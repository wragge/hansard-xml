<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Minister for Justice. I remind the minister that during the last election cam <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> paign you announced, and now your government proposes, a cut of $1&half; million from the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and to do so by transferring hearings from the commission to the Human Rights Division of the Federal Court. Since you were so deeply involved in the decision and since you now represent the Attorney, what would it therefore cost the Human Rights Division to hold these hearings?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="391" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Bolkus, for that question. I do not have a precise figure in mind as to what it would cost them to hold those hearings. But let us be clear about this: has it possibly dawned on you yet why the decision making has to be shifted from the human rights commission? If you had a clue as to that, you would understand that, quite against advice from the other side of the chamber as it then was, from the opposition at the time, you took the view that you could proceed to make the human rights commission into a court without it being a court. You let it operate under that misunderstanding for quite a considerable period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was not an isolated example. There are plenty of other examples of where your then government was warned as to the unconstitutionality of proposals that it sought to get through this parliament and, sadly, did get through, one way or another. You later found, as a consequence of the Brandy decision, that it was not possible to do that which you had, I believe, come into this chamber when you were then representing the Attorney and said was possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do I gather from the blank look on your face that you do understand that much&mdash;that your then government got it wrong? You tried to get the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to do something for which there was no constitutional backing to allow you to do. So that had to fall apart. You were warned at the time by quite prominent people outside the parliament that this was a hazardous path for you to take. You were warned it was a hazardous path both constitutionally and in light of the people who would suffer if you got it wrong&mdash;that is, the people who need the protection of the Human Rights and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Equal Opportunity Commission. You were prepared to play a card game with their opportunities, their future and the determinations that were going to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You later found, as I have indicated, that you were wrong and that had to be changed. Come the election, you were one of the people, with other members on what was then this side, when you were formerly the government&mdash;now the defeated and rejected government, the government which the people of Australia don't want&mdash;who called on us to say what we would do to resolve that matter. I understand that you were one of the people&mdash;I could be misinformed; I would be happy for you to tell me if this is the case&mdash;running around the country saying, `I'll tell you what the coalition are going to do. They're going to gut the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. They don't care about human rights.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a great shame for you to have to realise that our policy said that we did care about human rights&mdash;that has always been our position&mdash;and the manner in which we would resolve the dilemma created by your government's ineptitude was to shift not only the decision making to the Federal Court and create a separate division for those matters, but the hearings as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do you think we did that? We did that because there is no point in wasting the time and money of litigants. These people are not necessarily very wealthy people, who need the benefit of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. There is no point in having two hearings. So we said we would simplify this process and we would have the hearings in a separate division of the Federal Court and they will make the determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made some assessments. Admittedly, from opposition, you don't have it down to the last cent. But we believed it was a pretty close and reasonable assessment&mdash;or we did at the time believe that. If we have had subsequent advice on that matter, I am not aware of it. Nonetheless, we think that is a very sensible way to protect the rights of Australians who want to take the opportunities and advantages offered to them or use the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="392"> protection of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a supplementary question. That answer is something that is pretty well known to anyone who has been involved in the discussion here. But what we are about is getting the detail. Detail is important for the continued operation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Minister, you are the one who proposed the transfer. You are the one who identified the cuts. Given that the proper estimate as supplied by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of the cost of the hearing function is only $720,000 a year, what other functions does the government expect HREOC to cut in order to make that saving of over twice that amount&mdash;that saving of $1&half; million? Can you guarantee that HREOC will not be gutted in terms of its functions because of the loose approach that you took to funding and resourcing this area, and the decision making you took?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a couple of things with respect to that. From my experience in opposition, which was extensive, I can advise you that you will soon understand that the reason you will not have some information is we will not give it to you if we do not want to. Within the bounds of propriety we will be more responsible to parliament than you were.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to work on guesstimates because you would not open all the books. You would not open them before the election campaign so that the community, Australia at large, could see the $8 billion black hole. So you have never wanted to open up the books at all&mdash;never at all!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you this: sadly, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;any area of government&mdash;will have to bear the burden of your mismanagement. So perhaps you would like to tell them why you have left them in the position of cuts having to be made. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<QUESTION PAGE="392" SPEAKER="Calvert, Sen Paul" NAMEID="5F4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment. Minister, do you support the actions taken by the South Australian government to declare South Australia's first marine park over part of the Great Australian Bight? What will you as Minister for the Environment and the government be doing to address the many problems that face our coastal zone, particularly that of coastal pollution?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="392" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Calvert for his question. Senator Calvert has taken a great interest in the marine environment. I welcome the opportunity to indicate the government's support for the South Australian decision to proceed with the declaration of a large, multiple&hyphen;use marine park in the Great Australian Bight to protect the breeding grounds of the southern right whale and the endangered Australian sea lion&mdash;a further sign of an enlightened Liberal government, I might say, in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, only last weekend I had the opportunity at a conference arranged by the South Australian Conservation Council to examine the issues associated with the development of a comprehensive network of marine protected areas. At that conference I was able to recommit this government to the development of a comprehensive oceans policy&mdash;something that Labor was never either able or willing to do&mdash;and that policy will examine the issues confronting Australia since the declaration last year of the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="393">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the Commonwealth should take appropriate action to help support marine environments and I have asked my department to advise me on how the Commonwealth can best support the South Australian initiative. Multiple&hyphen;use marine protected areas are an important tool in the management of our valuable marine bio&hyphen;diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, Mr President, you might be interested to know that about 5.2 per cent of Australia's marine areas are in protected areas. This is not as good a performance as first appears because 74 per cent of that is taken up with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COOK" NAMEID="RF4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thanks to us.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That means, Senator Cook, that much still needs to be done in temperate waters. The State of the Marine Environment Report released in 1995 demonstrates that estuaries and coastal waters in the developed parts of Australia are suffering moderate to serious problems. These problems are caused by pollution from elevated levels of nutrients arising from poor inland water quality and land management, stormwater run&hyphen;off from urban areas, sewage and industrial discharges. These problems are compounded by a loss of habitat, dredging, beach and dune erosion, overdevelopment, loss of amenity and poor long&hyphen;term planning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sewage and stormwater run&hyphen;off are the major sources of nutrients in urban areas. Most of Australia's sewerage is only treated to a secondary stage and remains high in nutrients. Unfortunately, each year about 10,000 tonnes of phosphorous and 100,000 tonnes of nitrogen are discharged through sewage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's unique temperate seagrasses appear to be under particular threat. Increased sedimentation and nutrients from catchment have been linked with massive dieback of seagrasses in many parts. New South Wales has lost about a half of the seagrasses in its estuaries while, in Victoria, about 85 per cent of the total biomass of seagrasses has been lost in Westernport Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The costs to remedy this deficiency of the past are, of course, enormous. Engineering to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduce algal growth in Cockburn Sound would cost $170 million; the Peel Harvey estuary in Western Australia $50 million; and the Tuggerah Lakes in New South Wales $12 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer is the new government's $100 million coasts and clean seas initiative which will provide the funding base to tackle these problems of coastal and marine pollution, particularly pollution caused by sewerage and stormwater in the most densely populated areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How could we imagine that, facing that problem, the opposite parties in this place, the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA), would block the attempt by this government to remedy this major deficiency, this major problem that needs to be overcome. And, for that, they should hang their heads in shame. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Minister for Justice. Minister, in keeping your campaign promise to achieve `better cost recovery' by the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia, it was estimated you would raise $15 million over three years. Given that ITSA recovers its costs from the estates of bankrupts, will not any increase in cost recovery be at the expense of the creditors, the innocent parties in insolvency cases?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="393" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chris Evans for his question. I will take this opportunity to advise you, because you may not have been at the relevant committee hearings, and other senators who may be interested that ITSA circulated amongst its staff&mdash;I think sometime last year, if not the year before, but it certainly was not this year&mdash;a briefing note indicating that they should not resolve too many bankruptcies too soon because if they did it would get less money from the finance department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the note said, `Look guys, why don't you slow down on the job. You're actually doing too good a job. You're actually resolving too many of these at any one time, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="394"> in any one period. If you keep solving them at this rate, the pile of unsolved ones will go down&mdash;ipso facto we will get less money. Why don't you concentrate on something else. Why don't you concentrate on the development of government policy and how we will implement it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that does not tell you that something was seriously wrong in ITSA in terms of management and the allocation of its time, I do not know what does. ITSA should have been working as one of the most efficient bodies to deliver the best service possible to the innocent parties&mdash;and you are right&mdash;creditors and anybody involved. They should have been able to benchmark themselves and set up as the standard to follow. They were either unable or, as the particular memo I am referring to indicates to me, unwilling to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the estimates committee the relevant officer was queried about this memo and there was some embarrassment about this on his part. There was some embarrassment that a private ITSA memo had been released and the public at large could see what was going on. The advice he gave the committee was that the interpretation I have just given you of that memo was somewhat harsh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He would have us believe that he was simply concerned to see that ITSA officials spent the appropriate amount of time on each bankruptcy and that they should not solve them too quickly because they might miss something. He said that they should spend a lot more time on every one so that they could be 100 per cent sure that every one was done 100 per cent correctly. He said that it was wrong to read the memo as, `This will be bad for us in relation to our staffing level negotiations with the Department of Finance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will produce the memo and leave it to senators opposite and those on this side and members of the public to judge. I indicate to you that I took one look at that and said that something was wrong. These people have an opportunity to set a standard or to demonstrate quite clearly that it is possible for public sector people to do a top class, world class job which the private sector could use as a benchmark. I have indicated to you&mdash;and I think if you speak to anybody who has had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some experience with ITSA they will agree&mdash;that they failed to do that. On that basis, there needed to be some changes. A little bit of a brush with reality and some market prices just might have done it.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I was interested in the minister's comments about  what somebody else had to say, but the real question was: why is it that small businesses are being made to suffer, as a result of the government's decision, because the costs will be at their expense?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point you need to understand is where bankruptcies come from. It is true that some of it is a result of mismanagement. There is no doubt about that. You cannot say that a business goes bankrupt without any fault on its own part. You must also understand that under your government the level of bankruptcies was outrageously high. Your failure to attend to the economy and the trouble with interest rates&mdash;one could go on at length&mdash;have ensured that a very large number of people went bankrupt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I have simply put to you is: what is in the interests of the innocent parties, the creditors, and, for that matter, the people going bankrupt? It is that their estate is handled as efficiently, as quickly and as sensibly as possible. We had the head of the show or the senior officer writing to the junior staff saying, `Don't do too much of this too quickly because it will be a bit difficult when we have to negotiate our agreement with finance and we will get fewer staff.' If you think that that means they were doing the best job possible by the creditors, you shop at a different supermarket to me, Sport.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Has the Labor opposition offered bipartisan support to the coalition government's strategy to bring the budget into surplus? Can the minister explain the benefits to the Australian people that would flow from a bipartisan approach?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="394" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ellison for that very important question because it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="395"> really goes to the heart of whether the Labor Party has learnt the lessons of its defeat at the last election. It also goes right to the heart of whether Labor has learnt to act responsibly in the interests of the Australian people. As to whether there may be bipartisan support, I can only say to Senator Ellison that the situation is that the opposition seems to be hopelessly divided on that. You only have to look at examples over the last few days in this chamber and outside to see that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only last Saturday at the ALP's Victorian state conference, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, said that this $8 billion suggestion is a deceit, plain and simple, a deceit. He said further that this $8 billion black hole is a chimera put up for political purposes&mdash;a con job by Mr Costello. That was preceded a couple of days earlier, as I reminded the Senate yesterday, by that incredible matter of public importance debate put up by Senator Sherry where he said that the task of bringing the budget into underlying surplus was an ideological pursuit. Those two do not sound too encouraging to me, Senator Ellison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw some encouragement from the statement in the other  place last week by the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, who first of all acknowledged that there was an underlying deficit of around $8 billion. He actually put it at $7.6 billion, but that is near enough I would think by Labor's standards. Encouragingly, he also appeared to agree with the government on the importance of bringing the budget back into surplus. Mr Evans said in the House last week&mdash;and I quote this for the benefit of members opposite and their leader, Mr Beazley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course the opposition accepts&mdash;as it did in government&mdash;that it is very desirable, other things being equal, for there to be a return to underlying fiscal balance as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that that does mean that we can expect some bipartisan support in our efforts to solve the fundamental fiscal problems facing this nation. The first thing, obviously, that has to happen is for the Leader of the Opposition, his deputy leader and the Minister for Finance to get down and have a little quiet talk amongst themselves and sort out which way they want to go and what they really think <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the question of the budget deficit and the need to bring it back into balance. Then, hopefully, they will come forward to this place and to the Australian people with some semblance of good order, rationality and bipartisanship in tackling the fundamental problems that this government has been elected to correct in the interests not only of the Australian people but of the whole Australian nation.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the reason why we have finished up with a black hole in the budget of $8 billion. That is why we have finished up with interest rates amongst the highest in the Western world.

That is why no major reforms at all had been undertaken on an ongoing basis throughout the economy to get the basic structure of the economy sufficiently internationally competitive and efficient to produce great benefits, to release opportunities and to allow Australians to capitalise on the great <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="397"> resources, opportunities, talents and skills we have as a people and as a nation.</PARA>

We do not do it simply because of some ideological binge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that even prior to the election that lot over there were well and truly embarked on a hidden agenda in terms of Public Service cuts. What you will find at the present time is that Senator Vanstone's department is looking at cuts of just over 1,265. Of those, there will be something in the order of 965 that will be lost as a direct result of decisions previously made by that lot over there. So, in other words, there are already significant cuts in train.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="399">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take your point about the importance of ensuring that people outside the capital cities or the principal towns are not deprived of services. That in many respects is a separate but very important issue. One of the consequences of reductions must be to ensure that at the end of the day you do not impose more pain in one area than in another. To the extent that there are greater claims on departments in rural and remote areas, then obviously you would expect the government to be sensitive to those claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can certainly assure you that if you are asked why it is that we have to endure further pain then you ought to tell them about Beazley's black hole and you ought to tell them about Senator Sherry thinking it is simply an ideological pursuit. The fact is of course that that in itself is the ultimate ideological statement. Really and truly I just hope that over the recess Senator Sherry does a crash course in economics and understands the importance of actually getting the budget back into surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless you get the budget back into surplus, you end up having to borrow. The interest charges that are devoted to debt retirement are money that could have been spent elsewhere. It could certainly have been spent in Tasmania and it could certainly be spent ensuring that people get access to the services that they require. So let the blame lie precisely where it falls. We will do the best we can to minimise the damage. But, at the end of the day, I think everyone knows who is responsible for the present processes.</PARA></ANSWER>

Companies that have not been successful can drift into the sunset. This is the business&mdash;as you well know; you have had some experience of it&mdash;of governments. You try something.

They are utterly unrelated propositions. Telstra's profit actually went up&mdash;you should know this, Senator Schacht, when you are not busy running around the countryside. Where did you come, third in the TA stakes? Good effort! If you look at the figures, you will find that operating expenses rose at a higher rate than the profit figures.

That is why, if you look at the experience in BT, they have achieved dramatic improvements. I think it is also very unfortunate that Senator Woodley has not been up here today apologising. I presume he has had a look at section 287 since yesterday and he knows that what is in our bill precisely mirrors the universal service obligation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Spindler for his question. As he will be aware, the Prime Minister has stressed that removing dangerous firearms from the community is of critical importance to set us in the right direction as a society. As he said in the other place yesterday, as to the question of gun control laws, the government is strongly of the view that we need effective uniform legislation.

That will be the essence of the proposal that will be put by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="403"> Commonwealth government at the police ministers meeting on Friday.

I am advised by the Taxation Office that, whilst it is difficult to estimate the value of collections for firearms and ammunition separately, the value of collections in 1994-95 is estimated to be in the order of $10 million. The Prime Minister in his statement yesterday has indicated that he believes it is appropriate that the cost of removing the firearms be borne by the entire community rather than just gun owners, and the Commonwealth will be considering options in conjunction with the states and territories for financing fair compensation to gun owners.</PARA></ANSWER>

She went on about a memo that had absolutely nothing to do with the question that was asked by my colleague Senator Chris Evans, who asked a question about the effect of cost recovery on creditors. Instead, we got a four&hyphen;minute explanation about some leaked memo that had nothing to do with that particular question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had the gratuitous remarks about where Senator Bolkus is and what number on the ticket Senator Wheelwright was. Half my colleagues&mdash;not with any objection&mdash;are described as `sport' by the minister opposite, who often, in opposition, used to take unctuous points of order on what language was used in this chamber. No&hyphen;one abuses language more in this chamber than Senator Vanstone herself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, in spite of the new strictures laid down by the Howard government, Senator Vanstone should be well briefed. We all know the great highlight that was made of cutting ministerial staff numbers. I thought to myself, `Maybe this is the reason she is not properly briefed.' But looking at the internal handbook this morning I find she has got three departmental liaison officers working in her office. As well as cutting staff, they shoved three of those in to make up the difference. They cut our staff and make up the difference with departmental liaison officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you take the salaries and on&hyphen;costs of having those three liaison officers, Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Vanstone is getting $300,000 more advice than she is supposed to be getting. And Senator Vanstone still cannot answer a question. We almost seriously have to put this question across the chamber to the minister for employment: `What is your name, what political party do you represent and what state do you come from?' Do you think you could answer that, Senator Vanstone? Do you think you could actually give us an accurate answer on that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill interjected before, and I have some sympathy with his point. He said that Senator Vanstone has been a minister for only eight weeks and it takes time to settle in. I would have to concede that that is true. But the answer to that, Senator Hill, is that you do not come here as a bullyboy or bullygirl, or whatever the appropriate phrase is, throwing around insults and trying to lord it over everyone else when you do not meet the basic precepts of a minister&mdash;that is, you can answer for the portfolio responsibilities. There are only one or two things required here: a lot more homework by the minister or a different style&mdash;one or the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now faced four question times. We have a senior minister getting paid $10,000 more than some of the others to her immediate right. They have been able to answer questions and she has not. I think the recommendation to the Prime Minister is that she should have $10,000 deducted.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, we are not expecting high quality from this government; we are expecting minimum standards. I have to tell you that we are not even getting minimum standards. We have addressed 12 questions to Senator Vanstone over the last week and a half, and on every one of those questions, whether it has involved her current portfolio or whether it has involved the portfolio she held before the election, she has had absolutely no idea of what the information relevant to those questions should be&mdash;absolutely none.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now had this situation compounded by Senator Hill, who was talking about the so-called mess of the past. All you have to do, Senator Hill, is look at the weekend press to see what the academics are saying about your agenda in higher education. The Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, Professor Niland, warned that, translated into salary costs, your cuts would mean about 350 academic and administrative staff positions at risk. If you are not going to listen to him, you might listen to the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, who talks about the loss of 600 staff positions across the three South Australian universities. Those planning new buildings, including Griffith in Queensland and Murdoch in WA, have said they cannot go ahead because of your proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to look at what is going to happen in education, you need to get someone who can get on top of the job. The way that Senator Vanstone has performed in this place has shown not just arrogance, not just a lack of understanding of her responsibilities here, but also a lack of understanding of the responsibilities of the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have four great quotes from Senator Vanstone. The first one was last week when she said to me, `Don't bother about asking a supplementary because it is quite clear you are not going to get the information.' `Don't bother about it,' she says, `Forget about the interests of the constituents that you might be representing.' </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the situation was compounded by this great quote from Senator Vanstone: `We won't give you the information if we don't want to.' Isn't that the height of arrogance&mdash;for a  minister who cannot answer questions to deliver a comment like that! But she goes on. In response to Senator Crowley's question about a very useful mechanism in our community for creating traineeships and creating jobs, what does she say to the people who have created 28,000 jobs in our society, the people that Senator Hill is supposedly concerned about? She says, `Well, they can drift off into the sunset.' No thank yous, nothing else: `they can drift off into the sunset'. When Senator Faulkner said, `We are waiting for an answer, Senator Vanstone, and we will continue to wait,' she said, `You can set up camp.' They are four quotes from Senator Vanstone, in response to 12 questions, which sum up this minister's dismissive approach not just to the parliament but to her responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if the questions we are asking are not important, which is what Senator Hill would have us believe. They are important. They go to issues that Senator Vanstone was concerned about in the framing of opposition policy before the last election. They show that, as an opposition shadow minister, she was a failure because nothing could add up. Now she is suffering from amnesia. All those costings that she put up before the election are now proven to be wrong, and she wants to forget them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite apparent today that, when it comes to her own portfolio, Senator Vanstone is even more at sea and cannot understand the issues. Whether it is answering a basic question from Senator Mackay about structures in unemployment, whether it is asking about the evaluative processes that are important in the wind&hyphen;up of any organisation in response to Senator Carr, whether it is answering a question from Senator Crowley about levels and the processes in government, whether it is NETTFORCE, NBEET or previous portfolios, this minister has come in here and on 12 occasions over four question times shown absolutely no knowledge.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="409">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill says that it is early days. It may very well be early days, but the issues that we have raised have been public issues. They have been in the media, they have had a fair degree of currency, and they are not a surprise. None of these issues have been dragged out of some drawer somewhere which no-one knows about. Just about every issue has been in the press, and Senator Vanstone has not known about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which worries me is the question that I asked last Wednesday about Ms Ferris, senator&hyphen;elect for South Australia. There is an important national issue about the electoral processes in South Australia. Senator Vanstone basically said, `Well, I'll see if I can get you an answer. If I do, I'll provide it to you.' We are not going to let that one lie, because we know that the electoral process is worrying you. We know that the concept of office of profit, which may very well have been transgressed by your senator&hyphen;elect in South Australia, has been raised with the Attorney-General's Department. The question I asked was very simple: has the matter been raised and what is the effect of the advice? It should not take seven days to get an answer. Senator Vanstone, lift your game or else, like that high quality board, you might be drifting off into the sunset. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

To suggest that a minister must give the full details of any conversation he or she has with anybody is, frankly, ludicrous and something which I am quite sure Senator Bolkus, who has had some experience of being a minister, should understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the question about, apparently, showing some indifference or cold&hyphen;heartedness in saying that those training companies which have not been successful can simply drift away. That seems to me to be perfectly appropriate. The answer I gave today indicated that those which had been successful would stay and those which had not would simply drift away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board of NETTFORCE, through a letter from me to the chairman, have been thanked for the work they have done. The answer to the question clearly indicated they had done some good work and it was appreciated. The answer further clearly indicated that, as a consequence of these people on the other side having lost, there would now be new training arrangements and there would be new administrative arrangements surrounding that, of which the NETTFORCE board would not be a part. There does not seem to me to be a difficulty with that and I am sorry if opposition senators do not understand that or cannot come to grips with the fact they have lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion to take note of the answers I have given has clearly been moved to try in some way to dissuade me from consistently reminding opposition senators that they did lose, and why they lost.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">KOONGARRA PROJECT AREA REPEAL BILL 1996.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22nd February, 1988 my former colleague, Senator Paul Maclean introduced the Koongarra Project Area Repeal Bill. Unfortunately the former Labor Government did not take the opportunity to repeal this act, even though it was clear an agreement had not been reached with the traditional owners and the Minister in 14 years and even though the former Government had a policy which would prevent the mine ever opening under their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="415"> leadership and even though it is just patently wrong to attempt to extract uranium from such a significant and special place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now with the possibility of more uranium mining rearing its ugly head again in the Kakadu World Heritage Area, the Democrats are re&hyphen;introducing this bill as we believe it is vitally important this mine does not go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is, clearly, to repeal the Koongarra Project Area Act of 1981. As honourable senators will be aware, the Koongarra Project Area Act was submitted to this House on 12 June 1981-the last day on which the Government then led by Mr Fraser had the number of senators needed to force any bill it wished through the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Koongarra Project Area Bill was brought on with total disregard for the sections of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 which provide for at least 15 sitting days notice to both Houses of Parliament, and 60 days for public comment after publication in the Commonwealth Gazette of any intention by any government to remove land from a national park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Parliament now has the opportunity to correct that act of piracy by repealing the Koongarra Project Area Act and thereby returning the Koongarra mining project area to the Kakadu National Park and World Heritage Area..</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be interested and, I am sure, relieved, to hear that section 3 of the Koongarra Project Area Act has not yet been proclaimed. Section 3 is that section of the act which actually excises the Koongarra mining project area from the national park. It is therefore most appropriate that the Koongarra Project Area Act 1981 be repealed immediately, while its repeal is a simple and straightforward one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Koongarra area as it now stands, the Australian people have an invaluable treasure-an area of unique scenic, archaeological and ecological importance. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry Second Report 1977-known as the Fox report-opposed the exploitation of the Koongarra deposit, and suggested that the South Alligator River catchment area was the most suitable large total river catchment for inclusion in the Kakadu National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any mining at Koongarra would cause irreparable damage to the South Alligator River catchment area. The Fox Commission also pointed out that the Koongarra area is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"located upstream from the extremely valuable Woolwonga Wildlife Sanctuary . . . the Woolwonga area is so valuable ecologically that we would oppose in principle any mining development upstream of it". (Fox Report) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government allowed any damage to the Woolwonga area, which is now incorporated in Kakadu National Park, it would be abrogating its responsibilities under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance and Australia's agreement with Japan for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Danger of Extinction. Even the original mining company's environmental impact statement described the Koongarra area as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"containing a most diversified range of ecosystems, wildlife, wetlands and landscape formations not found elsewhere in the continent . . . the region has a number of Aboriginal sacred areas, relics and features. The ancient Aboriginal art work found in many of the caves and galleries of the rock outcrops has no equivalent in Australia". (from Noranda Ltd)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the archaeological value of the prehistoric sites of Kakadu National Park, of which Nourlangie Rock is one of the most important, is massive. In a report on archaeological research in Kakadu National Park, leading Australian archaeologist, Dr Rhys Jones, and Tia Negerevich wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Along the base of the great cliffs . . . are rock shelters which constitute one of the world's most important storehouses of information about the prehistory and the art of hunting and gathering man. In terms of the number and age of occupied rock shelters, and the staggering profusion and antiquity of the brilliant rock art sites, the Kakadu area can be compared with some of the classic archaeological locations of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in Kakadu, the Aboriginal owners are the direct descendants of the people who lived in the rock shelters and who painted the art . . . The conjunction of living Aboriginal traditions, and extremely diverse and rich landscape and the wealth of archaeological sites, some with proven antiquity back to 23,000 years ago, makes the Kakadu a key zone for research into the prehistory of Australia." (Rhys Jones and Negerevich)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The writers liken the importance of the Kakadu sites to the Dordogne cave paintings in France, with the added factor of the direct descent of the traditional owners from the inhabitants of the area over 23,000 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unique beauty of the Koongarra area, including Nourlangie Rock, the South Alligator River catchment area and the Nourlangie Creek catchment area, would be destroyed forever if mining were allowed to take place at Koongarra. Explosions from a mine site there might cause falls or slides of segments of Nourlangie Rock itself-one of the most significant archaeological sites in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be a significant increase of dust in the atmosphere, and that, as well as other adverse ecological effects of such a mine would cause direct degradation of the archaeological sites, as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="416"> well as the indirect degradation caused by scars on the landscape from roads to the mining area, noise and air pollution, and pollution of the water table. None of this must be allowed to occur. With the repeal of the Koongarra Project Area Act 1981, the area will be returned to its rightful place in Kakadu National Park. The area is of such obvious international significance that its inclusion in the World Heritage listing for Kakadu is utterly appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were very strong views put forward in this place in June 1981 by Australian Labor Party (ALP) senators when the original bill was brought on. They were horrified that such a unique area should be excised from a national park so it could be destroyed in the commercial interests of a mining company-and at the time Canadian-owned mining company at that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We say it is no different now that the mineral lease is now owned by a French Company,&mdash;Cogema. On that occasion all Labor senators joined with the Australian Democrats to vote against the bill. I am sure, with the ALP speaking so strongly against any new mining in this area, they will be consistent in their attitude. I am confident the bill will also gain the support of the Greens and I challenge the Government to go beyond the cargo cult mentality which some in the mining industry are attempting to persuade you to adopt and join with on this issue to replace this beautiful area in the middle of the Kakadu World Heritage Area and preserve it for future generations to enjoy and to wonder at.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate, and I look forward to its speedy passage through both houses.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PROHIBITION OF EXPORTATION OF URANIUM (CUSTOMS ACT AMENDMENT) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is to prevent the export of all uranium from Australian shores. The Australian Democrats believe this is very important because it is only through not taking any part in the nuclear fuel or weapons cycle that we can be sure, certain sure that our country is not contributing to the whole nuclear problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is no good to say, we only produce uranium ore, or we only produce it for power, or our uranium can't go into weapons. The fact of the matter is, we are producing a material which will become waste which has to be dealt with and will last many thousands of years. The fact of the matter also is that there are no guarantees, no absolute guarantees that Australian Uranium is not being enriched, flag swapped and used in weapons manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must be responsible with the uranium in this country, we must admit that it is producing waste and the effects of that waste in biological and environmental damage are measured in a geological time scale, not a human time scale. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to go into a little detail on radioactive waste to explain our cause for concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management and final disposal of radioactive waste has presented some of the most profound and enduring difficulties for nuclear power and uranium mining. This is in start contrast to the great improvements in managing and disposing of almost all other types of wastes created by modern societies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Radioactivity comes from the alpha, gamma or beta radiation or a combination of these invisible rays arising from the decay of unstable atoms in the waste. Cancers or birth defects may therefore arise from human exposure to radioactive waste. Also radioactive waste particles can take from a short time to a very long or geological (many tens of thousands of years) time frame to decay to harmless substances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wastes from nuclear reactors have some of the very longest lived wastes and so need to be kept isolated from the biosphere for hundreds of thousands of years. It is virtually impossible to guarantee there will never be leaks, cracks, earthquakes, breakdown in maintenance or other occurrences which could cause leakage of the waste material in the time scale needed. Both ocean and land style disposal are being used globally for attempted disposal and there are many, many problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A prize for the dirtiest most dangerous place for radioactive waste would have to be shared between Hanford, in Washington State US and Mayak near the Ural Mountains in the former USSR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Records in Hanford are poor, but there are more than four million litres of partly liquid, high level nuclear wastes held in 177 tanks, some of which have leaked and some of which burp poisonous and radioactive gases. About 1 tonne of plutonium is believed to be scattered under the sand at Hanford, together with thousands of tonnes of other solid wastes. A total of 760 billion litres of non high&hyphen;level radioactive wastes were also stored or simply poured into the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total contaminated soils and associated groundwater amounts to about one billion tonnes. Estimated costs of cleaning up Hanford, which of course has not been done, are thought to lie between $50 billion and $200 billion. The US General Accounting Office states that the total bill for remediating all of the country's nuclear weapons manufacturing sites could reach one trillion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mayak is the official name for a 200 square kilometre secret nuclear complex 80 kilometres north of the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. Little was known by ordinary Russians or the West of the nature of Mayak until 1989, when the authorities admitted to a disastrous explosion in a nuclear waste container in 1957. The explosion contami <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="417"> nated 217 villages with 20 million curies of radioactivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Routine methods of nuclear disposal were just as dangerous. From 1950&hyphen;51 about 70 million cubic meters of waste were simply poured into the nearby Techa River (about 2.5 million curies). Tens of thousands of people downstream received doses greater than those received at Chernobyl. The now evaporated Lake Karachai was used for a Mayak dump for 30 years and is estimated to contain one billion curies of radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nuclear problem in old USSR countries is much more extensive than at Mayak alone. There are thought to be hundreds of `hot spots' in Moscow due to secret nuclear work there. There are two other major reprocessing sites in the former soviet union besides Mayak, Tomsk&mdash;7 and Krasnoyarsk&mdash;26 with their associated wastes. The Russians have poured high level wastes in a free state down deep wells. And of course there has been much recent attention ton their use of sea dumping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are 407 nuclear reactors associated with 235 nuclear ships which produce 20,000 cubic metres of liquid radioactive wastes per year and 6,000 cubic metres of solid waste. Some 35,000 spent fuel assemblies are reported as being stored on land and at sea. In all the former Soviet Union has dumped twice as much radioactivity into the sea as all other countries put together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also anticipate an argument from the Government that our uranium is needed to fill a gap in the increasing demand for uranium for the power industry. However our information is that the industry is actually contracting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1994&hyphen;2000 approximately 60 reactors globally will be past their design lifespan. There are 48 new reactors in the pipeline which are supposedly coming on stream between 1994&hyphen;2000. Of the 48 planned perhaps as many as one third have financial or political problems and may not ever be completed. However there are also existing reactors being decommissioned which will be past their design lifespan. For example 10 plants in the US, 20 in the UK, 5 in Japan and 3 in Germany will be past their design lifespans Even assuming all 48 overcome financial and political problems there will still be 12 fewer by the year 2000 than there are now. Therefore reactor numbers and subsequently nuclear power is actually decreasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current demand for uranium is about 60,000 tonnes per year globally taking into account the fact that new reactors initially use more because a full core load is needed. Supply at present is about 30,000 tonnes per year because a number of mines in Canada, the US, Australia and Kazakhstan operate at 50% or less capacity. This is offset by large stockpiles and large quantities of enriched (in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some cases up to 95%) uranium on the marked from the USSR (between 500 and 700 tonnes) and the USA (600 tonnes).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Indonesian Government is reported to be considering a nuclear power program of up to 12 reactors to meet the quickly increasing demand for power from its 120 million citizens. Australia, the US, Canada and Japan are all vying for an active role in Indonesia's nuclear power industry. Concerns expressed both from within Indonesia and international groups particularly point to the danger of earthquakes and volcanoes in such a volatile geological area and the capacity of the Indonesians to use best possible and expensive practice to maintain all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Waste could be earmarked for storage on uninhabited islands. Wahli, the environmental group in Java recently claimed 77% of the population oppose the construction of nuclear power plants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first nuclear reactor planned for Indonesia is scheduled for construction in 1998 near Mount Muria on the north coast of central Java. This is a dormant volcano (like Mt Pinatubo) in one of the most seismically active regions in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been and will continue to be accidents at nuclear power facilities. On the 8th August 1995, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that from the beginning of 1992 to May 1995 there were 7,698 incidents in Russian nuclear power plants and that safety standards had not improved since 1963. The Australian Government supporting 12 nuclear power plants in Indonesia is like supporting any other nuclear power plant development, an act of madness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nuclear Terrorism</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, we must remember that our uranium doesn't get special treatment in the case of theft or use for terrorism. This century has seen the proliferation of several terrorist friendly technologies&mdash;plastic explosives are one example. However some of the most potentially dangerous technologies are those associated with nuclear, biological and chemical means of warfare. Of these the worst scenarios are where terrorists achieve control over nuclear facilities, material or even weapons. On 20th March 1996, speaking at a US Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, the Director of Central Intelligence, John Duetch said</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The chilling reality is that nuclear material and technologies are more accessible now than at any other time in history. . . This problem can begin in any state where there are nuclear materials, reactors or fuel cycle facilities."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Possession of functional nuclear weapons is not necessary to pose serious security threats to civilian populations. Highly radioactive material of any sort such as from a nuclear power station, will suffice to contaminate large areas if a means of distribu <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="418"> tion can be found. Terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities (eg reactors, high level waste dumps) could cause large numbers of causalities and render some areas uninhabitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The disaster at Chernobyl was an accident; the deliberate destruction of an operating reactor's containment could have equally catastrophic consequences. These are problems recognised by many Governments in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To sum up, there are simply no good arguments for Australia to sell its uranium overseas. To use the fatuous notion that if we don't sell it, some other country will and we won't get the money is like saying we should sell cocaine, or the Cartels in Colombia will sell it and we won't get the money. There are problems with the entire nuclear cycle, from producing and transporting the ore, to enrichment, to use, to waste and to disposal or use of that waste. And those problems are measured in our very genetic blueprints and in a timescale most of us can't imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats implore the Senate to deal responsibly with this vitally important legislation and ensure its speedy passage through both houses.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">URANIUM MINING IN AUSTRALIAN WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES (PROHIBITION) BILL 1996.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this act is to spell out the terms of a prohibited activity in any part of  a World Heritage Area. For the purposes of this act a prohibited activity means the mining, extraction, treatment and transport of any uranium or uranium bearing ore.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is an attempt to protect, in particular, the Kakadu World Heritage Area from further uranium mining or milling, and from any transportation of uranium ore.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strength of this act lies in its sensible and reasonable aims which are to prevent the tainting of a World Heritage Area by uranium mining and associated activities. Having a uranium mine in a World Heritage Area is like having a large industrial grease trap in the concert hall of the Sydney Opera House. A rubbish dump in a church. A chemical factory in the Healesville sanctuary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of this bill I will put aside all the arguments about the risks associated with nuclear power. Put aside arguments about our uranium finding its way into nuclear weapons, and all the problems associated with disposal and long term management of  nuclear waste from enriched sources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is specifically about protecting superb world heritage areas, and in particular Kakadu World Heritage area, from the risks associated with uranium mining. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kakadu is a magnificent National Park and World Heritage Area in the Northern Territory. It is one of only 17 World Heritage sites out of 440 globally which were inscribed for both outstanding natural and cultural heritage values according to the strict international criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kakadu was inscribed on the World Heritage register in 3 stages, 1981, 1987 and stage 3 in 1992 which included the controversial Coronation Hill area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It contains magnificent wetlands, representatives of most of Australia's bird species. It protects almost the entire South Alligator River Catchment area, and is an area of great and abundant diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From a cultural perspective I have viewed extensive rock art galleries there with art possibly dating back 40,000 years. It is a place where Aboriginal people live and interact with their environment and their heritage. Many Aboriginal people have told the Democrats over the years that it is a place they believe is too precious to be disrupted for a uranium mine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will argue that the local Aboriginal people will receive great benefits from the mine. Those benefits are supposed to flow from a minority percentage of the  royalty equivalents. But in effect these payments are used to make up for the neglect by Territory and Commonwealth governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are used as a justification for not giving funding from other sources for what could be best described as citizenship rights; for example basic health services, housing and basic infrastructure. The Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth governments have demonstrably and continually abrogated their responsibility for the traditional owners of Kakadu.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is morally bankrupt for any Government in this nation, State, territory or Federal, to pressure Aboriginal people to agree to a uranium mine on their land so they can have some hope of getting basic services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the many concerns about uranium mining is the potential effect of radioactive spills of contaminated water and its mobilisation into the environment, particularly downstream in catchment areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also try to say there are no safety or environmental  problems with mining uranium, they will say it is OK to take a chance on more mines in Kakadu. But remember this is a World Heritage area and you don't use Ming vases in a juggling act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1985/86 Annual Report of the Office of the Supervising Scientist states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Disposal of uranium mill tailings in surface dams, no matter how well stabilised and protected, almost <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="419"> certainly involves the acceptance of eventual tailings release into the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this risk may be reduced. . . it is unlikely that any containment structure could remain totally impregnable to the natural processes of slow erosion over periods comparable to several half lives of the longest lived isotopes retained in the tailings"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ranger and Narbarlek and the Jabiluka and Koongara deposits are in high rainfall catchment areas. Tailings from uranium extraction contain more than 70% of the radioactivity of the original ore. Impacts from uranium mining and milling are measured in a geological time scale as half lives of radio nucleides and in many cases are measured in tens of thousands of years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unauthorised and authorised releases or spills have occurred at both Ranger and Narbarlek in the past. A notable spill at Narbarlek occurred as a result of a split in a pipeline allowing about 5kgs of tailings slurry to spray outside the Narbarlek restricted release zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In early 1995 during a heavy wet season, the management of Ranger applied to release contaminated water from Retention Pond 2 in the restricted release zone, which would have flowed into the Magela Creek system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Traditional owners of an area of Arnham Land downstream from the mine in the Magela Creek region objected strongly to the release and sought an injunction to prevent the release from the Northern Territory Supreme Court which was heard on the 16th March.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Judge rejected the application for a permanent injunction and effectively paved the way for the release of contaminated water saying `someone' had to explain to the traditional owners and affected peoples downstream that the releases were safe, because the scientists said so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The traditional owners point out that if this contaminated radioactive water was to be put in the Sydney water and food supply there would be outrage, yet they were expected to support such a release. Fortunately the time involved in the court proceedings meant that the flow of the creek had slowed to the point that the Office of the Supervising Scientist advised against the release.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is still possible that the Ranger management (or even the managers of other mines should they be approved by the Coalition Government), will request to release contaminated water in the future as it has stated it has only deferred the release.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This controversy followed earlier requests for release of contaminated water in 1986/87, and 1989. The 1989 incident Ranger released water by allowing it to overflow to a spillway into Djalk <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> mara Billabong using the rationale that the Billabong would act as a filter for the water.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the Office of the Supervising Scientist refusing to give approval, the Northern Territory Government did, and the release went ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following this incident, the Office of the Supervising Scientist released this statement in their 1988/89 report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Over the past year or so, Ranger/ERA has shown an increasing tendency to regard certain environmental requirements as `legal technicalities' the strict application of which ERA has described as an impediment to developing the Best Practicable Technology'. Ranger has been reluctant to adhere strictly to the ER's where compliance leads to operational inconvenience, or additional expenditure and it has disregarded technical advice from the OSS resulting in a number of incidents or deliberate actions whose environmental implications are undesirable".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all these reasons, spills and the potential for more, the effect on the Aboriginal comminutes and the effect on one of the most precious places on earth, I ask all honourable Senators in this place to forget their party and industry allegiance just for one minute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Think of the wonderful gift the human race has been given. A unique, rich world, with clean rivers and seas, an abundance of life in all of its different forms and rich soils and resources. We have a chance, possibly unique, to protect this and to live in a way that protects it for future generations, to live simply so that others may simply live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Think of the world you want to pass on to your children and grandchildren, the life chances you want them to have, the places you would like them to see, the experiences you would like them to enjoy. With all that in mind, let's be very clear, nuclear accidents sully and contaminate our environment and our very genetic blueprints on a time line measured in generations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure when you take the chance to honestly reflect on my words and on the content of this bill, you will all agree that Kakadu is too precious to put at risk, too precious to expose to further radioactive waste.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is another example of the bipartisan approach of this government to improving the health of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This particular bill has had an increasingly tortuous history since it was first introduced into parliament by the former government in early 1995. The bill was initially part of an omnibus bill, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995, which was subsequently divided into more manageable parts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill incorporates and re-introduces the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1995 which was passed by both sides of the House of Representatives on 28 September 1995, but was still awaiting consideration by the Senate when the parliament rose at the conclusion of the 1995 sittings. As a result, over 600 applications for listing particular products for supply in Australia have been delayed, which has incurred considerable financial distress for the applicants waiting to have their products listed prior to marketing. These applications comprise relatively simple, low risk products such as vitamin, mineral, herbal, homeopathic and sunscreen products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that, given the long gestation of this bill, it is in the public interest to relieve this financial distress as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government welcomes manageable legislation and particularly welcomes the innovations contained in this bill. We note that last year the then government and now opposition, who first moved this bill, also actively promoted the measures contained in this legislation. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has now been reintroduced for the third time in this place in a form which will facilitate its passage by accommodating the needs of the Senate as well as the conventions of the House. This legislation is brought forward by the government as a priority bill for introduction and passage in this session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of this bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, ARTG. This new process will significantly reduce product approval times to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new scheme, products must meet the same criteria as currently exists. These criteria include a statement that the goods are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, being the purposes identified in the application for marketing, and not other purposes which go beyond the accepted indications for the therapeutic uses of the product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the National Regulatory Scheme for Therapeutic Goods, which have been identified in its first five years of operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mechanism to address shortages or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the act, the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the "penalty units" classification used in other commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme, in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality, safety or efficacy from the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also included in this bill are provisions to permit warrentless entry of premises to seize goods, but limiting this power to situations where there is an imminent public health risk of death or serious injury, and where there are reasonable grounds for believing that illegal activity is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A definition for "food" has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of "therapeutic goods" which excludes "food" but fails to define the term. What constitutes "food" in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words "prescribed dose" and "frequency of administration" included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="421"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This will ensure that technical and scientific data that should be lodged in connection with a general marketing application, will be evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also corrects a defect in the legislation regarding the ability of the secretary to approve the inclusion on the ARTG of products for export only where those products have been refused marketing approval in Australia. In these circumstances the secretary is currently empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods. This power is however limited to goods that have been manufactured in Australia for export only, and does not extend to products imported into Australia solely for re-export. The bill proposes that this provision be amended to ensure that the secretary's ability to require confirmation from Australia's trading partners of their willingness to accept goods refused marketing approval in Australia, extends to all products, irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in Australia or elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, this bill will benefit Australia's therapeutic industry and further enhance Australia's role as a leader in drug evaluation, registration and regulation in the region.</PARA>

It is important to recognise that over recent years much has been built into the education system in Australia and much of that is now at peril under the hands of the potential wreckers of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be put on the record that the Labor government transformed all areas of education in this country. For instance, during our period in office, Commonwealth school funding increased by 55 per cent in real terms; real funding to vocational education increased by 56 per cent; university places rose by 77 per cent; and student income support measures increased by 164 per cent. That was what the government was prepared to put into this important resource in our community, and education is the most critical resource that any society can invest in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This output showed that our input was paying dividends. The output involved a greater number of students staying on to year 12 at school&mdash;in fact, the year 12 retention rates doubled to some 72 per cent. It should be remembered that, before Labor came into government, only 36 per cent of students stayed on to year 12. On our exit from government, some 72 per cent were staying on to year 12, and that of course is a major <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="422"> achievement. We tripled the number of young people undertaking non-apprenticeship, post-school vocational education, and we saw an 87 per cent increase in the number of school leavers going to university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These achievements showed not just the investment or the returns but also a very strong commitment and a very strong understanding by Labor that there needs to be a national role when it comes to education&mdash;and that means all sectors of education, not just the tertiary sector but also the school sector. That national role went not just to issues such as the commitment of funding but also to issues such as the rationale behind our commitment to funding in the education sector. It was a rationale which acknowledged that there needed to be a federal responsibility, and that federal responsibility was needed to drive change and ensure that Australia continued to be internationally competitive. National leadership is important and needs to be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election, the Liberal Party when in opposition recognised the need for national leadership. But since the election, the idea of national leadership has now been replaced with myth and prejudice. I hope that the promise Senator Hill made before the election&mdash;the promise which recognised an ongoing role for government on a national level in the education sector&mdash;can be maintained, but I must admit that the signs already coming from the government have us concerned about their direction across the spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the close friends of the current education minister, the South Australian education minister, Mr Lucas, recently called for the axing of some 3,000 jobs from the federal Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. He was quoted as saying that the Commonwealth department has almost 16,000 employees, yet it runs no schools, employs no teachers and directly educates no children. But the reality is that only 25 people are employed at a federal level to administer Commonwealth funds to government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Lucas, in that ideological drive of the Liberal Party to ensure that the federal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government gets out of as many areas as possible, has distorted the facts and, in distorting the facts, has undervalued the important national role that governments can play. The entire schools division of the federal department employs fewer than 200 people and costs around $15 million annually, or less than one half of one per cent of the value of the Commonwealth schools program. What we have seen here is&mdash;in the interests of the Liberal Party's ideological drive to break down the national approach in this area&mdash;a distortion of the facts by the state minister, a person who, as I said, is not just a factional colleague of the current minister but also a close friend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to retain that national leadership. We cannot afford to let the education process go back to the states. We cannot afford to see a situation, for instance, where we replicate federally what happened in Victoria in recent years, where Victoria closed some 300 schools and sacked 8,000 teachers. We cannot afford to see what happened in South Australia replicated, because South Australia cut education expenditure by some $40 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We on this side of the parliament are concerned that the Liberal Party's commitments made before the election will not be met. I say to the minister that you are being judged in this place and, at the end of the day, you will not be judged on how successful the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is. You will be judged on your performance in this portfolio. You can recite the mantra of the $8 billion Costello con and use that as an excuse to undermine your own portfolio's interests, but you will be judged on what you deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already, it is quite clear that no matter what sector of education is involved&mdash;whether it is higher education or schools, students or academics&mdash;there is a growing tremor of concern about Senator Vanstone's performance. We know that you are under pressure, Minister. We know that the poisoned chalice has been handed to you by the Liberal Party. They see you as having the job that is almost impossible, because Costello, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) intend to cut back enormously <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="423"> in education, training and youth affairs. We know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that Mr Howard wants Senator Minchin to go into the ministry as soon as possible and you, Senator Vanstone, might be the one extra South Australian minister at whom the gun is pointed at the moment. It is either you or Senator Hill. We know Senator Minchin has to come in, but we do not know who is to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I say this to you: how you perform in this portfolio will be critical. How you are performing already is not good enough. It is quite apparent that the job is too much for you. I have had reports from the higher education sector saying that you have been to meetings recently and have said, `I haven't read the brief. You've got to remember that we're still celebrating.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, Minister, you cannot celebrate in politics; you have to deliver. And in terms of delivering, if you are being deceived by the Costello and Howard ideologically driven mantra, you are setting yourself up for a fall. Whether it is higher education or schools, the tremor is out there and it is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of tertiary places, we see headlines in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> `Vanstone puts tertiary places in doubt'. Of course, that is of national concern. It would be of national concern to any country that needs, in a growing world environment, higher levels of education. Vice-chancellors have a concern about cutbacks in facilities, staffing and student intakes. Queensland is concerned about their 2,450 new places that the previous federal government committed to Queensland&mdash;a state which has a high level of take&hyphen;up in terms of tertiary applications, a high level of interest and a high rate of growth but a state whose minister has not been able to see Senator Vanstone about this issue for quite some time. They are concerned that the extra funding provided by the previous Labor government will not flow through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just that. There is also concern about funding that has already been allocated, Minister. You have vice-chancellors all over the country writing to you saying there is $50 million in university funding in quality pay which has been committed. The institutions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are already spending that, and it has been signalled there are to be cuts to that $50 million&mdash;money that has already been spent. As Professor Wilson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Universities have gone to enormous lengths to participate in the quality audits in the good faith that the rewards will be there at the end of the day. Many universities had already made irreversible commitments for spending the money and withdrawing now would be regarded in a very poor light.</PARA>
<PARA>They have already started spending. If you are not to listen to any other vice-chancellor, listen again to South Australia's. He thought the worries were over. It would be of very considerable concern to him if anything happened to that $50 million. We are talking about buildings under threat, places under threat and also schools' funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone, you are being judged at the moment. It is not just in here that you are failing&mdash;you are failing out in the community as well. All I say to you is: we know you are under pressure, we know that the push is on to get Senator Minchin in, but we also know that you are a minister without strategy, without philosophy and without background in this area and, unless you actually develop that very quickly and learn how to defend your portfolio in the ERC process, not only will the cuts take place but you could be the victim of them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that today's MPI is entitled `The failure of the government to unequivocally honour the pre&hyphen;election promises and guarantees made by Senator Hill in regard to the maintenance of programs for education'. The reason this title, I believe, has been chosen is that it is just another opportunity, as has been taken in other places, at question time and through the media, to try to flush out from the government what its budget proposals are going to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple point that members opposite need to understand&mdash;they certainly understood it when they were on this side of the chamber, when they were in government; suffice it to say, I understand you do not like being reminded that you were rejected, but you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="424"> were&mdash;is this: the people on this side of the chamber were elected on a series of policies which were published, various debates in the community, advertising and so on. We on this side of the chamber have had a major policy debate. The people have spoken. They have unequivocally made their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When is the opportunity for the next major policy statement? If there is going to be any change in direction, when would it be? It would be in the budget. Has any government thought it would be wise to undertake its budget negotiations through the media, by responding hit and miss to questions here and there and by ruling one thing out and leaving another in so that come budget night there was nothing to say because the whole process had been unravelled prior to those decisions being made? Clearly not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there ever was a government that behaved like that, certainly this government is not going to. We have made our commitments. We are now engaging in the process of preparing the budget for August. People are putting to us a variety of views about how to structure the budget&mdash;not just in the areas of higher education, labour market training and vocational training in my portfolio but in all portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A wide variety of views are being put forward, and we are doing what I believe is the proper thing: listening to all of those views and in due course, at the appropriate time&mdash;not at this moment&mdash;we will make those decisions. I intend to bring every piece of skill and experience that I can to making those decisions&mdash;by that I do not mean necessarily my own skill and experience but that of others&mdash;and to structure the budget as best as is humanly possible against what is a very unattractive budgetary situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Prime Minister refused to open the books to let the people of Australia see the state of the nation's economy prior to the election. What do we find on coming to office? We find Beazley's $8 billion black hole. In response to this black hole we can ask ourselves: what would Labor do? Would Labor say, `We know how to fix that. We'll put up taxes'? If their past record is anything to go by, the answer is yes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Bolkus was in government he sat over here and voted to put up taxes all the time. That is probably what the Labor Party would do. In the alternative, the second thing they might choose to do is say, `We'll ignore it. It will all get better.' This is the Keating theory of `I'm the boss; I'm pulling the right levers; the champagne is flowing over; I'm pressing the right buttons; I'm the world's greatest Treasurer; and this is the recession we had to have'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, there are two scenarios I can imagine a Labor government might take up in facing an $8 billion black hole: either put up taxes in the notion that the rest of us in community are rich, that Australians have so much money they can afford to pay more taxes, or do as they have done in the past and simply ignore the problem. We are not prepared to do that. We believe that one of the key ways of providing real jobs to young Australians is, rather than churning them through labour market programs, getting the economy back on track&mdash;and we will do that. We believe we have the support of the Australian community to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Come the budget, the Australian community will make their assessment of whether they think we have made the right decisions. I can assure Senator Bolkus of this: the Australian community do not want taxes to go up and they do not want the budget deficit to be ignored. They would have preferred a government that was honest with them about the situation vis-a-vis the deficit and they would have preferred to know that budgetary situation before the election.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first point was that we know what this is all about. This debate is about the opposition saying, `Why don't you tell us now what your budget thinking is. What are the options you are looking at so that we can further fearmonger in the electorate&mdash;so that we can run out and tell people that they are going to lose their jobs, run out and tell people that programs are going to be cut and frighten the death out of people unnecessarily.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But today is something else. The second point I want to make is that I almost had my breath taken away by the audacity of this motion. On the other side of this chamber are the people, now the opposition&mdash;the country can get lucky some of the time&mdash;who in 1993 marched around the country attacking my party, then the opposition, and said to the Australian people, `Do not re-elect these people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support today's MPI on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We do agree that this government has failed to unequivocally honour its pre-election promises and guarantees, especially in regard to education. I should say that this is so specifically in regard to higher education, because during the election campaign the coalition made many promises to that sector, to students and academics alike. I should say that this relates specifically to higher education, because no other party was prepared to tackle the need for a massive funding boost to primary and secondary education. So many of the government's promises pertain to higher education specifically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But many of those promises have been broken now and, despite Senator Hill's wooing of the academic and student vote, we are now faced with a very different situation. We are faced with a situation in which ministers are unavailable to meet with students and their representative bodies. We are faced with a government that is unwilling to meet its election promises, including its funding commitments. We are faced with a situation where universities across the board are looking at drastic funding cuts. We are also contemplating and being told about possible HECS hikes and other increases to fees and charges. So, for all of Senator Hill's claims in this chamber this afternoon that students support his government, we have seen nothing in the past week except an emerging panic in our higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Senator Vanstone would be aware of the rumblings of student discontent even in this chamber as protesters raised the issues of HECS and Austudy. Admittedly, that was rather a rowdy gesture. It would have been far preferable for the students to have had a private meeting with the minister. Why is this not happening? According to most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reports, students have been unable to get time with the minister as yet. Certainly reports from the peak student body, the National Union of Students, are that, despite almost daily phone calls, they have not yet met with the minister. Perhaps the minister can enlighten us. This is despite a pre&hyphen;election promise&mdash;on page 6 of your higher education policy document&mdash;that the coalition's minister for education would meet and consult regularly with representatives of both national and institutionally based student organisations. Despite the fact that the government made this promise, no student group that we know of&mdash;I am prepared to be enlightened on this if the situation has changed today&mdash;has met successfully with the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that; we have seen panic emerging within the vice&hyphen;chancellors groups and other academic groups, especially given yesterday's headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that up to $50 million is being delayed when it comes to the quality funding. That is despite the fact that this funding commitment was made in December last year. It is now four months late. In yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> the Executive Director of the Australian Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Committee, Mr Frank Hambly, is quoted as saying that he just wanted to know `when the quality money will be paid to universities, and if it will not be paid, why not'. I hope the government will answer this question today. When will this funding be available to institutions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spokesperson for the minister is quoted as saying that `no decision has been taken on this matter at this stage'. Does this mean that the government is reneging on that election promise, despite the fact that universities are making irreversible funding commitments? In fact, many of them have started spending that quality money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the coalition's promises&mdash;again in writing&mdash;to `maintain the level of funding of operating grants to universities' and to make `no cuts to university places'? However, I would like to know what Minister Vanstone said to the AVCC in her meeting with them that prompted them to immediately send out a letter to their members warning them to `brace themselves for funding cuts'. That <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="427"> letter speculated that funding cuts could be as much as $750 million. Already there is speculation that as many as 50,000 places will be cut from higher education institutions around the country. That is the equivalent of eight to nine medium sized campuses. In Queensland alone that would be the equivalent of around two university campuses.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take as another example the government's promise that the HEC scheme would be maintained. The government allowed the community to assume that there would be no increases to individual fees and charges when it came to HECS. But we now see this minister appearing on Triple J, skirting around the issue and refusing to rule out for new students any increase in HECS. Are we going to be looking at up&hyphen;front fees for undergraduate places? Despite the coalition's commitment not to introduce up&hyphen;front fees for undergraduate places, it seems we will be contemplating very shortly a situation where places that are not Commonwealth funded undergraduate places will have up&hyphen;front fees and charges for students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the promises made to the National Tertiary Education Union? They were told by not only Senator Vanstone but also Senator Hill that the pay claim would be top priority. As yet the President of the NTEU has had no word that her wage claim will be responded to. There has been no evidence that that has been taken care of. What we are about to see is unprecedented industrial action on tertiary campuses around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> When it comes to research spending, there was a promise to maintain not only the level of funding to universities but quality and excellence in teaching and research dimen sions. I think $90 million was promised but we have yet to see any funding for universities. So I dispute claims by Minister Hill and Minister Vanstone that `students were disillusioned with the former government but that they had another option', which was to support them; that they would keep their promises and `the students would be better off'. I maintain that under this government students will be hit hardest as usual. They will be used as a revenue raising measure and they will not be better off.

I acknowledge that Senator Hill did have a commitment to this area of public policy and did have an understanding of it. This makes all the more sharp the contrast with the current minister. Senator Hill said to the Australian Education Union's annual conference on 20 January this year, `Unlike the other mob, we are determined to only make promises we will keep.'I also recall that at an AEU breakfast in the dining room last year Senator Hill undertook&mdash;on behalf of a future coalition government, as he put it&mdash;substantive promises to teachers and parents that a coalition government would maintain all existing programs. In writing he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no cuts in Commonwealth specific purpose payments for Australian schools under a Howard Government . . . We will continue to demonstrate our commitment to education by at least maintaining recurrent, capital and targeted equity programs at both the current year levels and at the levels forecast by the Government for future years.</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone reading that could quite legitimately presume that a Howard government would keep its word. We had to assume that those commitments meant that there would be no cuts to education programs. But day after day <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="428"> we read in our newspapers that this government intends to transfer responsibilities back to the states&mdash;and in so doing will reduce the level of Commonwealth commitment to schools programs. For the average worker that means some very serious issues are being raised. Under the programs of the last government for families of two adults and two children some $195 per week in value was allocated in resources that went from programs run by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of that was the contribution the Commonwealth made to schools. In respect of specific payments this meant, for instance, that in my state&mdash;the state of Victoria&mdash;for every primary school student at a government school some $343 million in Commonwealth funds were allocated every year, and some $507 million in Commonwealth funds were allocated for every secondary student. Last year the Commonwealth contributed some $48 million for capital projects in Victoria: almost half the entire capital budget for the whole year came from Commonwealth sources. Some $220 million was allocated to recurrent funding from Commonwealth sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the national equity programs, that meant that such things as English as a second language received $13 million. If you are a migrant, newly arrived in the country, you might draw upon programs which the Commonwealth funded to the tune of $9 million. Disadvantaged schools programs received $14 million and special education received $6 million. Students at risk programs received $1 million and country area programs received $1.9 million. Community languages programs received $1.9 million and students with disabilities programs received $1 million. Early literacy programs received $1.7 million.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . identifying duplication, overlap and cost shifting between the Commonwealth and the States/Territory tiers of government in delivering services and recommend measures needed to promote more efficient service delivery, having regard to the need to improve outcomes for clients and value for money for taxpayers. This should include examination of the appropriate roles of the Commonwealth and the States/Territories, the relationship between service funder and service provider and the scope for contestability in service provision.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear what that means. It means that in education all bets are off, as the minister has indicated. That is the very point that the minister made to the vice&hyphen;chancellors and which she has made again and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem for us, though, is not just this whole question of failure to actually come clean as to what you are intending to do and failure to stop the rot caused by the constant suggestion about moving away from election promises, but the very fact that the minister really does not want the job. This is the real issue here. How is the minister going to be able to fight for her particular portfolio area if she does not want the job? Quite clearly, she did not want the job. She said that she was very disappointed to get it, that it was not the job she was looking for and that she was very disappointed to have to entertain such a project. Senator Hill, unfortunately, did want the job, but did not get it. This is a real difficulty for those who are concerned about education, because it is quite clear that the commitment is not there to actually understand the issues and to fight for the principles that are involved in the defence of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the years of Labor government, the quality of education in this country has never been higher and the levels of funding have never been greater. You compare that, Senator Tierney, with what is happening at the state level. In Victoria we have seen the closure of some 300 schools. We have seen 8,000 students drift out of the system and the removal of 9,000 teachers. We have seen one after another quite vicious attacks upon the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="429"> education system in this country. The contrast could not be greater than that which occurred at a national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the breakfast I mentioned before, Senator Hill made one very simple point. He said, `We have grave concerns about the quality of Commonwealth leadership in education. We will maintain that leadership role.' Senator Hill went on to say, `We are particularly concerned that we don't just pour money into the bucket and allow the states to drain it out of the bottom.' He said that this whole question of substitution of Commonwealth funding and Commonwealth service provision by way of allowing the premiers across this country to wallpaper their offices with Commonwealth money without being accountable and without being responsible to the people of this country in terms of improving the quality of service provision could not go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we seen since this government has been in office? We see quite clearly that the contrary is happening. Quite clearly the push is on from the ideological Right&mdash;Senator Kemp and his mates down there in the Tasman Institute are bubbling away&mdash;because they are most concerned to pursue an agenda to remove Commonwealth leadership from a very important area of this country's future; an area which is critically important for the future of the children of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen is the finance minister, John Fahey, indicate again and again that, if this government must break election commitments, it will. This is in sharp contrast to the point that Mr Howard made during the election campaign when he said that if it meant the difference between keeping their promises or the bottom line on the budget `we would keep our election promises'. What a load of nonsense! Quite clearly we have seen what the real agenda is&mdash;it is the reintroduction of Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we will see it directed specifically at education, because you loathe and despise the state education system in particular. You cannot handle the concept that we have achieved increases in retention rates, that we have more working class people at school now than we have ever had, and that we have more people at university than we have ever <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had. We have a 64 per cent increase in the number of people at universities and a 65 per cent increase in funding. What do you want to do? You want to wind the clock back so that only some families will have access to the power and the privilege that comes from the sort of society that you think is right and proper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why education is such a problem for you. You want to make sure that it is restricted&mdash;that it is available to just the few. You want to make sure that the Commonwealth government&mdash;and the state governments, for that matter&mdash;actually withdraw from it and allow it to remain in private hands. The real issue here is what sort of society you produce as a result of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have got then is quite clearly a commitment entered into to maintain to guarantee the level of funding for all programs&mdash;capital and recurrent&mdash;and targeted equity programs. You could not get a more specific commitment than that. What do we see day after day? We see the failure of this government and this minister to front up to that very basic commitment: that failure of the minister to come to terms with the responsibilities that being a minister involves. I suggest that this a matter of public importance that we will hear a lot more about, because it clearly involves the fundamental failure of this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak today on a debate which relates to the further erosion of the quality of education and the equity of education in Australia. The government has foreshadowed cuts to the education budget of between five and 10 per cent, which amounts to between $500 million and $1 billion. The education budget is comparable to the defence budget, each being at around $10 billion. Yet, in contrast, the defence budget is only being cut by one per cent or $100 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These government priorities are not good for the community. These priorities are not about what we value; that is, a cohesive compassionate society. The defence department with its budget has been given a far higher priority than education, health or welfare budgets, which the government is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="430"> planning to axe. Ironically, Australia has no identifiable enemy. Yet this is meant to justify the continuation of all of the $10 billion per year which could be spent far more appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that the cuts foreshadowed by the government go against its pre-election promises. Senator Hill promised prior to election that the HECS system would be maintained, there would be no up-front fees for Commonwealth funded undergraduate places, there would be no voucher system and Austudy would be retained as a financial support mechanism. At the same time, Senator Hill foreshadowed widening the university funding base through more postgraduate fees, increased commercialisation of research and more funding from overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only spending initiative foreshadowed was a further discount on the Austudy assets test, so that middle class farming families with up to $1.5 million worth of assets could claim Austudy. This is hardly comparable to the $393,000 asset threshold that city families can claim. It could be used by tax minimisers to claim Austudy, while some disadvantaged city people might miss out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost immediately after the election, the government indicated that it had dumped its pre-election commitments. The government is looking at a number of options of raising HECS across the board by two per cent, or introducing three tiers of new rates where the highest rates would pay more than double the present rate of HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be massive cuts in places&mdash;up to 2,500 new places&mdash;which would jeopardise at least two new regional campuses from opening. Also, it is rumoured that 50,000 existing places are to be cut. Postgraduate places may be substantially cut along with thousands of casual and support staff. This will increase class sizes and thus reduce the quality of education provided to students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These measures will be a massive shock to the education system. However, they have not come out of the blue. They are part of the acceleration of policies and values perpetuated by the Labor government, who have taken smaller steps to change the amount of public funding of university institutions, decrease <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funding per student head, alter the basis of research and staff tenure, and who have shifted the cost burden from government to students. The privatisation agenda has largely meant that the taxpayers fund&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the MPI debate raised by Senator Bolkus. I always like speaking at a time following Senator Carr's contribution because he highlights much of the silly nature of the ALP's approach to education. I will come back a little later to the humbug and hypocrisy in this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have before us a situation where this afternoon&mdash;and, indeed, throughout the day&mdash;the Labor Party has been critical of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. This MPI and also the whole focus of question time towards Senator Vanstone shows that this is `Get Senator Vanstone Day'. Obviously, a very dispirited opposition over there have nothing better to do with their time than to attack a minister who has an enormous task before her&mdash;and the enormous task before her is to fix up the mess left by 13 years of Labor maladministration in the area of education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main thrust of the Labor Party's attack on Senator Vanstone earlier today had to do with the way in which she was answering questions. Well, that was a bit rich, given what we have had to put up with for 13 years here&mdash;and, indeed, in my five years here&mdash;during which time we were never able to get a straight answer out of any of you. You would never answer the question. Even when points of order were raised, it was never ruled that you should properly answer the question. I could probably count on one hand the number of times when a minister on that side gave a straight answer. Usually it was a matter of bucketing us or getting off with some totally irrelevant point. On many occasions I asked specific questions and found it enormously frustrating in never getting an answer. So it was a bit rich today for those opposite to attack an entirely new minister on that basis when we recollect that during a period of 13 years very experienced ministers never gave us answers at all.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="431">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here today is also a presumed attack on what the Labor Party thinks&mdash;based on rumour and innuendo&mdash;our approach might be to education. We set out in our election policies what we were going to do on education, and the whole basis of this notice of motion is entirely false. What we will be doing in terms of expenditure on any other areas of education will be revealed fully in the budget. To date, there have been no announcements, no policy outlines and no expenditure outline by Senator Vanstone to say what we are doing. That is all a matter for the budgetary process. As the Labor Party was in government for 13 years, those opposite really should be aware of the way in which the process works: you announce those things at the time you deliver the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also a bit rich for this group over here to be talking and spreading rumours about broken election promises. Looking back to 13 years of Labor government and, in particular, at your last term, 1993 to 1996, we can observe what you promised the people in 1993 and what you actually delivered&mdash;and I refer to your l-a-w law tax cuts and then your putting up sales taxes by $1 billion a year. There was the sham of the budget you delivered last time: you promised that you would balance the budget&mdash;and here we find ourselves, 12 months down the track, with a $8 billion hole. The whole hypocrisy of the approach of this former government stands out very starkly, given its recency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have just left government. You have left us in this mess. You have left us with a legacy of broken promises. Nevertheless, you have the hide to come in here today with this matter of public importance based on rumour and innuendo. You should be hiding your heads in shame about your record in the area of education because you are setting up myths. We can contrast that with the actual reality of what you have done over 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to some of those areas. Senator Vanstone's department is employment, education and training. The previous government's record over 13 years in the areas of Senator Vanstone's jurisdiction was appalling. We had this monster department called DEET with a budget of around $11 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million and a staff of 17,000. That department was administering programs which we found, in estimates committee after estimates committee, were not working effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You set up a program called Working Nation. What a joke, calling it Working Nation, when in reality a little under 20 per cent of the population was either underemployed or unemployed. You set up programs because you were desperate to keep the dole numbers down. You had official unemployment figures of 700,000 to 800,000, but, when we add in all the people whom the previous government defined off the unemployment list through those programs, we find that the figure was up to a little under one million people. That does not include people in part&hyphen;time employment who are officially classified as being in work. However, they are underemployed. They would certainly like to work more hours if they possibly could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former government and this huge department spent the last few years covering up the real state of unemployment in this country by defining people off the list and fudging the figures. You have done the country and the unemployed a great disservice by that approach over recent years because you have tried to hide the real magnitude of the problem. It is to your everlasting shame that you did that. The problem of unemployment left by 13 years of Labor government is absolutely massive and it is going to take the new government an enormous amount of time and effort to have a great impact on that situation. John Howard has outlined the programs for getting the economy on track in order to bring the unemployment figure down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area of particular disgrace was that of youth unemployment. If we look back to 1985 we see that 25 per cent of youth in this country were jobless. When those opposite left government we had 29 per cent of youth who were jobless. What a record! Over 12 years the figure actually increased by four per cent. In most of the rural and regional areas the figure was over 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="432"> Senator Vanstone is faced with an enormous task as a result of the legacy of unemployment which has been left to her. She has also been left with a terrible legacy in educa tion. I was absolutely amazed at some of Senator Carr's comments about quality of education.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this matter of public importance. It is quite obvious that the last speaker for the government, Senator Tierney, has wandered into the wrong debate because we are debating the matter of education. Senator Tierney just spent the last 7&half; minutes talking about tax cuts and unemployment. Let us get back to the issue of education. Given that Senator Tierney was chairman of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee for the last couple of years I thought he might have been able to make some small contribution to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great things that has happened in education in this country occurred more than 20 years ago when a Labor government made education a national issue. Finally, we had a government that demonstrated leadership and recognised that, if we are going to do anything with respect to developing the economic and social structure of this country, we have to provide an adequate education system and one which provides for the promotion of national standards. Under 13 years of Hawke and Keating Labor governments we were able to promote the highest of standards with regard to quality and access in the private system, the government system, and the tertiary sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This new government has come to office with the highest retention rates for year 12 students anywhere in the world. We doubled the school retention rates that existed under the previous coalition government. We find 87 per cent more  students now going on to university. That is vital to the changing employment market in this rapidly changing and highly technological age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Carr outlined, we introduced programs aimed at improving such things as literacy. We initiated national programs directed through specific purpose payments to the states for such things as English as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> second language, for special education, for civics education and for disadvantaged schools. It was all about instituting national improvements and providing access to education right across the country irrespective of the economic circumstances of the students and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the short period that the coalition has been in office it is clear that it is going to walk away from that commitment. The coalition is going to walk away from the commitment it made to maintain as a minimum the level of contribution from the Commonwealth to the education and employment sector. This government is going to go back to its old ideology of handing it all over to the states. It was clear in Fightback and in the deliberations of other committees of this parliament&mdash;such as the Joint Committee on Public Accounts&mdash;that this government does not really believe in specific purpose payments to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that these areas, such as education, should be left to the states and that the Commonwealth should withdraw from them. This is what is on the agenda: massive cutbacks in Commonwealth funding. Leave it to the states and then what you will see is the sort of destruction of the education system that we have seen in Victoria: hundreds of schools closed and 8,000 teachers sacked or retrenched. What we saw in New South Wales under the Greiner and Fahey governments was thousands of teachers put out of the education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have the former Premier of New South Wales, who presided over that reduction in education opportunities in New South Wales, as the Minister for Finance in this government. He is the one who is going to preside over these massive cutbacks.The cutbacks are clear. The education sector knows about them. The university vice&hyphen;chancellors have already indicated their concerns. The Queensland state minister for education has indicated his concern. What do we get from this minister? We get a refusal to answer questions in this parliament. She does not know or, most likely and more appropriately, she does know but she is not game to answer the questions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every word that we have heard from the now opposition on the other side of the chamber on this education debate has been total speculation and scaremongering. They know very well that any responsible government that is 10 weeks into its term obviously must take time to reassess the projects that are under way and see if they can do them in a better way. It has all been speculation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very interested in the comments that have been made by Senator Carr and others on the Victorian education system. Senator Carr is a great one to talk about this because in his role as senior adviser to Joan Kirner, when she was Premier, he had a hand in successfully ruining one of the best education systems in Australia, if not the world. It has taken a great deal of effort by the Kennett government to give the highest priority to children's education so that Victorian educators can once again hold their heads high. Senator Carr spent his short time in the federal Labor government in an attempt to ruin the federal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Labor government the Victorian government education system became an absolute shambles, not devoted to the best interests of students and parents. In the four years of the Kennett government we have seen a return to excellent levels of achievement at every level. The changes that have been made have not affected the quality of education. In the last years of the Cain&hyphen;Kirner Labor government in Victoria we saw parents marching with their feet and going in large numbers to the private school system. Since the Kennett changes in education have been made, we have seen parents voting with their feet in reverse. There has been a return of parents and students to the state school system in Victoria, which speaks for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our coalition education policy, which was introduced by us for this last election, we did detail to some extent the shambles that education had become under the 13 years of Labor government. I will very briefly mention some of those things. As the Senate will be aware, in 1989 the then Labor government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reorganised higher education in Australia. It replaced the existing binary system with what it described as the unified national system. Under this, colleges of adult education became universities, forced amalgamations occurred and the number of Australia's public universities increased to 36.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1989 reforms were, in many ways, simply a redefinition of existing institutions but, as a consequence, the number of students within the higher education sector increased massively to over 600,000 students. The expansion in those numbers was not matched by a commensurate increase in per capita student funding. Since Labor's election in 1983, universities have experienced a 13 per cent per equivalent full&hyphen;time student unit decline in Commonwealth funding. That is not what you would call a very good treatment of education. The coalition certainly hope to reassess some of those goals in what we aim to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Margetts mentioned one of our election promises, which was to support Austudy to financially assist students to improve equity and access. As a first step, our election policy mentioned that we would increase the discount in the assets test for Austudy from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for farm and business assets in businesses in which the parent is substantially engaged. I would point out to Senator Margetts that this was a recommendation of the all&hyphen;party Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee last year. It was not just the coalition that was indicating that that position should be looked at; it was all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also imagine from her comments on this that Senator Margetts has no experience of the reasons why farming families cannot afford to send their children on to tertiary studies. Unfortunately, she spoke about middle&hyphen;class farming families. I do not know where she gets this idea from. Not all farming families are middle class; they occupy every level of the socioeconomic spectrum and all of them have equally hard decisions to make when it comes to sending members of their families on to tertiary studies. This is what we want to change.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="434">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, secondary schools were overburdened by monitoring requirements imposed by the last Commonwealth government. The Labor government at that time promised to streamline the administration of funds for targeted programs and to remove some of the burden of reporting requirements. Senator Carr spoke about the millions and millions of dollars spent by the last government on education. The money may have been spent, but it did not reach the classroom and the schoolyard. That is where the coalition aims to target the money much better. Many school administrations have spoken to me about the complexity of paperwork and administration that they were forced to undergo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have it both ways. Just as you said before the election, `You haven't any policies; show us your policies,' you are now saying, `You're not going to do anything, but you're breaking your promises.' You cannot have it both ways; it is either one thing or the other. We will be maintaining the programs that will work. We will be providing the youth of Australia with an education that will equip them both for life and for work, which is far more than the previous Labor government did.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion, I should just make a couple of comments. I understand honourable senators on the other side and maybe other honourable senators here might wish to comment on this report more fully. Fututech has been a matter of great interest to me and other senators from Queensland because it was supposed to be trialled in a commercial process at Kilcoy, which is not far outside Brisbane. Kilcoy is one of the smaller meatworks which is not controlled by a major chain in the same way that AMH has controlled meatworks through large portions of Queensland and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fututech offered a wonderful opportunity for Kilcoy to progress and also for us to start to close some of the major problems that we have had in terms of inefficiency compared with our competitors overseas. Everybody would appreciate the fact that one of the grave difficulties that we have had in the primary industry sector is getting more value back to the people who produce the original product. I speak as somebody who suffers the consequences of our not being able to get value for money for producers because, when you sell animals for slaughter, the meatworks give the price based on the price for beef and the processing cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Processing costs in Australian abattoirs have been unacceptably high, compared even with New Zealand. Everybody thought that Fututech was a wonderful opportunity for us to reduce the processing cost. The idea was that these animals would go through an automated slaughter process. What became apparent as the trials went on was that the process was not working. The idea that these animals would be automatically killed just was not happening. There are numerous stories about the consequences of the failure of the automated slaughtering process to kill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="435"> the animal in a fashion that the carcass could then be processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Parer would be aware that the carcasses were unfit for processing after they had gone through the process. That did not help anybody at all. I personally was not aware that, at the time at which this process was being followed, there was actually a commercial agreement between the Meat Research Corporation and Kilcoy meatworks. Everybody thought that this was just a convenient trial which had been done at Kilcoy with the concurrence of the company. Nobody knew that there was in fact a commercial obligation on the Meat Research Corporation to provide what is described in the summary as a fully operational commercial slaughter line based on commercial criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General found that, in despite of that commercial obligation, the process was commenced without the rigour one would normally associate with research. There were unresolved technical problems and there had been a failure in a commercial sense to quantify the costs and benefits or to properly define the market potential. In other words, you had a great idea, a great concept, `Let's have an automated slaughter line for beef cattle.' But instead of progressing it to a more finished stage, the Meat Research Corporation hopped in and said, `We are going to install this line at Kilcoy,' and entered into a commercial obligation to produce a line which could be used for commercial production. So when the prototype did not work&mdash;and it was not fit to work when it was installed, because it was still in the developmental stage&mdash;the Meat Research Corporation entered into a situation where it had a massive commercial exposure to the Kilcoy meatworks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has seen the cost blow out from $2.2 million, which was the estimated cost of the Kilcoy portion of the Fututech program, to $20 million for that portion of the program. That is half of the $40 million which was expended in relation to Fututech. Poor financial management has cost the Meat Research Corporation a lot of money. That poor financial management and poor commercial management has, moreover, cost producers a lot of money because the blowout of $18 million <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is funded to the tune of $9 million by contributions from the industry. I think this is very unfortunate. I would have hoped that the situation would not have been what it clearly was and is exposed in this report as having been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I am also very pleased to see that the Meat Research Corporation has taken on all the recommendations contained in the Auditor&hyphen;General's report. We might consider some of them to be fairly fundamental, but obviously they were not followed. For example, ANAO recommendation No. 1 states that before a decision to commercialise a process is made, rigorous documentation and analysis of technical data should be undertaken on all research projects to support the assurance that estimated performance improvement and cost savings can be achieved. That is pretty simple. If you were a commercial operator, you would do that. The Meat Research Corporation, for some inexplicable reason, has failed to do that. I would hope that not only do they agree to accept the recommendation, but they to start to put it into practice from now on, because that is obviously a matter of great significance.</PARA>

The view of the Greens is that this gives undue precedence to article 11 agreements, which are a very small part of the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Article 11 is a tiny section of the convention that allows the minister to enter into a bilateral agreement with another country to determine that a hazardous waste is not a hazardous waste. This is by no means the overall aim of the Basel convention and therefore should not be stated as one of the overall aims of this bill. For that reason, the Greens will be opposing this item.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (South Australia&mdash;</STATE>
<ROLE>Minister for the Environment)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.08 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This and a number of amendments of the Australian Democrats and, I think, some of the amendments of the Greens (WA), relate to the issue of article 11 agreements. I think, as Senator Chamarette said as she sat down, it is really a debate about the legitimacy of such agreements and the place for dealing with those agreements within this amending bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I could make a few general comments on article 11 agreements to help clarify the government's position. Article 11 of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Basel Convention provides that parties may enter into agreements with other parties and/or non&hyphen;parties providing for the trans&hyphen;boundary movements of hazardous wastes. An article 11 agreement may contain different rules to those in the convention. However, article 11.1 shall stipulate the provisions which are not less environmentally sound than those in the convention. In other words, the source of the agreement is, Senator Chamarette, the convention itself and the convention provides for the setting up of these agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, I guess, in some ways your argument is an argument against the convention itself. We are a party to the convention and we are trying to put in place legislation that provides for Australia meeting its commitments thereunder, which includes not only the transfer of wastes under the convention proper but also under agreements that are set up under article 11.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point I was seeking to make was that, although there may be separate rules for such an article 11 agreement, the fact that they shall be not less environmentally sound has the effect that the agreement cannot therefore undermine the convention. I should have thought that that would have given Senator Chamarette some comfort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill provides for the minister to declare an agreement to be an article 11 agreement for the purposes of this act, which is section 4G. Regulations to be made to give effect to article 11 agreements are dealt with in sections 16C to E. A substance is to be deemed to not be hazardous waste if it is covered by an article 11 agreement under which the substance is not regulated. That just simply distinguishes substances that are dealt with under the article 11 agreements from those that are dealt with under the core of the convention. A substance is to be deemed to be hazardous waste under the act if it is covered by an article 11 agreement, even if it is not otherwise regulated by the act. This is under section 4F, which operates only for the purposes of the article 11 agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, Australia is a party to an article 11 agreement in relation to the OECD. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="437"> fact, Australia is currently a party to three article 11 arrangements. The major one of these is the OECD decision on the trans&hyphen;boundary movement of hazardous waste destined for a recovery operation, which is commonly known as the OECD council decision. As a member of the OECD, Australia is obliged to comply with the terms and conditions of the OECD council decision. I will not go into all the details of it as that would be a bit unnecessary at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing is that section 4G provides the legal mechanism under which the movement of such waste can occur. So the bill before us picks up the fact that the convention provides for article 11 arrangements. Australia is already the party to three such arrangements and we need a domestic regulatory procedure to ensure compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I really cannot see the purpose of this amendment and the others related to it which would result in us not having this capacity in domestic law. I should have thought that the Greens and the Australian Democrats would have been in here calling for it. It might have been a different thing if the convention did not provide for it, but that is history.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What do you mean&mdash;you walked away from it. We are picking up the pieces. We are seeking to repeal the definition of `dispose of safely' and Senator Chamarette is opposing that. The phrase `dispose of safely' is replaced in the amendment bill by the concept of environmentally sound management which, as I understand Senator Chamarette, is taken directly from the Basel Convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's aim in amending the act is predominantly to bring Australia's national legislation into line with the convention. Accordingly, definitions such as `dispose of safely', which do not appear in the convention, have been removed to make way for the more consistent and widely recognised Basel terminologies. Consequently, the bill adopts the convention definition of `environmentally sound management', which applies to all stages of the waste management process, including recycling, transport and handling. On the other hand, `disposed of safely' refers specifically to the disposal process and could be misconstrued to mean final disposal only. Such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the intention of the convention and that seems to me to be a strong argument in favour of the government's amendment and an argument that should put your mind at rest, Senator Chamarette.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats intend to support the position of the WA Greens, and it is important because the first instance in which the definition is applied is to page 14, lines 26 onwards, proposed new subsection 4G, article 11. The amendment is important because it is the first instance in the bill in which the definition is applied. Although there was a little confusion about which particular amendment we were speaking about in the first instance, Senator Chamarette is quite right in saying that the argument that needs to be rehearsed is an argument about the definition of `dispose of safely'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this case, on page 3, which is the first instance where that definition is referred to, we really need to explain why it is that such a definition should not be accepted and therefore why that definition should be opposed and why the Greens' amendment No. 1 should be supported. The argument really is about the wording of this `dispose of safely'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="439"> The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) gave some indication that he believed that the wording was as the result of extensive consultation. The consultation did occur. I do not dispute that at all. The result of the consultation is this construction we find on page 14, subsection 4G, which is not what should be expected as a result of long consultation, because that whole area, 4G, allows to accrue to the minister an extraordinary discretionary power to define something as either hazardous or not hazardous according to the conveniences of the time. That is the sub stance; that is the essence of what this debate should be about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way things are defined might sound pretty, but when we read what article 11 arrangements are&mdash;`substances not classified as hazardous waste'&mdash;proposed new subsection 4G gives to the minister far too much discretionary power to allow all sorts of tricky corners to be avoided. It is those tricky corners which really bring responsible behaviour to those Australians who are operating overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not trying to get rid of article 11 agreements completely but, in looking carefully at article 11 agreements and the method by which they can be applied, we are being very careful about what it is that the minister can and cannot define as hazardous or not. That is the reason that we disagree with the very first mention of section 4, `definition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">dispose of safely</EMPHASIS>', when we want to support the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The WA Greens acknowledge that the safe disposal of hazardous waste is the intent of the act. We think that it is outrageous to remove that. In this particular clause, which is the first time it is mentioned, the concerns about it are not so great, but we are concerned about the fact that what we are presently doing is deleting the `dispose of safely' phrase out of the entire act. That phrase relates to the purpose of the convention and is what our obligations are about. Under this bill, the object of the hazardous waste act is proposed to be:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ensure that exported, imported or transited waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The original act states it more specifically as `to ensure that exported or imported hazardous waste is disposed of safely'. Changing the object of the act is intended to include those matters that are termed recyclables. I understand that, and I believe it is appropriate that an act should include aspects that are intended to be covered. In one sense, it could be an important measure of strengthening the effectiveness of the act to be in accordance with the tenets of the Basel convention, as the minister has said.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum to the bill commented that the original phrase could be misconstrued as limiting the act to control the final disposal of hazardous waste rather than controlling all the dealings of such wastes. I acknowledge that, but the reverse is also true. By the government's own argument, there are obviously areas within a given act where references to the specific are crucial to ensure every base is covered. The act would be strengthened only if the general aim of environmentally sound export, import and transit of hazardous wastes was compounded by the specific intention to also ensure their safe disposal. It is for that reason that, in our amendment, we oppose the erasing of the term `dispose of safely' from the entirety of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As outlined in section 5 of the principal act, this phrase has a very important and specific definition that is necessary to control the dumping of hazardous wastes, and the assurance that hazardous wastes will be disposed of safely is a central aim of the Basel convention. No other term&mdash;certainly not one as unspecific as `the way in which hazardous waste is to be dealt with after export'&mdash;ensures safe disposal in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems ridiculous that, in a bill that is supposed to expand the objects of the principal act to encompass Australia's obligations under the Basel convention, the main aim of the principal act is quietly erased from the register. We believe that ensuring environmentally sound management for hazardous wastes, consistent with Australia's international obligations, also means safe disposal of those wastes, and that intention should be spelt out without compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we reject wholeheartedly the government's intention to erase `dispose of safely' from the act and we oppose not only this proposed new section but the other proposed new sections where that erasure also occurs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this outrage and helplessness are expressed in almost muted tones&mdash;in tones of sorrow rather than anger. It is, frankly, heartbreaking to see this in a state like Tasmania, where the sense of community is so strong. As one of the British newspapers aptly headlined, `Where in the world is safe?' Our collective compassion and sympathy goes out to those touched in whatever way by the harrowing events of 28 April. They will live on in the minds of Tasmanians and all Australians forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his intervention and strong action with regard to the institution of a national approach to gun laws. The measures that have now been agreed to by all states were in the main adopted in principle early last year but were deferred at the ministerial council held somewhat ironically in Launceston last November due to the intransigence and prevarication of two state governments, sadly one of which was Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, this is not a matter for political partisanship. One of the strongest advocates for change was the Liberal Deputy Premier of Victoria and then Minister for Police, Pat McNamara. It takes a catharsis like this to bring people to their senses, and it is with no great measure of relief and thankfulness that we now have in Tasmania <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="441"> a tripartite agreement on gun law reform. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record the work done by the then federal Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, in his valiant attempts to induce change. I am sure that he is pleased by these initiatives, tardy though they clearly are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A positive outcome, if there is such a thing in these circumstances, is the way the Tasmanian community has drawn together and the level of nurturing and support that has been evident at all levels of Tasmanian society. In Tasmania we know the value and strength of community. Tasmanians regularly top the list for their generosity during national charity appeals. We have a strong sense of local identity, a strong sense of ourselves. Margaret Thatcher's notion that there is no such thing as society is an anathema to those of us in the Labor Party. It flies in the face of the level of societal solidarity we have seen both in Tasmania and around Australia over the last 11 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that there is such a thing as society is clearly axiomatic. The question is: what kind of society do we want? We constantly hear references to financial, physical and human capital but rarely do we hear about social capital&mdash;the social glue that binds us together as a society. Eva Cox said in her recent delivery of the Boyer lecture series that social capital is the sum of our social connections and the levels of trust we need to maintain a truly civil society. These are the building blocks of a civil society: trust, mutuality and reciprocity. Unfortunately, there are those in society who believe the obvious path to creating a society rich in society capital is, as Eva Cox puts it, `to increase the morality in communities and the power of families&mdash;nuclear, of course&mdash;and Eureka! the problem is solved'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in an era of constant change. People are afraid. They are afraid for their jobs. They are afraid for their future. When the Japanese economy goes into three consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, workers around Australia fear for their livelihoods. The internationalisation of the world economy has brought about often painful change to Australian workers. The response <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of governments must be the rebuilding and nurturing of communities and the reintroduction of certainty and security in people's lives and a sense of belonging. Society must become more cohesive&mdash;not less. To quote Hugh Mackay:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we don't take urgent steps to restore the sense of community, the moral impact is long&hyphen;term. People learn their sense of values from the experience of living with each other.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The social cohesion that binds communities can, given a certain environment, have a negative effect. This can result in communities clinging together bound by fear of the different. We saw this most starkly in Queensland during the federal election, with the ugliness of racism assisting in the election of ultra right wing candidates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agenda of this government is becoming crystal clear. In only two months of government we have seen signs of Australians being split into economic categories by attacks on Aboriginal Australians, welfare recipients, public sector workers and unions&mdash;handy scapegoating and ideologically driven. By treating any Australian differently based on their occupation, based on their gender, based on their ethnicity and so on, we are all devalued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 13 years under the previous Labor government no group was singled out as being of greater or lesser significance or value. Historic initiatives such as Mabo helped demystify the different. Now we are all at risk of marginalisation based on our level of consumption, whether by necessity or by a chosen lifestyle. The value of the individual and their rights in society become defined by their financial and class status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="442"> Only in extreme circumstances will public services be provided by government. Look at Thatcher's Britain; look at Reagan's America. Who suffers? The young, the old, the poor and always the sick. Of course there will be a good education for your kids, if you can afford it. Of course you will get the best in health care, if you can afford it. Of course you can get the phone on, if you can afford it. We end up as consumers, not citizens. This is not the kind of Australia the next genera tion deserves. This is not the kind of legacy we should leave them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe in publicly owned monopolies like water, electricity and telecommunications. I do not believe in privatisation of these publicly owned monopolies. Let us take Telstra for example. Sure, the coalition's policy on the initial part privatisation of Telstra was well&hyphen;documented during the election campaign. It even received resounding support from some strange sources like the Wilderness Society. Sure, this government has a mandate to govern, but it does not have a mandate to sell Telstra. Every single non-government party in this chamber pledged to oppose the Telstra privatisation. This opposition was consistent, constant and abundantly clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government owned enterprises such as Telstra were developed for specific reasons. They were established and progressed through money provided by Australian taxpayers to enable certain strategic and service related needs to be met. The simple fact is that many of these public utilities relating to water, electricity and telecommunications are there because they are government owned. In many cases the private sector could not or would not have established them. Government governs for the people, and that responsibility relates fundamentally to issues of fairness, access, equity and social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It so happens that a government business enterprise like Telstra is also doing very nicely from a financial perspective. In the last financial year ended June 1995 Telstra as a fully owned government business enterprise had total assets of $24 billion, produced an after-tax profit of $1.7 billion and provided a dividend to the Commonwealth of $94 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forgetting all the social justice arguments and concentrating purely on profit, why on earth would you want to sell it? In 1991-92, profit was just $300 million and the dividend to the Commonwealth was $478 million. In other words, in the space of the last three years profitability has increased sixfold and the dividend to the government has doubled. All this has happened just as Telstra is taking on the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, where opportunities are abundant.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This profitability and expansion, I must add, have been associated with record productivity over the last three years, considerably outstripping all other industry groups with a cooperative approach between the union movement and management through the accord. This same cooperative approach also delivered an unprecedented result of no days lost through industrial disputes in the 18 months to the end of the 1995 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us forget again for a second about the negative effects of the privatisation of Telstra on the lives of ordinary people and regional and rural Australia. Selling Telstra is quite simply bad business. The fact that it is simply bad business is compounded when you consider that the moment one-third of Telstra is sold the government loses one-third of its dividend&mdash;$300 million per annum with the associated exponential increase in forgone revenue as the years go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, let us turn to the social costs of a privatised Telstra. Let us have a look at Tasmania, the most ruralised state in Australia. If cross-subsidisation did not exist, people living in Burnie would have to pay around an extra $850 per annum to have the phone on, people living in Smithton would have to pay around an extra $1,140 per annum and people living on King Island would have to pay around an extra $2,200 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at Bass. If cross-subsidisation did not exist, people living in Launceston would pay around an extra $730 per annum, people living in Scottsdale would have to pay around an extra $1,270 per annum and people living on Flinders Island would have to pay around an extra $4,930 per annum. Let us move on to the rest of Tasmania: Queenstown, an extra $1,250 per annum; Deloraine, an extra $680 per annum; St Marys, an extra $910 per annum; Geeveston, an extra $600 per annum, and on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people living in regional and rural areas the phone is a necessity of life. For the older people in our community the phone is a necessity of life. In fact, it is the primary means of regular communication with friends, relatives and, most importantly, health services. For all of us the phone is a necessity of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="443"> life. Why slug people who need it most and can afford it least?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose the partial sale of Telstra, not simply as a matter of social justice and good business but also on behalf of the people of Tasmania who showed clearly in the Labor Party's strong Senate polling and in the retention of three out of the four Labor held seats that they also oppose it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Still on the theme of regional Australia, and looking again at Tasmania, the impact of public sector cuts cannot be ignored. The first major fiscal hit already heralded by the government is significant cuts to the public sector, and the slashing of state grants. These cuts on the basis of reining in the deficit are premature, have obviously not been thought through, and will impact most of all on regional economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those regional economies&mdash;and the economy most sensitive to cuts&mdash;is the Tasmanian economy. Let me first profile our island state economy and demonstrate why the proposed federal cuts will have a devastating impact on an already struggling economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until the early 1980s Tasmania was performing at least as well as the rest of Australia in terms of economic growth, employment growth and our unemployment rate. Our economy was driven by strong investment and growth in our resource based industries such as forestry, mining and agriculture. At the same time, public sector investment was strong through the progressive development of our state's hydro&hyphen;electric system. With the winding down of the hydro during the 1980s and the complete cessation of dam building several years ago, associated with a plateauing of resource based industry activity, Tasmania's economic performance began to wane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this, a state that had relied heavily on public sector employment was confronted with a budgetary debt crisis in 1990 which meant severe public sector cuts. Since 1990, over 5,000 full time equivalents have been made redundant in the public sector alone, in a total labour force of some 220,000 people. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These elements have all come together in recent years to bring Tasmania's economy to its knees. Over the past four years, while the rest of Australia has been growing at three per cent to four per cent a year in real terms, Tasmania has been struggling to average half a per cent growth. This performance has been reflected in poor employment growth&mdash;under half that of the rest of Australia, and almost entirely part time&mdash;an unemployment rate stuck at above 10 per cent and now rising again, and virtually no population growth. The writing has been on the wall for four years but it has been ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the fundamental drive for a diversified economy has to come from the state government, we simply cannot afford further reductions in employment and Commonwealth funds. Tasmania's dispersed population has always necessitated greater public sector resources to ensure that every Tasmanian receives the same level of government services as every other Australian receives. The consequence of this special need is that public sector employment has become an essential component in community economies in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government's current fiscal path is continued, it will have three major consequences. First, if Tasmania receives its share of these cuts, several hundred jobs will be lost directly and several hundred more through the multiplier effect. This will take tens of millions out of our domestic economy in wages and salaries per year and further depress domestic demand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, if Tasmania is apportioned its share of a reduction in Commonwealth grants to the states, at least $50 million will be slashed per year. Service delivery and jobs will be sacrificed on the altar of economic rationalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="444"> Third, cuts to Working Nation programs will have a devastating effect on the long&hyphen;term unemployed. In 1994&hyphen;95 nearly $70 million of national funds were provided to Tasmania. This was increased to $100 million in 1995&hyphen;96 in recognition of Tasmania's high level of long&hyphen;term unemployed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were not for Working Nation funds, Tasmania's unemployment rate would have been even higher, because most of the decrease in those unem ployed over the past three years was in the long&hyphen;term unemployed category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple fact is that these initiatives, should they proceed, will guarantee that Tasmania's unemployment rate will remain above 10 per cent into the next century. Tasmania must receive special consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before becoming a senator for Tasmania, I was state secretary of the Labor Party in that state for almost four years. The resurgence of Labor in Tasmania is a shining example of what can be done when the will to win is recovered. It underlines the fundamental difference between Labor and other political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Never underestimate the Labor Party. We have over 100 years of history behind us. We have seen the bad times but we have always survived. We are at our best when our backs are against the wall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank every member of the Labor Party in Tasmania for their support, their tenacity and their determination. It has been an honour and a personal pleasure to work with people who care enough about the future of our society to sign on the dotted line, get active and work towards a fairer society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I joined the ALP in 1978 and in previous incarnations spent five years working in the union movement, which taught me the value of collectivism and unity. Industrial relations is a great passion for me and I will be a strong advocate in this place of the rights of working people. I owe a great debt to the labour movement and it has been an absolute privilege to make a contribution to improving the lives of people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank the people of Tasmania for putting me here and I will do my level best to strongly represent the interests of this state and make sure that we get a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This year is the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Culloden, so it is worth pointing out that I was born in Scotland and came to Tasmania in the late 1960s with my parents and brothers. I come from a long line of Scottish nationalists and have shared in the anguish of my family in Scotland who have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suffered under Tory government policies. Scotland has consistently voted Labour&mdash;in fact to the extent that insufficient Scottish Tory MPs have been elected to fill the Scottish cabinet. The price for that? Absolute starvation of funds, cutbacks in services, and little infrastructure spending. I am proud to say that, despite this, the Scots still keep voting Labour. I suspect that stubbornness, independence and pride are well immersed in the gene pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank my partner, David Crean, a non-practising doctor of medicine and a Labor member of the upper house in Tasmania. I would particularly like to thank him for his patience in putting up with me pacing around the house during election campaigns at 3 o'clock in the morning and writing interminable lists of things to do the next day. Patience and tolerance are things he has learned the hard way in his experience with a number of members of the Tasmanian Legislative Council&mdash;particularly, I would imagine, the famous George Brookes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A final word on another great passion: increasing the number of women in politics. I say to the coalition: congratulations on the number of women elected in the last election. I also say: be careful. Even a small swing against the coalition in the next federal poll will see most of these women go. Why? The vast majority were preselected in marginal seats. We in the Labor Party know about this. To date it is pretty much what we have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, Mr President, we have done something about it. The decision at the last ALP national conference was not just about a rule change, it was about a cultural change; it was about changing a mind&hyphen;set. We will achieve our target and, increasingly, we will see women preselected into safe seats. This will not just happen in the Labor Party; it will happen in all political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Someone said to me recently, `Politics is not so much a glass ceiling as a sticky floor.' Occasionally, it feels like it has been superglued. To women everywhere, this is our parliament too. Until we get to 52 per cent representation of women, it cannot truly be our parliament. So I say: pull your feet off the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="445"> sticky floor and mind your head on the glass ceiling. Thank you, Mr President.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to be the first to congratulate Senator Mackay on a very thoughtful and sincere speech and wish her a long and successful career in the Senate chamber. I note with pleasure that at last the standard of the Labor Party in opposition is starting to improve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech yesterday I devoted a major part of my time to a defence issue: accidents in the Australian Defence Force. I used the recent Senate report into the Nomad crash as a starting point. I now wish to move to the fundamental concern I have; that is, the number of serious accidents that have occurred in the ADF in recent years under Labor, and the lack of accountability in relation to those accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a common pattern across all three services, and all three services have been similarly involved. Lives have been lost and, in most cases, no censure has been made against any individual who is standing in a position of responsibility. I hold strongly to the view that rank carries inseparably with it responsibility. I will just very quickly look at some of those accidents in the recent past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the air force we had the Boeing 707 accident at East Sale, which one senior air force officer described privately to me at the time as `a real Third World air force type of accident'. The inquiry into that implied that blame lay with the training captain. He had a contributory role, but the RAAF had operated this type of aircraft for 10 years and it had been in civilian service for over 30 years. The inquiry also showed that the training manuals were deficient, there was no agreed approved syllabus for endorsement training&mdash;and the aircraft and all aboard were lost in an endorsement training accident. Yet none of the relevant senior officers in the air force were held accountable for that accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> In the navy we have had at least two FFGs driven up on reefs. We had the dreadful situation where two sailors were left on the weather decks of a submarine when it sub merged in the Tasman Sea a couple of years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To cite a case from the army, we had a soldier killed at Tin Can Bay just over three years ago. He was a recruit from the first intake of the ready reserve, had completed his 12 months continuous training and was on an exercise at Tin Can Bay when he was killed in a grenade accident. Despite numerous questions by me in Senate estimates, the Department of Defence has now safely exceeded the three-year statute of limitations under the Defence Force Discipline Act, and no action can be taken with respect to that incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this incident the soldiers were issued with grenades and the pins were interfered with; they were crimped together. On one day they were crimped and splayed back; on the day the soldier was killed they were not even splayed back but were just crimped together. It is one of the most absolute crimes in the army to interfere with or modify ammunition or munitions in any way at all, yet the ammunition was clearly interfered with here. There was a gross breach of regulations, yet no-one was censured in any way at all. The grenades in an unsafe state were issued to the soldier; as directed, he put them in his basic pouches, which were on the front of his abdomen; and, while he was crawling to a firing point, the pin came out of one of the grenades and detonated the others, and he was killed instantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The army set up an AIT, a board of inquiry, and there was a coroner's inquiry, and I have read all of those. Everything in relation to that accident is minutely documented: the time, the place, who did what, who the personnel were. Yet when the inquiry was held, no-one was held to blame. Having been through grenade live&hyphen;firing exercises as a soldier myself, I find it absolutely appalling that no-one was held accountable for the loss of that life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is true of most of the accidents that I am referring to here: no-one was held accountable in any way at all for the accident&mdash;and that is totally unacceptable to this parliament.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="446">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will diverge for a moment by saying that I support the recommendation of the Senate committee into the Nomad crash that there be an extension from three years to five for the statute of limitations under the Defence Force discipline act. In not all cases but clearly in some cases, the Department of Defence has protracted, through the bureaucracy, inquiries and restricted the availability of information to families, so that no charges could be laid against people until the statute of limitations had expired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that it takes time to set up inquiries, it takes time to get witnesses, it takes time to consider all the elements in writing up the report. There is an inevitable amount of time lost in the whole of the process before you can come to conclusions about accidents. But I do believe that on some occasions, regrettably, there has been a conscious attempt to draw out the time so that no charges could ultimately be laid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, it gives me no pleasure at all to raise this matter in public and in the Senate. I yield to no&hyphen;one in this parliament in my concern for the interests and advancement of the Australian Defence Force and the men and women who serve in it. Those concerns have been demonstrated from my first days in the parliament which now go back 18 years and, indeed, reflect a lifelong interest of mine in defence matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These accidents strike at the very heart of the Australian Defence Force and its capabilities. The roles and the tasks demanded of the Australian Defence Force are inherently dangerous and members of the ADF do lose their lives on active service. Military training must be realistic, so it has to have an inherently high risk in it also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that, regrettably, there will always be lives lost in military training accidents, but there must never be an avoidable or pointless loss of life and that does demand careful planning and careful execution of the exercises. Exercises have got to be properly resourced: there must be adequate funding and equipment. There has to be careful planning and supervision by experienced personnel and those personnel must take responsibility for their actions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very heart of this matter is that the Australian Defence Force operates as a team and, as a team, it runs on trust&mdash;absolute trust between subordinates and superiors. Soldiers, sailors and airmen put their lives on the line knowing that everything humanly possible has been done, both by their colleagues and by their superiors, to get them through. You simply cannot have servicemen or women seeing colleagues killed as a consequence of bad planning, bad management or any other form of incompetence on exercises, have no&hyphen;one charged and then expect the soldiers, the sailors and the airmen to do their duty and to obey orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret that I no longer have any confidence in the Department of Defence investigating itself in relation to accidents of this nature, and I say that with very great regret. The individual services can retain their accident investigation teams and boards of inquiry, but we do need an independent inspector&hyphen;general of accidents or its equivalent. I suggest that, where property damage over a quarter of a million dollars or, maybe, half a million dollars and/or loss of life occurs, the inspector&hyphen;general is compelled to investigate the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inspector&hyphen;general should have access to a pool of very experienced service personnel with particular expertise in the areas concerned in the inquiry, plus whatever civilian experts are deemed necessary. The crucial point, though, is that all the service personnel are ex&hyphen;service personnel totally divorced from the ADF and not dependent on it in any way at all for pensions or promotions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The powers of the inspector&hyphen;general should be: to send for persons and documents; to require evidence to be given under oath; and to inquire into all relevant aspects of the case. Above all, the inspector&hyphen;general should have the power to make recommendations on both procedures and practices and, most importantly, to make recommendations in respect of either reward or censure of individuals involved. Those recommendations must be mandatory on the relevant service. In other words, whatever the independent inspector&hyphen;general recommends in the way of reward or punishment must be applied by the service.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="447">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One final point I want to raise is the matter of financial recompense. Legal costs today are huge. Even if the family of somebody who is killed in a Defence Force accident is not going to mount a legal challenge, the matters of looking after the interests of the deceased are very real and they are catered for by the family having legal representation at some of the hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know of one case in the very recent past where a soldier was killed on an exercise and his family paid the sum of $30,000 in legal fees although they had made no challenge. I know nothing about the family's financial status, but I suspect that was a very great financial load for the family to bear, as it would be for most people. To their credit, they have never commented on that burden in public or drawn attention to it in any way at all. I will not do so by naming them here today, but I do believe it is reasonable that the family in these circumstances should be covered for reasonable legal costs for what, hopefully, should be a very rare event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the present system of not attributing blame to service personnel where they have fallen short of their responsibilities can no longer be sustained. Since the Department of Defence has shown it is incapable of sitting in judgment on itself, it is time to substitute an independent and experienced body to do so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his eight years as ACT senator, Bob forged a well&hyphen;deserved reputation as a highly effective representative of the Canberra community. This reputation was further enhanced by his service to the people of Australia as a minister and as a politician <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> blessed with sound judgment born of years of experience within the Labor movement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Susan, Bob and I are very different people, but we are all united in our commitment to social justice and our concern for people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say a few words about former Senator Ryan and her historical contribution to, amongst many other things, the status of women in Australia, a contribution that had a direct impact upon me as a young woman seeking employment for the first time.

This event set me on a path, albeit unexpected; a path that I have been honoured to follow. Hence, finding myself in this chamber presenting my first speech 12 years later, but still with a scaffolders ticket in my pocket, is a positive reflection on the accessibility of the democratic political processes which are fundamental to both the Labor Party and the Australian nation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say that in this reflection we see the presence and contribution of many women, including pioneers like Dorothy Tangney, Enid Lyons, Margaret Guilfoyle and Susan Ryan&mdash;all of whom have opened doors for other women.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These days, however, it is not enough just to hold open these doors. By being here I gladly carry with me a responsibility, as do all women elected to this chamber and the other place, to strive for the removal of those doors altogether. And Labor started the process&mdash;so successfully in fact that our opponents have belatedly jumped on the bandwagon and renewed my certainty that one day there will be no trace of the barriers that once blocked the full and active participation in the political processes by more than half of the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that someone like myself is here is the result of the selfless, dedicated and diligent work of many Labor women over the years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my family, all of whom have supported me in everything I have ever undertaken&mdash;especially my partner George Wason. I came from an essentially non&hyphen;political upbringing, spending my early childhood in Quirindi, New South Wales, before moving to Canberra when I was six years old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to thank my Labor Party and union colleagues and my friends, all of whom have given me strength and confidence. I also thank them for sharing this occasion with me. My children Alexandra and Annabelle, whom I hope, with the pursuance of the family friendly environment up here on Capital Hill, will only be affected in positive ways by their mother's choice to enter federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many others who have played a pivotal role in my life. One of those is Rod Driver who, against the best advice, took a risk and employed me as a union organiser in the building and construction industry. Thank you, Rod: your faith in me changed my life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ideals pursued by the union movement of equality in society and a fair go for all epitomise the Australian psyche. The sense of purpose that comes with improving the lot of others was something that I could not, and will not, let go. Unions, through their collective campaigns, have secured over a very long period of time many improvements for working people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a saying that I would like to share. For a worker to refuse to belong to a union is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not to exercise a democratic freedom; it is to accept benefits that others have worked for without contributing to the costs. Democracy flourishes only when freedom is accompanied by responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the achievements in occupational health and safety standards, hours of work, wage rates, superannuation, long service leave, family leave, and the vast array of other award provisions that union members have worked so hard for that have shaped Australian workplaces. These achievements have only been possible because of our sensible industrial relations legislation. I am talking about legislation that has taken nearly a century to evolve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Act provides for both an equitable forum in which all industrial parties&mdash;employees and employers alike&mdash;can resolve their differences as well as an environment which recognises the right of working people to unite and use their collective strength to protect their family's standard of living. Even employer associations admit that Labor's industrial relations system does work well. The awards provide the benchmark for employment standards and they must be protected. The achievements of unions are embodied in the awards and to lose them, as is proposed by the coalition, would unravel a century of effort by working people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has and always will recognise this effort. Also, Labor has embodied a commonsense approach to the prevention of workplace illness and injury by way of legislation that involved all parties in the determination and implementation of minimum safety standards. The various state&mdash;and now federal&mdash;coalition governments have subsequently moved to systematically dismantle this tripartite approach to health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With 500 workplace deaths and thousands of injuries occurring each year I question their priorities. Surely the health and safety of all Australians must be first and foremost in the minds of all legislators. I would like to take this opportunity to put on the public record my support for the initiatives taken to put in place very strong gun control laws in Australia, and I express my deepest sympathy for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="449"> tragic events that have unfolded in Tasmania in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, as Australians, can no longer take for granted the standard of living and conditions of employment that we have become used to. Working people will need to enlighten themselves very quickly as to the strategies and support available to them through the union movement in the face of what will be a systematic erosion of their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an unfortunate thing that political awareness is often triggered as a result of a problem occurring, whether it be in one's personal or professional life, and it is therefore crucial that initiatives such as the civics educational program attract bipartisan support. This program aims to empower everyone, regardless of their age, ethnicity or class, with knowledge about the Australian political system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I predict that many people will have their political awareness raised over the next few years. I have already seen the ranks of the Australian Labor Party swelling as a direct response to the uncaring, unfair and undemocratic industrial relations policy that this coalition government is espousing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own involvement in politics was something that emerged from my experience of working on building sites. Before that, I was like many other young people: pretty cynical about politics. This cynicism must be addressed by all of us. We can all assist in restoring public faith in the political processes by being true to our policies and to ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This is a big ask, but I for one am determined to earn the respect of the people I represent by contributing to the fair and effective public debate of issues which directly affect the quality of lives of Australian families. The issues we, as senators, will discuss and decide are the very issues which will determine what sort of life my daughters, and indeed the next generation, will experience. My vision has been formed by the proud tradition of Labor principles expressed and refined over a century&mdash;a tradition which values actions above words and which, quite frankly, is offended by the attitude inherent in a profit first, people last ideology. It is Labor's ability to act decisively that distin guishes us from the other parties&mdash;our ability to put in place fair policies that go to the very heart of the just society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The achievements of Labor in the form of Medicare, the social security safety net, affordable and accessible child care, school retention rates, Aboriginal reconciliation, the accord, universal superannuation, the forest conservation reserve system, coast and land care, law reform, APEC and providing a vision for the Australian republic have all contributed to the shaping of our identity as a community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for sustainable jobs is at the forefront of public concern and has seen Labor implement comprehensive strategies, such as Working Nation, as a means of addressing this basic right of employment. Labor puts job creation and job security at the top of our list of priorities. We saw this proud legacy being adopted by the coalition during the election campaign in its desperation to win government. Subsequently, we have seen the same legacy tossed out the window as the coalition settles into its real agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this ideology which will alienate this government from the people. Dry economic rhetoric and conservative propaganda promoting the new individualism will not fool the electorate. It will only serve to remind voters of the high price they are being forced to pay under the coalition. People of my generation who are experiencing adult life under a coalition government for the first time will quickly appreciate, if they have not already, the crystal clear distinction between the major parties. The Australian Labor Party has learnt the hard way the importance of genuine communication with the electorate, and we will go back to the people because our Labor ideology is based on equity, not elitism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Information and how it is communicated are major determinants of power in our society. Many people have little restriction on their ability to convey their views, but there are also many disadvantaged members of our community who, through circumstances beyond their control, find it very difficult to have their voice heard. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that all groups in our society have the public means and the opportunity to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="450"> form their views without media bias and to be able to express them freely. The importance of public policy relating to the use and control of credible information sources and its increasingly complex delivery technologies cannot be underestimated if we are serious about equitable and affordable access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the year 2000 the information sector will be the world's second largest industry. Those nations that develop the infrastructure necessary for this industry to flourish are the nations that will prosper into the next millennium. Infrastructure is not just cable and microwave dishes; it is an education and training system which can increase people's skills in developing software and creating useful content. Already in Australia information and information related activities employ more than 40 per cent of the work force and generate 36 per cent of gross domestic product, and this can only improve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">High quality communications, widespread computer usage and literacy, and a willingness to use modern engineering technologies will be essential ingredients in our economic wellbeing. However, I am not yet convinced that we have sufficiently analysed and discussed the societal and community effects of this shift in our economic base. For example, although the need to take this technology to rural Australia is well recognised, have we explored the long&hyphen;term impact on the economies of country towns? The geography of Australia provides special challenges in terms of access to information infrastructure; challenges that can be met only in a policy framework with priorities of equal access, universal service and that which puts the needs of Australians&mdash;both suppliers and consumers&mdash;first. The best way of ensuring this is through public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need only to look to Canberra, the nation's capital and my home, to see the rewards that come from investing in information technology and what it brings to a government administration. There is no doubt that this investment in technology has been a major contributor to the increases in efficiency achieved by the public sector, and to cut expenditure in this area would be short&hyphen;sighted and foolish.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canberra bashing has long been a hobby for the coalition. Uncharacteristically, the government restricted its rhetoric during the election campaign and implied to the people of Canberra that public sector job losses would be restricted to 2,500 positions with no forced redundancies. With every passing day, however, the list of cuts grows longer. Now I believe that even the Real Estate Institute of Australia in the Australian Capital Territory is begging the ministers to curb their lust for job cuts. I know that many of my Senate colleagues understand as well as I do the kind of negative impact this will have on our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been inundated with letters and calls from people who are living in real fear of being declared `excess'. The impact upon themselves, their personal morale and their families is devastating. These are the people at the front line of the government's harsh, dry political prescriptions, but they are not the only ones that will be affected. The quality of service delivery for every Australian in need will be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been a long time since Canberra was a one&hyphen;company town, but the private sector here is still very concerned about the impact of reduced government spending on our local economy. Small businesses are particularly susceptible to reductions in consumer demand. There is no doubt that the private sector is much stronger than it has been in the past and is innovative in promoting regional development opportunities. However, coupled with the proposed cuts in the area of Canberra's fastest growing private sector industry, it will be impossible to quarantine the loss of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Canberra is a community as rich and diverse as any other Australian community. The fact that it is the nation's capital and home to the federal parliament is something we are proud of, not something we should be penalised or punished for. Canberra is my community and I represent the ordinary people: the people who are working or trying to work; the people who are caring for others and those that they care for; young people who are hopeful for the future and those that are in despair; older people, active in retirement or in need of care themselves; and, of course, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="451"> children whose future is in our hands. My job is to represent these people in a way that unites us rather than divides us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you would not mind. I want to talk about something that has exercised the minds of many people here for a while, and that is the issue of the mandate. It has been claimed, on behalf of the coalition, that they have a mandate. It is quite clear that the coalition won a most handsome victory at the last election and that they therefore have the right to govern. That is crystal clear.

That is the proposition that is put: that the people have spoken and, having spoken, that the coalition are entitled not only to form a government but to have passed all that legislation that touches upon the policies that they introduced at the last election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon has made the interjection that I think shows up what needs to be talked about. Senator MacGibbon, who I heard speak before when he said some very wise things about the Defence Force, is very perceptive in putting forward the arguments that ought to be put forward. He said very graphically, `We got about five million votes; you got about four million votes. That is the end of the matter. That is the mandate.' What that gives you, Senator MacGibbon, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is this: the right to govern; the right to form the ministry; the right to select the person who will be Prime Minister, the political head of the administration&mdash;and you have done that&mdash;and the right to have the policies that you put forward be the policies that the administration follow in administering the country. There is no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the proposition you put. You are going a bit further than that. The proposition you put is this: that we, on this side of the chamber, should agree with whatever legislation you put forward that in some way touches upon the policies you put forward at the last election. Specifically what you talk about is Telstra. You say you made it clear, which you did, that as a government you were going to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra&mdash;you were going to bring legislation down to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your proposition was that, since you have five million votes to our four million votes, we should pass that legislation. This is in spite of the fact that the parliament, as defined under the constitution, is so constituted in this place now that you are unable to do that unless this side of the Senate gives way to the proposition that it does not matter what the constitution says, what the conventions are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="452"> or what the numbers on this side are, or what our conscience is, what our beliefs are and what we put forward in the election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the sale of Telstra is part of a budget bill and you are not able to keep government going without that sale, to take your proposition, then I think you are entitled to have sufficient money to keep government going. But that does not mean that you have the right in your budget bills to claim money for whatever you want. All that you have the right to do according to your budget is to get sufficient money to continue the usual functions of government. The sale of Telstra is not, may I say, necessary for you to continue the proper functions of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to put this proposition: say you have a budget and the sale of Telstra, just for the sake of argument, was necessary for you to carry on the functions of government, but you had an alternative such as increasing taxation and we were willing to put through such bills, then you would have to take that alternative rather than the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking now about the issue of mandates. There is a distinction to be drawn between mandates and conventions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do want to know what Mr Howard said about it. I will come to that. It is a convention, too, that the Governor&hyphen;General, for example, takes the advice of the Prime Minister and of the properly constituted government of the country. It is a convention to which this country needs to adhere to run properly that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Governor&hyphen;General, on a matter which affects the government, should consult the government and the Prime Minister. Those are conventions. The danger of not adhering to those conventions was illustrated in 1975 when the Governor&hyphen;General did not consult the then Prime Minister on an issue that very much affected the government of the day.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  They are conventions but they are certainly different from a mandate. Indeed, the word `mandate' is not mentioned in the constitution but the concept of parliament is. It is mentioned in part I, section 1 of the constitution and it reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which will consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is here&hyphen;in after called "The Parliament," or "The Parliament of the Commonwealth."</PARA>
<PARA>If the government of the day cannot get its legislation through the parliament, it cannot overbear the express provisions of the constitution by saying, `Look, we should have the legislative power. The legislative power of the Commonwealth should not be in the parliament, it should be in our mandate.' That is a proposition that has been put forward again and again recently and it is a proposition that cannot stand, by the very express words of the constitution. A mandate cannot overcome a convention and it certainly cannot overcome a constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people may say&mdash;and it is not only the government that says this; many commentators say it&mdash;that the parliament should ignore the express directions it is given, the express power that is given in the constitution, and should somehow pass the legislation that is put up by the other side simply because that legislation was much canvassed during the campaign. Clearly that cannot be done. The constitution clearly says it is not right to do that. We would be failing in our obligation under the constitution if we were to give way to legislation about which we had great doubts. If we think it ought to be opposed, it would be wrong to nevertheless let it through because there was this concept of mandate.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Armed as it is by the Constitution with extensive powers, it is in the judgment of the Senate of the day to decide whether or not to insist on any of its legislative amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives, or in certain cases to refuse to pass a bill at all. As such power should be used circumspectly and wisely, factors which the Senate may take into account in reaching such decisions include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A recognition of the fact that the House of Representatives represents in its entirety the most recent choice of the people whereas, because of the system of rotation of senators and except in the case of simultaneous dissolution of the two Houses, one&hyphen;half of the Senate reflects an earlier poll.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The principle that in a bicameral parliament one house shall be a check upon the power of the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Whether the matter in dispute is a question of principle for which the government may claim a mandate or electoral approval; if so, the Senate may yield. The Senate is unlikely to resist legislation in respect of which a government can truly claim explicit electoral endorsement, but the test is always likely to be the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>What is said there, Senator O'Chee, and I have great respect for your constitutional knowledge, is this: a mandate is certainly a factor that you have to take into account as a parliament, that we have to take into account as a Senate, but it is not the determining factor. It is one of the factors and, in any event, is always overridden by what the Senate would regard as the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People such as Senator Kernot, who has been much criticised in here, has said that again and again. It is enshrined in the words of Mr Odgers, a very distinguished clerk and the teacher of many distinguished clerks, deputy clerks and assistant clerks in this place. So the arguments on mandate put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forward in this chamber, in the other chamber and generally in the public, ought to be seen in that light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, it has often been said that, because half the Senate were elected this year and all the House of Representatives were elected this year, those people elected have a greater right as legislators than others here who were elected in 1993. If you are going into the generational distinction then you have to ask yourself: if it is generation that determines whether legislation goes through, then what do we do about a bill like the one covering the sale of Telstra? If Telstra is sold, it is sold forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Say future generations of legislators come into this place with a mandate from people who, if they had had the opportunity, would have preserved Telstra. What will they do once it is gone? On this argument about generational prerogatives, would it not then be unjust that the present generation of politicians determine the decision area of future politicians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale of Telstra cannot be argued on the basis of a mandate given in the last election, because the sale of Telstra will affect not only this generation of parliamentarians but also future generations of Australians and people who will want to then use it. The only proper way to analyse this in the end is to ask what the parliament wants to do. As the constitution says, the parliament consists of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Queen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overriding a mandate, indeed, overriding the parliament itself, is the concept of the rule of law. This is something we ought to think about. A learned judge in the last century in Victoria, Mr Justice Molesworth, in a case called Dill v. Murphy, or Murphy v. Dill&mdash;I forget now which name comes first&mdash;talked about parliament being `despotic'. For example, take the situation in Victoria now. I think Mr Justice Brooking referred to this in a case that he was deciding where in that state there was a question as to whether or not the parliament was a despot. I do not say that in the sense that it was evil but that it was despotic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have anybody, whether elected or not, who has despotic powers, then there is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="454"> certainly the opportunity for injustice, the opportunity to exercise arbitrary power. I think one of the annual reports of the Supreme Court of Victoria uses the phrase, `the risk of corruption' if you have an uncontrolled despotic power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The way to get over this problem and have some sort of control over the exercise of power is the concept of the rule of law. That concept has been exercised more in the federal field than in the state field. In the federal field, the High Court has applied this concept of saying there is an overarching principle above the principle that parliament can do whatever it legislates to do. The cases of free speech at a political level give examples of that proposition at a federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the concept of the rule of law, everybody is treated equally and everybody has the opportunity to approach the courts of law and have access to the fundamentals of life in food, shelter, warmth and what have you. Lots of those concepts are relevant when talking about Telstra, which seems to have been spoken about a lot today and previously. One of the great issues of debate on the sale of Telstra concerns the universal service that is now given to people around Australia. Some people get the service at a lot less than the real cost and other people pay more but, as has been said by both Senator Mackay and Senator Lundy, the principle operates that everybody in Australia is part of the community and the concept comes to the fore whereby some people give up something that they might otherwise be entitled to for the good of others who are more entitled to those fundamentals provided by this rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of where the rule of law applies&mdash;and this is going to be a matter of great debate in this chamber over the next few months&mdash;is in relation to the issue of industrial relations. The industrial relations argument will be based on the concepts of society and what they mean. Are we going to embrace the principle of contracts between two people or between one group and another on the basis that people can work out what they want and then that will be enshrined in the contract and that is the end of the matter, or are we going to embrace the principle that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there is a difference in strength in the bargaining positions of people and that there is great danger where there is this difference that one person will be overborne by another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going right back to the statute of labourers, which was made 600&hyphen;odd years ago, there was this concept that an agreement was the be all and end all. Since that time, this concept has led to great injustices. One of the great institutions to overcome that injustice is the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to read documents these days that used to be considered quite conservative.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During consideration of documents, Senator Bolkus spoke to me about a quote. I have been quoting Odgers and others. In relation to the issue of the mandate, Senator Bolkus pointed out that perhaps one of the great authorities in this area is the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard). The quote comes from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of 15 September 1987. I think it is a very profound statement. This is what the now Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By any measure of any politician with any experience, the majority of the Australian people have turned against the identity card.</PARA>
<PARA>This was the Australia card at the time. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Prime Minister and Government members doubt our assessment of this, if they really believe that the Australian people have bought their argument about people opposing the card being the friends of tax dodgers, why do they not put that belief to a test at a referendum and not hide behind the argument that there is some kind of mandate out of the last election? That suggestion is invalid not only in terms of the number of votes cast but also on the simple proposition that when people vote at an election they do not vote on only one issue. The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney.</PARA>
<PARA>I could only agree with that, because people vote for the parties in an election for a variety of reasons. They might vote because they think it is time for the government to change. They might vote because they like the coalition more than they like Labor. They might vote for one policy put forward by a party and, although they do not like the other policies of that party, they think on balance they ought to vote for them. So there are a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> variety of things affecting the way people vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless you can establish that the majority of people voted for the specific policy that you are saying you have a mandate for&mdash;and Mr Howard is absolutely right when he says that you cannot; that is the inference drawn from his words&mdash;the whole proposition is an absolute phoney. Senators Jacinta Collins and Bolkus would agree that that is an absolutely phoney proposition. I am indebted to Senator Bolkus for giving that quote to me. It does sum up the argument well, and I would be inclined to think the government, having heard that proposition put by the leader, will now&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rule of law is put forward on the issue of morality, and you would agree with that, Senator Watson. There are a lot of moral principles that we have to return to, such as the issue of looking at people as they should be looked at. As I said before, people are entitled to the wherewithal of life, to equality and to protection from events such as the recent dreadful one that happened in your state, Senator Watson. They are the sorts of things we should be paying more attention to, rather than having us come in here and persistently talk about economics. I am not saying for one minute that we should not talk in economic terms&mdash;finding the right way to run the economy is absolutely essential to the proper happiness of the Australian people and an absolutely vital function of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is that there are a lot of additional issues that we do not look at enough in this parliament. Issues of morality, issues of the rule of law, issues of what people are all about and issues of what society should be all about are essential. I am glad to see that the legal and constitutional committee, ably chaired by Senator Ellison, has brought forward a document that deals <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="456"> with the issue of how we should start measuring social issues in addition to the economic ones.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.56 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 March Australia elected a new government to manage the nation's affairs. I was very interested in some of Senator Cooney's remarks about mandates, and I may return to that in a few minutes. I take it that the nature of this debate, the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech, has indicated the significance of this change in government, because a change in government is an event that is fairly rare in Australian politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had 13 years of Labor government, and that government of course failed as judged by the electorate. The judgment was pretty harsh and unforgiving, and the vote for change was overwhelming. Hundreds of thousands of Australians who habitually voted for the Labor Party turned against them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very significant that, in this election, we won every significant group. Youth, aged, men, women, ethnic groups and the blue-collar vote, in the majority, turned to the Liberal Party. Australia at this election showed that it had had a gutful of a tired, out of touch and arrogant government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later I will address a number of reasons for this change, but I want to concentrate briefly on the significance of a change that has occurred only five times in 50 years. On average, Australia has changed its government every decade. Since World War II, the changes federally have been only in 1949, 1972, 1975, 1983 and now in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The power of the ballot box was certainly felt by the federal Labor members. We have with the Howard government a 45-seat majority, the third largest in the electoral history of the Commonwealth, and Labor's other discredited years in 1975 and 1977 were the only defeats that were greater. It is interesting to note that, when Labor loses power, it does not lose it in any small way. Voters have ousted Labor governments in the last seven decades, and all of them have been trounced in the polls&mdash;Scullin in 1931, Chifley in 1949, Whitlam in 1975 and now Keating in 1996. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extent of Labor's defeat can be seen very clearly in my own state of New South Wales. Nineteen Liberal candidates and 10 National Party candidates won federal seats. The coalition won 50 per cent of the Senate seats in New South Wales, and the Howard government now holds 29 of the 50 House of Representatives seats. Labor is without representation in rural and regional New South Wales. Liberal women played a vital role in this victory. Danna Vale in Hughes, Joanna Gash in Gilmore and Jackie Kelly in Lindsay have joined the swelling tide of Liberal members in this parliament, and soon in the Senate we will be joined by Senator elect Helen Coonan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has this massive change taken place? It is instructive to examine why the Australian people have delivered such a devastating blow to the Labor Party. But before I go on to mention the reasons for this I want to come back to Senator Cooney's point about a mandate, because it is very significant to what will be happening in this chamber over the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Westminster system that we all work under has a protocol that indicates that, if a party gets more than 50 per cent of the seats in the lower house, it is the government and it has the mandate to govern for the next few years. We were delivered an overwhelming majority. We have over a 45&hyphen;seat majority. We set out our program very clearly. Our program on Telstra was set out clearly. Our program on IR was set out very clearly. Our environment program was set out very clearly. Yet here in this chamber there are parties, even minor ones who claim they have a great belief in improvement of the environment, just about to block all that. And on what basis?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot keeps claiming she has something called a `counter mandate'. I majored in government in my first degree and I have never heard anything about counter mandates. This is an invention of the last few weeks&mdash;a very convenient invention. Parties that get around five per cent of the vote do not have counter mandates, particularly&mdash;I want to address the central thrust of Senator Cooney's point here&mdash;if in this election and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="457"> in this chamber the government gets 50 per cent of the seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I went to school, 50 per cent was a pass, and we have received a pass in the Senate. We have 50 per cent of the seats. We have an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives. We got 50 per cent of the Senate seats when people voted in 1996. On that basis, there can be no moral argument whatsoever by the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and anyone else who wants to argue for a counter mandate that any such thing exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people voted for change at the last federal election. They voted for overwhelming change. It behoves this chamber to listen to the will of the people, which is for change. I want to go through a number of areas where people desperately want change. In this address&hyphen;in&hyphen;reply debate, I want to point out a number of the major failures of the Labor government over the last 13 years and the programs that the Howard government will introduce to correct those problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's most glaring error&mdash;it is certainly for the Labor Party the most humiliating error&mdash;is in the area of unemployment. I want to speak about unemployment, the former government's failure in regional Australia and their failure in communications policy, but at this stage I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA>The reason for this amendment is that the word `practicable' can be considered as enabling unspecified commercial considerations relating to profitability to dictate and take precedence over sound environmental practice. `Practicable' is a word that implicitly leaves up to an incumbent what is practicable and what is not.

<PARA>Mr Temporary Chairman, you may have been unaware but in our discussions with regard to the Greens' amendment No. 1 I did rehearse those arguments and I am hoping not to delay the chamber too much. However I will reiterate that, in going to the substance of our amendment with regard to page 14, item 27, section 4G, again this whole section may sound attractive and may have many of the right words in it, but its effect is to give the minister extraordinary discretionary powers, according to the circumstances, to decide whether something is hazardous or not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, again, a government which was serious about this would recognise that hazardous waste is hazardous waste and that it is not made any less hazardous by the consideration of the profitability of a company or by other expediencies which may come into play. If it is hazardous, it is hazardous and it does not need to be redefined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our purpose in opposing this particular area is to not allow that ministerial discretion to be used, and used in ways which we can predict&mdash;in ways which allow the greater imposition of hazardous waste upon areas, especially in foreign countries, where it is not necessary, where it is not appropriate and where it is not desirable.

If you are going to have an article 11 agreement mechanism, which is set up under the original convention, you have to have procedures by which it can be ordered.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vitally important that we bring to the attention of the public the duplicity of Labor's campaign. Labor has been asking the people to believe them about Telstra. But, of course, all throughout the last election campaign the Australian Labor Party quite deceitfully circulated within electorates around Australia mock telephone bills, using&mdash;unlawfully, I would suggest&mdash;the Telstra logo and symbol. More importantly, there was the unauthorised use of the ACN number which has been allocated to Telstra Corporation Ltd. Indeed, the mock bills were circulated to such an extent and provided such a degree of concern within the community that Telstra itself found it necessary to issue media releases dissociating itself from this dishonest campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, within Tasmania, especially within the electorate of Lyons, this was used to an art form by the Australian Labor Party. I believe that this quite dishonest campaign allowed the sitting Labor member to win that seat. Telstra, three days before the election, put out a media release entitled `Mock bills concern Telstra.' It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra Corporation Limited today repeated its concern about imitation Telstra bills being circulated as election campaign material.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned that comments from customers indicate many believe use of or a representation of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="460"> Telstra's logo and/or wordmark indicate Telstra endorsement or approval of election material.</PARA>
<PARA>That was clearly within the minds of the Australian Labor Party operatives, people such as the then state secretary of the Labor Party in Tasmania, Sue Mackay, in their campaign to try to let the electorate believe that these brochures were in fact authorised by Telstra when clearly they were not so authorised. They caused confusion within the electorate and I believe unwittingly allowed the Labor member for Lyons to retain his seat. However, the people of Tasmania will be continually reminded of the dishonesty of the Labor Party campaign concerning Telstra and their allegations which were, quite astoundingly, repeated in one of the first speeches that we heard this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allegation about network charges, quite clearly, is false. There is no basis for it. There is no foundation for that assertion in any shape or form. In fact, during the election campaign, I publicly challenged the Labor Party to come out with their documentation in support of the various prices that they were alleging would be incurred by way of a network charge. Of course, not a single Labor person responded to that challenge. The dishonesty of the campaign concerning Telstra is highlighted in view of the fact that the Labor Party itself ran these sorts of campaigns against the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank, the Federal Airports Corporation and Qantas&mdash;and the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Labor Party's former leader have to say about Telstra when asked on ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> in 1994 whether it mattered if Telstra was publicly or privately owned. The then Prime Minister said, `Of its essence, it mattered nothing.' Former powerbroker, Graham Richardson, who in fact allowed Paul Keating to become Prime Minister, at pages 305 and 306 of his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS> writes about the proposal concerning Telecom. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This wimpish proposal did not satisfy Paul Keating, who wanted to go much further and sell off Telecom into the bargain.</PARA>
<PARA>It has always been part of Paul Keating's agenda&mdash;exactly the same as the GST. And now, the federal secretary of the Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party all of a sudden is starting to say, `Look, let's think about this. A GST might be a good idea.' All of a sudden, the Labor Party are embracing this policy; similarly, I suggest, with Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was Paul Keating's idea to sell off Telstra, the whole lot of it. He went to an election campaign saying, `Oh, no, we can't sell any of it.' I am sure within a few years Labor will do the full circle yet again and say, `How about selling it off?' The Labor Party campaign and, might I add, the Australian Democrats' campaign in relation to Telstra, is quite disingenuous. Today, we were submitted to a ridiculous matter, allegedly of public importance, criticising us for not strictly abiding by every actual policy initiative with which we had gone to the election. I would have thought there was no clearer policy than our policy on Telstra. If the Labor Party and the Democrats, who supported the Labor Party, clearly want us to follow every single election issue that we went to the people with, they would support us on Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they do not want to. Why not? They want us to stick to all our election promises, but they do not want us to stick to them if it suits them. The duplicity of the Labor Party and indeed the Australian Democrats is further shown in relation to their stance on industrial relations. We campaigned very effectively on the unfair dismissal law. The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats went to the people opposing us on that. Now, after the election, the Labor Party and the Democrats are seriously considering their position. They are saying, `We may well go along with the Liberal Party on this.' They themselves will be breaking the promises they made to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, former senator Bob McMullan is now on record as saying, the chances are, if Labor ever got re-elected, they would never re&hyphen;enter into an accord with the trade union movement. The Labor Party and the Democrats have to be made to be honest and accountable in relation to their criticism of us on policy issues and also when they look at themselves on policy issues.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="461">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is very clear. The Liberal&hyphen;National Party coalition received on overwhelming mandate in relation to the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra. We have a mandate for it. For the Labor Party and the Democrats to combine, yet again, to oppose us on this issue would in effect mean that they will not allow us to remain truthful to the election policies that we went to the people with. I look forward to the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats doing a U-turn on Telstra in the same way that they have done on unfair dismissals.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tragedy which occurred last week in Port Arthur has loomed large in every Australian's heart and mind. I too wish to express my deepest sorrow to the families and all the people who were associated with that tragedy in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But something else happened at the time we were all still reeling from the events in Tasmania that moved me in an intensely personal way. I speak of the death of Rob Riley. I would take the opportunity here to just speak very briefly of this man and his death, news of which came on Wednesday, 1 May. This afternoon we were able to pass a formal motion of condolence to Rob Riley's family and friends and express our support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is highly appropriate that the Senate should commemorate the tragedy of the loss of yet another young Aboriginal person&mdash;a loss not only to his own people but to everyone who knew him. The tragedy of that loss can be seen as an expression of the sadness and shame of the early death of so many leaders among Aboriginal people which comes as a result of over 200 years of our failure to really recognise the rights of indigenous people and what has been done to them during the time of colonisation. May we look to the day when Aboriginal people can expect to live to a ripe old age in a society which accepts and honours them and shares the wisdom of their ancient culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I express my condolences to Rob's family, to all his friends and people in Western <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia in particular who mourn his loss. Rob Riley, a former chairman of the National Aboriginal Council, was a wonderful expression of the call for social justice and the cry for justice for his people. It was very fitting that on Saturday the Canberra Aboriginal Church called the nation to prayer for justice by organising a prayer vigil just outside Parliament House. I believe that it is symbolic events of this kind that will transform the face of Australian society into looking to addressing the kinds of underlying causes of not only the tragedy in Tasmania but also the tragedy that many Aboriginal people have suffered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A statement and invitation was issued by Flo Grant, Secretary of the Canberra Aboriginal Church, in association with the Wiradjuri Christian Development Ministries and Elder of the Wiradjuri Council of Elders. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Rally was put into progress two weeks ago. We now extend our sympathies to the people of Tasmania and express how very sorry we feel about the dreadful tragedy of last Sunday. We will be adding the family and friends of those who lost their lives, were injured and traumatised by this dreadful time to the prayer points of the Prayer for Justice rally on Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure I speak for all Aboriginal people as well as the churches.</PARA>
<PARA>In that rally for justice there was a most powerful statement read out which was called The Power of the Gun. In a few moments I will seek leave to have that statement incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just a few more words about the reason for the calling of that rally, because I believe it is something that Rob Riley lived for and would have liked to see continue and be advanced. Despite the sorrow people feel for his death, I am sure that he would want us to remember the wonderful things he did and to be able to work for that change within our society. I would like to keep working for that in response to the sorrow of the loss of his life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the pray for justice rally, some very pertinent statements were made in relation to what Aboriginal people have been feeling in the last few weeks about the kinds of comments that have been generated in the political arena. The statement of the call to prayer for justice states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="462">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal people of this land continue to be at the mercy of politicians who only see us as `the Aboriginal problem' and began throwing money to infrastructures of their making from 1967 to address this problem. They continually promote us as a drain on the national economy&mdash;with no recognition of our dispossession of this great continent and their responsibility as the dispossessors.</PARA>
<PARA>To continue quoting from that statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The newly elected government is also continuing to talk reconciliation whilst Aboriginal people hold grave concern about the effects of what we see as an attack on all Aboriginal people by the government as it scrutinises the integrity of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) without intimation or consultation. This action has Aboriginal people divided and talk back radio and other media programs tell us the opinions of the wider Australian society regarding Aboriginal people and issues such as Native Title, land rights and compensation for Aboriginal dispossession. The arrogant attitude portrayed is far from progressing toward reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA>As a response to those concerns, people were called together to work in a positive way for change, requesting consideration and consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to conclude my remarks by reading a portion of the Aboriginal tribute to the deaths in Tasmania and seek leave to incorporate the balance. The tribute reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal Australia, along with every Australian, is shocked and distressed by the cruel and heartless massacre of defenceless men, women and children at Port Arthur, Tasmania. Sunday, April 28th will always be remembered as a tragic day in our history. Thank God for those who survived the gunman! For sure, he meant to kill them all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our prayers and condolences are with all who experienced the violence and will suffer the trauma for the rest of their lives. Aboriginal people know only too well the trauma of having suffered violence at the hands of others. The Myall Creek and Murdering Island massacres are examples among many across the country where whole families, indeed complete tribes, were entirely wiped out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard and his government are to be encouraged and assisted in every way to secure better and more uniform gun control laws&mdash;those who use the gun to kill in vengeance or for sport ought to be despised by all right minded men. But gun control is not the complete answer, Mr Howard! As you well know, governments must deal truthfully and wisely with the injustices and inequities still far too prevalent throughout our country causing many to become frustrated and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> angry and the irrational few to resort to the violence seen in Melbourne, Sydney and now Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the remaining paragraphs of this statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . I express my appreciation of the people who met at the rally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will never know deliverance, nor real reconciliation, until we sincerely face the fact that this continent was taken by: "The power of the gun", which commenced on the 26th January 1788. Others came in peace and left peacefully, but the British came intent on annexing an entire continent. We as a Nation will never be rid of the blame, or the shame, until we face the truth of the past 208 years and deliver real justice to the surviving remnants of those first invaded Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Justice for all Australians is tied unavoidably to justice for Aboriginal Australians. The fact that Aboriginal people have not resorted to violence upon others in their struggle for justice, as in other parts of the world, is a tribute to their patient and peaceful nature. They would sooner inflict violence upon themselves, eg. Aboriginal deaths in custody and a growing number of suicides are of great concern to us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The God to whom we rightly turn for comfort in times of sorrow is the same God who demands that all men everywhere deal justly with each other.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Northern Territory)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment debate this evening to refer to a matter concerning the Prime Minister's code of conduct for ministers. I was grossly misrepresented by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives today. I hope that the Prime Minister's gross misrepresentation of what I said was not deliberate. I will take the trouble to fax to the Prime Minister the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of my remarks tonight and the transcript of last night's ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  program. These two documents will make it abundantly clear to the Prime Minister just how badly he misrepresented me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn firstly to the comments that the Prime Minister made concerning Senator Herron. In a statement he made in the House of Representatives today he appeared to clarify the position that I have been taking on this issue. The Prime Minister said this:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="463">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Herron obviously has some patients who are in his care. I think it is only plain commonsense that he be allowed to see some of those through. The idea that you suddenly drop a patient on whom you have operated the previous week because you have become a minister is ridiculous. Anybody who argues that is even more ridiculous. That is the first part of the question I have answered.</PARA>
<PARA>As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;you were here&mdash;not only did I not suggest anything so absurd, but it was explicit in the question I put to Senator Herron that I was not suggesting that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  will indicate that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as we all know, that is not what Senator Herron was seeking to do. He made it clear here in the parliament and on television interviews that he wanted to continue&mdash;for some years into the future, presumably&mdash;a continuous practice in surgery on new patients. It was a situation that he described as being `weekend hobby surgery'. They were Senator Herron's words, not mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the Prime Minister stated explicitly in the House of Representatives today that he has ruled that out. Having misquoted what I said, the Prime Minister goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second part is that there is no question at all of Senator Herron continuing a medical practice&mdash;and I have made that perfectly clear to him. He will be a full&hyphen;time minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, Mr Acting Deputy President, the Prime Minister must have made that clear to Senator Herron some time between question time in the House of Representatives yesterday and now. Clearly Senator Herron had not received that message yesterday and he was still arguing the case forcefully in the Senate that the position he would put to the Prime Minister at the end of this month would be that he could be a part&hyphen;time Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and a `weekend hobby surgeon'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister now has to be responsible for some of the extraordinary assertions that Senator Herron cast at me across this chamber. In response to the questions that I asked about ministerial accountability, Senator Herron claimed that the opposition was attempting to force him to choose between <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> representing the interests of Aboriginal Australians and the interests of his surgical patients. He went so far as to suggest that I would be putting his surgery support staff out of work if I forced him to make the decision to give up surgery. Well, as it happens, the Prime Minister has made it abundantly clear that that was a nonsensical assertion by Senator Herron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Prime Minister who tabled this code of conduct for ministers in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. I might add that this code of conduct goes all the way down the line to include parliamentary secretaries as well as ministers. I will have something to say about the absurdity of that at a later stage. It is not parliamentary secretaries who argue submissions in cabinet and therefore put themselves in direct conflict with interest situations. It is ministers who do that. Nevertheless, this was the code of conduct that Mr Howard produced with a great flourish. He said it was the first time that this had ever been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the misrepresentation by Mr Howard in respect of Mr John Anderson. Once again I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> where the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me come to the allegations, if you can dignify them with such a description, that have been made by Senator Collins about the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Apparently, in some way, it is wrong to be a primary producer and a minister. That is the proposition implicit in what Senator Collins said.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, I said nothing so absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In what I said on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program last night and here in parliament, I was not suggesting that because he was a primary producer John Anderson should not be a cabinet minister. What I said was that, as minister for primary industry, he clearly was in breach&mdash;and remains in breach&mdash;of the code issued by the Prime Minister. As Minister for Social Security he would not be in breach of it; as minister for health he would not be in breach of it; as Minister for Resources he would not be in breach of it. But as minister for primary industry he is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have with me a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet handbook</EMPHASIS> that I operated under for the whole <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="464"> time I was a minister. This is a document produced by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which is updated from time to time. This document binds, properly, all ministers to a code of behaviour. The bottom line of this code is that being a federal minister is a full&hyphen;time job and you cannot even appear to have a conflict of interest between your own affairs and your responsibilities as a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A reference to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet handbook</EMPHASIS> indicates only too clearly that much of the code tabled in parliament last week has been lifted directly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet handbook</EMPHASIS>. The relevant section of the code of the Prime Minister, which is copied from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet handbook</EMPHASIS>, which John Anderson is still in breach of, is contained on page 7. The reason I make this point is that both the Prime Minister and John Anderson on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Countrywide</EMPHASIS> today have attempted to wriggle out of this by saying, `Oh, there's an exception for the family farm.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Well, there is, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I suggest that they deliberately left out the second half of that paragraph which means there is an exemption for the family farm only if you are not the minister for primary industry. Again, this applies to all ministers except the minister for primary industry. A paragraph on page 10 of `A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility' says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>If you are in any doubt about it, the next paragraph is even more explicit. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know that there is any ambiguity whatsoever attached to that paragraph. I might add that those sections are taken straight from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a further requirement on ministers in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet handbook</EMPHASIS> which is an entirely appropriate one. That is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from these formal declarations, Ministers at meetings of the Ministry, Cabinet and committees must declare any private interests, pecuniary or non&hyphen;pecuniary, held by themselves or members of their immediate families in matters under discussion, where those interests conflict or might conflict with their public duty as Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say, and this is important and proper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers should adopt a broad interpretation of the requirement that they take into account the interests of family members and all interests of their own&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is correct. It should not be a narrow interpretation. If there is even a broad chance that a submission conflicts with a minister's own pecuniary interests, then he has to declare it and absent himself, as we did, from debate or discussion on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From my own recent experience as primary industries minister, I know&mdash;and I have said this in here&mdash;that I took into cabinet many submissions that were vitally important to primary producers in Australia which would have clearly had me in breach of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet handbook</EMPHASIS> had I been in the position of the current minister for primary industry. I am pleased to say that John Anderson said today on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Countrywide</EMPHASIS> that he will declare this interest and he will refrain from debate in cabinet, and even from voting, if the matter affects his interests as a beef and grain producer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that suggests&mdash;and, indeed, it is explicitly clear&mdash;is that John Anderson, by </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="465">
<PARA>definition, is going to be a less than effective Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. There is nobody that can carry a debate in cabinet better than you can yourself. In fact, you get very nervous if someone else is doing it for you. On at least half of the major submissions that John Anderson will take into cabinet on behalf of primary producers in Australia he will be precluded from carrying that debate himself in cabinet, not only by the Prime Minister's code of conduct but by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet handbook</EMPHASIS> , which was our bible for our whole 13 years in government.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
