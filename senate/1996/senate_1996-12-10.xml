<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my speech in the second reading debate on the Telstra bill, I indicated that negotiations and discussions between the government and me had not been concluded. I also indicated that, in the weeks prior to the vote for the second reading of this bill, I sought concessions for Queensland because I considered the partial sale of Telstra to be eventually inevitable. Those negotiations and discussions I referred to in my speech have now been concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the bill had been defeated on this occasion, and again after it had been reintroduced following a three&hyphen;month delay, it would have been odds on that the government would take the opportunity to dissolve both houses. The likelihood of the government being returned with a majority in the Senate would be remote. It would have been unlikely, on the other hand, that the government would not have a majority at any subsequent joint sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The partial sale of Telstra would then become a reality. But would there be any opportunity to seek special concessions if the government had the numbers to force its proposal through, however tortuous that path may have been? The opportunities would not exist, as they similarly would not have existed if the government had decided to sell part of Telstra by non&hyphen;legislative means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have outlined before, my principal concern with a part&hyphen;privatised Telstra is the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continued employment of Telstra employees in rural and regional Queensland. I accepted the fact that technological advances would lead to staff reductions, but I was not prepared to accept that centres where telephone operators were located would close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There had been suggestions that they could close, and there was even a suggestion that 013 operators' jobs could be outsourced to the Philippines. While that would be most unlikely, the closure of operators centres in rural areas was openly canvassed. I was able to achieve the aim of operators continuing to be located in the following Queensland centres outside the Brisbane metropolitan area: Ipswich, Gold Coast, Toowoomba, Nambour, Mackay, Maryborough, Rockhampton, Roma and Cairns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second aim was to keep any reduction of operator numbers in those centres to a minimum. In accepting the number of operators who will be employed in those areas, I had to take into account that the number of operators would be reduced in other areas of Australia. To this end, the number of operators in rural Queensland will reduce by 3.4 per cent between 30 September this year and the end of June 1999, compared with a Queensland&hyphen;wide reduction of 11.5 per cent and a nationwide reduction of 13.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the agreement on the O13 operators, Telstra has agreed to locate a national directory assistance call connect customer service centre in Toowoomba. It is a new service which allows a customer to ring Telstra, ask for a person's number and be automatically connected to that person. The service will be offered from a separate access code and will attract a fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beginning in Queensland in 1998, this service will require the employment of 45 full-time staff by June 2000. These full-time operators are included in the percentage calculation of 3.4 per cent, which I have just mentioned. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a table outlining the projected levels of staff through to June 1999 in the non&hyphen;Brisbane metropolitan operator centres in Queensland</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the figures in this table, following assurances from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and Mr Blount, the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra. I realise that some honourable senators would not accept such assurances. But I do, because if assurances following negotiations are not kept, future negotiations would be of no avail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, I attach two caveats to that acceptance. First, I regard the staff figures in the table to be a minimum. Second, I believe that every senator for Queensland, and those members of the House of Representatives whose electorates include an operator assisted <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7014"> service centre, should make regular checks to ensure that the undertakings are fulfilled. I am sure that the unions representing the operators will be vigilant on the numbers employed in each centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my expectation that Telstra, as it develops its plans for the years beyond 1999, will see the benefit of employing operators in those regional centres of Queensland and will retain not only the centres in which the operators work but also the number of staff, at least at the 1999 levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further aim during my discussions on this bill was to ensure that telecommunications services in rural Queensland are, as far as is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> practically possible, equal to those available in metropolitan areas. The $250 million which the government agreed to commit from the partial sale of Telstra over a five-year period will help this to occur. Queensland's share of $53.1 million will be invaluable for its rural telecommunications customers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has said, the funds will focus on providing regional communities with additional opportunities through improved access to telecommunications infrastructure and services, increasing the amount and quality of training and educational opportunities and by providing better quality communications and information centres for regional businesses, public institutions and residents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect the funds from the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund will be distributed by an independent board created to assess applications for funding under the program. I further expect that such a board would be supported by a secretariat within the Department of Communications and the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be thought that all of the $53.1 million allocated to Queensland will be spent on capital items. It could be expected that a significant proportion will be used to provide wages, thus providing even more jobs in the rural areas of Queensland. I should imagine that similar effects will occur in other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not resile from having undertaken discussions with the government to benefit those whom I represent in this chamber. It was inevitable that Telstra would be sold, whether by legislative means or otherwise, and I would have been derelict in my duty if I were willing to forego an opportunity to achieve concessions for Queensland.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to get clarification of two things from the minister. One concerns the provisions aimed at consumer protection. What I was trying to ask previously was: why has a division 6 been put in there separately when there are already provisions in the existing act to look after consumer interests? This is indicated in schedule 1, item 5 which talks about timeliness and comprehensibility <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7015"> of the bills. That is to be put in at the end of section 38 and if you take section 38 with sections 347 to 349, that provides a code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was wondering why there is a separate division 6 for customer service guarantee and whether there is a lack of faith in the consumer provisions that are already there. If that is so, why has the government not changed them in respect of all matters, not only as to the periods of time that suppliers might take to connect, but also the quality of the service? Why are they separate issues? The other question was one which I think Senator Harradine may have the answer to.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because I want to ask the minister and Senator Harradine might want to think about this. In my previous speech I raised the problem of keeping the sale of Telstra to a third. The minister said that of course that would be so and it would be a little unusual that people would want to trade off more than a third. I would agree with those sentiments, but there are specific provisions in the proposed amendments which seem to contemplate that that might happen. I refer to proposed item 8AC which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra must take all reasonable steps to ensure that a situation described in paragraph 8AB(2)(a) . . . does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, if that does arise, Telstra will be guilty of an offence and will be convicted and fined not more than 500 penalty units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with the proposition put by the minister yesterday that it does seem strange that Telstra would get into a position where more than a third was sold. The minister assured me that that would be a ridiculous position to be in. If that is ridiculous, why is that provision in the proposed amendments? If the government wants to keep the sale to a third and no more than a third, why does it have provision 8BX which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Part.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an offence to sell more than a third of Telstra and for that Telstra can be fined if it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sells recklessly or otherwise. If the sale goes beyond a third, it does not make that sale invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One way of keeping the sale of Telstra to a third and no more than that&mdash;in other words, one way of keeping the third from going beyond a third&mdash;would be to sell it by redeemable preference shares. Then if you do go beyond a third, you can redeem them back. It seems that a suggestion has been made that a great amount of capital can be raised by selling redeemable preference shares and that would ensure that no more than a third was sold. It would save the government having to put in a section which enables a court to fine Telstra and the government would not need to go to provision 8BX.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that the government might not get as much as otherwise, but that is a matter for the markets. We do not know what we will get until we see the prospectus in any case. It seems to me that the suggestion that has been made that the government has another look at this before it goes on would make the drafting of the legislation much more comfortable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are those two issues. Why do you have a separate provision, division 6, for the customer service guarantee when you already have one? You have left the one that is there without changing it in any substance, yet you are bringing in another regime. It seems fairly contradictory. I would like you to answer the consumer protection issue, if you could, and the issue of the creep in the size of the share of Telstra that is sold.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney does address a very important issue when he asks me about the customer service guarantee. That is not in current legislation, unlike a number of other consumer safeguard arrangements such as the right to untimed local calls, price caps and the universal service obligation. The customer guarantee is something that we developed specifically in the lead-up to the last election in recognition of the fact that quite frequently the carriers, particularly Telstra, do not honour their arrangements to keep appointments <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7016"> let alone maintain and service telephones within a reasonable period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This provision is designed to ensure that they do and punish them if they do not by way of pecuniary entitlement which can, as you pointed out yesterday, be  offset against your phone bill if necessary or if it is your choice. It is an entirely new provision. It is a world first for Australia. It does have regard to practices that I have observed elsewhere, particularly in the US and the UK, but to my knowledge no-one has taken precisely this approach. I think that is one of the reasons why the Australian Democrats finally came to the conclusion that the customer protection arrangements were so good that they wanted to get those pushed through the parliament as quickly as possible. It is over and above what is there already.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As far as the general notion that you should not be able to sell more than one-third is concerned, the starting point is political reality. No-one in this parliament would contemplate for a moment standing idly by and allowing Telstra, or indeed anyone else associated with the partial sale, to blithely contravene the act. If it were necessary I would not have thought there would be any shortage of volunteers to come into the parliament and do something about it, but that will not be a problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you point out, there is already a provision that would punish Telstra to the tune of some $250,000 and would make it an illegal act if they were to consciously go beyond the one-third. A lot of consequences flow from illegal actions, as I pointed out yesterday. For example, any potential investor who entered into a contractual arrangement would be at risk of not getting their money back if they were a party to something they were aware was against the law. Senator Cooney referred me to 8BX, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Part.</PARA>
<PARA>This part is actually part 2A, which commences on page 29 of the bill. That essentially relates to restrictions on foreign ownership and the limit we are putting in place, and some of the other provisions as well including that Telstra's head office, base of operations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and place of incorporation are to remain in Australia, and that Telstra's chairman and a majority of Telstra's directors must be Australian citizens, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that in that area you can have accidental overlaps which would need to be corrected. The Qantas float was a recent classic example of that. Therefore, that provision is designed to ensure that some accidental temporary overlap does not result in an invalidation of the whole sale exercise in relation to foreign ownership. But it does not in any way refer to the overall concept of the sale. Therefore, any breach would remain a breach and would not be overlooked by reference to that provision.</PARA></SPEECH>

That section is headed `General functions&mdash;protection of public interest and consumers'. Why is new proposed division 6 confined to issues of the period that it takes to connect customers and the period that it takes to offer customers arrangements and such matters? There is a whole division on that sort of thing, yet issues of quality are left to section 38.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't you put the two concepts together?  Why do we separate the concepts?  When you say that there is not much in the way of punishment there at the moment, as I understand it, there are quite heavy penalties proposed already under civil proceedings for failing to obey Austel direction&mdash;up to $10 million, for example. All I really want to know is why you separate those two things out.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Section 38 of the existing act does relate to the quality of performance by the carrier. Therefore, there is an obligation on the carrier to provide certain information under pain of financial penalty but also to provide a deal of information which then finds its way into Austel quarterly and annual performance reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7017"> That is one of the bases upon which we have come to the view that Telstra's perform ance has been inadequate. In other words, particularly outside the metropolitan areas, we consistently find that the quality of service is declining&mdash;the length of time it takes to answer a phone call, the length of time it takes to get through to operator assisted services, the length of time it takes to get through to service difficulties and faults, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those at the moment are simply dealt with by putting them on the public record. Section 38 simply enables or requires Austel to make public those deficiencies in Telstra's performance of customer satisfaction but does not take it any further. That is why the customer service satisfaction guarantee for the first time puts a legal obligation on Telstra to provide services within a fixed period, to install and maintain and keep appointments within a certain period, and if they do not you can get your money back.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the customer service guarantee is over and above that. It deals specifically with defaults in terms of installation, maintenance and appointment keeping.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In case it is suggested by Senator Schacht or anyone else that somehow this does not go far enough, let me remind him of a couple of examples in my own portfolio area of which he ought to be very much aware. The Creative Nation policy document was released in October 1994. It simply contained an announcement in respect of the Australian multi&hyphen;media enterprise&mdash;$45 million. All that you got was the announcement. Ministers were still corresponding on which portfolio would take responsibility for the initiative several months later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry consultation was required and continued into January 1995, and the commercial structure was not complete until December&mdash;well after the announcement. The executive administration and board structures were eventually decided upon in April 1995, some six months after the announcement. The DIST concessional loans program of $48.2 million over four years was announced in the 1994-95 budget as part of the Working Nation package. At the time of the announcement, the government had not developed policies for assessing applications, nor had it developed an administrative framework or delivery mechanism. The scheme was not operational until the end of 1994&hyphen;95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Distinctly Australian was a $300 million package for arts and culture announced in the 1993-94 budget. At the time of the announcement, the government had not developed its cultural policy statement but stated that it would be developed within six months. The package also included tax incentives for encouraging owners of heritage listed properties to carry out approved conservation work. However, the administration process and competitive selection process remain to be developed. It was said at the time of the announcement that the strategies would be developed following a consultation process that had not at that time been established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The TV production fund provided $20 million per annum for a period of three years commencing in 1995-96. At the time of the announcement it was stated that the detail of the fund and its administration would be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7019"> finalised through extensive consultation involving all relevant groups.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The announcement of Creative Nation was not tied to the one-third sale of Telstra or tied to the sale of Qantas or tied to the sale of anything else. It was a stand&hyphen;off program. This is all tied as part of a deal to get a vote to sell one-third of Telstra, which, once sold, will never be able to be recovered or changed. You know that; Senator Harradine knows that. That is what is fundamentally different about the situation that we face in this vote in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I presume the $250 million comes from the one third sale of Telstra. So that is what is fundamentally different: you are selling Australia's biggest and most successful and profitable company. We were asking details last night and they were not ready, although Senator Harradine said you did have a document and he had seen it. But the rest of us were to be kept in the dark until we started asking questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate this has probably been done only at short notice but it still leaves a lot of questions. Why wasn't the model you used for the National Heritage Trust Fund adopted where it was a separate piece of legislation? We were berated by the government that the fund was a separate piece of legislation, much more detailed than in here, about the ministers who would be chairing it, about the approach of the bodies that would give advice. A <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7020"> Senate committee has looked at it and made recommendations. I was part of it and even though we opposed the whole principle of the issue we did seriously look at a structure. All of that has been ignored in what has been put forward today in a one and a half page statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still nothing in here that stops the minister year by year changing the appropriation, changing the amount of money for the states. There is nothing here I can see to say that from year to year in the appropriation&mdash;the one line&mdash;you will not change the amount of money. There is nothing in here to say that for a particular year you might put West Australia up a bit and South Australia down a bit. That is all left to your judgement. We are left with a board of three to five people. Can you imagine who they are rounding up for that? Some of the good old boys from out in the bush&mdash;all part of the old National Party rural network&mdash;to make sure the money is spent in the politically best way possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, we know as well as you do that you do not have to be actually sitting at the table signing the cheques or allocating the money to get the desired political result. You know that if you make the right appointments to this you will end up with the outcome politically desirable for your backbench to get them off your back. I notice the remarks today of Mr Cobb, for example, are pretty critical of the allocation to New South Wales compared with that to every other state on a per capita basis.</PARA>

What a pathetic defence. There is no guarantee for more than a couple of years at the best. He then says,`But I will rely on the union in Queensland to defend the jobs'. The union that represents the Telstra workers was seeing Senator Colston on and off publicly, and privately, asking him not to sell Telstra.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened enough to know that is an outrageous proposition. You sold the union in Queensland down. You sat there apparently and told them you had an open mind. And now you tell them you expect them to enforce your deal. What an outrageous hypocrisy! Then we see in the list this great deal, this great pork barrel of Senator Colston, that by June 1999 there will be 40 extra jobs in Queensland for this national call connect centre. There is an indicative list of what Telstra has said it will provide in staff levels through 1997, 1998 and 1999. The only way Senator Colston wants this enforced is to ask the union to keep a check on it. That is basically the thrust of it. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7021"> You have then accepted the word, Senator Colston, of the minister and the management of Telstra who at the same time as giving you this list are working to sack 22,000 workers throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just does not add up. You were taken for a ride by this government. I suspect the deal was done when you became Deputy President of the Senate&mdash;a wink, a nudge and a nod. For Senator Colston to table this as evidence of his great achievement really is quite astonishing. This slush deal has been done to provide funds that basically will be under political control and appears to have advantaged in some limited way the concerns of senators Colston and Harradine. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This deal will rely on the exposure the minister gets when he makes his statement and other people can judge. This is not like any other arrangement, I say to senators Colston and Harradine. Once you sell one third of Telstra you cannot say in a couple of years, `I made a mistake; I want to retract it; I want to withdraw the legislation and get a third of Telstra back into public ownership'. This is done once and lasts forever. You cannot get it back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was one of the points Senator Harradine made consistently in the last six months. He knew that, and he raised a redeemable preference share issue as a way to allow a future government to get the third of Telstra back. The way Senator Harradine has made arrangements for the committee to have a look at it but to have no effect on the outcome means that that has gone as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, we appreciate that today you have given us a little bit more information. Apparently you could have given it to us three or four days ago, according to Senator Harradine, but you chose not to; you dropped it here at the last moment. But it still does not overcome the fact that at the very least you should have replicated the national heritage trust fund arrangements&mdash;put it through a Senate committee to see that it was properly done as far as it possibly could be. What you have here is a political slush fund, which we will call the tele rort fund.</PARA></SPEECH>

Reduced staffing levels and increased <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7022"> outsourcing, better control of administrative and overhead costs and improved management information systems will also add to improvements in unit operating costs . . .

<PARA>Amendments 1 to 3 seek to modify clauses 8AA and 8AB of the bill. I have moved them <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7024"> because I want to give some strength to Senator Harradine's proposal for a Senate inquiry. These amendments will ensure that the only shares that can be sold in Telstra will be redeemable preference shares. I am not sure at this stage about the redeemable preference shares proposal. I do not have a closed mind on it. I do at this stage think that it makes more sense to Telstra and to the government to raise finance by way of a bond issue than a float of redeemable preference shares. But, as I say, my mind is not closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I do agree with Senator Harradine on, though, is that a float of redeemable preference shares is infinitely preferable to a float of ordinary shares. It is preferable for two reasons. First, it ensures that the control of the underlying assets of Telstra stay with the Commonwealth, stay in public hands. As Senator Harradine has repeatedly pointed out, a float of redeemable preference shares allows the government to raise $8 billion worth of revenue without surrendering control of the underlying assets of Telstra. I think that is really important. It is vitally important&mdash;this has been Senator Harradine's argument in relation to a whole lot of other entities&mdash;that, wherever there is basically a natural monopoly, it should remain in public hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason that redeemable preference shares are preferable to the issue of ordinary shares is that the entire financing proposal is reversible. The preference shares would be redeemable at some later stage by a future government. When the budget deficit is properly repaired in years to come, and if the Telstra sale does not proceed, such repair will proceed far more quickly and a future government with a bit more foresight than both the former Keating government and the current Howard government about the value of assets could start redeeming the shares. I know that that is a big political ask, but we are not talking about the best option here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not unusual for us to look at the reversibility of this situation. Each year billions of dollars worth of government bonds fall due and they are redeemed, usually by the issuing of new government bonds. A future government may decide&mdash;at least this gives <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them the option&mdash;to move the debt from Telstra redeemable preference shares to government bonds. I think the reversibility aspect of this is important because a lot of us here and a lot of Australians have not been convinced about this huge economic and social experiment of privatisation&mdash;in this case, a privatised Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not convinced privatisation of Telstra will be in the public interest. Who is to say whether in a couple of years time consumers will be happy with the outcomes, despite the minister's assertions? Who is to say what business will be thinking in a couple of years time? Who is to say how regional Australia will view what they see they have been given and how it actually works out in practice? Maybe a political party may be able to make promising to redeem the shares a very attractive proposition to Australian voters. So that is the attraction of Senator Harradine's proposal vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis ordinary shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate, though, for us it is very much a second best solution. We should not be issuing any shares of any type at all. Telstra should remain in total ownership by the Australian people. I believe the public sector would be much better off if the float of Telstra did not proceed. I want to raise the economic argument here that the public sector will be better off to the tune of $1 billion over four years, with that amount increasing. That increases to $2&half; billion when retained profits are added to the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what we are giving up. This is what we are losing. We might have some little deal for regional Australia. Nobody wants to disparage the opportunity for employment for any Australian, but let us not overlook what has been forgone in this arrangement. Not proceeding with the float means $2&half; billion of taxes that will not have to be increased. This government has not said yet how it will make up the income stream forgone. It means $2&half; billion worth of services that will not have to be cut if we do not sell off the profit stream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a strong argument. I want to put it before a Senate inquiry with teeth&mdash;not a pathetic Senate inquiry whose report is preordained to go nowhere but a Senate inquiry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7025"> where its final report will influence what is happening with the Telstra financing option. If my amendments are accepted, then Senator Harradine's inquiry will suddenly become very important. It will be looking at two issues: whether there are benefits for the public sector in moving down the redeemable preference share float option or whether the public sector would be better off not proceeding with the float but rather financing $8 billion worth of public debt through normal government Treasury bonds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would be a very interesting inquiry. I do not see any point in participating in an inquiry that is reduced to an academic exercise in proving Treasury wrong on its arguments even though you know full well it does not make one iota of difference at the end because this government will still proceed to an ordinary shares float. We know what Treasury think about this proposal. I think these amendments will keep Treasury honest. It will force them to seriously consider, just for once, whether they are better off with redeemable preference shares or Treasury bonds. That is why I am asking senators Harradine and Colston in particular to support these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth amendment seeks to enhance the reporting arrangements of Telstra Corporation to the parliament by seeking to ensure that, where Telstra makes major changes to its staffing levels, they are reported to the minister as the investment manager for the majority Commonwealth shares, who must then seek the option of his or her principals, the Commonwealth parliament. If the principals, that is both houses of parliament, by resolution approve the plan, it proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This will give the parliament some control over Telstra's staffing levels. Obviously, in making an assessment, the parliament will balance the impact on staffing issues vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis dividends and profitability&mdash;not a radical proposal at all. Senator Colston in his remarks said that the guarantee or the safeguard for all of us over employment was for each senator for Queensland and each member of the House of Representatives for Queensland to monitor the implementation of the government's proposal. So what! We look at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it; we monitor it. What can we do about it? We cannot do anything about it under the existing proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this proposal, we are saying that the parliament, as the elected representatives of the majority shareholders, the two&hyphen;thirds, should have the right to decide whether it wants to trade off some aspect of dividends against maintaining employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of other privatisation decisions which have been brokered through watchful upper houses and which have included guarantees about staffing. For example, the State Bank privatisation in New South Wales, in which my colleague Liz Kirby was involved, required no reduction in staffing numbers or branches for three years after privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment is drafted in a similar vein, recognising that workers should not be the victims of privatisation. It is bad enough when privatisation results in a massive transfer of windfall gain from public hands to private hands with the undervaluing of asset prices, but then there is almost always this massive transfer of value from labour to capital as labour is stripped to the bone for a temporary&mdash;and it is always temporary&mdash;rise in dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will ensure some protection against excessive and ludicrous downsizing. There are too many corporate cowboys out there who test their corporate virility by how many body bags they can produce. I have heard them in planes talking about how many faceless people they managed to downsize this month. It makes me sick. It makes me sick that people in secure jobs can always talk so callously about the people for whom there will be no jobs. And Telstra is no exception, with the most callous way in which people on million dollar salaries can say, `And 22,000 of you have to have no jobs at all'. Haven't they been listening to Stephen Roach, the so&hyphen;called guru of downsizing? He is saying that downsizing is short&hyphen;sighted. I am reminded that when Kim Beazley was minister he forced Telstra to shed 15,000 jobs. Then it started to expand again and they had to put most of them back on. That was a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7026"> monumental waste of money, just as Roach would have predicted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BZW has forecast that Telstra will have a 27 per cent profit improvement over the next three years despite falling market share, and that is with staff reductions of just 6,000 to 8,000. But there has been all this predication that Telstra was not going to be worth selling in years to come; all this talking down for months and months. And now, suddenly, when you want to sell it, it is miraculously worth a whole lot more in your view. To me, 22,000 seems excessive. It is all about inflating the Telstra float sale price. It is the same innocent people. If this sale did not happen, 22,000 workers might not lose their jobs, 22,000 families might not face the prospect of serious financial upheaval and the communities within which those 22,000 workers live would not face flow&hyphen;on job losses. Preserving 35 jobs in Toowoomba and 175 in Tasmania has to be placed in the context of losing 22,000 jobs over the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Please support my amendment. You say that majority ownership of Telstra means public control. Let us give the public a say through the parliament&mdash;a say on what happens with Telstra jobs. Amendments 5 and 6 are consequential on my amendments 1 and 3. They seek to modify the Telstra sale scheme to limit a float to the sale of redeemable preference shares. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, what we do not have is better outcomes. Ironically, the minister was today talking about people having to wait longer on phones or having to wait for services. It is ironic, because when you cut down staff in a service industry, people have to wait longer. Companies such as Optus, which are running in competition, can choose what services they provide. At the moment, there is a lot less choice from Telstra. I would certainly like to keep it that way so that the company has some public obligation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7027">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you pull people out of a service industry such as telecommunications, funnily enough, people have to wait longer on the line and for other services. Telstra is providing not just a range of courtesy services for business at competitive prices but a whole range of services for a whole range of people. To be able to provide services in a country such as Australia, you have to have people. Machines are not yet able to do those things for which, in the end, you really need to speak to someone at the end of the line. If they keep getting changed from machine to machine, a few of those telephones will end up being abused by the people on the other end of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we are seeing not a concentration on actual outcomes but on a very narrow definition. I am afraid that Senator Alston's definition of efficiency in service provision in the public sector is that you get rid of people. He thinks it must be efficient if you get rid of people. I do not think that. The Parliamentary Catering Service is another good example of that. The people are not the problem. It is the way that you expect people with fewer services to provide a service. In the end, instead of putting that money back into the service, it goes off as profit. The benefit of the people forced into having very little choice ends up suffering. Exactly the same is happening with Telstra. When you end up giving Telstra those things which other people in the market do not want, that is what ends up happening. In the end, you will say, `See. We told you they were inefficient. Let us compare it to a privatised sector, which then chooses to cream those areas of the market in which they think there is a buck.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, Senator Kernot's amendments are supportable. To a certain extent, they pre-empt the outcome of the committee. We have started the committee. We have not yet dealt with the rest of the amendments. It certainly pre-empts the findings of any inquiry. Because of that, it is better than what existed to start with, but it is pre-empting the outcomes to a certain extent. I would like to flag that, at the end of all this process and Senator Harradine's amendment to the motion that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> report of the committee be adopted, the bill be recommitted for further consideration in committee. In this way, we will have a chance, at the end of that legislative committee, to come back with the outcome of the committee and be in the situation in which we are now in. We can then make a real vote at the end of that process. I am keen to hear from the minister in relation to Senator Kernot's amendment No. 4.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The much more insidious difficulty with this whole notion&mdash;Senator Margetts instinctively appreciates this when she talks about difficulties and unintended consequences&mdash;is that you would essentially be asking the parliament to run the business. If it is not the largest business in Australia, it is certainly the second largest. How would we ever begin to make decisions? You have a board and senior management people. These are enormously complex decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do not let anyone think for a moment that Telstra's management thinks the good life involves sacking as many people as possible. Why would they want to do that? They want to reduce so that the company is competitive. That is measured by output, not simply by the number of people you have on the payroll. That is really the problem that you confront time and again when you look around the world. The fact is that, unless you get your <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7028"> cost structures under control, you are not able to reduce the price of your services and, therefore, be competitive. That is what Telstra is aiming to do. It is aiming to ensure that it has the capacity to undercut its competitors not only to retain market share but to deliver better outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply say to Senator Kernot that it would be ludicrous to effectively give Telstra employees the tenure of a High Court judge and have the parliament constantly making decisions and judgments&mdash;as she well knows, three-quarters of the other side are in the pockets of the trade union movement&mdash;that are simply not commercial. They would make them on a whole range of other factors, but not on the basis that management and a board are employed to make them. That is not in any shape or form a workable proposal.

We will certainly give him leave to do so with his response to the major points that Mr Costello made in his letter in arguing his case for redeemable preference shares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I have to say, whatever one's assumptions, Senator Harradine has made some very strong points as to why he believes the validity of the redeemable preference share option has great merit. In this amendment we are saying to Senator Harradine, `We've taken your view here. We say you should support this amend ment because it actually puts into action the possibility of the redeemable preference share. It also maintains Telstra in full public ownership, which is what you have said your gut instinct has been all the time to support. You have not voted for privatisation before.' This way there is flexibility for the government to achieve its fiscal outcomes, raising money to handle debt, but it is not irrevocably sold; it could always be looked at in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many arguments amongst economists and others about the points you raise, Senator Harradine, but we would believe that, for you, this amendment achieves 99.9 per cent of what you set out to achieve in many of your public statements over the last six to nine months. So I would be interested to hear Senator Harradine's comments about this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take the point that Senator Margetts raised, which will be debated later in the committee stage, about Senator Harradine's amendment to refer his redeemable preference share issue to the standing committee on economics and to report back by March. This bill, if carried at the moment, cannot be gazetted until past that date. We have all said many times on the record that that is no satisfactory outcome at all because the government could completely ignore any recommendation of the Senate committee and proceed to proclaim the bill as passed in this Senate, with the support of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7029"> We believe that Senator Margetts's amendment has a lot of merit in that, above all else, it makes the work of the Senate committee absolutely effective. It makes it reasonable for the senators to say, `Whatever we are doing on this committee, whatever evidence we are dealing with, it actually could have some effect.' It cannot be ignored because the final vote would be delayed until the committee's report is dealt with. That really is a very sensible way to handle this. I could imagine on most other occasions the Senate committees would come into disrepute, if they were doing work the outcome of which was predetermined by government unilaterally taking other action. Members on the Senate commit tees would say, `Why would you bother with the work?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the amendment moved by Senator Kernot should be supported. We take note of the query in subsection (4) about staffing numbers. It is interesting that only this minister would respond by pointing out how to get around it, not how it could be used effectively in respect of future job losses. Only this minister would immediately look&mdash;as a lawyer from the Victorian bar&mdash;at how he can get around any provision that parliament may put in. So he says, `We'll sack in lots of 99 and ignore it.' That is typical of the way this minister treats these sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, it is very true that nobody wants to second&hyphen;guess the management of Telstra in full public ownership, but the way you have been going on and the way the arrangements have been reached, you are removing the power of the minister to direct on this legislation. Therefore, what are the other protections? If you left the power of the minister to direct in the legislation, this would not be necessary. We will come to that amendment later on. That is why the opposition is sympathetic to subsection (4) of this amendment. We also believe this is a way in which Senator Harradine may actually have his cake and eat it too, as far as maintaining Telstra in public ownership is concerned, but leave the possibility of having redeemable shares issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>The amendment is self&hyphen;explanatory. I do not know whether honourable senators wish to canvass this at length at this time. I am happy to do so, but I think we are probably happy to deal with this particular matter simply as a procedural matter and then come to Senator Margetts's amendments if we want a real debate on effects. We can come to Senator Margetts's amendments at the end of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> committee stage. I am in two minds as to whether the committee wants to deal with this just as a procedural matter, to get it over and done with, and then come to Senator Margetts's proposition later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I deal with that, I think it is very important, as we are in committee, to raise a matter that was raised by Senator Kernot. Frankly, I am disappointed in Senator Kernot saying that the 22,000 jobs that Telstra is cutting are as a result of the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra. The information was tabled in the parliament today. I have been able to get from the clerk a copy of the letter, by the chief executive officer, Frank Blount, that went to all members of staff, pointing out that the decision taken by the board was the result of open competition from July 1997. The result of that was that they needed to tackle the problem of efficiency. That problem was highlighted by the fact that Telstra was operating at 30 per cent below world best practice in this particular field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very big telecom companies are going to enter the market from July 1997. That decision, of course, was as a result of decisions taken by the previous government and endorsed by the current government. As Mr Blount said, `If we cannot keep pace with the efficiency levels of our major competitors, we will not be able to meet their lower prices, which means we will lose market share and revenue. Our profits will fall and our growth will be restrained.' In other words, they would lose employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Blount said, `We are looking closely at ways of improving efficiency by analysing all parts of our business to see whether they fit with our future business strategies, in particular the way our core businesses are operated and managed.' Et cetera, et cetera. `Inevitably, these efficiency measures will mean staff reductions.' That would happen whether I voted for the sale of a third of Telstra or whether I did not. It does not make any difference at all. Telstra was in the process of slimming down to meet the challenges of competition, which, of course, were the result, I understand, of a bipartisan understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Colston and I have tried to ameliorate that position. We have tried to build into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7031"> the system a recognition that the parts of Australia which have been left out to dry, including the whole of my state of Tasmania and rural Australia, were going to get a better deal. I stand by that. We will come to this question of ownership. On that particular matter, 66&frac23; per cent of the board will be representative of the public.</PARA>

Minister, why has the government on International Human Rights Day closed the doors of the three Queensland offices of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission this morning? Why has the federal anti-discrimination funding been withdrawn from Queensland so anti-vilification and anti-discrimination cases in Queensland covered under the federal acts will be handled from Sydney?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator, for your question. I do not have advice as to the details of that. I can say with confidence that the government does not assume that a blanket of racial tolerance has fallen upon Queensland. I feel confident the changes relate far more to a decision for administrative efficiencies. I take the opportunity to say that this government is committed to human rights. If you are purporting that, by seeking administrative efficiencies, one is not so committed, then, with respect, you are wrong.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, given that 16,000 complaints and inquiries on human rights matters were received by the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Commission in the last financial year, why are you discriminating against Queensland when the Commonwealth continues funding human rights services in other states of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, with respect, I have already indicated to you that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I do not have a particular brief on this matter, and I have implied that I will get an answer for you. With respect, you waste your time and the Senate's time simply trying to get an answer to a question that implicitly you have already asked. If there is anything additional in your supplementary that I have missed, I will be happy to take it on board and get an answer for you from the Attorney-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat what I indicated to you earlier. It is incorrect for you and a mistake on your part to assert that, because of some changes that have been made for efficiencies, the government is not interested in this and not interested in that. It is possible to come back with a long list of efficiencies that your government sought in a wide range of areas when it was in government and to assert that, because you were seeking those efficiencies, you had no interest in beneficial outcomes.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope, Senator Faulkner, that that includes all of us. It also gives us the opportunity to ensure that we practice what we preach both domestically and internationally. Sadly, for far too many in the world community the basic human rights and freedoms that we take for granted are simply not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, consistent with the record of coalition governments in the past, is strongly committed to basic human rights and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7032"> freedoms. I remind you that, under the Fraser coalition government, that commitment was recognised by Australia's election to the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1978, with a re-election in 1980. We voted on the Security Council for economic sanctions against South Africa. We ratified the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. We took part in actions which we vigorously contributed to with others within the world community&mdash;in campaigns against abuses in Africa, in Asia and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, that commitment has carried over to the Howard coalition government, which is just as determined that we will not only meet the highest standards of basic human rights and freedoms domestically but also contribute in a positive way to a better international environment in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach to human rights is based on, first, a realistic assessment of what can and cannot be achieved; secondly, a constructive dialogue with other governments, including both bilateral and multilateral approaches; and, thirdly, working to strengthen democratic and human rights institutions, particularly in our region. We are prepared to use development assistance as a goal in that regard. For example, we are prepared to use a development cooperation program through AusAID to continue to support democratic development in human rights institutions in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I remind you that in PNG we are broadening our assistance in the law and order and justice area&mdash;$120 million for current and planned assistance. Another example is our assistance to a research centre for human rights in the Ho Chi Minh Academy of Political Sciences in Vietnam. I could continue, particularly with our own region but also on much of the developing world where we are constructively contributing to a better international environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly bring to your attention a number of new initiatives in this area. We are supporting the establishment of an informal Asia-Pacific forum of national human rights institutions. We will provide $250,000 over three years, through the Australian Human <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, for the establishment of a secretariat to the forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is supporting the development of the Asia&hyphen;Pacific human rights arrangements, which will bring our region into line with Africa, the Americas and Europe. The government is proposing to establish a new centre for democratic institutions which would promote democracy and democratic change, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are strongly supporting the establishment of an international criminal court.

Why then has the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the Howard government was better off having not won a position on the Security Council? Whose view of government policy is correct?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get the detail that Senator Faulkner has requested. But I do welcome the opportunity to remind honourable senators of the achievement of the Howard government in implementing this family tax package in which two million families from lower to middle incomes will gain benefit. One of the legacies of the Labor government was that families basically suffered disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record of the Labor government was that the elites were treated as special, the rich got richer and the poor were generally disregarded. But there was also a huge group of middle Australians, the so-called battlers, who were disregarded. They responded to that failure of Labor policy during the last election when they unceremoniously voted the previous government, a government that was out of touch with the needs of real Australia, out of office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They partly voted them out of office to get an alternative that would recognise the importance of families, that would recognise that families did it hard under high interest rates, under record high unemployment, under policies that were basically insensitive to their needs. A commitment that Mr Howard made during the election was that in our first term of government we would give them some relief from the financial hardships they had experienced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have honoured that commitment. It is important that those who gain advantage are made aware of the details of the opportunities they now have to be better off.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to give answers on both if time permits, Senator Cook. The report of the review of Australia's Quarantine and Inspection Service is not a review of individual applications. It has nothing to say about them. The key theme of the report is that quarantine is a shared responsibility, as you have said, Senator. It is necessary for all governments, industry and very much the general public to take ownership of quarantine in this country. The minister has pointed out that there is a need for quarantine to be viewed as a continuum which incorporates offshore, border and post&hyphen;border measures, with each of these elements supporting and reinforcing the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report refutes the belief held by some that we can adopt a no risk quarantine policy, as it would be untenable and totally impracticable. Australia's quarantine policy is not and cannot be one of zero risk. Such an objective would require the end of all trade and international travel. The report recommends a continuation of the use and refinement of scientifically based risk analysis. It recommends further improving current processes in terms of timing and the amount of consultation and communication, and it has provision for an appeal mechanism on process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report says that Australia's quarantine systems were generally in good shape and notes that much of the criticism about the effectiveness of AQIS cannot be supported by facts. However, the Commonwealth remains committed to maintaining a conservative quarantine policy to safeguard human, animal and plant health in Australia. The report recommends the creation of a statutory authority called Quarantine Australia to ensure political independence. There is a diversity of views on this issue, such as the recent Senate report on cooked chicken meat and the report of the national task force on fish and fish products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The minister indicates that he will be responding to the Nairn report recommenda tions as soon as possible. Some of the recommendations will need to be viewed in the broader policy context. Those that have budgetary implications will also have to be considered in the budgetary process. There is a need also to have discussions with state and territorial ministerial colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has established a steering committee within his department under the chairmanship of the departmental secretary to oversight a Nairn implementation task force. This is one of the recommendations of the Nairn report. The steering committee and task force will formulate responses to the report taking into account resource issues and existing policy. The minister expects to bring these suggested responses to cabinet in the first quarter of 1997.</PARA>

Minister, the latest version of your draft telecommunications national code was released today, and it provides for Austel to audit the cable roll-out, of which there are some thousands of kilometres, I understand, to ensure that the code is being complied with. It also requires Austel to determine the technical feasibility of co-locating mobile phone infrastructure. I note that councils are now able to propose alternative sites. Austel must arbitrate on any disputes between the carriers over terms and conditions of co-location. So I ask the minister: did you notify Austel of this measure or discuss it with them prior to releasing the code?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I think I have already indicated in this chamber, one of the difficulties we had in relation to the revised telecommunications code was that, because some of the provisions that we wished to insert had not been the subject of previous discussion in the context of the earlier public inquiry, if we were to go ahead without having those matters further canvassed in the public arena we ran the risk of that code being declared invalid or at the very least one of the carriers being able to obtain an injunction on the basis that the code was not properly in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on an expected question in this area. It does not go specifically to each of the points of your question. I will give you the information that I have got and, to the extent that it does not answer any specific questions that you have asked, I will take those back to the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the minister's comments on this issue have been taken somewhat out of context. What the minister was addressing was the myth that exists amongst some sectors of the community that the overseas born in general are more likely to be involved in criminal activity than are the Australian born. Australian and overseas studies have consistently shown that the overseas born commit fewer crimes and are less likely to be in prison than the Australian born.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the 1993 national prison sentence data, the overseas born prison rate of 86.9 per 100,000 was significantly lower than the Australian born prison rate of 131.6 per 100,000. This compares with rates in 1985 of 76.5 for overseas born and 107.53 for Australian born people. I suppose that simply shows that we are putting more people per thousand in prison; whether we are catching them doing the same number of crimes or more than that is not commented on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All applicants for entry to Australia must be of good character, and character requirements are designed to exclude any person whose presence in Australia would not be in the interests of the broader Australian community. Persons who may be excluded from entry on character grounds include criminals or associates of criminal organisations, war criminals and any persons likely to vilify a segment of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no particular problem with New Zealanders. The minister used the example of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> New Zealand migrants, who have a higher prison rate than some other migrant groups do, and who are not subject to the same screening arrangements as other migrants are, to illustrate how effective Australia's migration screening procedures are. They are not subject to the same screening arrangements as other migrants, because of the special relationship between Australia and New Zealand. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the trans&hyphen;Tasman travel arrangement, Australian and New Zealand citizens may enter each other's country to visit, live or work without normal screening requirements. This joint arrangement between the Australian and New Zealand governments recognises the common historical, cultural, political and institutional history of the two countries. Being from a particular national or ethnic group does not make an individual more or less disposed to crime. The important point to make is that socioeconomic circumstances of individuals, irrespective of birthplace, are key determinants of the incidence of crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Institute of Criminology statistics indicate a positive correlation between unemployment and higher prison figures, and, therefore, specific overseas born groups who experience high unemployment may have higher prison rates&mdash;but for that reason, not by reason of their place of birth. A prevalence of higher crime rates among some migrant groups is not because they are predisposed to commit crime or because the immigration character checks are ineffective but because they experience higher unemployment and lower socioeconomic status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add one more point, the prevalence of high unemployment amongst some migrant groups can be best addressed by refocusing the immigration program onto skilled migration and thus restoring the balance in the program. That would be one step that we could take. That is exactly what this government intends to do with the 1996&hyphen;97 intake. Senator, I think that does answer most of your questions but, as I have said, I will give this answer and your questions to Mr Ruddock. If there is anything he wants to add in relation to some specifics, no doubt he will give me some further information for you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator Bishop today, relating to the mining industry and research and development tax concessions.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to admit that it is misleading to take note of the answer, because the minister did not actually answer the question. The minister spoke about the impact of the removal of syndicated research and development when the mining industry was complaining specifically about the cut of the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bishop's question was prompted by a letter that most senators would have received today from the Chamber of Mines and Energy of Western Australia Incorporated. This letter makes very useful reading, particularly because the next question that Senator Parer received today was on the environmental measures being taken by the mining industry. That let forth an uncharacteristic and unique&mdash;some would say childish&mdash;exposition of the importance of the mining industry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is peculiar that there is this juxtaposition. On the one hand, we had Senator Parer disavow the considered views of the mining industry as presented in this letter from the Chamber of Mines and Energy and, on the other hand, extol its virtues on the basis of faith, not on the basis of any practical assistance that this government might wish to give to help the mining industry realise its true potential for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote what the mining industry says about the cut of research and development tax incentives from 150 per cent to 125 per cent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will inevitably have the consequence of reducing the amount of R &amp; D undertaken by the minerals and energy industry in Australia and therefore, the industry's competitiveness and future growth.</PARA>
<PARA>This was not commented on by the minister. He dodged that point. Later in the letter, in saying how valuable this tax concession has been to the industry, the chamber says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result Australia now leads the world in a variety of areas of mining technology, including exploration technology, environmental management and rehabilitation (particularly in arid areas), mine safety, mining, crushing and mineral transport and mineral processing technology.</PARA>
<PARA>In this letter, they give four very good case examples of industries that have succeeded in making world leading breakthroughs in evolving new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One is with Hamersley Iron, CRA and the CSIRO on environmental technology. One is with a Western Australian company, Westralian Sands, for an $11 million pilot plant to test the feasibility of converting iron oxide waste from the synthetic rutile process into an iron product for use in steel making. Another is a $16 million project by Western Mining <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7045"> Corporation to develop technology and build a plant to extract cobalt from the nickel metal produced at the Kwinana nickel refinery. There is another about mining safety, where remote operated vehicles can go where no man or person should go underground because of the risk to human life and the disease inherent in underground mining activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are practical examples which the industry says in their own correspondence will be undercut by this government's measures. The minister responsible for this industry had not one single word of consolation for the industry about their future outlook. He defended the proposition that this advantage should be cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this country is growing heartily sick and tired of is that our economic structure is such that we are an exporter of raw, unvalue-added commodities, be they mineral or agricultural, and an importer of high value-added technology. Often machines or equipment, plant or other important elements in the industrial process are made of Australian iron ore from furnaces fuelled by Australian coal and by workers fed by Australian grain and clothed by Australian wool. You cannot export enough resources to import sufficient of that technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">R&amp;D works in this industry on the basis of adding value to the primary product. This is the unkindest cut of all. If you cut the ability of this industry to value add, you reduce the value of Australia's exports and reduce the advantage this industry has to emerge as the world's leading resource development industry, where Australian companies that have honed their ability onshore can move offshore and develop further on a world scale to the advantage of them, the Australian economy and our current account deficit. I am surprised mightily that the minister did not know. If he did know, he would not say anything to give this industry a clear signal for their future outlook in research and development.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on the government's decision to reduce R&amp;D funding. This will obviously have disastrous consequences and impact on the mining industries in our country, in particular in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> most important state of Western Australia. In a whole range of industries&mdash;gold, iron ore, mineral sands and copper&mdash;there will be reduction in expenditure and employment. Those industries are responsible for the opening up of Western Australia, for the development of the state and for the high living standards which are enjoyed by many tens of thousands of Western Australians. Those industries give high wages, they have high value and high reward, and have many flow&hyphen;on effects to other parts of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work is often dangerous. Last week in Kalgoorlie and associated areas I was repeatedly asked, `Why does the Commonwealth government hate the goldmining industry? Why is the Commonwealth government seeking to impose new taxes on the goldmining industry? Why are the Commonwealth and the state governments conspiring to increase input costs to successful mining enterprises in that state?' I was told repeatedly by a range of interests in Western Australia that the reduction of the R&amp;D concession will have the effect of making marginal mines unprofitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook referred to correspondence from the Chamber of Mines and Energy of Western Australia. Let me refer to a number of the comments made in that correspondence, which has been circulated to all senators in this place. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of particular concern is the proposed reduction to the R &amp; D incentive rate from 150 % to 125 %. This will inevitably have the consequence of reducing the amount of R &amp; D undertaken by the minerals and energy industry in Australia and therefore, the industry's competitiveness and future growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the principal factors underpinning the strong growth and performance of the mining and mineral processing industries in Australia has been a significant and sustained investment in research and development encouraged by the R &amp; D tax incentive . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of Australia's environmental technology overseas is one well known example. However, there are many others. Hamersley Iron, CRA and the CSIRO have jointly developed a revolutionary process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that will result in much expenditure. From my own experience in the Northern Territory on the uranium mining committee, ERA told us <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7046"> that the R&amp;D concession had been instrumental in them forming new companies and developing offshoots that were developing new industries and export earnings in Indonesia, China and Malaysia and the retention of mines and reclaiming of wasted lands. Those new industries which were developed by ERA derived directly from the R&amp;D concession granted by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not understand, when we have a current account that is rising, why we seek to penalise industries that invest in research, why we seek to penalise industries that seek to export, and why we seek to penalise industries that are successful. That is the effect of the R&amp;D elimination or reduction that is being encouraged by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go on and quote what the Chamber of Mines and Energy in Western Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These wider benefits to the Australian economy are being put at risk by the proposed reduction to the incentive rate. The rationale for the incentive is that it is frequently not possible for research proponents to capture for themselves all of the benefits resulting from the research. Other companies and parts of the economy also benefit from the gain in knowledge and the commercial opportunities and initiatives for further research that are created. The existence of these wider benefits to the economy is the reason why it is entirely appropriate for the Government to provide a tax incentive for R &amp; D activity.</PARA>
<PARA>That quote is 100 per cent right. It is the strong argument for providing that incentive for R&amp;D activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After Senator Bishop's contribution, I feel I should rise to answer some of the things he has said because, quite obviously, he has not spent any time at all following what has been happening with the committee that has been looking into the legislation involved with research and development, the committee that has spent three or four weeks receiving evidence and listening to those people who support what the government is doing and listening to those who would oppose. Of course there will be people who oppose what the government is doing because, whenever they are going to be affected by legislation, they are always going to come along and try to put their case strongly, just as, when the opposition was in government, people came along and put their points of view just as strongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, in each of those cases the governments position prevailed because, in effect, it is not just looking at one industry in isolation. In this case, you talk about penalising industries. When a government comes to power and finds itself with the financial problems that you as a government left us, something has to be done across the board to make sure that whatever cuts had to be made were felt evenly. This is not penalising companies; what we are looking at is overcoming budget deficits. That is why the decision was made.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mentioned that we are eliminating research and development concessions. That is simply not true. We have reduced them form 15O to 125 per cent, which has been recommended to this government as the level at which they should remain&mdash;125 per cent. The 125 per cent is still a far greater concession than companies get anywhere else in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some R&amp;D concessions in other countries, but they have strings attached to them. If you look at Singapore and other countries, you will see that there are some strings attached to them. Of course, those people who are directly affected are going to go to people like you. You come in here with a prepared speech. You must have known exactly what was going to happen with regard to the answer. It is very difficult to have a prepared speech to respond to a minister's answer when you do not exactly know what he is going to say. You did your bit of research, you lost your place and then you had to ad lib for a while and eventually you got back onto your speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular instance, if you want to talk about research and development you would want to look carefully at the evidence that was given to our committee by the department and read all of the evidence given by those people who benefit from such things as syndication&mdash;those people who benefit by charging fees and getting these syndicates together while, in many cases, using up tax losses which were at great cost to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bishop, look carefully at the report when it comes down. It is a very good report that will be tabled later. I congratulate the members of the secretariat who have written such a comprehensive report that puts every side of the argument&mdash;those people who are in favour of the reduction of the tax concessions for R&amp;D and the money in concessions that is given to R&amp;D, and those people who oppose those reductions and concessions and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the answers that are given to them. You can also look at the comments and views of the committee&mdash;and I am quite sure you will read at length the minority report that has been put in by your opposition colleagues Senator Sherry and Senator Cook. I ask you to read the body of the report carefully. If you do that, you will see that in totality what this government is doing is of benefit to the economy in general. People who think they are going to be adversely affected are basing their view on assumptions which cannot be proved and which may not come to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never yet seen a government put in place any measure which looks to reduce a benefit to any industry where it does not prophesy the doom of that industry. I do remember in Senator Button's day the car industry and many other industries predicting doom and gloom should the government take the action that it proposed. In this case, let me tell you that the government intends to take this action and carry on with these proposals because we have listened carefully to what everybody has said. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a great invitation to speak. You were talking about what this government might do contra the mining industry. The mining industry, like the agriculture industry, is very much in my heart.

At least capital gains tax is spread all over Australia. But the other one that you gave them that stands out is the fringe benefits tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the worst thing you could have done to people at the time. Of course, the Howard government has made some changes there. They are two of the things that you gave them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7049"> The big ticket issues for the mining industry are quite clear; for example, industrial rela tions reform. Where was the Labor Party on IR reform? Against it every single inch of the way. What is the next big ticket item? Lower interest rates. What do the opposition say about lower interest rates? They bemoan the fact that we have succeeded in producing an environment which is now producing lower interest rates. Indeed, we are now having economic growth at the rate of 3.8 per cent. What does the shadow Treasurer say? The economy is as flat as the Nullarbor Plain. What a great economist Mr Gareth Evans, former Senator Evans, is when he makes statements like that in the context of 3.8 per cent growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is another big ticket item for the mining industry? Waterfront reform. I think it was Senator Bob Collins who said, `If I don't reform the waterfront within a certain time, I will resign.' We have been waiting for his resignation ever since, because nothing has happened. Nothing happened in relation to the waterfront during the Labor Party reign. They knew something had to be done about it, but they did not have the political will to do something about it. We have and we will deal with it. The mining industry and the workers within the industry will benefit as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is another big ticket item issue for the mining industry? Rail reform. Over 13 years of Labor government, the rail system in this country went in a downward spiral. We have arrested that downward spiral and we have now committed ourselves to a fundamental reform of the rail industry and the rail infrastructure within this country&mdash;another big ticket item on which we are delivering for the benefit of the mining industry and those regional communities in Australia that rely on the mining industry, which is really the bread and butter for the outlying regions of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have also committed ourselves to cutting red tape for a lot of the small businesses that in fact get their livelihood from the mining industry. So the small businesses will benefit and be able to provide their services to the mining industry at a cheaper rate; therefore make it more profitable and allow for greater productivity and greater employ ment opportunities. But, once again, Labor during 13 years refused to deal with the red tape problem for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is another big ticket item for the mining industry? The Native Title Act. We all know about the problems that have been occasioned by the Native Title Act not only for the mining industry but also for the indigenous communities of this country who have been denied the possibility of latching onto the profitability of the mining industry and thus providing some economic support and economic independence for those communities. We have committed ourselves to making amendments to the Native Title Act to make it more workable for the mutual benefit of our indigenous communities, the mining industry and the wellbeing of all of Australia. Where is the Labor Party on that? Once again, they stand in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been able to detail half a dozen areas where we have been of real benefit to those people within the mining industry who derive their employment and their livelihood from it. We are criticised for a small reduction in the R&amp;D tax benefits. Why have we had to implement that? Solely because of the $10 billion black hole that you people on that side left us to deal with. We would have preferred not to have to do it, but the reality is that you left us with a mess.

<TIME.STAMP>(3.46 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this matter of public importance on the deleterious effect of the government's cuts and higher fees on access to the Family Court and related services. The Family Court is a much maligned but nonetheless essential service in our community. It is a body that is there to resolve the most personal and most important of disputes. It is not surprising that many Family Court cases excite intense emotions and anxiety amongst the participants and the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the major parties as well as the minor parties in this place support the ongoing role of the Family Court. Whilst many of us from time to time have been critical of aspects of its administration, we all overwhelmingly value the service it provides. The Family Court is surrounded by a series of support services. Some are provided within the courts, such as the court's own counselling and mediation service. Others are provided in the community. These include marriage and relationship education, adolescent and family mediation, family skills training and family mediation services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The totality of these services is aimed at providing as flexible and as helpful response as possible to firstly prevent families entering into crisis and also supporting them in the event that they do. The objective of the parliament is that at the end of the day we want to see fewer divorces. We want to see more families stay together and we want to see those families that do separate do so amicably. We want to see more children have access to both their parents, their grandparents and their extended families. This is why the government cuts in this area are so mean spirited. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7056">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the cuts imposed by this government, this Howard government, will make it harder for ordinary Australians to access these essential services. An inability to access justice meted out by the Family Court or the assistance provided by the related services means more family turmoil, more heartache, more despair. It is damage flowing from these cuts that simply cannot be measured by economists. It is damage to the very fabric of our society and something that we should not tolerate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let us look at these cuts. Firstly, in terms of the Family Court itself, the government promised in the election campaign to cut $2 million a year from the court's budget. They claimed this would be merely efficiency gains by the court. But it did not take long for this promise to be proven false. The court's budget has been cut by $3&half; million in 1996-97 after the so-called public sector wide efficiency cuts, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department efficiency cuts and the loss of Justice Statement funding are all taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts do not end there, for the forward estimates show that the court will face a further cut of $10 million in real terms in 1997-98&mdash;big cuts and the impacts are deep. For instance, in terms of the consequence of these cuts, registries at Mackay and Bendigo have already been closed. Another at Launceston has been reduced to a counselling registry and even that is under threat. The registries at Geelong, Rockhampton and Wollongong are at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The daily reduction programs in Melbourne and Parramatta were suspended, although high demand has forced the reinstatement of the Parramatta program on a more limited basis. The delays in the Melbourne registry have become so bad that practitioners there openly talk about over 1,000 cases that have disappeared into the waiting list black hole at that registry alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Circuits to regional areas have also been severely reduced. Circuits have been reduced to Albury, Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Launceston, Mount Gambier, Traralgon, Warrnambool and Whyalla. But they are the lucky <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ones. Burnie, Griffith and Wagga Wagga will not be visited at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of Justice Statement funds will mean that the provision of two family consultants to service remote and regional centres will not go ahead. The Cairns registry will not be upgraded to a filing registry as promised and outreach programs to Campbelltown in New South Wales and Logan and Ipswich in Queensland will not proceed. Only 19 of the 39 new Family Court counsellors promised in that Justice Statement Australia wide will now be employed&mdash;less than 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I previously implied, related services will also be deeply affected. First, there is the Family Court mediation and counselling service. The Family Court Amendment Bill 1996, which is currently before us, seeks to allow the court to charge a $40 per hour fee for this service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern of the opposition in this place in respect of the introduction of these fees is twofold. Firstly, there are deep access to justice implications in slugging families in crisis with a $40 fee for the provision of the service. Ultimately, this service does save the government money because it helps reduce the rate of divorce. Secondly, we are concerned about the longer term objectives underlying the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of this bill and the charges being implemented by the government, this is yet another breach of this government's election commitment to the Australian people. In its law and justice policy, the coalition promised to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options for resolutions of disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>A measure such as this one, which makes it harder for people to access mediation and counselling services because of the imposed fees, hardly supports or increases the options that are available to Australian families in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7057"> But the cuts do not end there. Government cuts mean that the family skills training services that were to be provided under Labor's Justice Statement this financial year in the Richmond-Tweed area, Central Mur rumbidgee, Shepparton&hyphen;Mooroopna, Bendigo, Ballarat, Gold Coast, Wide Bay&hyphen;Burnett or the Greenough River region will not proceed. We can also look at the adolescent and family mediation services which were to be provided this year and next in Newcastle, the Clarence, Geelong, Whyalla and Preston. They will also go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The range of programs that this government is prepared to cut is amazing. It does not stop there. Family mediation services which were to be opened in Gosford, Newcastle, Wollongong, the northern outer suburbs of Melbourne, Geelong, Bendigo, Ipswich, Wide Bay&hyphen;Burnett or Perth's south&hyphen;eastern metropolitan area simply will not be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A whole range of services have been ditched&mdash;services that are critical to families in crisis and services that are critical to regional families in crisis. On top of those, we can look at the court fees. This government has made concessions to Senator Harradine, and I must say that we have not as yet seen the colour of those concessions or the regulations. It is getting very close to Christmas and the parliament will soon adjourn, and the Attorney-General is sitting on those regulations. They need to be brought forward immediately. Despite those concessions they will still garner a massive $90 million over the next four years out of the Family Court system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fees for a typical family law case will increase from some $368 to over $1,700. That is before anyone pays one cent to their lawyer. These fees are not user pays; they are basically a rough tough on families in crisis, a tax with devastating consequences on the families and on the fabric of our society. They are not going to deter the rich. The extremely poor will not be adversely affected because some of them will still be able to get legal assistance. The people who will suffer from these fees will be the new emerging group in our society, the group that is progressively being identified as Howard's losers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that this is not where it stops in terms of funding to legal aid. The ramifications of the cutbacks in legal aid on the family law system are also quite deep and pervasive. We had an assurance from the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Attorney-General that cuts to legal aid funding would mean more money for family law cases, but despite this we are already seeing caps placed on the funding. For example, in Victoria there is a cap of $15,000 on existing cases, with a cap of $10,000 on new ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening already is that we are finding the intellectually disabled having to represent themselves and fathers being forced to cross&hyphen;examine their own children when allegations of incest have been made. This is a government which does not care about access to justice and which does not care about families. It is depriving families and Australian citizens in general from access to the most basic services in our court system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cuts are wide, deep and all pervasive. In terms of their motivation, they are quite mean spirited. These sorts of cuts we are talking about are despicable. There is no over&hyphen;arching financial imperative, no matter how real or imagined, that can justify the sorts of ramifications we are talking about from the federal government's cuts in this area. They must be reversed and we should put pressure on the government to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Chief Justice Brennan said in what I think has been noted as an unprecedented statement in September this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not an overstatement to say that the system of administering justice is in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA>This government is responsible for that. This government is responsible for bringing this crisis around. Nowhere is this crisis more evident than in the case of our family law system. This government ought to be condemned for what it is doing to access to justice in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.57 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me say that, if the judicial system is in crisis, then the responsibility for that has to be borne by the former government. This certainly did not happen in the last eight months&mdash;that is, if it did happen. The truth is that the situation is nowhere near as serious as Senator Bolkus has portrayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government came to power with an election commitment for a $2 million cut to costs and the Family Court and a further <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7058"> funding cut of $1.65 million to programs initiated under the previous government's Justice Statement. Also, there is a two per cent reduction which is demanded through the efficiency dividend. So there are no great surprises here in relation to these cuts. There is nothing that has been hidden from the Australian people. It was on this platform that the Australian people elected this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect that Senator Bolkus touches on is that of higher fees. In relation to the Family Court, the proposed fee for ancillary relief was proposed at $250. However, after negotiations and consultation, the government reduced this to $150. As well as this, the government reduced the proposed one&hyphen;off hearing fee from $400 to $300. To partially offset that, the government agreed to an increase in fee for divorce applications from $460 to $500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government announced all these proposed increases in the 1996-97 budget. It was as a result of finding the $8 billion black hole which the previous government hid from the people of Australia. It was in relation to that sad state of affairs of Australia's finances that this government had to take the course of action it took. It took it across the board&mdash;not just in relation to the judicial system, not just in relation to legal aid or the Family Court, but across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the question of related services, Senator Bolkus has raised the question of a deterioration in counselling and mediation services. The first thing is that the $40 an hour fee is only in respect of voluntary counselling as opposed to counselling which is ordered by the courts. There will be exemptions for those who cannot afford it. So at the end of the day you will not have a counselling fee for that which is ordered by a court, and you will not have it applying to people who cannot afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General in the National Press Club on 15 October this year said he was keen to maximise access to primary forms of dispute resolution such as mediation and counselling and to ensure that those services are provided in the most efficient and effective way. He said such services were less <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expensive and traumatic ways of resolving family law disputes than litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus appears to be saying that capping legal aid at $15,000 is denying people access to the Family Court. The Attorney&hyphen;General has said it is better to try to resolve matters by mediation and counselling than to throw money at litigation and that if you must have litigation cap the fee so that it can be spread evenly across those who need it. The choice in legal aid is always whether to spend thousands of dollars on one case and so deny others a chance of representation. Capping provides more people with access to legal aid and representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regarding counselling services, Senator Bolkus overlooks the fact that there are some 288 venues around the country where counselling services are funded by the Commonwealth. In regional areas, where there are Family Court closures, community&hyphen;based services may be required to pick up counselling work that would be otherwise done by the court. The government has not overlooked the ramifications of any closure. These changes will have an impact on community&hyphen;based services and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and peak bodies representing these agencies are working with the Family Court to develop protocols for sharing the responsibility for providing the range of counselling services needed to support all the requirements of the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is aware of the problems that might arise from these necessary closures and is addressing them through consultation and mediation. It is easy for an opposition to criticise the government and say cuts in counselling and the fees are too high and people are denied access to the Family Court and that legal aid is being cut back. But the opposition is unable to show where people have been turned away from the Family Court because they could not afford to apply. The opposition has failed to say that 40 per cent of all fees are waived due to exemptions for people on social security, getting legal aid, or successfully showing the court they cannot meet the filing fees entailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not just a peremptory act by the Commonwealth to bring in these fees; it had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7059"> been in the pipeline for some time. When the opposition was in government it was looking at exactly the same fee increase. It knew cost recovery in the Commonwealth jurisdiction was poor, to say the least. The increase in these fees will barely take the Commonwealth to the same levels of cost recovery as the states. It is irresponsible of us only to meet the needs of today without planning for the needs of tomorrow. We have to make sure our financial planning will allow for an increased legal aid system in the future, a more efficient Family Court system, and it may be tough decisions will have to be taken in the meantime and we will have to look at rationalising some of the registries we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the proposals mooted is the briefing out of counselling services. I can tell Senator Bolkus that the Family Court of Western Australia, which received much praise in the Joint Standing Committee on Family Law Matters for its efficiency, does not rely on court counsellors as such as other family courts in Australia do, but briefs work out to the family services to provide counsellors at the court. It operates in a most efficient manner. I hold up the practice of the Family Court of Western Australia as a good example. Use could be made of magistrates and country courts for Family Court access for those in regional areas. The joint standing committee mentioned that in its report last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has approached this in a thoroughly rational manner. It has to be dispassionate in looking at this problem. It has to look at the question of cuts on the one hand and balancing that with fees and cost recovery on the other and the question of access to justice. Involved in that question of access to justice is how high do you go with your fees and to what extent you make the legal aid dollar go further. The capping of fees is not a bad start in that regard. None of the cuts were a surprise; they were contained in the government's election commitments and I dispute the $10 million figure Senator Bolkus has raised regarding the year after this. The cuts we are dealing with are before the parliament and are ones mentioned by the government as I stated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no evidence to date to show these higher fees have stopped anyone from using the Family Court. Senator Bolkus could not give us any evidence. He mentioned the scenario of a father cross&hyphen;examining his children in the Family Court. I find that hard to believe. In a Family Court there are discretionary powers about evidence from juveniles. That discretion is exercised most cautiously for obvious reasons. I dispute that example and refute it entirely as being the result of any cut or increased fee imposed by this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are also extremely concerned with the impact higher court fees are already having on Family Court services, particularly on those users of the system who represent some of the most disadvantaged and disempowered citizens of this country&mdash;women. We heard a lot about family values during the election, but once a family starts breaking up those values seem to start breaking up too, especially with this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rate of reported violence against women and children is also on the increase. As far back as 1992, Dr Hilary Astor, in her report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Violence against women</EMPHASIS> for the Office of the Status of Women, cited the time immediately after separation as the most physically dangerous time in a woman's life. In 1988, a survey by the Office of the Status of Women illustrated that nearly one-fifth of respondents&mdash;one person in five&mdash;believed that violence against a wife is sometimes justified. Violence against a wife is never justified. The respondents were both men and women. Lesser forms of ill&hyphen;treatment, such as denying money and yelling abuse, were even more widely accepted. This is a really shocking finding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the environment that some of the most crucial services of the Family Court are frequently called upon to deal with. In 1992 the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act reported that following divorce living standards of non-custodial parents, generally males, increased markedly while living standards of custodial parents, usually the mother, and their children dropped.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7060">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Institute of Family Studies undertook two studies on the aftermath of divorce. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Settling up</EMPHASIS> was published in 1986 and studied the economic consequences of divorce. In 1993 the Australian Institute of Family Studies published <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Settling down</EMPHASIS>, in which the lives of divorced parents with dependent children are followed in the period five years to eight years following the breakdown of their marriage. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Settling down</EMPHASIS>, they concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The duration of dislocation and disadvantage was quite variable in this population of parents. Men usually recovered, and in many cases attained a higher standard of living within three years of separation; women suffered a severe drop in their standard of living which remained over the early years. Five to eight years after separation, the gap had lessened, an amelioration largely accounted for by the formation of new family units. The difference in magnitude and direction of the immediate effects of marriage breakdown on mothers with children and on fathers, and its long-term continuation unless the mother repartners, is one of the most confronting findings of this study.</PARA>
<PARA>So we find that the people who are most worried about higher fees are the people who have the least money, and that is generally the person who has the children in a relationship. They are the ones who are suffering most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of the Status of Women found in 1995 that 80 per cent of women and 73 per cent of men were worried about violence impacting on their lives. There is no mistake about this. When the primary care giver of children&mdash;and that is of course most often women in this country&mdash;is subject to emotional, physical, psychological or economic violence, and that happens very often after divorce and during divorce, then the children are also victims of that violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition parties did make a pre-election promise to maintain funding to legal aid, and we have seen what has happened to that. It is doubtful that legal aid as we know it will now survive in this country. In the law and justice policy statement, the coalition parties stated, `All people should be equal before the law.' How true. They also said, `All people, regardless of status or financial means, should have the ability to access the law.' I would have to agree with that one, too. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report refers to not only the importance of legal aid for disadvantaged groups but also the level of fees in accessing the judicial system. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most obvious barrier to justice is the financial one. This, of course, affects many people in the community, especially in time of high unemployment. But as the Australian Law Reform Commission has pointed out insufficient money is a barrier which affects women to a greater extent than men because women generally have fewer financial resources than men. There are other barriers besides lack of financial resources. People who do not speak English face difficulties both in obtaining adequate information about the legal system and in communicating with many of the people and organisations that form part of it. Presenting even more difficulties are cultural barriers. For example, recently arrived immigrants may be reluctant to resort to the legal system when they come from countries where the legal system is a tool of oppression and judges, lawyers and police officers are among the oppressors. In less extreme cases, many people will face a barrier as the result of a fear of what they perceive to be (and not without reason) an intimidating, unpredictable and complex system. Less dramatic but equally important, difficulties arising from geographical location present considerable barriers for many Australians living outside population centres.</PARA>
<PARA>By way of illustration, we should look at the closure of the Launceston Family Court.</PARA>

Legal aid gives people proper representation before a particular court they may come to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation has developed to a point where a judge in the Family Court can request the legal aid commission in a particular state to provide support for representation for a child or children, and the legal aid commission&mdash;I know this has been the case in Victoria, for example&mdash;has, as it were, overruled what the judge has said, so legal aid has been refused. So a judge may request legal representation for a child, who may well be of tender years, who has absolutely no responsibility for the situation he or she is facing, who needs by the very judgment of the court that is hearing the case legal representation, but the legal aid commission concerned refuses that representation because it has insufficient funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Judges in effect are being overruled not in a court of appeal but by a legal aid commission, because of lack of funds is a very bad situation to have. Something has to happen. Either funds have to be made available or our legal system has to change. We as a community, as a society, cannot allow the situa tion to continue where people cannot, because of a lack of funds, exercise the rights we as legislators give them. It is wrong to have one group of litigants who are well endowed with resources and the ability to put their case against people who are much more disadvantaged because they do not have the resources of, if you like, character, education and experience to face up to an opponent or the funds to engage a lawyer to present their case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison spoke earlier about a father cross&hyphen;examining a child. One would hope that would not happen, but we can well imagine what would happen if a wife wanted to cross-examine her husband or a husband wanted to cross-examine his wife in circumstances which are quite vicious if the opportunity were presented to one party to be vicious against another and a judge felt disinclined to intervene because, if he or she intervened, the impartiality expected of judges may well be compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of lack of funding cannot be put aside by simply saying it is a budget measure and every area of our society and our community must take cuts. It is true that the government has been elected and the government has said there will be cuts. That must be taken into account, but I think we are avoiding our obligation to society and to those who are brought before the courts, whether it be the Family Court, a criminal court or a civil court, if we simply say that, due to budget measures, unfortunately some people cannot have representation. If we are going to say people cannot have representation, then we have to do something about the legal system. We cannot have it both ways. We have to change the legal system&mdash;perhaps make it more of an inquisitorial system&mdash;change the function of judges or do something, but we cannot in all conscience continue in the direction we are headed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that sitting on the opposite side of the chamber are Senator Ellison, Senator Coonan and Senator Abetz, all eminent lawyers in their own right. They would understand what I am saying. They, together with everybody who is a lawyer in this chamber&mdash;indeed, everybody who is in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7062"> chamber&mdash;have to face up to this crisis that has developed. I use the word `crisis' advisedly. The private profession says that the system is not as it ought to be. Clients certainly say that the system is not as it ought to be. Judges and chief justices say it is not as it ought to be. We really do have to face up to what needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This situation has gone beyond the party political stage. Certainly, in this chamber there are exchanges on a party political basis, and that should be kept going in this particular aspect, as with all aspects of society. But, above and beyond that, we have to solve this problem that we as a community are faced with and decide, as I have said a couple of times during this speech, whether or not we are going to change the system, increase the legal aid that is available or do a bit of both. We just simply cannot keep saying it is a budget problem and therefore do nothing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the matter of public importance, and I utterly reject the sentiments and assumptions implicit in the wording `the deleterious effect of the Government's cuts and higher fees'. The reason I oppose it is that, with the exception of Senator Cooney's contribution, what we have heard so far has been simplistic, piecemeal and even disingenuous in that those opposite have tried to explain the misery and failure of separation, divorce and domestic tension as being effected or contributed to by cuts and higher fees in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As with most areas of human behaviour, to begin to understand the complex processes of family law it is necessary to take a holistic approach not only to the families caught up in domestic conflict but also to the institutions that serve those families and provide the infrastructure to work through the problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I speak about this topic with some feeling because, in my early years as a legal practitioner, I did practise extensively in family law and I am currently a trained mediator, so I do have some considerable experience in this most difficult field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, in such a complex area as the dynamics of family breakdown, there needs to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be an ongoing evaluation of the Family Court and it needs to be charted as to how effectively it can deliver services and at what cost to both users and the community. Of course, the starting point is that the annual costs of running the Family Court now exceed $100 million. Added to that, just last year the report of the parliamentary Joint Select Committee into the Funding and Administration of the Family Court&mdash;headed, I might say, by South Australian Labor MP Martyn Evans&mdash;rejected calls for more Family Court funding. They said that throwing more money at this problem was not really what it required and they found that the court was living beyond its means like a person living on bankcard. There were some quite extraordinary examples of administrative costs. The chief executive was one example, having spent a little over $208,000 over four years commuting backwards and forwards between Sydney and Canberra. For the purposes of the Senate committee, the Family Court had some difficulty even articulating a comprehensive statement of what its core business really was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Few would dispute the need for the Family Court to make efficiencies to better streamline its administration. Given, of course, the $8 billion budget deficit that the government inherited, it was only fair and reasonable that the Family Court, like all federal departments, should shoulder its share of the burden in reducing public sector outlays and meeting budget savings targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Ellison said, it was not as if the budget cuts and the fees were just imposed on the Family Court. In fact, the Family Court was asked to consider how it might make these savings. Most of the litany read out by Senator Bolkus were efficiencies which the Family Court has made of its own volition. What is particularly short&hyphen;sighted about motions such as the one being discussed today&mdash;at least at the level of the discussion&mdash;is that they zero in on costs and fees without even acknowledging the substantial reforms and shift in focus in service delivery that underpin increases in the Family Court fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government recognises the value to families of access to primary forms of dispute <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7063"> resolution such as mediation and counselling, and the good sense of that is obvious. If you can actually assist people before their marriage or relationship completely breaks down, if you can work out what there is to salvage before they are embroiled in the adversarial system, it makes a great deal of sense to do so. In fact, it is perfectly obvious that it assists not only the individual partners but their children, their grandparents and, in fact, the community, if some way can be worked out without the cost, expense, delay and bitterness which inevitably follows an adversarial bout in the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To that end, the government's thinking is that these services are best delivered by a mix of court and community sectors in appropriate geographic areas. Part of the structure of the new reforms and fees highlights the important role that private and community based mediation services can play as alternatives to the Family Court. I would have thought that those on the other side would have welcomed the fact that the government is thinking creatively, in an innovative way, about how to emphasise the value of mediation based services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this belief that underlies the charging of a fee equivalent to that charged by community based counselling services for voluntary counselling access through the Family Court. The fee, of course, is $40 an hour, but only for voluntary counselling. So those poor unfortunate individuals, those poor unfortunate Australians, who end up in the Family Court as part of an adversarial contest will not be asked to pay for counselling or mediation. Of course, the thinking behind it was that it was inequitable, that some get the service free and others pay&mdash;it stands to reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do agree with Senator Cooney that there is something to be said for looking at how the Family Court can structure greater efficiencies. The legal profession clearly has a role to play in this. In the past, the legal profession has, from time to time, risen valiantly to these sorts of challenges. A cap on fees is just one such challenge. Aspects of family law have been around since 1974 in their current form with a few amendments here and there. But basically, while there can be complex cases, and there always will be, not every case is so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complex that it is going to be disadvantaged by the placement of a reasonable cap on a legal aid service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bourne talked about the fact that a lot of people are denied legal aid. But, of course, the numbers reflect people who may not have been eligible in the first place. That figure bears no relation to those who have been refused legal aid, who otherwise might have been eligible and who were denied legal aid on the basis that funds were not available. The figure is just nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney also talked about separate representation, which is an issue of great concern. Unfortunately, time is going to beat me on this, but the shift in focus to mediation, the imposition of increased fees on those who can afford it, the waiver of fees for those who cannot and the better targeting of delivery of services will ensure that the family law system is one that responds to individual needs at a time of the very greatest vulnerability.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Ellison and Senator Coonan have made valiant efforts to justify cutbacks. However, I note that both of them looked extremely uncomfortable about their justification, because it is very hard to justify cutbacks in such a sensitive area of public policy. I accept some of the comments that have been made about wastage in administration. I accept that savings could have been made in that area. However, the majority of the cutbacks I am concerned about are impacting on ordinary families. This decision comes from a government that went into the last election saying how pro family they were. However, every decision relating to the family seems to me to be asking the family to pay and pay again. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison said that none of these cuts would come as a surprise. I am sure that they will come as a surprise to families who will find out that the cost of a family law dispute will go from $368 to over $2,000. It may not come as a surprise to him, but it would certainly come as a surprise to those families. The user&hyphen;pays principle is a denial of justice. Senator Coonan obviously has experience and skills in mediation. I am sure she understands <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7064"> the hardship and emotional trauma that so many families go through. They do not need the additional burden of financial costs in relation to the provision of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on the public record some of the problems that we are facing in Queensland. The proposed changes will mean the closure of the Mackay family registry. The Rockhampton registry is still at risk and its future has not been clarified. The Cairns registry will not be upgraded. Plans to establish a Gold Coast registry have been abandoned. Outreach programs in Logan and Ipswich will not proceed. Anyone who knows Logan and Ipswich as areas of extensive populations will know that it is just not good enough to tell families there that they will have to go into Brisbane. It is a very dense population region. Outreach programs in those two areas are most important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only 19 of the 39 new Family Court counsellors will be employed. Clearly, that will impact on many thousands of families around Australia. The introduction of the user&hyphen;pays charges will mean $40 per hour for counselling services. Why would you go to counselling if you have a cost burden at that rate? Families are struggling as it is. They will not choose to use counselling, because it will be seen as too expensive. In those families where one or other partner, usually the male, is reluctant to go to counselling, that $40 per hour will act as a deterrent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cuts to visiting programs by judges, court staff and counsellors will result in a 50 per cent reduction in services to regional areas. I know that a number of people in Queensland are very concerned about the impact. I have a letter that I would like to read from the Family Law Reform and Assistance Association in Gladstone. I will summarise it, given the time. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our association protests in the strongest possible terms to the charges which will now be levied in Family Court matters contained in the coalition budget . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In case you are not aware it will now cost $460 to file for a divorce, $250.00 to file any application in the Family Court, $40.00 for a compulsory one half hour conciliation conference . . . <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Organisations such as this one are very disturbed about the impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, the Queensland Law Society Family Law Committee Chairman Peter Sheeley said that the major concern was for country lawyers and their clients, who would have to travel to major regional centres to have cases attended to and heard. Mr Sheeley said that successful counselling in the early stages could contain the costs of divorce to under $1,000 compared with bills of many thousands of dollars for protracted cases. He predicted that these higher charges could be very detrimental to many families, particularly regional families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to Senator Ellison's statement that these charges were not unexpected. I have a memo from the Family Court of Australia. That they were obviously surprised is evident from this five-page document that details just some of the cutbacks that will have to proceed and are now in the process of proceeding. There is the closure of the Bendigo subregistry. The delay reduction programs in Parramatta and Melbourne have been cancelled. Library subscriptions have been reduced by 50,000. When family law personnel cannot keep up with their reading, it is pretty petty of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outreach activities will be eliminated other than minor expense travel. This is in a country like Australia, where one-third of the population lives outside capital cities. There will be the non-replacement of Justice Butler in Launceston when he retires later in the year. Clearly, Launceston will be badly affected. There will be the closure of the Rockhampton, Wollongong and Geelong registries. Pre&hyphen;filing counselling and mediation activities have been abandoned. Senators have commented positively about mediation, yet this memo indicates that pre&hyphen;filing counselling and mediation activities will be abandoned specifically because of budget cuts. These budget cuts in family law, of all areas, simply indicate that the coalition rhetoric is inappropriate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, the Australian Labor Party innocently comes into this place and says how horrendous the government cuts are, as though they bear no responsibility for the reason we have to impose them. Do they think that one day we on the Liberal side of politics woke up, looked at ourselves in the mirror and said, `Let's cut the Family Court'? Of course we did not. Do you know what we did? We woke up one morning and found that the former Minister for Finance had misled the Australian people. Do you know when we found that out? It was on 3 March, the day after the federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Minister for Finance told us that the budget was in surplus and would be in surplus for the ongoing future. On 3 March we found out what a total fabrication that was&mdash;a $10 billion deficit. No matter how much the Labor Party interject on this, the reality is&mdash;and the Australian people know&mdash;they left this place in a terrible mess and, as a result, we have been required to make some of these distasteful cuts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Time is very short, but there is another matter that really has to be nailed, that is, the question of the fees. The people of Australia need to be reminded that over 40 per cent of Australians who will be accessing the Family Court will not be required to pay the filing fees because they are on legal aid or social security, or because their income is such that they will not be required to pay. Are you honestly saying that more than 40 per cent of the Australian population live in abject poverty? We did accuse you of creating a new underclass in Australian society, but we never went as far as to say that over 40 per cent were in that category. Even with a bit of political hyperbole, never did we accuse you of that. Yet 40 per cent of the Australian population will be saved from paying the fees and only 60 per cent of the community will be required to pay those fees. That is not an injustice. If you say that is an injustice, then you will create an injustice for the total Australian community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is quite important because the long&hyphen;term consequences of nuclear testing at Maralinga and also at Montebello are still with the Australian community, are still with many individuals who were affected by nuclear fallout and are still with the Australian landscape. The audit report basically goes into the project of rehabilitating the Maralinga site. Those who know anything about nuclear testing at Maralinga will know that it was a process that took place over a long period of time. There were a number of tests that occurred at Maralinga over a number of years which caused the nuclear fallout. They were above ground tests, airburst tests, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is principally in relation to the people who were affected by nuclear testing. All of the work at Maralinga and also at Montebello is carried out by a unit in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy known as the test site management unit. My concern is the veracity and the accuracy of the records that are kept by the test site management unit. I will illustrate what I mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, a friend's father died of cancer. He had been a national serviceman on board HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Culgoa</EMPHASIS>. Whether or not his cancer was attributable to his presence at the Montebello tests is a matter for debate. But what is clearly not debatable is the lack of accuracy in the records that are kept by the test site management unit. The test site management unit maintains that at 8 a.m. on the day in question&mdash;that is, the time at which the first Montebello test occurred&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Culgoa</EMPHASIS> was 1,000 nautical miles south-west of Montebello.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite impossible for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Culgoa </EMPHASIS>to have been there because, in fact, at midnight&mdash;just eight hours before the test&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Culgoa</EMPHASIS> went over the bar at Carnarvon to discharge the ship's cook, who, I understand, had appendicitis. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Culgoa </EMPHASIS>was only capable of a maximum speed of about 19&half; knots and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7067"> cruised at around 15&half; knots. Therefore, it was not possible for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Culgoa </EMPHASIS>to be at the site that the test site management unit claimed it was at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a reason for some concern, because the test site management unit is responsible for maintaining the records on which the servicemen and civilians who are claiming to have received cancer caused by nuclear fallout are reliant. In other words, they have to go and prove their case using records maintained by the test site management unit. If the accuracy of those records is so poor, we need to do something to ensure that the situation is rectified. When you see records that are so inaccurate, it is clear that something needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What honourable senators may not be aware of is that there was a special administrative arrangement to provide compensation for people who were affected by the nuclear fallout. That was put in place in 1989. But what occurred a couple of years ago was that the previous government substantially reduced the opportunity for people to claim. Now people only have a right to claim if the first signs of their cancer manifested themselves within 20 years of the test to which they were exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Montebello occurred in 1956 and Maralinga occurred through the late 1950s and early 1960s. There are very few people who, having developed the signs of cancer in 1976, would still be alive to claim in 1996&mdash;20 years afterwards. That is of concern to me. I believe that until further research is done, it is not possible for us just to wipe out the chances of those people to make claims for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned that there is an organisation of veterans who were exposed to the nuclear tests at Maralinga. Some of these tests were in fact very dirty nuclear tests&mdash;that is, they involved the destruction of plutonium devices at ground level and the detonation of nuclear weapons at close to ground level so that you create a large amount of radioactive dust, radioactive fallout. We still do not know the consequences of those tests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying, therefore, is that when we consider the rehabilitation of Maralinga we should also consider along with it the proper management of the human consequences of nuclear fallout and the proper management of those records.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the twenty&hyphen;first report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report provides an overview and analysis of the legal, economic, and social issues associated with the investment of superannuation savings. As such it represents an audit of some of the current market&hyphen;place trends and policy developments in the area of superannuation investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The purpose of superannuation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underlying its analysis was the Committee's recognition that the primary purpose of superannuation is to provide retirement income. The Committee was mindful that any changes to the superannuation system must reflect this fundamental principle.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7068"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considered the nature of investment generally and in relation to the trend toward globalisation. The report then examined the duties and obligations of trustees  and the history behind the development of those duties and obligations. In this context the report raised the concept of socially responsible investment and looked at some American examples. The more controversial concept of directed investment was rejected by the Committee. The report briefly considers the question of fraud as the issue was raised in some of the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Infrastructure and SMEs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report examined infrastructure investment and tax concessions. Evidence provided to the Committee suggested a degree of confusion regarding the intent and operation of these concessions. Accordingly the Committee has recommended that the relevant taxation provisions be clarified. The Committee noted the natural appeal that the long term nature of infrastructure might well have for superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also examined investment in small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) was examined in some detail. The report discusses some of the difficulties in matching the generally lower level of funding generally sought by SMEs, with the much larger amounts superannuation funds are seeking to invest. The Committee noted with approval the steps that are occurring in the market place to bring SMEs and superannuation savings together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Housing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee examined the relationship between housing and superannuation did not find a persuasive case for the draw down of superannuation savings for the purchase of a home. The report notes some difficulties which exist in the operation of the infrastructure bond provisions in relation to public sector housing initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing mortgage securitisation is regarded favourably by the Committee, especially given the role of this process in lowering interest rates generally for housing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Short&hyphen;termism</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Institute of Actuaries of Australia defines short termism as `a preference for an investment policy which seeks to minimise short&hyphen;term fluctuations in the rate of return on assets'. Superannuation funds have consistently been criticised for this investment practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Committee found that undue short termism can lead to problems for superannuation funds, it also discovered that there is an awareness among industry players of the dangers, and that the industry is taking steps to address this issue. The report recommends that the government should review and monitor superannuation policy and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation to ensure the maximising of retirement incomes is not being unduly affected by short term investment considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Broader social objectives</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final chapter of the report reflects the Committee's consideration of broader social objectives in relation to superannuation fund investment. An essential question implicit in the Committee's terms of reference was the compatibility of the furtherance of broader social objectives with the fundamental requirements on trustees flowing from the trust relationship and prudential control legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trust relationship is pivotal to our superannuation system. It has shaped its development to date, and has been its fundamental and defining characteristic. The Committee notes, however, the Budget announcement that a regime of retirement savings accounts is to be established outside the requirements of trust law and considers there is a need for Parliamentary oversight of such changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the report, the view taken by the Committee is that the primary aim of superannuation is to provide retirement income, and the law requires trustees to act at all times in the best interests of fund members. The furtherance of broader objectives, or socially responsible investment as it is sometimes called, is not necessarily incompatible with trustees' legal and fiduciary obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Committee was told of a large industry fund which had a provision in its investment policy statement that, all things being equal in terms of returns and risks, trustees will prefer a project or investment which had job creation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Choice</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the increasing emphasis on greater choice, the report recognised the need of superannuation fund members to have more information to assist in making their long term investment decisions. Members need greater eduction generally about the long term nature of superannuation, and specifically about kinds of investments that are possible within the regulatory framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National savings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee examined the view that Australia needs to develop a conscious national strategy to take advantage of the huge volume of superannuation assets in determining our social and economic future. As a result of the decline in public investment and trend toward privatisation, it has been argued that there is a need to harness superannuation for social and economic purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding some of the attractions such a view offers, the Committee is unable to accede to it. There would be insufficient parliamentary <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7069"> support for such a major revision to our superannuation system, especially given the development in investment patterns and financial markets that the Committee identifies in its report. Again the basic role of superannuation savings in providing retirement incomes needs to be emphasised. The assets of superannuation funds should not be regarded as a public asset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that people can self&hyphen;fund their retirement incomes, thereby reducing the pension burden on future taxpayers, and to the extent that increased domestic saving leads to higher levels of domestic investment, all Australians will benefit from the current superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My thanks go to Bronwyn McNaughton who was the Committee Secretary responsible for the preparation of this report. I should add that Bronwyn has now gone to work in the superannuation industry after only a short time with the Committee. Her predecessor left to work in legal practice in the superannuation area and it seems our Committee is becoming highly efficient in preparing people for further employment in this field!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Proceeds of Crime Amendment Bill 1996 forms part of my portfolio's significant contribution to the Government's task of achieving major savings in outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Proceeds of Crime Act by providing for the transfer each year of the net balance of the Confiscated Assets Trust Fund to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net balance will be calculated by deducting from the balance those payments that have to be made for statutory purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments that have to be made for statutory purposes include a prescribed annual management fee, payments under the equitable sharing program to the States and Territories where the Commonwealth has been able to recover proceeds because of the significant contribution of a State or Territory law enforcement agency, and payments by way of restitution to innocent third parties or where quashing of a conviction causes discharge of a forfeiture order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also offers increased payments into the Confiscated Assets Trust Fund and subsequently <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7070"> into Consolidated Revenue by extending the present equitable sharing program to the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed international sharing arrangement is intended to promote Australian law enforcement strategy by increasing the motivation of foreign countries to assist in recovering assets in their jurisdictions which are subject to forfeiture under Australian legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangement will authorise payment into the Confiscated Assets Trust Fund of payments made to Australia by a foreign country in recognition of assistance provided by Commonwealth law enforcement agencies; and it will give me the discretion to authorise payment to a foreign country where that country has made a significant contribution to the recovery of proceeds under a Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasingly, Australia needs assistance from other countries in relation to the investigation of sophisticated organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed sharing arrangement would provide an incentive to other countries to initiate or support investigations of Australian criminal activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia stands to benefit substantially from the arrangement, because the proposed sharing arrangement is likely to foster a net inflow of confiscated proceeds into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to be able to encourage and promote sharing with Australia of proceeds recovered by foreign countries, Australia must be able to reciprocate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangement is in addition to any other "sharing" of recovered proceeds which may apply when, under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987, Australia is able to have its proceeds orders enforced in a foreign country and the proceeds repatriated to Australia, or to enforce a foreign country's proceeds orders in an Australian court and return the funds to that country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to make my first speech to this parliament on a day that, for me, combines family significance with political history. It was on this day 60 years ago that my mother, who is in the gallery there today, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and my late father were married. Forty&hyphen;seven years ago on this day, the Menzies government was elected for what was to become a record term in government. I feel sure Sir Robert is here in spirit today, not for my speech but to follow the West Indies playing the Prime Minister's X1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, I come to this place proud to represent my state of New South Wales as a Senator. I am aware of the privilege and great responsibility and I am grateful to my family, mentors and the Liberal Party for the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to be a product of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party and honoured to have served it as President for the last three years. The Division has taken many difficult decisions in those years, decisions which have included performance assessment and enhancement by audit and, where necessary, candidate replacement. These measures, backed by a determined state executive, have delivered, on merit, to this the 38th federal parliament, a fresh team of young men and women to complement their more experienced colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A record 14 new Liberal members from New South Wales entered this parliament following the March election. The Liberal Party, without fuss or fanfare, and certainly without quotas or tokens, has led the way to deliver more women to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are proud that our team, this parliament and our nation is led by a member of the New South Wales Division, John Howard. He is a man who has all the qualities of leadership that are best summed up in John Buchan's `Great Captains' from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Homilies and Recreations</EMPHASIS>. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can make a catalogue of the moral qualities of the greatest captains but we cannot exhaust them. First there will be courage, not merely the physical kind, but the rarer thing, the moral courage which we call fortitude&mdash;the power of enduring when hope is gone. There must be the capacity for self&hyphen;sacrifice, the willingness to let worldly interests and even reputation and honour perish, if only the task be accomplished. The man who is concerned with his own prestige will never move mountains. There must be patience supreme patience under misunderstandings and set&hyphen;backs, and the muddles and interferences of others. There must be resili <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7071"> ence under defeat, a tough vitality and a manly optimism, which looks at the facts in all their bleakness and yet dares to be confident. There must be the sense of the eternal continuity of a great cause, so that failure and even death will not seem the end, and a man sees himself as only a part in a predestined purpose. It may not be for him to breach the fortress, but the breach will come. I add another quality . . . The greatest captains have laid their spell not only on the mind and spirit, but on the heart of their armies.</PARA>
<PARA>John Howard's battlers have long willed him to be Australia's Prime Minister, and I am proud to have been part of the army of Australians that created a new dawn on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also mindful of the long and outstanding service to the people of New South Wales given by my predecessor Michael Baume. Michael was the member for Macarthur from 1975 to 1983 and a senator for New South Wales from 1985 to 1996. Michael has always been a loyal servant of the state of New South Wales and the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pig industry will regret Michael Baume's departure from his honorary position as biographer of the life and times of the slickest piggery proprietor the industry has ever known. Michael gave a new meaning to `pig ties' as the proprietor did to porkies. I wish Michael all the best in his position as Consul&hyphen;General in New York.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a proud son of Junee&mdash;they say that half of Junee is in the gallery today&mdash;a town of 4,000 people, situated midway between Sydney and Melbourne on the main southern line. Junee, along with Werris Creek in northern New South Wales, is one of the great rail towns and rail junctions of New South Wales. We have had to adapt to the changing technology and the paradox of productivity and employment. Junee now has a greatly reduced dependence on rail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was during my time as shire president that the shire council, backed by strong community support, convinced the Liberal state government to allow the development in Junee of a drought proof employer&mdash;a long stay institution which also enjoys a high occupancy rate. I refer to the first privately designed, constructed and managed correctional centre in New South Wales, built by Theiss <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Contractors and operated by Australian Correctional Management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Junee community, like most bush communities, considers blood to be thicker than water. We are proud of a long list of high achievers who were born and raised in our shire. To name just a few, we sent Laurie Daley to Canberra to add a touch of class to the Raiders, Bernie Fraser to the Treasury and the Reserve Bank, and Ian Pike to be Chief Magistrate in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Junee is also fortunate to be 20 minutes from the `place of many crows', the dynamic regional capital of the Murrumbidgee Valley, Wagga Wagga, also known as the `garden city of the south'. Wagga Wagga is the largest inland city in New South Wales and home to 57,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of Wagga Wagga's prominent institutions include the Charles Sturt University&mdash;with a campus of 10,000 students including 500 international students; its flagship courses include wine sciences and equine sciences&mdash;the RAAF base, which is the primary ground&hyphen;training base to all three services; and the Kapooka army base, which is the headquarters of the 1st recruit training battalion. By 1999, Wagga Wagga district will also have a naval communications base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Several of Wagga's current home&hyphen;grown sporting heroes include the captain of Australia's cricket team, Mark Taylor, and his opening partner of 33 tests&mdash;sure to be back&mdash;Michael Slater. Included as well are the captains of both AFL grand final teams: Paul Kelly of the Sydney Swans, and Wayne Carey of North Melbourne. Beat that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from a large family. My mother is one of 14, my father is one of eight, I am one of seven. My wife, Margaret, and I have four children. Our home is simple Irish with many bedrooms and little carpet. Since leaving Joey's&mdash;that great institution&mdash;in 1959, I have lived in a world where there are more stars at night, where sunset is a work of art, where you freeze in winter and cook in summer. It is an environment where we have learnt from the ancient skills of our indigenous people and from the recent lessons of land care that man is merely the custodian of the land and that planet survival demands a certain order <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7072"> of our water, land, plants and animals&mdash;an order which when respected will provide for man. It is a world where words are rarely wasted and hard work, individual endeavour, fortitude, favourable weather and commonsense are basic requirements for success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to the Senate as the 16th Liberal Senator for New South Wales since the foundation of the Party in 1945. My initial observations in this place are that it needs more fresh air, it has many bookshelves whose books seem to be valued by the metre, words seem valued by time, many speeches are delivered to attentive walls, many conversations are ended by bells, and life is an endless meeting&mdash;and I would not miss it for quids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I am mindful that the cost to family life of political commitment is both high and well documented. I would not be here without the help of my Sydney foster family, Bill and Trish McPhee, the support of my family and my hardworking wife, Margaret, and my children, Kate, Will, Ted and Harriet&mdash;all of whom have had to make considerable sacrifices. They have always displayed much understanding and given me great support through the inevitable highs and lows of family, farming and politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one really understands what they mean to their own parents till they have their own children. I am saddened that the tide of life sweeps that meaning away for many people. For me, there are no more important words than the words I use to end every conversation I have with my children. No matter how robust and energetic these conversations are&mdash;and they seem to get more vigorous and assertive as the family gets older&mdash;the conversation always ends with a reciprocated, `I love you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We people from rural and remote Australia are a friendly mob. I found during early morning walks in Sydney with friends that saying `G'day' to other early morning walkers often invoked alarm. Madam President, you will be pleased to know after a few days we always broke down the barrier, and we had them all saying `Hello.' I am now working on the shy passers&hyphen;by in this place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My public life began in 1981 when the local baker, the late Ted Benbow, encouraged me to run&mdash;successfully&mdash;for a local government position on the Junee Shire Council. Then, in 1985, along with Alby Shultz&mdash;g'day, Alby; he is now the indefatigable Liberal State member for Burrinjuck but was then the dynamic field officer for the New South Wales Division&mdash;Ted got me to join the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not mind a bag of wheat for every time I have been asked, `Why are you interested in politics?' and `Why aren't you a member of the National Party?' Suffice to say, I have a strong view that the Liberal and National parties should recognise the changing demographics in Australia, end the ridiculous pretence of differing constituencies, set aside individual agendas and ego, and have the guts and determination to give up the horse and sulky logic and become one strong, united party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A decision to merge the Liberal and National Parties would strengthen the political hand of rural Australia, do much to strengthen cooperation and interaction between city and country and would be the most strategic political decision taken in recent political history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I joined the Liberal Party because it is best placed to represent all Australians. It is not dominated by sectional interests. It is owned by no one individual or group. It is a Party in which all members, whatever their station in life, can enjoy equal self-esteem. Unlike other parties which have to put up barriers to retain their constituency, we are about breaking down the barriers and uniting all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has one of the lowest participation rates by the wider community in party politics. It would probably be fair to say most Australians have a low regard for politics and politicians. Most believe that individuals can make no difference. Many have given up. I believe we can all make a contribution to a better Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first awareness of the national interest occurred when, as a young boy in the late 1940s, I attended an Anzac ceremony with my Uncle Kevin. I still remember when the bugle sounded the last post tears came to his <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7073"> eyes, and I cried because he cried. Later I discovered they were tears from a Changi-Burma line prison survivor. I then learnt of the significance of my uncle's tears, of the sacrifices and atrocities of war and how prejudices and ego often cause conflict. So was born my instinct for the national interest&mdash;an instinct that is far stronger than any ego or personal agenda, an instinct that has served me well, especially during my three years as Liberal Party president in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many times I have observed the capacity of all Australians to pull together during times of war and national disaster. Is it too much to ask of the beneficiaries, of such capacity, to pull together in times of peace for social justice and a fair go for every Australian? The great challenge of uniting Australia in these times of shrinking government resources includes the provision of services and infrastructure to those people who are the backbone of our primary industries and who live in rural, regional and remote areas to enable them to enjoy a lifestyle that does not deteriorate into an underclass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equal is the challenge in our towns and cities, where much of suburbia is filled with a generation of unemployed parents and children, isolated by poverty, with low self-esteem and a lifestyle where drugs and suicide are an everyday expectation and work is a faded Bob Hawke promise. These people need real jobs, not retraining for non-existent jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No less is the challenge imposed on this generation of Australians by the centuries of misunderstanding and neglect of our indigenous people. We must provide for the return to our indigenous people of their self-esteem: built up over thousands of years by their majestic mastery of traditional living, land custodial skills and timeless culture; broken down in 200 years by the inevitable exploratory nature of man, the intrusiveness of his machines, the enticement of his money and the destructive onslaught of his social habits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A paradigm shift is required and will only occur when provision is made for our indigenous people to progress, even in remote areas, from communal benefit to individual benefit; when access for all Australians to health, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education and employment is not distorted by location or station in life; and when, regardless of race, creed and colour, we purge those leaders who believe all should be equal except the equalisers and who see the often generous funds of government as the opportunity for a feast on which to fatten their personal circumstances while neglecting the famine. Unfortunately, when these predators of the public purse turn on, Australians who would normally be concerned and supportive turn off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to pay tribute to our primary industries. Primary industry, which is generally carried on in rural, regional and remote Australia and includes fishing, farming, forestry and mining, continues to contribute 75 per cent of Australia's net external earnings. Our regional cities, towns and villages that support our fishermen, foresters, farmers and miners are a vital part of that contribution, as are our rural women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our rural women are often taken for granted. Many run the farm, more often the farmer. Rural women display greater patience, more resilience and are generally better educated than are rural men. `Marry a teacher or nurse and droughtproof the farm' is still a well-known bush convention. Rural women often have to contend with droving, drafting and old harvest trucks, yet find the time to do the books, do the washing and ironing, cook the meals, oversee the homework, school excursions and weekend sport, water the garden and look like a lady of leisure for church on Sunday. Our rural women deserve a medal for holding together the spirit of family farming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our farmers are an endangered species. Despite the declining numbers of farmers, now down to 120,000, and an increasing average age, now 53; despite the drift to the coast and the fact that more people live in the western suburbs of Sydney than all of rural Australia; despite the decline of farm employment from 27 per cent of total employment in the 1920s to three per cent today; and despite the relentless decline in terms of trade for agriculture, our farmers and the world's farmers have to feed an extra 90 million people every year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7074">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We live in a world where 1.3 billion people lack regular access to fresh water, where 800 million people do not enjoy food security, where 185 million children suffer malnutrition and where 1 billion people have an income of no more than $1 a day. Population growth is wearing down Mother Earth and swallowing up our farming land and agricultural water resources. Twenty&hyphen;five per cent of the world's agricultural land is degraded and 25 per cent of the world's wild fisheries are overfished. If the world does not wake up, in 100 years there will be no tropical rainforest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of land from dryland agricultural production to urban development requires, in resource transfer terms, 1,000 tonnes of water to produce from irrigation 1 tonne of wheat. Many land scarce societies who face such transfers face the paradox of the reproductive rights of the current generation and the survival rights of the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great challenge in feeding the world will be to produce enough food at a price that is affordable to all without destroying the environment. Rural, regional and remote Australia has taken up this challenge. We have adopted landcare and our farmers are bonded to the land, often in a similar way to the custodial and spiritual ways of our indigenous people. They have stuck through drought, fires and floods, through good times and bad, they compete in world markets corrupted by the US and European treasuries and in many years have accepted fresh air and freedom as their only income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My tribute also extends to my bush companions, our indigenous people, who live in rural and remote Australia. I share their love of the land and their concern for the loss of their timeless culture. They, like myself, sleep many nights under the stars, understand the value of a campfire and can read Mother Nature, her seasons and warning signals. They, sadly, often live in a mire of low self-esteem, shunned by the passage of time and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Ian Ring, who published research this year on the health of our indigenous people in the cape, found no improvement in any major health indicator since 1976. On every indicator, Aboriginal and Torres Strait <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Islanders are disadvantaged compared with non-indigenous Australians. Life expectancy is 15 to 20 years less for Aboriginal people, while infant mortality is three times higher. An Aboriginal baby born today has still, despite our best efforts, only a one in three chance of living to the age of 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years, try as many have, we have failed these people. They, like our jackeroos, drovers, shearers, shearer's cooks and all rural dwellers, are a precious part of Australia's culture. All these people need not feel isolated and forgotten. They will have a champion for their cause in me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been easy for many Australians to stir, by fax, phone and emotion, the melting pot recently introduced to this parliament by an Independent member of the House of Representatives. That universally poisonous melting pot of candour, criticism, blissful ignorance, fear, poignant truth and racial undertones is not peculiar to Australia, but it has tempted many in the media to report that speech with glasshouse headlines which invoke basic territorial jealousies, tribal instincts and human inconsistencies&mdash;headlines which trigger the pollsters and cult figures but which blatantly ignore the issues that unite Australians and overlook the proven capacity of Australians to embrace our `fair go' ethic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strength in the fabric of Australian society has always been the woven cloth, never a single thread. Our woven cloth has always included some threads of individual failure, tragedy, injustice and intolerance. The same cloth held threads of success, fortitude, self-sacrifice and compassion. We should not allow the thread of discontent spun from one speech in this parliament to unravel the fabric of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Social inequity and disadvantage cannot be simply identified and isolated on a map. It is not determined by birth, bound by creed or colour, nor solved by worldwide days of recognition. Madam President, visiting Australia's disadvantaged by airconditioned car or bus or through the eye of the TV news is a comfortable First World response but no solution. Providing a real world solution will require Australians from all walks of life <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7075"> rolling up their sleeves and opening up their hearts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite all concerned Australians to answer a call of feet, hands, hearts and means to establish a care corp&mdash;volunteers whose sole task would be to identify the priorities of disadvantage within Australia and act to alleviate them. By giving up a week of their time or a few days pay, not once but year after year, to marshall the resources of both government and the able in our community to overcome the plight of the most disadvantaged and needy in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our Governor-General, Sir William Deane, has recognised the collective plight of our disadvantaged as the most important problem facing our nation. If we can maintain the volunteer ethic in areas as diverse as firefighting, Meals on Wheels and international aid, then surely we can provide volunteer supervision and target community ownership of programs to rebuild self-esteem and refurbish essential services to our disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only a strong economy will fund from income the compassionate side of government, `the true measure of good government'. Bold initiatives will produce a strong economy, real jobs and real wealth. Australia is ready for an era of bold initiatives, an era of national savings and real wealth creation. Like the Snowy Mountain scheme of the 20th century, we need a plan for the 21st century&mdash;a plan which will bring cohesion and long-term benefit to all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our plan should include a very fast train which adopts an inland route and has passenger and freight capacity and time lines to link our capital cities. The VFT will break down the barrier between city and country, curb the environmentally destructive urban sprawl, open up development corridors for the next 100 years and be the bridge to the 21st century. It will take Australia from a country retiring to the coast, living on welfare and resting on its laurels to a new frontier for development with job opportunities and excitement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also harness some of the millions of megalitres of fresh water that flows annually into our northern tropical seas. This water resource can be used to open up <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some of the last tracts of virgin farming land available in the world. Such a plan would recognise that in a world of shrinking land, mineral and water resources Australia has much to offer. It would also allow many remote communities, both black and white, a lifeline to higher self-esteem and a train ride to better health and education facilities and employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our plan should also include research and development to allow the construction of mass transit systems, a vital strategy to meet Australia's commitment to reduction in greenhouse gases and addressing the looming fossil fuel crisis. Why can't we also develop technology to recycle the millions of megalitres of sewage polluting our seas and break the nexus of a throwaway society and a mountain of garbage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my own state of New South Wales, the development of an inland international air freight terminal would be a catalyst to restructure and vertically integrate the Murray-Darling farm enterprise and provide a long-term solution to salinity and degradation by water and land management practices. With the added value of workplace reform it would allow Murray-Darling farmers to competitively enter Asian supermarkets as fresh food suppliers to three billion people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, the paradox and urban consolidation and urban sprawl, public and private transport, productivity employment, the myriad of environmental issues, clean air, fresh water&mdash;we buy fresh water now; will we eventually have to buy clean air?&mdash;are not some trendy `Greens' issues; they are our issues. They are planet survival issues which will not be solved by lobby groups, radical political agendas or single issue political parties. These issues will only be solved by government achieving interaction and understanding between city and council, between the various competing energies and agendas and between the producers and the users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent years, Australian taxpayers have remained largely unaware yet committed to subsidising from future tax revenue $120 billion worth of unfunded state and federal public sector superannuation. We have tolerated a public purse which has allowed rights to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7076"> overpower responsibilities and build in billion dollar rorts; an archaic tax system that taxes battlers and the thrifty, yet allows taxable profits in key industries to be exported by foreign owned and vertically integrated companies that use transfer pricing; and a 13-year fire sale of Australian equity in key export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have allowed our agricultural industries to have their disease free status and marketing edge threatened by political agendas and world trade predators. We have ignored the development of our national infrastructure, yet allowed Australian superannuation savings to develop foreign owned offshore infrastructure. We have largely ignored the vast underdeveloped water, land and mineral resources of Australia's far north. Is it any wonder we cannot fund hospitals, schools or house the homeless?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who can fix all of this? We in this chamber can. We can ensure our children and future generations inherit from us a social, economic and environmental climate that is safe and secure, that Australia remains a great place to raise a family, breathe fresh air and drink clean water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Madam President, every time I hear the bugle sound the last post, I am reminded that I belong to a generation that has never been to war, has taken much and given little. I am reminded that the debt we all owe to earlier generations of Australians cannot be repaid but merely serviced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My aspirations are bound by the honour boards of past campaigns in both war and peace. My commitment is to reward the individual, unburden the dependent and protect the vulnerable. My hope is that in walking the tightrope between rights and responsibilities the balance will always be maintained in Australia by the peaceful democratic processes of our parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My dream is that on the day of my last speech in this chamber I will be able to say that I have served in a parliament whose members have all put the nation's interests ahead of their own; a parliament which has robustly discarded as un&hyphen;Australian the morays of the eighties and its legacy of greed, corruption and debt; a parliament which has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promoted a fair go for all as the spirit of Australia; a parliament which has delivered the opportunity for all Australians to enjoy independence of means and mind; and, finally, that my contribution in this place will be judged by my fellow Australians as worthwhile. My only wish then will be that God allows me to return with my family to the peace and tranquillity of the bush. Thank you very much.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.26 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the luncheon adjournment, Senator Harradine suggested that this clause be considered in conjunction with his other amendment, which deals with a reference to the economics committee. I do not disagree that in one sense they should be taken together. I do not know whether under the standing orders they can be put together or whether there has to be a vote now. Whichever way it is, I indicate on behalf of the opposition that as presently structured and presently proposed by Senator Harradine both this clause, this amendment and the subsequent amendment which goes to the end of the committee report referring the issue of preference shares to the economics legislation committee will be opposed by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will oppose them for reasons which have already been alluded to but which I will now refer to very specifically. We have said to Senator Harradine on a number of occasions both here and elsewhere that to refer his proposal of a redeemable preference share to the economics committee to be considered and for that committee to report on 26 March only to delay this bill for its proclamation date till 1 May makes the work of the committee basically irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be a useful exercise for some to see further debate and discussion about the general principle of the redeemable preference share. But, to have any impact on this legislation, the very least Senator Harradine should do is change his amendment to accord with something similar to what Senator Margetts has proposed: that the third reading of this bill be held over or recommitted subject to the response of the report coming down by 26 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7078"> Quite frankly, as we have said before, even if the committee members unanimously agree that there was great merit in Senator Harradine's proposal, once the legislation is through, the government will comfortably wait till a proclamation date of 1 May, pro claim the bill and say that was a very interesting report. It will be tabled on 26 March and, at some stage in the future, it might be considered by some officer in Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they will have their bill. They will proceed with the direct privatisation of Telstra, and anything to do with redeemable preference shares, irrespective of the recommendation, will have no impact at all. I have to say that, as an old wily campaigner in the Senate now for 21 years or more, I am surprised that Senator Harradine would let the government get away with this particular proposal that there be no cut in of the legislation having to be dealt with in its final third reading subject to the report of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before on a previous amendment, I think Senator Harradine has undersold himself and his proposal. He has now circulated to many of us his detailed reply to the response of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to his redeemable preference share proposal. I think he is quite proud of the fact that he has pointed out some errors in the Treasurer's response. To us, that would mean it is even more imperative that he tie the report of the committee he has proposed consider this matter to that response, saying, `You cannot have a third reading of this bill automatically until the committee's report is dealt with by the Senate and is taken into account in the debate on this unparalleled legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not get a second chance at this. We will not be able to say in six or 12 months time, `We will try to unwind the partial privatisation of Telstra.' This legislation, if carried, with the associated processes being got under way, will be a defining moment. No parliament will be able to unwind it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine knows that. It is for that reason he has proposed the redeemable preference share&mdash;that, at some stage in the future, if the parliament chose to support a government, it would be able to buy back the one&hyphen;third shares so that Telstra could be maintained in 100 per cent public ownership. We believe that the opposition cannot support this particular amendment because it would indicate to people that, firstly, we may be going soft on our total opposition to privatisation and, secondly, we would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> willing to take part in a process that is fundamentally flawed on the principle of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also say again to Senator Harradine that he now is, I think, almost the equally longest serving senator in the chamber. He is a senator who has strongly supported the evolution of the committee processes of this Senate, both on the reference side and the legislative side, going right back to the initial reforms of Senator Murphy in the early 1970s or late 1960s. He has been a strong supporter of the standing committees of the Senate being able to deal with both legislative issues and references on matters of broad concern to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators, we all know, whether in government or opposition, that the workload on all of those committees is pretty heavy. Whether in government or opposition, all of us have to serve&mdash;except if you are lucky enough to be a minister&mdash;on a number of standing committees and reference committees. Senators have to juggle a lot of time and arrangements to put the time in to attend committee hearings and draft reports. It is not easy work. Much of it is underrecognised by the general public and even the media covering the goings-on of parliament. I would have to say my observation is that most senators on all sides of parliament accept that responsibility and that onerous work very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But again I say to Senator Harradine: there is enough work on all of these committees without asking those members of the economics committee&mdash;the half dozen permanent members as well as the participating members&mdash;to serve on that committee and then find out that whatever work they do, whatever recommendation they bring down, the government can chuck it in the bin. It can just say, `Nice report,' drop it in the bin and then say, `Well, that was nice, but we are going on to proclaim our legislation', irrespective of any recommendation. Even if that recommendation was unanimous, it goes straight in the bin, with no opportunity to ask the government to reconsider&mdash;not just ask it to reconsider, but force it to reconsider because the bill would not have been finally completed if we go along the road of Senator Margetts's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7079"> amendment to say we have a chance to deal with it at the third reading stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to Senator Ferguson, who is the chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, whose members are from all sides, `You may be willing, because you are a loyal member of the government, to spend your time'&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">

When I was chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee I never accepted any reference after having been told, `The report will be dropped in the bin and be ignored.' I do not think you, Senator Ferguson, would want to accept that responsibility and then find whatever excellent work you had done could be ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, Senator Harradine, we make one last appeal to you: please look at amending your amendment, particularly at the adoption of the report of the committee stage, to allow the bill to be held over until your committee reports back. That is the only effective way you will get coverage of your proposal&mdash;it is not anyone else's; it is your own proposal&mdash;of redeemable preference shares. We believe that is the only effective way for the Senate to handle this. Otherwise, this will be the mickey mouse of all committee work I have ever seen in my time in the Senate&mdash;and I do not think that is a justifiable thing to do to any Senate committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously there will be a large number of potential investors and conservative funds&mdash;for example, superannuation funds&mdash;looking for a type of investment such as this. I suggest to the committee that we should allow this to proceed so that those investors will be able to make those submissions. You might say, `Okay, we can hold a gun to the government's head.' Who will be issuing the shares? It will be the board of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All right; you could say, `The government could instruct the board of Telstra to raise the capital by way of issue of redeemable reference shares.' They could do that. But if the committee, for example, came forward with recommendations that the redeemable preference share option was a desirable and viable option and one which would attract the amount of money that is being sought&mdash;that is, $8 billion&mdash;why would the board of Telstra adopt that particular approach? After all, the investors may be looking for some sort of security which redeemable preference shares would give; those shares would give the type of security and preference over ordinary shareholders that these investors may desire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They may not and probably would not want to simply buy ordinary shares, because they are not interested in running an organisation such as Telstra. They are not interested in buying up, as it were, part of the assets of the organisation. They are interested, however, in getting a guaranteed result in a preferential manner; thus they would be able to do that through the redeemable preference share option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up until now it does appear that the government has been following the advice of Treasury. Honourable senators would have the letter of the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;obviously written by the Treasury&mdash;and honourable senators would have my responses. I want to refer to a couple of points made in the Treasurer's letter. For example, on page 1, paragraph 4, of his letter to me, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra would be required to pay a 9 per cent annual return to investors for a 15 year period, at which time shares could be redeemed at the original $1 issue price. That is, your proposal would have very similar characteristics to Telstra issuing $8 billion in debt. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, depends on whether the redemption is optimal or whether it is mandatory. There is a wide range of options for the design of redeemable preference shares, ranging from fixed coupon cumulative preference shares, the redemption of which is mandatory, to participating non-cumulative preference shares, the redemption of which is optional at the instance of Telstra. It is therefore not correct, in terms of either legal or economic analysis, to say that the proposal to raise finance by way of redeemable preference shares is similar to raising $8 billion in debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extraordinary that the Treasurer should be advised in that manner. I would suggest to this chamber that Treasury has a great deal to answer for in regard to this matter. I would be very interested to hear from the Treasurers of the various state governments. I am sure they would be most interested in the outcome of the Senate inquiry in respect of redeemable preference shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the Treasurer indicated that the government wanted to have a situation where the issue would enable the company, Telstra, to respond to fluctuations in the market&mdash;that is to say, it being open to market fluctuations would have some effect on the efficiency of the organisation. I can understand that. I pick up what the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I note the importance of market signals in applying pressure for continuous improvement in the management of public sector trading enterprises such as Telstra. The partial sale of Telstra will significantly assist in achieving that goal.</PARA>
<PARA>My response to that is that participating preference shares, for example, where the dividend varies with the ordinary dividend, do have a fluctuating value and do give market signals as to perceptions of management efficiency in so far as that contributes to increased profitability. That is confirmed by the literature. It is all contained in the material that I have distributed to honourable senators. I understand the minister may have seen that&mdash;I asked that it be distributed in the chamber. I seek leave of the chamber to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  a copy of the Treasurer's letter to me of 3 December 1996&mdash;the Treasurer, with my approval, made this public last week&mdash;and my initial responses to that letter.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Harradine</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 2 September 1996 to Senator Alston in which you outline your reservations about the partial sale of Telstra. As foreshadowed by Senator Alston in his letter to you of 21 November 1996, I am responding to the technical issues raised in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset, I note the importance of market signals in applying pressure for continuous improvement in the management of public sector trading enterprises such as Telstra. The partial sale of Telstra will significantly assist in achieving that goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your letter raises an alternative financing option to the partial sale. This alternative option has been the subject of careful and detailed consideration by the Government. Schemes such as the one proposed by you have received serious consideration from the Government as they have been put to the Senate Inquiry into Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The model you suggest envisages Telstra issuing $8 billion in redeemable preference shares, then making this amount available to the Government through a partial `buy-back' of existing Commonwealth shares in Telstra. Telstra would be required to pay a 9 per cent annual return to investors for a 15 year period, at which time shares could be redeemed at the original $1 issue price. That is, your proposal would have very similar characteristics to Telstra issuing $8 billion in debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An issue of this nature would be without precedent in Australia. In fact, market analysts advise that it is highly questionable whether Australian and international markets would be sufficiently receptive to raise $8 billion from such a security. For this reason alone, it is doubtful that an issue of redeemable preference shares would return to the Commonwealth the equivalent proceeds of an ordinary share issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if such a raising was possible, it would have the effect of significantly constraining Telstra's financial capacity as it would be required to maintain existing operational levels while at the same time servicing a substantial additional liability but without the corresponding asset base which would be transferred to the Commonwealth. In raising the company's debt to equity ratio from 31 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> per cent to approximately 70 per cent, thus placing Telstra at the lower end of its international peer comparison range, the proposal would be likely to be viewed negatively by commercial ratings agencies and may lead to a significant drop in Telstra's credit rating. This would have the potential to compromise the company's future financing and operating flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also needs to be borne in mind that the cost of borrowing envisaged by the proposal would be above the Commonwealth's current borrowing costs. As a result, the ongoing cost of servicing the debt raised by Telstra through the redeemable shares would be higher than the ongoing costs of the same value of sovereign debt to be retired with the proceeds. Furthermore, as the proposal would effectively represent a transfer of debt liability from the Government to Telstra, it would not permit a reduction in overall public sector debt levels as is envisaged by the partial sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your proposal also raises some fundamental taxation issues. You are probably aware that the issue of attaching franked dividend income to debt-like instruments has received considerable attention by government and the tax administration since the introduction of the imputation arrangements in the mid 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proliferation of tax financing schemes led to the enactment of specific anti-avoidance provisions designed to prohibit the transfer of franking credits and other tax benefits by dividends which could reasonably be regarded as equivalent to the payment of interest on a loan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular arrangement you describe would be likely to be caught by these provisions. The legislative amendments required to allow the franking of `debt dividends' would have wider application than to Telstra with consequent effects on the integrity of the tax system and the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also mention that the nature of imputation precludes the franking of (deductible) interest. Imputation was introduced in order to remove the effect of income being taxed in the hands of a company as profits and being taxed again in the hands of its shareholders when distributed by way of dividend. The relevant income is distributed out of a company's earnings after obligations, such as interest payments, are met. Payments of deductible interest do not distribute taxable income of the company and should not receive the benefit of imputation credits. Allowing such payments to be franked would not have the effect of relieving double taxation but of sheltering from tax otherwise taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst on the question of imputation arrangements, I note your suggestion that publicly owned companies operate at a competitive disadvantage because their shareholder governments cannot <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7082"> utilise any franking credits which they may accumulate. If there is a disadvantage it is not to the company: its tax liability is the same whether its shareholders are taxed at normal tax rates, reduced tax rates, or are exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general question of State-owned enterprises is dealt with by the Statement of Policy Intent on the taxation treatment of government trading enterprises, agreed at the 1994 Premiers' Conference; otherwise the basis for the imputation arrangements is that there should not be double taxation on that part of a company's profits that is passed to shareholders by way of dividend. Having regard to the fact that governments do not pay tax the issue of double taxation does not arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your proposal also raises a potential difficulty with the Corporations Law under which Telstra operates. This relates to that aspect which would see a capital sum paid to the government for the explicit purpose of financing the Heritage Trust. Section 162 of the Corporations Law prohibits a company from undertaking an act other than in pursuance of its objectives. With such clear intention attached to the arrangement proposed it would be difficult to argue that the funds transferred to the Commonwealth were for Telstra's business purposes. The Government could not contemplate an arrangement which breached the Corporations Law in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust the above comments serve to explain why the Government believes that the partial privatisation route remains the most appropriate course to achieving its policy goals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston is aware of the contents of this letter, and the reasons it discloses for the Government's decision to follow the partial privatisation route. However he has indicated that he would be happy to address other aspects of your letter should you require that.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This ignores the question of a natural monopoly. Markets are concerned about return on investment. Increased returns on investment may indicate either more intensive exploitation of a natural monopoly (which represents a tax on other businesses and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumers with all its adverse effects) or an improvement in management efficiency (which is wholly desirable).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The example of a 9 per cent fixed dividend preference share for 15 years was an example only, as previously indicated. In fact the coupon yield would be likely to be substantially less, as indicated by current stock market yields and taking into account the imputation credits likely to be available. Redemption need not be mandatory but optional at Telstra's wish. There are a wide range of options for the design of redeemable preference shares ranging from fixed coupon cumulative preference shares the redemption of which is mandatory to participating non&hyphen;cumulative preference shares the redemption of which is optional at the instance of Telstra.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed sale of Telstra is an unusual event. There are plenty of precedents for the issue of redeemable preference shares. Whether the shares are ordinary shares or preference shares the size of the float will be equally unprecedented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In fact, market analysts advise that it is highly questionable whether Australian and international markets would be sufficiently receptive to raise $8 billion from such a security."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the perceptions of market analysts there is no signed supporting documentation attached to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7083"> Treasurer's letter. Who are these analysts? Where are their experts' reports? Generally the market is willing to buy any security&mdash;it is all a question of portfolio preference and pricing, weighing up the outlay versus the return. Given the unprecedented size of the proposed transaction, it would be reasonable to expect that Parliament have the benefit of fully reasoned experts' opinions, and valuation analyses of different options for raising funds from Telstra. The extreme demand Australian investors have for fixed interest paper (SBC estimates a $20 billion shortfall in suitable domestic paper per annum) would mean that even a non-participating redeemable preference share would be highly attractive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . it is doubtful that an issue of redeemable preference shares would return to the Commonwealth the equivalent proceeds of an ordinary share issue."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one has ever suggested that redeemable preference shares are worth the equivalent of ordinary shares. The question is whether redeemable preference shares can efficiently raise $8 billion for the Commonwealth while retaining the Commonwealth's underlying rights to Telstra's natural monopoly assets. Ordinary shares locked into a one third minority may have to be offered at a greater discount to underlying value than redeemable preference shares. The question is not just how much money the Commonwealth gets in but what value it is parting with in return for its money. A freehold sale of land will always bring in more money than the sale of a 30 year leasehold of the same property but a leasehold sale may better preserve the wealth of the seller.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Servicing dividends on participating non-cumulative preference shares need involve no more additional liability than servicing dividends on ordinary shares.

The arguments advanced show no evidence of serious consideration of participating, non-cumulative or optional redemption preference shares. Hybrid equity of this sort is not even <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> innovative, any more, in the United States market.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasury has a tendency to describe as "tax avoidance" anything which reduces the revenue even if it is a long established commercial practice such as the issue of redeemable preference shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apparently, the Treasury took the view that redeemable preference shares are essentially a tax avoidance device and wished to eliminate them through section 46D. This policy view may be disputed, since redeemable preference shares were used for decades before income tax was imposed. Further, in the absence of a full integration system of company tax which would impute losses directly to shareholders, arrangements to use up company tax losses are necessarily either non-neutral or a form of tax avoidance. Indeed the Asprey Committee in 1975 recommended carry back of losses and flow through of losses for small companies!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasury's attempt to distinguish between ordinary dividends and debt dividends was essentially misconceived. In Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 5) of December 1989, Treasury introduced a severe tax penalty widely thought (not always correctly) to outlaw redeemable preference shares. If a company paid what Treasury described as a "debt dividend" (not clearly defined) not only did the dividend lose any imputation credits but the dividend was taxable in the hands of the recipient while the company was denied a tax deduction for the "debt dividend".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not clear that redeemable preference shares are necessarily caught or should be caught by the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7084"> provisions relating to so-called "debt dividends". Treasury-speak about the "integrity of the tax system" is nonsense when it is realised that the tax system is creating unjustified distortions against flexible financing instruments for companies and generating more fragility in the corporate sector when recessions come. Removal of tax distortions was one of the key themes of the FitzGerald report on National Saving. Denial of imputation credits to capital protected equity is a Luddite response to pro-savings financial innovation. It would be absurd to allow pseudo&hyphen;arguments about the so-called "integrity of the tax system" (which rest on ignorance of basic tax theory) to prevent serious consideration about the most advantageous way for Parliament to ensure the public receives the greatest benefit from its Telstra assets.</PARA>

One may also note that section 46D actually imposes double taxation because franking credits are denied to so-called "debt dividends" yet these payments are not deductible.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If there is a disadvantage it is not to the company. . . "</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because Government owned companies cannot raise capital from taxpayers who can use franking credits they are at a competitive disadvantage in terms of a lack of flexibility as between debt and equity capital raising. The Industry Commission recognised in its inquiry into Charitable Organisations in Australia (Report No. 45, 16 June 1995, p.318) that the imputation system does bias the investment decisions of tax exempt bodies which cannot receive refunds of imputation credits for company tax levied on their portion of taxed company income.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis for the imputation arrangements is that company income should be imputed to shareholders and they should get credit for the tax paid by the company on their portion of the company's income. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Given that the logic of imputation is that company tax is essentially a withholding tax paid by the company on behalf of the shareholders, there is no logical reason why imputation credits should not be refundable in cash as is the case with excess PAYE instalments. As the Treasury (1986) has pointed out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Some Economic Implications of Takeovers</EMPHASIS>  Treasury Economic Paper No. 12, AGPS Canberra, has pointed out, the logical imputation of full imputation is that "there would be no company tax as such on company income but, as a withholding arrangement companies would make a tax payment which was deemed to be a prepayment of personal tax on the share of total company income in which its shareholder had an interest." Yet Treasury shrinks from its own logic and denies shareholders cash refunds.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is gratifying that the Government would not contemplate breaching the Corporations Law, this paragraph appears to involve some basic ignorance on the part of the Treasury Department of the Corporations Law which has been recently transferred to its administration. The Treasury seems not to understand that section 162 relates to the abolition of the ultra vires doctrine. The power to buy back shares is conferred by the Corporations Law and shareholders are free under section 117 to dispense with an objects clause in any case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 162(2)(b) simply provides that where the memorandum of a company contains a provision stating the objects of the company and the company does an act other than in pursuance of those objects then the company contravenes the sub-section. However there is no legal requirement for a company to have an objects clause at all&mdash;nor has there been any such requirement since 1 January 1984.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to try to get a handle on what we are actually proposing here. As I understand it, it is quite possible that the legislation will get passed by 13 December. Senator Harradine has proposed that the royal assent is deferred until 1 May. He also proposes that we refer to a Senate committee the process of investigating the redeemable share option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be curious and interested to know what the Telstra board is going to do in the light of that. Are they going to wait until we get the report of the committee? As Senator Harradine pointed out, should they assume that the redeemable share option is a good option or are they going to proceed&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's right, Senator Schacht, I think they will, too; in fact, I think they already have. Or are they going to proceed to secure someone to buy the 33&frac13; per cent of Telstra? Senator Harradine, if it was the case that the Telstra board waited until this committee reported and came down <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with its recommendations, and if it did come down with the recommendation that the redeemable share option was a real option for them, why aren't we passing the legislation? Why are we dealing with the legislation now? Why wasn't the redeemable share issue considered in the first reference to the economics committee, because it was around then, and it was something that had been talked about? If we were treating this genuinely, it ought to have been referred as part of that reference at least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This surely points out that there is no way that this can be treated seriously either by the government, who have made their decision very clear, or by the Telstra board. If they were here today, I think they would say to us, on the one hand, that it is not good business practice to proceed with one decision to sell a third of Telstra and, on the other hand, to proceed to investigate another option. Surely, that must place pressure on your ability to sell something&mdash;if that ultimately ends up being the decision. It has the capacity to affect the value. If it was in a private sector business dealing, people would write it off as being stupid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we should not pass it. If Senator Harradine was deadly serious about this being treated seriously, we would not pass the legislation, because it involves the very essence of the credibility of a committee delivering a report. As you said&mdash;and I think you are right&mdash;it would be one of the most significant references that the economics committee would be likely to have if it was not going to be usurped by a decision to pass legislation which has a preset date for royal assent. The committee's credibility would be undermined straightaway and its recommendations could not be considered logically or taken seriously.</PARA>

They have nothing whatsoever to do with any additional funds that might be available in relation to the fund itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say in relation to Senator Harradine's comments that the government takes the view that, by having this matter examined by a Senate committee, there will be an opportunity to test the various proposals in a way, as Senator Harradine quite rightly says, that has not been available until now. In other words, the process that has been gone through has essentially been a private one, where people have responded in writing to the various ideas and proposals contained in Senator Harradine's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By allowing the matter to be tested before a Senate committee, there will be public scrutiny of the issue for the first time. As Senator Harradine says, there will be public accountability by Treasury officials, who will be required to subject themselves to cross-examination and explain the logic and thinking behind their assumptions. They will have the ability to test the assumptions themselves. There will then be available just over five weeks between the date of that committee report becoming available and the date on which this bill would come into effect. There will be a five-week period during which the government will be able to take into account not only the report itself but also the public reaction to the report. It can also assess the matters that may for the first time have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7088"> explored in much greater depth than is understandably available when you are simply asking a government department to provide raw material upon which a minister would finally sign off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you should not jump the gun. You should wait until you see what is contained in that report. It is rather breathtaking that neither the Australian Democrats nor the Labor Party has shown the slightest interest in this issue, yet they get up today and argue that this is the only way to go and that we should scrap any thoughts of privatisation and simply endorse a proposal for redeemable preference shares. If they have had such a massive conversion to the cause that they now think it is a very commendable initiative, the least they could do is participate in the committee hearings and test the proposition to its ultimate conclusion. If they are not, it is quite clear that the only reason they have moved that amendment is to attempt yet again to delay the process.</PARA></SPEECH>

Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7091"> Cooney and Senator Margetts rightly raised the question as to whether the Senate had control over this bill once royal assent occurred and once the date of operation commenced&mdash;and that is 1 May. I agree entirely with what they have said. That is perfectly clear. That is clearly the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, having made my decision in respect of the matter, I believe that to do otherwise than I am doing now would create a great deal of uncertainty in the market. I believe that that uncertainty should not be there. It would not be appropriate for me to do anything that would contribute to that uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the market and certain players in the market will be most interested in giving evidence to the committee. But for me to do anything other than what I am doing would, I believe, have the effect that I have suggested. You can disagree, as you do, with my judgment. But, having made that judgment, I believe to do what I am doing now is certainly better than what the bill has in it at present&mdash;that is, to enable the government to proclaim it virtually as soon as it gets through the house and receives royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least we have until 1 May. It gives the government from 26 April to 1 May to consider the outcome of the committee. So I am not intending to change my view on that. If that short&hyphen;circuits things here and sets the matter up for a vote on my proposition, I think that might be the most desirable way to go.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course! I have observed the last 10 years of your experience in facilitating debate, Minister. After very brief discussions with the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine, we have agreed that the most substantive amendment still left&mdash;other than the one which will be involved at the end of the committee stage&mdash;is the one which restores the minister's power to direct.

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its cooperation in changing the order of the running sheet so that we can deal with this item. As I have said, the opposition opposes item 25. First of all, the opposition still is fundamentally opposed in principle to this bill for the one&hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra. We strongly oppose it. Whatever amendment is carried or not carried, we will vote against the third reading and the carriage of this bill. In principle, we fundamentally oppose the privatisation, either in part or in full, of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, in view of the deal and arrangements made between the government and some senators, I have to accept, from the numbers, that the reality is that the bill on those votes may be carried. Therefore, the question for the opposition, if the bill is going to be carried against our strong opposition, is: what is in the best national interests of the Australian people from the operation of a partially privatised Telstra?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An issue we have fought for, through the references committee in the middle of the year, is that the power of the minister to direct the board and to direct Telstra be maintained. It was an unequivocal recommendation by the opposition and the Democrats in the Telstra report earlier this year that that power should be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be said that, even with the partial privatisation of Telstra, 66&frac23;of the shareholding of Telstra will still be maintained by the government on behalf of the Australian people. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) have said that there will be no more moves to sell any more of Telstra at least until there is another election. Of course, it cannot happen without it coming back to a vote of both houses of parliament.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="RAY" NAMEID="UI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you want to bet the Sydney Harbour Bridge on that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator, I will not take you up on that bet. I am taking them at face value. That is what they have put on the record. They have said it will not come back to the Senate unless there is an election in the meantime. So that will be for some <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7093"> time in the future, until the people decide otherwise in an election which they could use to claim a mandate. Of course, we will always strongly oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that when you own two-thirds of the shares of Telstra&mdash;of any company&mdash;that shareholder should have the right to say what is going on in that company. It is in the national interest. Telstra will be the dominant carrier of telecommunications in this country for the foreseeable future. Australians&mdash;85 per cent&hyphen;plus&mdash;will continue to use Telstra in full or in part to get telecommunications services. That is in the national interest. That is a natural monopoly, according to Senator Harradine. He says, `This means it is a natural monopoly.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it will be very odd when, under the structure that the minister has put forward, the minority shareholders will be able to start dictating, under the Corporations Act, to the majority shareholders&mdash;the Australian people&mdash;the best outcomes to maximise the profit, against the interests of the majority. That is what will happen. In Corporations Law, minority shareholders have certain rights. What will their rights be? To maximise profit. For example, in an estimates hearing recently, we had confirmation from Telstra that, when they get rid of 22,000 workers, the bottom line profit to Telstra will be increased by $600 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would imagine that the private shareholders&mdash;the directors&mdash;involved in that third will say, `We want that redistributed to dividends,' to maximise their return on their investment. That is what they would do. It is not unnatural. It would be a perfectly natural response for minority shareholders to get back as quickly as possible through dividends the money on their investment. But that may not be in the best national interest of Australia, for the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the AIDC example showed, the minority will hold the majority to ransom under Corporations Law. Unless the power of the minister to direct is put back into this legislation, we will have the worst outcome&mdash;even worse than it is now. It may be one&hyphen;third privatisation but, in effect, full control will be given <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the private sector, to the private shareholders. That is what is going to happen if we do not put this power back in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw to the attention of the minister, who will strongly oppose this, that in only the last few days the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) said in relation to legislation to establish an employment agency run by the private sector, the Public Employment Placement Enterprise Ltd, `We will maintain the power of the minister to direct.' I draw attachment 1 of the statement to the attention of the committee, particularly Senators Colston and Harradine. If Senator Vanstone believes she should have that power in relation to that enterprise, why should it not apply to Telstra? Attachment 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will also be open to the minister to direct the provision by the company, at reasonable cost, of employment services in the public interest. This will ensure that the government has the capacity to cover any situation where employment services need to be delivered in a location but where the market has not responded in the tender process and no other arrangements are available.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Vanstone said. She is not exactly noted for an impeccable performance as a minister in this area over the last nine months. She has woken up. She wants protection in the national interest. Even though this is a fully privatised operation, she wants to hold the power of the minister to direct, to get outcomes in the national interest. If it is good enough for Senator Vanstone and that new private enterprise arrangement, it ought to be good enough for the minister to retain the power to direct in the case of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senators Harradine and Colston: you have reached arrangements on issues relating to employment and provision of services, particularly to regional Australia. If this power of the minister to direct is not maintained, you are relying on extraordinary good faith&mdash;forever and a day. The one thing you will be able to do to meet your commitments as far as you see them is to know that the minister has the power to direct. You will be able to go to the minister and say, `This deal is not being met.' If you let this provision go through as is, and the minister says, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7094"> `But the board of Telstra said something different and I cannot do anything about it,' the minister will be dead right. But, if you have this power to direct put back in, you will have some negotiating power with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the minister will say that the power to direct has not been used since Telstra became a GBE, we all know that the fact it is there has an influence on the board and in the informal discussions. The minister, in his own statement issued last week, headed `Telstra's presence in Tasmania and Queensland', stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past few weeks I have been working with Telstra to identify some of the implications of their current three-year business plan for Tasmania and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>If they do not agree to have talks with him, they all know that he can actually direct them. Remove that power to direct, and there will be no talks. It just will not happen. Once that symbol of ministerial power is removed, the informal discussions will stop. I believe that is the most pressing issue we are now faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we want a Telstra acting totally in the commercial interest at the behest of the minority shareholders, a la what happened with the AIDC? The way they acted was a considerable embarrassment and it affected the program of the government accordingly because they could threaten to sue. Do we want the same to happen with Telstra? Of course we do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be issues from time to time over the next few years as we want to develop, as Senator Harradine wants for Tasmania, the high quality telecommunications system and broadband services. Senator Alston has said that there are no plans by either Telstra or Optus to roll out broadband services in Hobart in the foreseeable future&mdash;none whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, if we want it for Tasmania then at least we can get it by the minister directing Telstra to do it, so that some of the $20 billion capital works program of Telstra over the next five years will be spent in Tasmania or other regional areas. That will be to make sure that we have a telecommunications network throughout Australia to which all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australians have equal and equitable access. We in the opposition make no bones about it: we believe this power is there for the public good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if Telstra is privatised by a third, we give notice here and now that, if this power to direct is taken out, when we get back into government we will take every action possible to restore this power to the act. We say that now so that potential investors do not go around the place saying that they have been ambushed about this. We will take every possible action to restore this to the act if it is taken out during this process. We think it is much better in the national interest that this bill be amended now to maintain the power to direct so that we do not have to go through that process and so that all investors know what they are buying with Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These investors will know that the power to direct is in the act and that if they try to abuse the power of Telstra, this natural monopoly that Senator Harradine so aptly describes, the minister's power to direct will be able to be used for the benefit of the national interest, not for the benefit of minority shareholders interested in only one thing&mdash;profit&mdash;irrespective of Australia's national interest. Of course, a third of the third will be foreign investors. They have only one absolute interest&mdash;profit. They will not be interested in serving all Australians. They will not be interested in jobs in regional Queensland or southern Tasmania or anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the issue of the minister's power to direct is fundamental. Being a shareholder representing 66&frac23; per cent and then giving up and saying that you have got no power at all, that you cannot direct your own directors because they will then be taken on by the minority and the minority will sue accordingly, really is abdication by the government against the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say quite bluntly that I appeal to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston on this particular measure to support this in the national interest and also in the very narrow view of ensuring that they have got the leverage to deliver the arrangements they have made by the minister still being able to direct Telstra. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7095"> This is a fundamentally important issue and our amendment is to restore that power, as it should be.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the power of the minister to direct Telstra in the public interest is retained. The Department of Finance made two key points concerning this issue in their submission to the Telstra inquiry. First of all, they argued that the removal of the minister's power would make no difference because it is a power which has never been used. We would argue that that is simply nonsense. If its removal makes no difference then surely neither does its retention. In our view, irrespective of whether or not the power is explicitly used, its very existence can create an influence on the board's deliberation and that is a very good reason for its retention. The point of this argument is not difficult at all to grasp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the Department of Finance argued that the retention of that power in a partially privatised Telstra would be inappropriate since it could potentially amount to a power that could disadvantage minority shareholders in a way that would be inconsistent with provisions of the Corporations Law. Our advice, however, suggests that if the government want to retain this power then they can do so. Undoubtedly, its removal will enable the government to attract a higher sale price but will weaken their ability to direct Telstra to act in the interests of the majority shareholder. I remind the senator that that is the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people want Telstra and indeed the government to act in the interests of the public&mdash;something we have not seen a lot of lately, I have to say. For the government to reject this power is to implicitly admit that they do not want the power to govern in our national interest. If the dictates of the market or the interests of corporations do not accord with the interests of the public, then so be it. These are the outcomes that the government is obviously prepared to live with. As far as I am concerned, a government that does not want to govern in the public interest is not a responsible government; it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> simply a government trying to avoid its role and its duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Retention of the power to direct Telstra in the public interest does not mean that the government need to run the company or to intervene in a heavy&hyphen;handed manner. It simply means they retain the power to direct in the public interest should the need arise. If, as the government has argued, Telstra will continue to be responsive to the public interest following the one-third sale of Telstra then the government will not be required to use this power. But I would argue here that its retention will act as a safeguard for the  Australian public. It is for this reason the Democrats support the removal of this clause.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is attempting in this bill to remove the express power for the minister to direct Telstra. Whatever the arguments are in relation to that, you have really two choices. You either have a government being a shareholder on behalf of the public in a major asset, playing by the same rules that it expects other shareholders to observe in the corporate world, or the Commonwealth retains a privileged position. If the Commonwealth wishes to retain a privileged position, I and many people would argue that it would be better that it retained Telstra as a wholly owned Commonwealth asset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the government has no intention to do so, I would also argue that the throwing away of that ability to direct is very unwise. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7096"> It flies in the face of many assurances that have been given about how Telstra will operate in a post-privatised or partly privatised environment. It must be remembered that Austel will not exist in its form after next year. The functions of Austel will be divvied out amongst a number of entities and a large number of the functions of Austel will be taken over by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern about the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is that, once again, there is no real control by the parliamentary process. We are actually taking much on trust and we are entering into a very different environment from what we are in now. I have mentioned the Gambotto case before and it has been mentioned by a couple of other speakers. It was a High Court decision, Gambotto v. WCP Ltd 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this case, the majority shareholder held over 90 per cent of the shares. The principle that came out from that case was that it is not possible for the majority shareholder to oppress the minority shareholder. Perhaps the government could clarify whether or not they believe it will be possible for the majority to oppress the minority. I think it is very odd indeed that, with all of the assurances by government about what will and will not happen in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, pricing and service, to a large extent they are putting almost total faith in the market to do all of these things. If the market does not, there is no comeback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and the government will be stepping back from that and saying, `This is a majority public asset, but we are not going to give ourselves the ability to intervene in any way if our blind assumptions do not turn out to be true.' I think most people's concerns are very real in relation to the actual decision making that can and cannot take place in relation to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the example of the AIDC, as has been mentioned, the government board member was put under a lot of pressure not to even attend meetings where issues of confidentiality were being talked about. It became very difficult for that member to provide that information. There is the ability <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for certain information to be provided to the government, but you still have problems under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would argue that the very least that we need to do to address those legitimate concerns in the community amongst workers in the industry, amongst unions, amongst customers, amongst consumer organisations&mdash;you name it&mdash;is to continue to have that ability, used or unused, for intervention in case those assurances are not met.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not spoken at any great length in the committee stage of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996, but I do want to speak on this amendment. It is an absolutely A&hyphen;grade essential amendment if the government is to have any direction over Telstra in the future. I say that because, for the last two years of the Labor government, I was the minister for industry. Within my portfolio was the AIDC, the Australian Industry Development Corporation. For reasons that are public, the AIDC was partly privatised when my predecessor Senator John Button was the minister for industry. We privatised 18 per cent of the AIDC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During my period, the cabinet decided to sell the lot of the AIDC. What happened then was that we found the holder of the majority shareholding in the public interest could not get access to the documents of the AIDC for the very good reason that the rights of minority shareholders under Australian corporate law are protected. That is a very good principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a principle that arose because in the eighties the corporate cowboys of this country flogged off corporate entities left, right and centre, irrespective of the rights of the minorities. For example, Alan Bond is on charges in Perth at the moment. The hour after the Bond Corporation took over Bell Resources, they went in and asked Bell Resources to write a cheque for $1.2 billion and hand it to the Bond Corporation, which they did. They were a shareholder. The minorities had no say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That needed to be protected, and corporate law upholds the rights of minorities. So when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7097"> I, as minister, holding about 82 per cent of the shares of the AIDC, wanted to conduct a due diligence study in order to ready the AIDC for the sale of the other 82 per cent, I could not. The head of my department, Sandy Hollway, who is a respected public servant and who is now the head of DEETYA under this government, was my nominee on the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He could not talk to me about the affairs of the board. He was disbarred from doing that as a director. We were unable to conduct a due diligence study. Therefore, the AIDC was not sold. What we then did was buy back the minority shareholding. We bought it back so that we could have control of the company so we could then ready the whole damn thing for a float, not just 18 per cent of it. That is what happened. You would think that an 82 per cent shareholder would be able to influence a board decision. It cannot. It cannot in that sense, and we could not. I think it is absolutely essential for an entity like Telstra to have the reserve powers of ministerial authority. It is absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators might recall the debates that we had in this chamber last year. When the AIDC board realised that the government was stymied, the first thing they did was put up their salaries. The outgoing Managing Director of the AIDC claimed a retirement package and a salary package over $1 million. I was questioned in this chamber as to how I, as a responsible minister, could allow salary enhancements of that order to go on when the government was preaching wage restraint to ordinary Australians. I was not allowing it, but I could not stop it. And I was the 82 per cent shareholder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seriously say to the government, and not just to the Independents on whose swing vote this may revolve, that once you sell a minority shareholding of an agency such as this, you automatically introduce into that agency the desire for it to make a profit and to reward those people who have bought those shares as an investment. That is in contradistinction to the service obligation that the organisation has and which we as a government will insist on.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But under corporate law the rights of those minority shareholders are protected and they can insist too, with considerable force, that their interest has to be met. This sounds a bit like the immovable object meeting the irresistible force. What happens in those circumstances is that ways are found around it. Unless there is the reserve power of the government or the strong presence of the government, then you will find that all sorts of things that are not in your interest as a government or as a minority shareholder occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were a cynical person, I would not tell you this. Being a cynic, I would sit back and allow you to be embarrassed in that way and then have a go at the whole idea of privatisation because of that embarrassment. But it is absolutely essential that this point be understood in this chamber because, once we vote on this bill, there is not going to be a second chance to come back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone is in any doubt about anything I say, do not believe me but go back and look at the circumstances of the AIDC. At that time the Department of Finance said to us, `Well, look, we want to float the AIDC, but we do not want the government to have a controlling interest or a golden share'&mdash;as the debate was at that time&mdash;`because that may well affect the price we get at the float.' That is true, it may well affect it. Some investors will be adverse to that proposition and not want to invest if they think that they, as investors and shareholders, cannot help form the policy directions of this organisation in certain areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a risk that you take when you part&hyphen;privatise; that is a risk that you have to accept when you part&hyphen;privatise. If you do not, you surrender the control of the whole organisation, and you might as well then have privatised the lot. Talking about being part-privatised when it comes to the corporate sector is a bit like talking about being part-pregnant.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.03 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I will deal with Senator Cook's point. The bill includes specific provisions to overcome any problems that were reportedly experienced with the AIDC in relation to the provision of information to the Commonwealth. It is a pity that you did not know this before you came in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New sections 8AD and 8AI of the Telstra Corporation Act would impose reporting obligations on Telstra and ensure that the exclusive provision of this oversight information to the Commonwealth does not breach the Corporations Law. New sections 8AQ and 8AR oblige Telstra to assist the Commonwealth in the conduct of a Telstra sales scheme and ensure that the provision of relevant information to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the sale of Telstra shares does not breach the Corporations Law. In the case where Telstra shares were sold in more than one tranche, these provisions will remove any argument that existing minority shareholders in Telstra are being unfairly treated by the exclusive provision of information to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to understand what occurs at the present time. Since Telstra became a government business enterprise in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1991, it has been obliged by the Corporations Law, governed by the Corporations Law, to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. That does not allow the board to act uncommercially, nor has any government sought to request it to act uncommercially. As we have established, there have been no directions given under this power. In other words, there has been an acceptance since 1991 that the company ought to act commercially. To the extent that you want to impose any social obligations over and above the company, you do that by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the scheme that governs all government business enterprises. That is the concept of a community service obligation. You impose on a company an obligation to do something that it would not otherwise do. You have provisions in relation to untimed local calls because, otherwise, the company would presumably want to act commercially and charge on a timed local calls basis. You impose price caps because you take the view that it is important to ensure that the benefits of new technology and productivity gains are passed on to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in a number of instances, the parliament recognises that to allow a company to act commercially will not always deliver social outcomes that the parliament regards as important. The parliament can then step in and take action, as we are doing in relation to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. In other words, it is a reasonable proposition to assume that neither Telstra nor any other carrier or perhaps service provider would be likely to provide services in rural and remote areas to the extent that some people might desire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is the world of difference between making a budget allocation providing funds to ensure that that is done in a proper and transparent manner so that everyone understands how it is occurring and, on the other hand, having an arrangement whereby you can ring up the company surreptitiously&mdash;and Senator Schacht says that you do not have to do it by giving an official direction; you simply lean on them. What that does is provide endless opportunities for political <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7099"> interference to achieve political objectives.

What sort of basis for decision making is that?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no basis for the suggestion, which I think was made by Senator Margetts, that somehow the Gambotto decision will mean that the tail is wagging the dog&mdash;the government will be able to exercise its power as a majority shareholder because it will have two&hyphen;thirds of the shares. The argument that the High Court decision in the Gambotto case means that the affairs of Telstra must be managed in a way which treats the interest of the minority shareholders as paramount is simply not correct. There are no provisions in the Corporations Law or any court decisions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which put minority shareholders in such a privileged position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gambotto case dealt with the situation where the articles of a company had been changed by the majority shareholder to expropriate shares held by minority shareholders. The High Court's decision in that case confirmed that a majority shareholder must act in the interests of the company as a whole, not just promote its own interests, and must not act in a manner which treats minority shareholders unfairly. The government accepts that it should not treat minority shareholders in Telstra unfairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill, therefore, overrides the Corporations Law only to facilitate the sale process and to ensure that Telstra is properly accountable to parliament. In other words, there has always been a doctrine of law that protects minority interest from oppression. You cannot say, `Simply because I've got the numbers on the board, I can do what I like. I'll make decisions in my interest and to hell with the minorities.' That is not the law, nor should it be. That is simply what the Gambotto case reinforced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said to you, the last thing that democracy and the people at large should want to see is a government having the ability to say, `We've got a couple of marginal seats. We want you to roll out services in those areas.' You dress that up and call it the national interest. The national interest is as long and as broad as you want it to be. No-one has ever attempted to define the national interest in any specific way, because it simply is the ultimate judgment that a government makes about what it ought to do and to what extent it ought to be accountable to the jury of public opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the way to run a company. If members of the public bought some of the one-third shares that are on sale, do you really think they would be happy with the ability of a government to step in and tell the board that it ought to act non-commercially, that it ought to somehow take your view of what the national interest is, that somehow it ought to regard itself as being a social entity? It is not, and it has not been since 1991; the world changed then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until that time it was simply a government department, effectively, and you could do what you liked with it. But the whole concept of corporatisation was to require government business enterprises to act commercially. That is why the power contained in section 9 has never been used. Governments have understood that there is an inherent contradiction between saying that the company ought to act commercially in the best interests of the shareholder, in the sense that they get higher dividends and profits, and giving the company the power to ensure that it passes on the benefits to consumers, that it actually does cater for people by way of lower prices and a better quality of service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can do all sorts of things that you might regard as being socially desirable or in the national interest. But, if you do it in the context of telling a company which ought to be acting commercially that you will require it to somehow not act commercially because you want it to act in some other way, you are defeating the whole concept of a government business enterprise. It is no longer that. It is simply a government entity or department that does whatever the government of the day wants it to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not think we had ever taken that view of Telstra. The view we have taken since 1991 is that we want it to compete effectively and deliver the best quality services at the lowest possible prices, and, to the extent there are any shortfalls in that, we impose certain requirements. If we say it would not otherwise have provided untimed local calls, we legislate for them. If we say it would not otherwise have provided services in rural and remote areas and we want it to do that, we impose a universal service obligation to ensure that it happens and we recoup the funds quite transparently from other carriers&mdash;and on it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to impose a customer service guarantee, as this bill does, when the company might not otherwise choose to do it, you impose it by legislation. The company then has the certainty of knowing that there is a legislative background against which it is required to operate. Consistent with that, it then takes commercial decisions which deliver it the capacity to compete effectively against existing or new players.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can imagine the frustration of people listening to this debate today on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. There is some ability to gain information under the bill, but I contend that if this bill goes through the government will not have the ability to act on it. We have all these assumptions. We have heard the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) talk about the ability in the future to be able to make appropriations&mdash;that is, to try to fix up muck-ups where those community service obligations are being provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the reality is, if the power to direct has been taken from the minister and the government, who has that power? The power is in the board. The Gambotto case, I contend, is relevant. It is not possible to oppress minority shareholders. You are trying to maximise the price of this partial privatisation of Telstra because people are expecting to make a profit. They are not going to be buying Telstra in order to provide a public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, basically, you could provide as many little packages of parliamentary appropriations as you like but you cannot force the entity you are creating to use them. They can say it is not in their interests to service. Even if you provide capital funding, they might decide, because you do not have the power to direct them, that they do not want the expense of servicing that capital. They might decide that you do not have the ability to even make them use your appropriations. That is the reality. You can appropriate for all you like, but you have lost that ability.

<TIME.STAMP>(7.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I present to the Senate tonight a progress report on the implementation of the policies in the coalition's special Tasmania package, which formed a key part of election commitments to Tasmania. The Tasmania package was unveiled by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in Hobart in February. Barely nine months have passed and already Tasmanians are reaping the very real benefits from policies contained in the Tasmania package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania, due to its physical isolation and smaller population, has borne the brunt of Labor's 13 years of mismanagement. It was not just Labor's reckless handling of the economy which hurt Tasmanians but an attitude under Labor that the needs of a small state like Tasmania counted for little. We saw that attitude again the other day from Senator Kernot over the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. Tasmania's best interests were too often sacrificed on Labor's altar of political convenience. Decisions were taken in Canberra to win the votes of people in Melbourne and Sydney at the expense of Tasmanians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to speak tonight especially about the Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation scheme, because it represents a new era of opportunity for Tasmanians. One of the most exciting components of the package is the passenger vehicle equalisation scheme. It is already providing a very welcome injection of confidence and growth for Tasmania's important tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme is modelled on the freight equalisation scheme, which was introduced in the 1970s by the Fraser government. It operates on the very fair and straightforward principle which seeks to equalise the cost of travelling Bass Strait with a car with what other Australians pay when travelling interstate on federally funded national highways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the introduction of the scheme on 1 September, just under six months since the coalition took office, the results have been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite simply spectacular. In the eight-week period to the end of October, there had been a 49 per cent increase in passenger bookings on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS>. For the current financial year, passenger bookings on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spirit of Tasmania</EMPHASIS> are up by more than 30 per cent, to 166,563 passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The increase in passenger vehicle bookings has been a massive 93 per cent. Importantly, 70 per cent of the new bookings were for travel south from Melbourne to Devonport. The unprecedented surge in calls to the TT Line reservations centre has led to the employment of eight extra people to cope with the demand. These are the very real, positive and immediate results of just one component of the Tasmania package. We are looking forward to a continuing growth in the number of people crossing Bass Strait with their cars and entrenching the concept of a national highway link between the mainland and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of the scheme also puts to rest the harping of the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MURPHY" NAMEID="FX5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator Murphy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Passenger numbers have actually gone down.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And we are hearing that harping again right now from Senator Murphy&mdash;and demonstrates just how out of touch they were. Labor had no credibility on the Bass Strait transport issues in any case. Last year, despite growing enthusiasm for the rebate principle, Mr Keating came to Tasmania and told people who wanted to get to the mainland that they could fly across Bass Strait, and there was no need for a passenger vehicle rebate scheme. Tens of thousands of people, travelling with their cars, have since proven him wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Faced with the prospect of defeat in Bass at the March election, Labor produced, in Mr Keating's words, `a great big lump of money' to buy a new fast ferry. Such was Labor's commitment to the issue&mdash;a minute&hyphen;to&hyphen;midnight decision to throw a lump of money at Bass Strait instead of a considered and long&hyphen;term solution. However, Labor missed the boat and the coalition rebate scheme has proven itself a vastly superior option which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7103"> has been well received by Tasmanians and people travelling to Tasmania from interstate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth remembering that the Labor Party in Tasmania had a carping approach to the scheme, none more so than Senator Shayne Murphy just prior to the introduction of the rebate scheme. Special segments of the visitor market are already finding the new scheme beneficial. For example, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> of 11 November reported:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Record numbers of Victorian anglers have been enticed to Tasmanian lakes over the past week by the Bass Strait fare subsidy, the Freshwater Anglers Council of Tasmania said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Executive officer Harvey Taylor said that record numbers of Victorians had visited Arthurs Lake and Lake Burbury in their own cars and boats last weekend and during the week.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Taylor added that, thanks to the rebate, it was now very economical for interstate anglers to visit Tasmania's renowned lakes, and he expected the numbers to keep rising.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MURPHY" NAMEID="FX5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator Murphy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's true.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps Senator Murphy does not like the competition at the lake. George Mure of Mures Restaurant in Hobart said only on Sunday that his business had increased by at least 15 per cent since the passenger equalisation scheme. On my recent visit to the Tasmanian tourist bureau in Melbourne, they said that they had not seen bookings like it since about 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has also reaffirmed its longstanding commitment to freight equalisation. The coalition will put the scheme on a rolling five&hyphen;year basis, assuring Tasmanian business and industry of much greater certainty than ever before. Until now, the freight equalisation scheme has been little more than a year to year proposition. A review of rates of assistance for freight equalisation has been under way. There has been concern in some quarters that the federal government is cutting support for freight equalisation. It is not. By putting the freight equalisation scheme on a five&hyphen;year basis, we are shoring up the scheme, and putting it on a much more certain footing for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Tasmania package, the coalition has fairly and squarely tackled the transport <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disadvantage caused by Bass Strait. We now have both passenger vehicles and freight covered by equalisation schemes which are delivering substantial and long&hyphen;term benefits to Tasmania, and it is no thanks to a Labor government that either of those measures were put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning now to the Nixon inquiry, the Tasmania package also contains several other significant initiatives which should be mentioned. One of them was a review of Tasmania's employment and industry to update the Callaghan report of 1976. The inquiry will be chaired by Mr Peter Nixon, who is extremely well qualified for the task. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> at the weekend, there was a very interesting article by Michael Lester on an interview with Mr Nixon, and a description of how well qualified he is for the job. As a former senior federal minister, he has extensive experience in government and industry. His inquiry has wide ranging terms of reference, which basically seek to identify opportunities for Tasmania to develop its economy, the issues which need to be addressed to make that happen and the strategies which should be put in place. It will be an important report which will help chart the future for Tasmania and focus attention on opportunities for our state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has also committed funding for the cleaning up of Tasmania's waterways. Eight million dollars will be spent over three years to improve water quality and social amenity in the Derwent, Tamar and Huon rivers. Funding has also been provided for further work to improve the water quality of the King River and Macquarie Harbour on the west coast, both of which have been degraded by mining operations over the past century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the very special role played by Tasmania's rivers and waterways in our fishing and tourism industries, and various recreational pursuits, this initiative will be of enduring benefit to all Tasmanians. It also underlines the importance this government places on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also supporting significant projects in our cities and towns which reflect the diversity of the Tasmanian experience. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7104"> Launceston, the federal government is providing $7 million over three years to continue the Inveresk rail yards project started by the previous government. That will have immense social and cultural benefits for the city and northern Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The project has already taken shape under funding provided, as I said, by the previous government. The funding to be provided by this government will ensure that the project realises its full potential. It is a visionary project which has generated great excitement, and full marks go to all those who have seen its future potential. An open day is to be held at the Inveresk site this Saturday, and I would encourage as many people as possible to visit and see how the revitalisation of Inveresk is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmania package also included a promise of funding of $2.5 million over three years for the International Antarctic Centre which is being created at Salamanca Place in Hobart. As you know, Hobart has an historic and continuing connection with Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another project that reflects some of the Tasmanian heritage is the axemen's hall of fame project at Latrobe in the state's north-west. The sport of woodchopping may not get the media attention or following of some of the better established sports, but it has had a long and colourful history and has widespread popular appeal. The government will be providing $150,000 over three years towards the establishment of a hall of fame to help preserve and promote this intrinsic part of our heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tasmania package is a visionary and comprehensive collection of initiatives specially tailored to the unique needs of Tasmania as an island state. The measures announced in the package and now being put into place will be of lasting benefit to Tasmania. They are a real recognition of the concern which this government has for Tasmania and the emphasis it gives to helping Tasmanians develop special opportunities for their state. It gives me great and deep satisfaction that the new coalition government has already taken strong action to honour its election commitments to the people of Tasmania and to give them hope for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel a little sorry for Tasmania that the ministerial statement by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) had to be relegated to the adjournment debate. However, I do not intend taking that any further. In last Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> , hidden away on one of the back pages, was an advertisement for a consultancy to review the operations of the Office of Government Information and Advertising. That organisation has been a matter of controversy. But I should stress that criticism by me and Senator Bolkus is directed at the ministerial committee and not this group. It is typical of this government that, having run into troubles, they attack the organisation that behaved with propriety and leave the ministerial committee alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To save this government a consultancy fee, let me give them some advice for absolutely nothing, if they want to clean up this area. If they want to clean up government advertising and the tendering process, they should review and reform the ministerial committee on government communications. The first step they should take is to remove Mr Grahame Morris, the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), from this ministerial committee, and they should do it right away. The first two contracts awarded in advertising and public relations went to their mates. These were people who had worked intensively on the federal election campaign in 1996 and had worked directly for Senator Minchin and Mr Grahame Morris when they were state directors of the South Australian Liberal Party. They also worked for the Country Liberal Party. Senator Collins has well documented their scurrilous activities in that territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This started on 15 May, when Mr Toby Ralph sent a letter to Mr Grahame Morris advising them of their great interest and involvement in the gun buy&hyphen;back advertising campaign. He  starts that letter by mentioning Ted Horton, who was the other key person involved in the Liberal advertising campaign. He suggests to Mr Grahame Morris that it <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7105"> would be a good idea if they got involved. When you turn to the back page, there is a rifle with the caption `It's time to bite the bullet'. That was to be their theme if they won the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found out that DDB Needham Adelaide was not on the OGIA register when OGIA was searching for firms to bid for this in a limited tender. Mr Grahame Morris, the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister, wrote to Ms Cathi Moore, the acting director of OGIA, and said, `There is no doubt in some ministers' minds.' He was extolling the virtues of DDB Needham. We asked questions of each of the relevant ministers, such as the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams), the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) and the Prime Minister, none of whom Mr Morris had discussed this matter with. The document sent to Ms Cathi Moore is an absolute farrago of lies. It was developed to impress upon a public servant that ministers had formed this view when the view was only in Mr Morris's own head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we pressed this matter through questions on notice, we were given the following answer. The question was whether Mr Grahame Morris had raised this with ministers. This is the answer given:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Morris has advised that he had no formal or informal meetings about the DDB Needham concept, nor did he take it to Ministers to other Members' and Senators' offices. He advises that the DDB Needham rough concept material (as attached . . . ) was on his desk and he showed it to many people but he does not recall which Ministers or others saw it and which ones did not.</PARA>
<PARA>Who could believe that. A sophisticated political operator could not remember, over six weeks when it sat on his desk, whether he had shown it to anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 22 July, there was a newspaper article signed by the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard. I do not know whether he wrote it. It is not normal for Prime Ministers to write these articles. What is the headline in that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS>? It is `It's time to bite the bullet', which is exactly the same phraseology as the concept given by Toby Ralph and Ted Horton to Mr Grahame Morris. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> presume that Mr Grahame Morris wrote this article. In the body of the article, the phrase `It's time to bite the bullet' is repeated. They were obviously signed up to this on 22 July or they were plagiarising DDB Needham's particular concept at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that after the intervention of Mr Grahame Morris, Needham, in spite of not being on the OGIA register, got a guernsey in the final five. After the final five were looked at by OGIA, Shanahan, Elliott and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, they were basically rubbished as no good. Who intervened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the estimates evidence from Ms Cathi Moore. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it was Mr Grahame Morris that suggested&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Chair says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you let the witness finish, please.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Moore says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The members of the committee were very comfortable with the proposal that the two contrasting proposals be added to the list. There was no dissent from that view. And, yes, Mr Morris made the initial proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course there was no dissent when the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister suggested something at one of these committee meetings. Of course it was accepted. He got them on the list of five. When they were supposedly eliminated, he got them on the list of three.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know from notes held on the meeting of 10 September that Mr Grahame Morris is listed as voting for DDB Needham. We also know that Senator Minchin has played a massive role in getting his former firm appointed to this position. It was then left to Mr Grahame Morris, not Mr Jull, to brief all the public servants excluded from this rorted meeting about the details of the decision. Only two reasons came out. First, they were looking for a wider target audience. Translated, that means that instead of a community based campaign, they were going to turn it into a political campaign because they were doing well on the polls on this issue. Second, they refer to the fact that Needham is livelier. They were the only two reasons given.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7106">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next day though, all the officials were briefed again about the decision. By whom? Not by Mr Jull but by Mr Grahame Morris, chief political adviser to the Prime Minister. It is very instructive to see that he said the committee was split about which advertising company should win. In the very last part he says that he wants the campaign to be factual, less agro and more John Howard like. That is what he said at this particular meeting. When pressed some months later, when the rort was exposed, Mr Grahame Morris came up with a new excuse. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 14 October he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the committee then reviewed the advertising campaigns to see which one would best fit in with the Burston Marsteller campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the PR campaign. You never fit the advertising agency to the PR campaign; it is always the other way around. So we have all these weasel words and answers trying to cover up this particular rort. Then the final thing&mdash;which is the main reason I am speaking tonight&mdash;was when the Prime Minister was asked a question by Mr Price, the member for Chifley, about whether Mr Grahame Morris, or anyone else, had contact with DDB Needham between their putting in for this particular contract and the awarding of it. The letter is in some detail, but let me go to the last paragraph. If this is not classic weasel words, I have never heard any. Mr Howard says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, Mr Morris has told me that at the end of August he attended a `wash&hyphen;up' of the 1996 Federal Election Campaign at the Federal Secretariat and two people from DDB were present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Morris says that one of the DDB Needham people asked him something like `I suppose it's not appropriate to ask how the gun campaign is going?' and he responded along the lines of `Sorry mate, can't help you. You'll hear direct from OGIA.'</PARA>
<PARA>Is this the same hard&hyphen;nosed political operator and apparatchik whom we have come to love and know over the years saying this particular thing? It has a serious side because, in the end, DDB Needham do not produce ads as they promised at their first and second pitch&mdash;thank heavens! They drop all the aggressive approach and they go to the blandest possible approach imaginable, back to the basic con <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> cept and beyond, because what we now have are the most boring, dreary ads in history, cheapo black and white, real voice&hyphen;over ads that any amateur could do overnight, yet they have charged something like 500 head hours to produce this particular rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have Ted Drane now launching a million&hyphen;dollar advertising campaign that will probably run over the top of this $4 million trashy campaign. If you want to clean this up, do not advertise in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, do not call for consultants.

<TIME.STAMP>(7.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the role, function and purpose of parliamentary privilege in the Western Australian parliament in light of the Commission on Government recommendations. The term `parliamentary privilege' refers to the powers, rights and immunities held by parliament, members of parliament and parliamentary committees. It enables parliamentarians to be able to do their job without fear or interference. Parliamentary privilege prohibits anything said or done by members in the course of parliamentary proceedings from being questioned or impeached in any court or tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliamentary privilege is one of the fundamental principles which maintains the separation of powers in our system of government. On rare but significant occasions, parliamentary privilege has led to conflict between the courts and parliaments. One of the most significant was the clash between the Senate and the Supreme Court of New South Wales during the trials of High Court judge Lionel Murphy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliamentarians have to be able to expose corruption and misgovernment, must be able to fully and fearlessly scrutinise the actions of government, the public service and the judiciary, and to inquire into matters of public concern. For these reasons it is necessary that the rights of citizens or the state to take legal action against parliamentarians be circumscribed by parliamentary privilege in order <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7107"> that the essential and larger freedoms of a democratic society are preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliamentary privilege had its origins in the English parliamentarians' battle against the power of the English monarchy in the 17th century. The result was article 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1689 which stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>As you would know, at that stage the executive was not part of parliament. Historically, the intention of parliamentary privilege was to protect parliamentarians from influence and threat by the executive, which was then the Crown. Now the executive is in the parliament and enjoys the protection of parliamentary privilege. What is more, the executive dominates parliament, particularly in this parliament in the lower house. The result has been that the executive can use parliamentary privilege to shield itself from full accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The detrimental effects of the shielding of the executive from full accountability through the use of parliamentary privilege was highlighted during the work of the royal commission into WA Inc. in 1992. It is believed that parliamentary privilege for the executive acted to prevent the full exposure of corrupt, illegal and improper conduct by public officials and the executive as members of parliament. It is my belief that, if properly pursued, a lot more people would have felt the full weight of the law otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of preventing this from re&hyphen;occurring, the Commission on Government made a number of recommendations which addressed the concerns of the royal commission, members of parliament and the community. The principal recommendations include the clarification of the proceedings in parliament which are subject to parliamentary privilege, as in the Commonwealth legislation; the establishment of standing committees to make determinations on the breaches of privilege codes; and the provision of a right to reply where there are allegations of an abuse of parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commission on Government made a number of recommendations with respect to the abuse of parliamentary privilege. Principally, a standing committee on privilege should be established in each house of parliament. The committee would be responsible for the creation of a code of conduct to serve as a guide for members in relation to possible breaches of parliamentary privilege. The standing committee, the Commission on Government recommended, should also be responsible for reviewing conduct alleged to be in breach of the code. The commission recommended that, in the event of a breach of the code of conduct being established, the standing committee should recommend an appropriate penalty to the house concerned. Depending upon the seriousness of the conduct, the commission recommended the penalty could be a retraction and/or apology, suspension from the House for a period up to 14 days, or forfeiture of the member's seat. Those are strong recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commission on Government was particularly concerned, in response to the extensive public hearings and complaints on parliamentary privilege, that the recommendations, once adopted, be reassessed after three years. The satisfaction of community concerns on this issue was of particular relevance to the commission's findings. I would remind this parliament that the recent occurrences in the New South Wales parliament indicate how current and how fierce are the passions about parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reviews the Commission on Government recommended should include public hearings to afford members of the public the opportunity to express their views and to enable the standing committees to judge community sentiment. Finally, the Commission on Government recommended that, if the standing committees find that the incidences of abuse have not been reduced to the satisfaction of the community, then the parliament should appoint an independent commissioner responsible for investigating and overseeing the use of parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A crucial element to the Commission on Government's recommendations was the provision of a right of response by citizens <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7108"> and organisations to enable them to answer statements made under parliamentary privilege. This is a recommendation I advocate for all the parliaments of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on the annual report of ASIO, the debate of which was abandoned when government business was stood aside today. I would like to thank Senator Calvert for volunteering to Senator Campbell to stand aside on the adjourment tonight. This report that was before the Senate today is the annual report of ASIO, which deals with internal security. The purpose of ASIO is to protect our people and our property from those who would do us harm. Regrettably, the need for that is as great as it ever was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ASIO, it is popularly thought, is mainly concerned with Soviet agents. But that is not true at present and it really never was true. It always has had a very wide area of interest. Some of the things it is principally concerned with are: politically motivated violence from minority groups and sections within the community, espionage, and the taking of intellectual property from Australian industry and from Australian institutions. It also has a very important role, as outlined in page 5 of the report, in relation to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons&mdash;weapons of mass destruction, their precursors and even the testing of them within Australia. It is not generally known how important that field is within ASIO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report that was presented to the parliament today is very much an abridged version&mdash;all the sensitive areas and all the areas that are interesting to read have been deleted. Nevertheless, it gives a fair oversight of the range of activities carried out by this authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my regrets on reading the report is that more mention was not made of the retiring Director-General, Mr David Sadleir, who retired last month as the Director-General of ASIO. David Sadleir is self-effacing, intelligent, shrewd and possesses a sound and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mature judgment. He was one of the best director-generals ASIO has had. He came in as director-general at a time when the authority was particularly run down and in a lot of trouble. When he left only a month or so ago, he left the organisation in very good condition. I wish him well in his retirement. On behalf of the parliament and the public, I would like to thank him for what he did through those years with what is a very important institution within the Australian community. I welcome his successor, Mr Dennis Richardson, who brings a great deal of enthusiasm and dedication to the job. I know he will perform very well in that role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ending of the Cold War at the end of the 1980s has not eliminated in any way the need for the security and intelligence organisations that we have in this country. One of the great needs in those organisations is maintaining constant surveillance of their internal security, of their own personnel, and the handling of information. That is often not publicly recognised. But the penalties for not doing that are very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate will remember three years ago when Aldrich James, a CIA agent, was exposed as having been working for the Russians. He had a 10-year period of betrayal before he was detected. The price of his betrayal was enormous and was a consequence of a failure of internal security within the CIA. For example, in his first year of operation, in 1985, he betrayed 13 American CIA agents&mdash;nine of whom were executed and three of whom ended in prison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7109"> In recent months, a similar case, also in the CIA, has been exposed&mdash;the Nicholson case. The interesting thing about the Nicholson case is that it was not an ideologically driven betrayal. It was not that Nicholson in any way at all was attracted to the Soviets. He was a person with an impeccable record in the armed services and special forces, very much an all American. But he got into a great deal of difficulty with an expensive divorce settlement. It illustrates one of the problems that we have at present. People who are in need of money&mdash;and large sums of money&mdash;in a hurry are as much a security risk, and probably more so in the present ideologically free envi ronment, than those who have a commitment to a particular set of ideals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me on to the matter of accountability and oversight of ASIO and the rest of the security organisations. Ideally, of course, the minister responsible for the security agency is accountable to the parliament. Unfortunately, as the last speaker was hinting, in his talk about parliamentary privilege, an executive government is not always able to be as accountable as it should be. The need for an alternative system or a supporting system in the form of committee oversight from the parliament itself is a crucial part of a modern democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ASIO operates within the law, within the statutory limits that are laid down under the act that set it up under the Labor government back in the late 1940s. So far as I know, it has never breached or exceeded those statutory limits. It is under the control of the Attorney-General and is answerable to him. The Attorney-General, though, is always one of the busiest ministers in any government. All other departments are constantly referring to the Attorney&hyphen;General a great deal of work for advice and legal opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As in the case of ASIS, one of our other security agencies, answerable to the foreign minister, what happens is that the security agencies are answerable to ministers who are in cabinet, who are very busy and who simply cannot put the time into the oversight for which they have to accept responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ASIO is also under the umbrella of the Director-General of Security, who looks at its activities. This year's report defines the duties of the Inspector&hyphen;General as being to see that ASIO acts legally and with propriety, complies with ministerial guidelines and directives and has due regard to human rights and civil liberties. He may inquire into complaints against ASIO by the public, into matters referred to him by the Attorney&hyphen;General or into other matters at his own discretion. But, again, basically the Inspector&hyphen;General is there to see that ASIO does not do something that breaches the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we come to the parliamentary committee of which I am the chairman. It was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a very bold move roughly 10 years ago when the Labor government that was then in power amended the ASIO Act, introduced section 5A and set up a parliamentary committee. That was a great advance forward at the time, but time moves on. There is a demonstrable need now, compared with other democratic societies, to increase that level of parliamentary oversight and accountability. It is not a matter of how that should be done, but when it should be done. My belief is that the time is now upon us when changes should be made to the ASIO Act, because section 5A is extraordinarily restrictive. The parliamentary committee which is charged with oversight of the organisation is denied any inquiry into any matters that ASIO has that derive from foreign intelligence, involve foreign nationals, involve any operational matters or involve complaints against the organisation. In fact, it can only deal with matters referred to it by the Attorney-General. That is a very great restriction on its operations. It cannot exercise the oversight that a democratic parliament demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to do in this parliament is alter the act. We need to put all the intelligence agencies under the umbrella, the oversight, of a parliamentary committee. You will remember that, when Mr Justice Samuels inquired into ASIS, there was a proposal that a new committee be set up to oversee ASIS. I would be strongly opposed to that. I think that the parliament only needs one intelligence and security committee. It should look at all the agencies. The responsibilities of that committee should be defined in the terms of the British act which sets up their Intelligence and Security Committee&mdash;that is, that the parliamentary committee should examine the expenditure, administration and policies relating to operational matters while not involving itself in day-to-day activities. It keeps those secure, but allows the parliament to exercise effective oversight and be accountable to the public for the actions of those agencies.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short space of time we have got <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7110"> left, I would like to address some of the issues on which Senator Newman&mdash;who came in here tonight&mdash;grossly misled the Senate. I refer to some of the matters that she spoke about in relation to the Tasmania package. The first thing that I would like to correct Senator Newman on is that she came into the chamber and started talking about the Bass Strait equalisation scheme. She called it a passenger subsidy. The reality is that it is a vehicle subsidy. It applies to motor cars, not people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the very points that I kept making during the election campaign was that they have got this around the wrong way. Let me tell Senator Newman that that is exactly what the TT Line and the state government think now. Passenger numbers on the boat are actually going down, not up. Passenger numbers per vehicle are going down. They have declined. That ship has the capacity to carry only so many cars. If you get less people per car, it means you get less people overall. That is the reality. Those are the facts. That was identified in the state parliament in the form of the estimates that they have in Tasmania. When the TT Line came before the members of parliament in Tasmania, those were the questions that they asked. That is what was identified. It was even reported in the paper. Yet Senator Newman still comes in here and misleads the Senate. She is trying to make out that the Bass Strait equalisation scheme is delivering something that it clearly is not. I know that the TT Line and the state government are seeking to renegotiate the arrangement that is currently in place. That is the fact of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot believe that this minister, who has such great difficulty in answering questions, can come in here tonight, make&mdash;as I think Senator Ray pointed out&mdash;a ministerial statement, and get it so factually wrong. It is almost unbelievable. If Senator Newman had taken the time to check with the TT Line or even her own state colleagues, she would have been informed of the circumstances. Fine, the subsidy is still there. But it is not delivering what it was intended to deliver. I hope the government will take on board what the TT Line and the state government will put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to it with regards to changing the focus of the subsidy. Tasmania does need more people. It needs more tourists to assist the tourism industry which is so critical to our state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman tried to paint this rosy picture about all the other things that the government has delivered out of the Tasmania package. As Senator Calvert would know, the TT Line has a huge debt with regard to the boat. I acknowledge quite openly that a Labor state government purchased the boat. At some point that will have to be replaced. Where are they going to get the money? They are already losing money. They are going to lose more money because they are getting less passengers per vehicle. I would be very interested to find out from Senator Newman where they are ultimately going to get the money to replace that vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to point out that, while Senator Newman tried to paint a very rosy picture, this government has taken $14&half; million from Tasmania for the  AMC/AME hydrodynamic facility in Bass Strait. We lost that very important development. The University of Tasmania has lost $10 million. We have lost $3 million in wheat subsidies. It looks as if Tasmania's freight equalisation scheme will lose $13 million. That is just to name a few. Talk about major developments and the Nixon inquiry! I know what the Nixon inquiry is going to find.  It  will  find <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7111"> that Tasmania is a cot case. I hope that, when Mr Nixon reports, this government will actually start doing something genuine for Tasmania. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) GEMCO has publicly stated that they order and use approximately 25 million litres of diesel each year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) GEMCO has retained consultants who have estimated that the maximum volume of fuel in the ground is approximately 3 million litres. (b) This amount is calculated from information obtained as a result of an extensive drilling program that provides information on thickness of fuel in the ground, surface area of the plume and the porosity of the soil. (c) Fuel loss has occurred in the vicinity of GEMCO's fuel facilities at Milner Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)-(6) I do not have such a map. Regulatory responsibility for this matter rests with the Northern Territory Government. I understand GEMCO has kept the Northern Territory Government fully informed and that the Northern Territory Government is satisfied that GEMCO is taking appropriate remedial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7)(a) The Australian Customs Service (ACS) requested information in a letter dated 1 February 1996. (b) The information requested was whether rebate had been claimed for any of the leaked fuel and the request was made in the context of a routine enquiry for information on a number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matters required to consider the company's rebate claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) No. These documents contain commercial information and were provided to the Government in confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) No. I have asked GEMCO to keep me informed on the environmental management of the leakage but this will not entail duplication of the Northern Territory Government's regulatory role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The ACS is to conduct a full audit of the company's diesel fuel rebate claims and payments. The company has indicated it will co-operate fully with the audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) The audit referred to in 10 above will determine the basis for assessment of rebate claimable. It is my understanding that the company has claimed rebate for leaked fuel and the extent to which this has occurred will be examined in the audit. As I stated on 17 October, the company has advised me that the leaked fuel is being recovered, cleaned, and re-used for activities which would be eligible for diesel fuel rebate. BHP acknowledges that when clean up operations are complete, there will be some fuel left in the ground that will not be recovered. BHP has indicated that it is willing to negotiate a realistic adjustment to rebate payments based on an agreed and, if necessary, independent estimate of the lost fuel on which rebate has been claimed, and that will be a matter for decision by the Minister and Customs in due course.</PARA>
<PARA><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7113"></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) Diesel fuel rebate is payable on purchases of fuel for use in eligible activities as defined under legislation. Payment of rebate is based on prospective use for eligible activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the very unusual circumstances which exist in this case, it is necessary to determine the basis on which rebate was claimed and whether the claim meets the requirements of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be done in the audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has announced that legislation to be introduced shortly will specifically cover circumstances such as occurred in this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13)(a) No. (b) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) The Government announced in the Budget that measures would be put in place to clamp down on misuse of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. Legislation to give effect to these measures is expected to be introduced shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(15) It is not possible to provide this material. Allegations of fraud are investigated and, as recently indicated by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who is responsible for the administration of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, diesel fuel claimants who attempt to defraud the Commonwealth will be prosecuted. In two recent cases, prosecution resulted in claimants receiving prison sentences.</PARA>
