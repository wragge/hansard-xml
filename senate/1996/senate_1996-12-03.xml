<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have moved two amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996. Last night, when we commenced debate on this matter, there was some confusion as to the financial and other impacts of my proposed amendment. My amendment was to change the two study units per term to one study unit, thus reducing the number of units a student is required to study under the open learning <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scheme in order to be eligible for the deferred payment option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I take on board your arguments about your scheme offering a degree of flexibility, but I still have concerns about the arrangements under this bill given the move to redefine study periods and to change the semester system. It seems that in the past students had to satisfy a 75 per cent course load minimum in order to qualify for the deferred payment option. It seems that we have lost that concept of the 75 per cent as a consequence of the semester changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can you enlighten me as to whether or not this is your understanding of the bill&mdash;that is, it changes that 75 per cent requirement? Given that your officers have had time to determine some of the changes to, and the impact of these changes on, the open learning scheme&mdash;and I should add it has not simply been overnight because my office has been in contact with your office on this particular matter for the last week&mdash;could you provide any financial details?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just been handed some information in response to some questions you asked last night on this higher education funding bill. I will read that information into the record. It is as fresh to me as it will be to you. The question that has been answered is basically your proposition: why cannot all open learning students defer their fees under the open learning deferred payment scheme? That would be the effect of the amendment you want to move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The material provided to me is as follows: the open learning deferred payment scheme commenced in March 1994, 12 months after the Open Learning Agency commenced offering units, to increase the take&hyphen;up rate of people studying through the OLA. OLA students are not required to commit to an award course and many undertake study for reasons other than obtaining a qualification. An equivalent situation within a university would be students undertaking non-award courses. These students are required to pay up front and are not able to defer the payment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government sought to increase access to higher education for students seeking to undertake a qualification who were unable to access a mainstream university place. Therefore, it required students to undertake a full-time load in order to be eligible for the open learning deferred payment scheme. Under OLDPS, students are required to commit to undertaking at least three units of study over two study periods&mdash;that is, a semester. The government's proposed amendments increase students' flexibility by allowing them to defer payment for two units in a study period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your amendment, however, would allow any OLA student to defer payment. While the concept of open learning has expanded the opportunities for many students to obtain a higher education qualification, it has also created a market for tertiary study unrelated to a qualification. Expanding access to OLDPS to these students is inconsistent with the object of OLDPS. It imposes a further burden on taxpayers who will gain no public benefit from this amendment and will more than double the Commonwealth's outlay. In the period of the forward estimates, this would amount to at least an additional $24 million. There is also a further long&hyphen;term cost to the Commonwealth as many of these people will never repay, thus effectively turning the loan or deferred payment into a grant. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Publicly funded universities are also significant providers of open learning and distance education opportunities to students. Favourable treatment of a private company, which is what OLA is, with a specified niche market will mean that publicly funded institutions, particularly regional universities, could suffer significant losses of HECS liable students. My understanding of that, in short, is that you are seeking to provide a very special niche for a private company that is not available to other publicly funded institutions who are also offering opening learning access. On that basis alone, I would ask you to reconsider it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government introduced this deferred payment to increase access for people who were looking to get a qualification and that is why there was some limit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6512"> there. To move that limit and say, `One unit will do', would allow deferred payment for the `browsing educators'&mdash;people taking something that they are not looking to build on towards a qualification. And on that basis as well I would ask you to reconsider. You asked what the cost would be. The assessment I have been given is that the cost of your amendment would be something like $24 million to provide to a private company something that we do not provide to other publicly funded institutions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for her response and for clarifying the financial consequences of this amendment. I understand from your answer that you have changed and in fact the Democrats do support the move from semester to a study period; but in doing so we have lost any concept of the 75 per cent minimum load in order to defer the open learning payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the minister is conferring, I should put on record that I thought the minister's earlier statement was interesting&mdash;that there are students who undertake open learning not simply to gain a qualification or employment. At least that is what I deduced from your earlier statements. However, the Democrats are committed to a flexible arrangement in open learning. We are committed to providing those students with the `mailbox and a television set' as former education minister, John Dawkins, said. We are committed to ensuring that they have access to the open learning scheme, especially those groups who benefit most but may be disadvantaged in a broader context&mdash;those with disabilities or those who are in remote areas. We believe that this is indeed a more flexible arrangement in changing the definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the surface, your amendment does seem to provide more flexibility as a student would be able to undertake say two units over the 13 week period and then choose not to study in the following period but not lose their ability to defer that payment. Our reading of that is that, while it seems fair enough, in reality a student must continue to maintain a full&hyphen;time load if they wish to continue to defer their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> study and work through their course in a measured, ordered and ongoing manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under your proposal, my understanding is that a student must be carrying a full&hyphen;time load at any point where they wish to defer their course costs through the open learning deferred payment scheme. So our proposed amendment is to make the minimum study load in order to defer perhaps a little more realistic&mdash;one unit per study period&mdash;for much the same reasons as the government has chosen to set the standard load at eight units per year. In the government's explanatory memorandum to this bill, `The proposal will continue to ensure that students studying at a distance do not overburden themselves. . .  while increasing ease of administration.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if you are committed to increasing that level of flexibility&mdash;and given that we do not have this change from semester to study period; a study period being set at a period of 13 weeks&mdash;substituting one unit for the two units that you have prescribed is indeed a more flexible arrangement and one that would ensure that students do not `overburden' themselves, as you say.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just two things: firstly, I do not want to labour the point; I am sure you understand the substance of the point when I say that you are asking for a niche to be provided to a private company that is not available to publicly funded institutions. I am at a loss to understand how that is consistent with Democrat policy but if it is, that is fine, that is your decision. I just want to make it abundantly clear to you that that is what you are seeking to do by way of this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, you drew the assumption in your remarks that the government's amendment will effectively mean that in order to defer payment, you will at any time have to be studying full time. I think that is your version of events and, with respect, that is not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just explain it to you this way. In the previous arrangements, you had to do three units in a semester. We say you must do two within that one study period. But you could, for example&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6513">
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARGETTS" NAMEID="DX5">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator Margetts</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry if I am making you tense. I am trying to explain this as efficiently as I can because I do not want to spend any more time on this debate than is necessary. I have a table here and I am just trying to explain it to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, that is right&mdash;the study period is half a semester. But you could, for example, do two units in the first study period, none in the second, none in the third and none in the fourth. You could do two in any one study period and none in any of the others. That covers four variations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, you could do one unit in one study period, two in another and none in the others. That would give you a total of three units in one semester. You would still be able to do that. Or you might do two, none, two, none. Or two, one, one. There are any number of combinations that might suit you because of your workload commitments or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we really have increased the flexibility. It is not a requirement for you to do two in every study period, but you must have done two in one study period. That is where the maximum flexibility comes in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do say, however, that to go down to one means that you are opening it up to the recreational learner&mdash;that sounds dismissive, and I do not mean it that way&mdash;as opposed to the person who is a vocational learner. That aspect is not available to the publicly funded institutions. Therefore, we do not think it should be extended to a private company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is how the flexibility works. You have to do two units in one study period, but after that the combinations are up to the relevant students. So there is a very big increase in flexibility.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not labour this issue any longer, but I acknowledge and thank the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) for her response. The Democrats simply seek to change that two&hyphen;unit requirement to a one&hyphen;unit requirement. Admittedly, this would allow for more flexibility. I do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> see that we are providing some kind of ridiculous advantage to a private agency. To the contrary, the aim of this is to make available to students that increased flexibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say that I do not have a problem with people pursuing education for so-called recreational purposes. If we are committed to the pursuit of knowledge, excellence and academic integrity, perhaps we should talk more about the recreational pursuit of knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the minister's response. I think it is worth restating that we have changed the definition of the study period. We are not talking about semesters; we are talking about a 13-week study period, so this has changed. I think we have an opportunity to change the flexibility of the arrangements, which the government has gone some way towards doing. We seek to go a little further and substitute `1 unit' for `2 units', as is currently in the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, perhaps I can clarify it for you. It is not simply that OLA is a private company and publicly funded institutions are not. You are saying that you're not interested in that distinction; you're interested in providing it to students. I just want to highlight to you that you are providing it to one type of student and not to all others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In publicly funded institutions&mdash;until, and if, this bill is passed&mdash;you cannot just enrol and do something as a matter of interest. You have to win a place to get into their open learning opportunities. That is the situation with publicly funded institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">OLA, however, is a private company, and pretty well anyone can roll up, enrol and give it a go. It is to those students that you are seeking to extend the deferred payment option. It is in that context that I think your view is appropriately understood. This is not something that you are presumably seeking to extend to universities, but you are happy to give it to OLA. That is what I do not understand. You are happy to give it to a private company, but not happy to say that it ought <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6514"> to be available to universities. In fact, it is quite the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I said to you that enabling people to buy a place would allow recreational learners to buy a place&mdash;not caring whether or not they pass the degree because they simply want to learn&mdash;you would say, `No, they're the rich and thick,' and you would not allow that. But you do want to make this amendment to give a special advantage to a private company to allow just that sort of thing in open learning. I am at a loss to see the consistency in it myself.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek further clarification. When I was studying in England, I spent quite a bit of time with people participating in the open learning system at the University of East Anglia and found from them that it is actually not a quiet, recreational thing to do. It is actually extremely tough. There have been studies done to show that it is actually tougher getting a qualification under open learning than it is, in many cases, under the system of going to university with other students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a bit distressed about the idea that it is simply considered to be recreational. Does the minister not consider that one of the reasons why people opt to take a half&hyphen;time course option, which is what we are talking about, rather than a full-time course option&mdash;that is, one unit per study unit rather than two units per study unit&mdash;is that they may have many family commitments? It is not actually a measure of their commitment to the course, to learning or, perhaps, to future use of that. It might be more a measure of their own inability to participate in learning in any other way. It may be that the television is their only option to get that course work in. You might enlighten me otherwise.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me take the opportunity to clarify `recreational learner'. It does not imply that it is any easier. A recreational learner may be someone who would like to buy a place at a university&mdash;perhaps some retired person who would like to take on a new degree and is happy to pay to do it. To me, being a recreational learner in that sense does not mean that the degree is easy. It means that the person is not doing it with a view to gaining a qualification to get a job; they are doing it out of interest. I certainly do not imagine that open learning is a pushover at all. What you heard from the colleagues you worked with in East Anglia is no doubt as true here as it would be in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My comments do not go to the difficulty of a particular course, but go to the purpose of undertaking it. One of the Labor members of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6515"> the House of Representatives raised with me recently a research project that had not, in his view, received appropriate recognition and funding. It had in the past, but now it was not going to have continued funding. One of the Australians working on this project is an Australian who was a surgeon and who decided that at 55 he would retire. I assumed from that that he had earned a suitable income from being a surgeon. It did cross my mind that it would not have hurt that person to pay $5,500 as a contribution to a lifelong income that allowed one to retire at 55, to take on another degree to become an archaeologist and to work with a former Democrat senator, Senator Sowada, in Egypt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That second degree, undertaken by someone who was a surgeon and who amassed sufficient income to be able to retire at 55, was undertaken at the expense of someone else who might otherwise have got in. Under our system, anyone would be able to be a recreational learner, take a second degree when they retired&mdash;if they are lucky enough to earn enough money to retire at 55&mdash;and pay for it. I want to emphasise that my description of a recreational learner is someone who is not doing it with a view to getting their initial qualifications to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, let me repeat: you are quite right when you say that there are some people who, for a whole variety of reasons, will not want to do full&hyphen;time study. I thought you asked, `Why will we only fund them if they are full time?' That is not right. They must do one study period&mdash;just one&mdash;where they take two units. For the remainder of the year, they can take none in the other three periods, or one, or two, or any combination thereof. But in any one year there must be one study period where two units are taken. That is not taking a full-time load over a year, by any stretch of the imagination. A full-time load in any year would be eight units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to fund people who would be doing only two units. That is a 25 per cent load. We are prepared to shift to that sort of flexibility as an acknowledgment of the very point that you raise. We think it is reasonable to say, `If you're doing just over 10 per cent and you're not going to finish for 10 years, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then you're not serious about doing this for a qualification. You're not serious enough.' In that sense it would amount to 25 per cent in any one year, and you have to do that by doing two units in one study period. But after that, the flexibility is up to you. You are quite right; there might be periods where it would not be appropriate or easily manageable for someone to do two units in each study period over the year. That might not be possible, and I quite understand that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6516"> Secondly, if that is the case, it may be the wording that is the problem: it says that at some stage you have to study full time. I am not sure what the rationale is there. You could talk about it as an average, you could talk about it over a year or you could talk about it over a semester to give that real flexibility. The problem that is sticking with us is that at some stage they will have to do full-time study. The people who find themselves in the category of those whose only option is par ticipating in open learning may be the people who, for reasons of disability or small children or whatever, may only have the option of part-time study.</PARA>

I think it is important, as Senator Margetts has pointed out, to note that two units in that study period is the equivalent to a full&hyphen;time load. I acknowledge that, in many respects, the government's proposal is to ensure some degree of flexibility. The tables that the minister has read out give students the option of studying certain units at certain times. However, at one point, students, in order to qualify, will have to do that two unit minimum. That is what we seek to replace with one unit to make it properly flexible.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

The whole truth is that they can defer if they do two units in a semester. They can go on in the other semesters and do no units. They will obviously defer the payment for two. But where they choose to do one unit, then payment for that unit is not able to be deferred. You can defer when you are doing a full&hyphen;time load.

The Democrats oppose the retrospectivity of the introduction of a basic charge and a statutory charge set at different levels for the purposes of the OLA. On principle the Australian Democrats are opposed to any form of retrospectivity, any retrospective legislation. I think we are thumbing our noses at the Senate and at legislative processes by passing such legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The office of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) would be aware of the concerns that the Democrats have on this matter. We have been in touch with her office and with the department regarding some of the correspondence we have had from students who have been concerned about the fact that they had as few as three days warning that they would be required to pay an up-front fee of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $93 per unit on top of fees which they might otherwise not be paying up-front or deferring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the government seeks to legitimate through this bill in item No. 28. We oppose this attempt to legislate retrospectively. We also oppose the content of the changes; that is, to set two levels of fees for the Open Learning Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have said many, many times in this chamber, a fee which must be paid up-front has always been a proven disincentive, especially for those groups whom I presume we would want to access open learning the most. I do not think those people should be denied that opportunity because they do not necessarily have the money, and they certainly do not have the funds, to pay up-front. By allowing the continuation of the basic charge set at whatever rate the OLA chooses and the statutory charge, limited to government restrictions, we are leaving students to fall through the cracks&mdash;in particular, those traditionally disadvantaged students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats oppose retrospectivity. We oppose education policy that is driven by an attempt to make the education sector more privately oriented or to lock those doors and lock access for those students who are from disadvantaged backgrounds or simply do not have the money to pay.

That is a concern that I was hoping to address. I will happily take advice on the consequences of the second Democrat amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A PPQ was prepared on this in anticipation of my being asked a question by someone such as you during question time. The situation is that OLA has incorrectly informed some students registering for the December semester at short notice that they had to pay the higher fee set by OLA for the March 1997 study period. The department has informed OLA that students cannot be required to pay the new fee set by OLA until after 1 January 1997, and then that is on the assumption that these changes are passed. So OLA did make a mistake. They have been advised of that. I expect they would be seeking to correct it, if they have not already. I do not know how recently you have been contacted. I will just try to get a rough idea of the date the letter was sent to OLA informing of that. I am informed that the letter was sent late last week.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an initial attraction to what Senator Bolkus has suggested. But, as I canvassed in the debate yesterday when dealing with government amendments Nos. 1 and 2, we indicated in August that we thought it appropriate that universities be able to sell places to Australian students once they had filled their govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment funded load. With the limitation of those full fee paying students not exceeding 25 per cent of places, quite a lot of people thought it appropriate provided such a limitation was kept because that would stop universities squeezing government funded students out by, for example, in any one particular course, taking 90 per cent full fee paying students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those two things in combination are the mechanisms by which you keep the appropriate mix&mdash;no more than 25 per cent of full fee paying domestic students at any one time, and in any one course, not squeezing the government funded students out. We think that is important and that is why we want to increase the number of government funded undergraduate places next year, the year after and the year after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated in the debate that some people would agree with that only if we were prepared to show bona fides and put it in the legislation so that it could not be changed. By leaving those matters in the guidelines, which are not disallowable, there would be the opportunity for a government at a later stage to change its view without coming back to the parliament, to increase the percentage of Australian students and perhaps even allow universities to sell places in courses where they had not filled their government funded load. It would be open to a government to do that at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The threshold question is whether we are prepared to put in the legislation that any future government would have to come back to the parliament if it wanted to change either of those two controls. I see what Senator Bolkus is saying but, equally, some people would be uncomfortable voting on whether to allow Australian students to buy places unless they were completely satisfied that this matter was dealt with. I do not think that there is a lot in it so I would be happy to proceed as we are, if Senator Bolkus would agree to that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Senate should first of all make a decision on whether we support full fee paying undergraduates and then work out the proportion.

I indicated, not in the same words that I will use now, that it was not the present situation that I was thinking of but some time in the future, with another coalition government or a Labor government or even just a different minister. If this limit were in the legislation it would not be possible to change it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not think it is necessarily the be&hyphen;all and end&hyphen;all answer, but I certainly would like to see the logic of this argument in dealing with the issue of whether or not the Senate agrees to the imposition of fee paying undergraduate students, and then deal with the conditions under which that should apply if the Senate agrees that should be the case.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I signal that the opposition will be opposing items 1, 2, 11, 28 and 29. We bunched them together because they do relate to one subject and that is the introduction of up&hyphen;front fees to undergraduates. There are also indications of opposition from both the Democrats and the Greens in respect of those provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the provisions that would allow universities to charge up&hyphen;front fees to Australian undergraduates. Items 1 and 2 amend section 30 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 which currently allows the minister to allow guidelines for the charging of fees for postgraduate students. These items simply extend the power to charge fees and to issue guidelines to this effect to undergraduate courses as well as postgraduate courses. Items 28 and 29 make the corresponding changes to the Australian Maritime Collage. Item 11 is a consequential amendment that ensures the undergraduates paying fees are not also subject to HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say in respect of this&mdash;and I said it during the second reading debate&mdash;that the opposition has immense problems with the introduction of up&hyphen;front fees. We have problems in terms of equity and also the impact on individual students. We are talking here of our long&hyphen;held opposition to up&hyphen;front fees for Australian undergraduates. Can I also remind the Senate that it was not all that long ago&mdash;it would have been within the last 12 months&mdash;that the current government, and particularly Senator Hill, also made great play of its opposition to full up&hyphen;front fees for undergraduates in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our opposition is based on the central tenet that access to various professions and career options for young people should be determined by ability and motivation, not by financial means. There are equity considerations involved here. As I said in the second reading debate, there is also some national interest implications as well. We do not accept the analogy with overseas fee paying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> students. We claim that is spurious because we think it is in our national interest to ensure that Australians do have access&mdash;through no up&hyphen;front undergraduate fees&mdash;to universities and tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has introduced some amendments to try and limit the extent of undergraduate places to some 25 per cent. As has already been indicated in the debate, the government amendment will set the 25 per cent figure. But we do have quite a number of problems with the way that figure and that imperative is going to be implemented&mdash;whether it is cross&hyphen;university, cross&hyphen;faculty, how courses come in and out of it. Basically, it is something that will need enormously close checking on. To that effect, when the issue comes up later in the proceedings, we will be moving amendments to ensure that whatever guidelines do eventuate, if this proposal gets up, those guidelines under the minister's most recent amendment will also be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are very enormous problems here&mdash;problems that unfortunately your government has not focused on in producing this legislation. There are questions like: what will be the impact of this legislation; how would it impact on those who are financially disadvantage; and how would it impact on the target groups that have been of major concern over the last decade or so? All those sorts of issues are pretty critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You claim that, under Labor, the system did not produce greater equity. We would argue against that very strongly because under Labor more and people of disadvantaged backgrounds were getting access in terms of numbers. We acknowledge the proportion did not go up, but we also maintain we should look at our record and our achievements as a country in this area, as against the trend internationally where inequity has been basically reinforced in comparable educational systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have been keen over recent years to see more numbers of women doing non&hyphen;traditional courses. That increased. The number of Aboriginals and people of non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds accessing the university system increased as well. These are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6523"> the people who will be denied in the future because of the introduction of up&hyphen;front fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you say that this will provide some greater access to the system but what you are doing is totally different from what we did a few years ago when we introduced HECS. You can shake your head all you like but you can hear it pretty strongly from this side that when we introduced HECS a few years ago, the money that was raised through HECS was applied to extra resources for education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how you can nod your head, Minister. You are overseeing in this package cutbacks of some 10 per cent by way of grants to universities, as has been estimated by the Australian vice&hyphen;chancellors. I would rather believe them, Minister, despite all your sniping about them and despite all the disparaging comments you make about their being only self&hyphen;interested. You did it again last night, `They are sharp when it comes to money matters.' We know they are sharp when it comes to a lot of matters and one thing they are sharp about is being able to see through you and your government's package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can see that this is a grab for money. Although on the one hand you claim that the increase in charges and the cuts to education are just a nick, they can see that this nick extends to at least some 10 to 12 per cent in terms of funding to universities. The vice&hyphen;chancellors are of that view. You disagree with the fact that they are of that view? You have a different view, obviously, but you do not disagree that that is the estimation they have made?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try during this debate not to respond individually because that would take up a lot more time; and I know senators have contributions they want to make. What is being sought from the parliament is a substantial change and it deserves the appropriate time to consider it and a respect for each other's views. I just want to say in response to the contribution by Senator Bolkus that it would have some meaning if the government was looking to cut funding for undergraduate places at universities. But since this government is planning to offer some 6,000 more government funded undergraduate places next year, I think this government is perfectly entitled to say that, under the system we are offering, more government funded students will be able to get in next year than would be the case if the previous government's plans had been implemented. That is just a plain fact of life&mdash;it is there in the budget papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to have about 6,000 more government funded undergraduate students next year. So let us not confuse this debate with any discussion about it being something to do with equity because people are going to be locked out. Under the proposals for the whole package that we are putting, more government funded undergraduate students will be able to get in next year. So let us not pretend to anybody that somehow people who otherwise would have got in are going to miss <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6524"> out. That is not the case. There will be more people in government funded places&mdash;undergraduate places&mdash;next year than would have been under the previous government's plans. That applies to total numbers of places and quite specifically to undergraduate places next year. In the following years there are fewer postgraduate course work places but still more government funded undergraduate places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So let's have no messing up of this debate with an argument that somehow under this government's proposals a whole band of people whom senators opposite might like to take as their cause celebre are going to miss out. No&hyphen;one is going to miss out who would not have missed out under the previous government. Fewer people will miss out under this government than would have missed out under the previous government because we are offering more undergraduate government funded places. So let us not tarnish a debate on the principle of whether in addition to those places Australians should be able to buy places with that kind of mishmash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The additional point that I would like to make comes back to the point that Senator Bolkus was making, that somehow this is devastating for higher education. We had a situation in the past where you either got a Commonwealth scholarship or you paid for a place. Many people think that worked very well. It was changed to say that education would be free to students&mdash;not free for everybody; other people would pay. Senator Bolkus was good enough to acknowledge that in that time there was not a significant increase in lower socioeconomic groups&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But not in the proportions. There were more numbers of everybody. In the equity sense, did they get a fairer share or a bigger share? No. You were good enough to acknowledge that so I am being good enough to acknowledge that you were good enough. I might think twice about that next time, Senator Bolkus. If you are not going to be generous when I am good enough to acknowledge that you are good enough, I will not acknowledge when you are good enough. Then we shifted to this notion <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it would be free for students. As I understand it, there was the expectation that somehow by doing this we could increase the proportions of lower socioeconomic people who otherwise would be shut out of higher education. But it did not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we shifted back to a system where people had to pay something. But, as I indicated yesterday, one of the great innovations introduced by Labor&mdash;I will be ungracious now, Senator Bolkus; there were not many in the 13 years that you were in, though this was one of them&mdash;was that the contribution being sought by students would not have to be paid up&hyphen;front or as they learnt, but rather when they earned. That is the beauty of the HECS system&mdash;that it allows access irrespective of your income at the time. We want to maintain that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What HECS did was acknowledge once again that there is a private benefit. There is an enormous public benefit in higher education institutions, but there is a private benefit to the people who go through as well, and we canvassed these the other day. Those benefits are higher incomes, more status in life, a better working pattern and a more secure working pattern&mdash;a whole range of things that we do not give to TAFE students and we certainly do not give to school leavers who simply go and get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We give a piece of paper to university graduates that is internationally portable and we spend, at a minimum, about $20,000 on them. We do not spend anything like that on TAFE students, who are no less valuable citizens. We certainly do not give them a piece of paper that is internationally portable. We do not spend anything like that on people who go and get a job and who work as a storeman, packer or whatever  they can because we did not provide them with either the opportunities of good enough primary and secondary education or the opportunities to get into the trade of their choice.</PARA>

Struggle along with your business.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not do that. There are enormous benefits in higher education that the taxpayer puts into this group of school leavers but does not put into people who go to TAFE or to people who go and get a job, and there are benefits they get for the rest of their life. That is what HECS was introduced to do&mdash;to say, `Look, you're going to have to make a contribution because the benefit isn't all the public's way. You get some benefit out of this as well.' What we want to do is redress what we think has become an imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn briefly in these remarks to the earlier debate on the open learning arrangements. Senator Stott Despoja rightly identified that she does not condemn what I call recreational learning&mdash;that is, people who are learning out of an interest, not because they want to get a particular qualification in order to get a job. The government supports that. I not know anybody in this chamber, for that matter, who does not support that sort of recreational learning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja says she supports it. She is happy to let people enrol in OLA to do it; she is happy to have the taxpayer fund a deferred payment scheme to these people in OLA&mdash;in a private company&mdash;but is somehow not happy to let other people engage in that recreational learning at a university, for example, by doing a second degree after they have retired. This refers back to the example I gave of the physician who was lucky enough&mdash;and wealthy enough, I suppose&mdash;to retire at 55 and go back to university to do archaeology and go off to Egypt to work with Dr Sowada. He is probably living a most enchanted life, I imagine&mdash;sending Labor politicians back to tell me that the research program is not getting enough money. Great! That is what the system does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja is happy for the physician to do that at taxpayers' expense, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> she is not happy for us to introduce, for someone who could afford to pay, a system whereby we say, `Over and above the existing government funded places, we'll put some more government funded places. We'll actually increase the number of government funded undergraduate places.' She is not happy with that, because what we are going to do on top of that is say, `Furthermore, if some additional people want to put their own money at risk and buy a place to do a second degree or to get into the degree or university of their choice, we're happy to let them do it.' It was a chance to make the rich pay. Now we want to let them pay and you want to stop them. It seems to me to be insane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are people there who are happy to pay, let us get them out of the government funded places. If they want to move out of a government funded place to a fully funded place for some particular choice, and, as a consequence of that, another person, who otherwise would not have got in, gets into a government funded place, well, we have done a good job. We have done a good job if that is what we can achieve. What about Senator Bolkus's contribution, making a suggestion about the so-called rich, with the term used in a pejorative way. One of the problems with this notion, of course, is that if you have any money people seem to think you are a drug runner or a crook, and that is what is meant by the pejorative of the rich.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer. Has the minister read the strategic study for the international coal industry entitled `Emerging Giants', published by a commercial researcher, Australian Mineral Economics? Is the government concerned about the erosion of Australia's competitive edge in the world coal export market?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6526" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Troeth very much for that question because she is asking a question which relates <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6527"> to our largest export earner, the coal industry, which brings in about $8&half; billion a year in export income. I do have some concerns, as everyone does, about any erosion of our competitive edge, whether it be in the coal industry or any other industry, but I am very confident that the opportunity does exist to maintain and expand our position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paper by Australian Mineral Economics points out that Australia will continue to be the dominant force in international coal over the next 10 years. However, the message is very clear that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels and we cannot afford to be complacent. It is worth pointing out to honourable senators that, while Australia is the world's biggest coal exporter, it is by no means the world's biggest producer. The biggest producer in the world is, in fact, China with about 1.4 billion tonnes, followed by the United States at about 900 million tonnes and India at about 400 million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The analysis suggests that Indonesia, Colombia and South Africa are the lowest cost producers at present and that strong export growth is expected from Indonesia and Colombia. In fact, when I was in Indonesia recently it was pointed out to me by some of the business people there that they expect the exports of thermal coal from Indonesia to grow within the next decade or so from about 20 million tonnes to 50 million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, I, and I think most other Australians, would like to see that growth occur in Australia. But our competitiveness is questioned due to the appreciation of the Australian dollar, the high rail freight costs and the high labour costs, despite our special advantage in terms of location within the APEC region, which is predicted will be the fastest growing region in the globe over the next 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is, as noted in the paper, Australia has the greatest capacity to lower unit cost of production in response to any fall in coal prices compared with any of its competitors. High rail freight charges in Australia are set to fall, with Queensland moving to commercial rates and New South Wales moving to a rail access regime to allow a third party to access existing rail freight infrastructure. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> These moves, of course, are very much to be lauded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has moved to amend the industrial relations laws and these will provide the framework for increased productivity and a challenge for the industry and those employed in it to use the new laws as a springboard for higher productivity and improved reliability. Considering the fact that we are blessed with very good resources, the two key factors in expanding and developing new mines are reliability of supply and productivity. It has nothing whatsoever to do with cutting wages; it is about improving the unit cost of production. Another favourable condition is the government's regime of maintaining a low rate of inflation, a rate of inflation significantly lower than those prospective competitors.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A perennial problem for all commodities, Senator Schacht, is the adverse effect of a strong Australian dollar, and a margin for currency fluctuation is something that companies should always factor into their plans. They do, Senator Schacht. If you have ever been in industry, you will know that they do get involved in the forward exchange. But the problem underscores the importance of working in the areas where tangible gains can be made, such as micro&hyphen;economic reform and productivity. Currency appreciation can bring some benefits, such as where a company has foreign borrowings or when it is importing capital equipment for expansion and new production. In short, the message I see in the study is that Australia will need to continue to look closely at its costs to remain competitive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. The float of the German Telecom last month resulted in an undervaluing of the asset and a windfall gain to the new private shareholders of $3.3 billion at the expense of the former shareholders, the German public. The sale of the second tranche of British Telecom shares resulted in a $3.2 billion windfall gain for its new shareholders at the expense of the British public. Minister, are you concerned that the now privatised Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was undervalued by 67 per cent by the previous government, a loss to the Australian public purse of $558 million? Would you call these share floats successful, as the stock market has labelled them? Should governments have sold their assets for substantially less than their real worth? And what guarantees can you give that, if the worst happens and the Telstra sale proceeds, the Australian public will get full value from the sale?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure Senator Kernot that those who participate in the float will certainly get full value for money and will be very appreciative of the opportunity. But you seem to have a simple&hyphen;minded notion that, if a share rises in value, the person who sold it must have sold it too cheaply. The fact is that there is a lead time involved in making a judgment and in striking the issue price, and a lot of factors can affect the sale price when it finally comes on to the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is probably fair to say that, once again, those who were responsible for the sale of the first tranche of Deutsche Telecom underestimated the level of demand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I recall, it was oversubscribed a number of times and the rate of increase was something like 17 per cent on the first day. If those figures are right, that indicates that there was an enormous demand which bid up the price of the share.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just understand this. If you strike a share price at $3 and no-one is interested, you will not get your $3. Why are people interested in buying it? Because they think it has enormous potential for the future. In other words, they predict that the stream of earnings will justify a higher net present value than might otherwise be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that it goes up in value does not mean it was undersold. If you wanted to sell it at such a price that there would be no scope for any increase, you would not get any takers. So you always have to leave a bit there for those who come along later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not mean, in any way, that the Commonwealth is selling itself short if it sells at a price below which the share price finally rises to&mdash;any more than you can predict that the share price will rise over time. That depends on performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look back after six months and find the share price has gone up 50 per cent, you do not say, `Well, they clearly sold it too cheaply.' The fact is that you sell it at the price that people are prepared to pay at the time, and the future movements in that share price will be a function of its performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Deutsche Telecom is yet another example of the enormous demand that there is in the marketplace for these types of shares. There has not been the opportunity in Germany for too many privatisations, and this one is a very big exercise. It is going to be followed by France Telecom in the not too distant future. What you are seeing around the world is a recognition that this provides tremendous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6531"> opportunities for investors as well as for users of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot, you ought to look at this as yet another example of how far out of touch you are. I do not blame just you; it is the crowd over there who ought to be hanging their heads in shame. They are the ones who privatised everything in sight when they had the chance. Senator Kernot, you might not understand all the benefits that could flow, but they do. They know that, by creating a sale price and by creating a market signal, inevitably you will bring pressures to bear, you will drive down the inefficiencies and you will provide benefits to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what it is all about. It is not about giving people windfall gains. There are people who understand that by investing in a company that is on the right track, that does have enormous opportunities and that is free of the shackles of someone looking over its shoulder all the time, like Paul Keating used to do&mdash;he would give them a call and ask them to send him a cheque for another $400 million&mdash;it can get on with the game. If a company is free of those sorts of constraints, then it can really get on with the game and, as a result, investors will reap the benefits. That is all that is happening. People are understanding the potential of these stocks and they are voting with their feet and their pockets accordingly. I am sure that Australian investors would like the same opportunity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bear in mind that it is all about making judgments about the minimum standards that ought to be available, particularly in rural and remote areas, where the quality of service is often very inadequate by metropolitan standards.

As long as exchanges are ISDN capable, then people will be able to get access to the Internet and other high speed data services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That is an important issue. It goes to the concept of the universal service obligation, and the bill that will be before the parliament shortly will contain provisions that will expand the range of the USO and will make it even more effective. Within that context, there will be the capacity to upgrade, but not to downgrade, the standard telephone service. In other words, no-one need have any concerns that the passage of the legislation could somehow reduce the current level of the standard telephone service. We are talking about upgrading it&mdash;upgrading it on a sensible basis, recognising the disparities that often exist between regional areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The United Kingdom in fact is the only country which has a social security agreement with Australia which does not index its pensions to its former residents in Australia. It also does not index its pensions to its former residents who go to other Commonwealth countries. Senators might be interested to know that the United Kingdom does index its pensions to those of its people who have gone to live in the United States. They treat them differently. They are obliged by the EU's rules to index their pensions to any of their expatriates who go to live in EU countries and, interestingly, they were prepared not very long ago to sign an agreement with the Philippines to index the pensions of any Britons who go to live in the Philippines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Australia also indexes any pensions of its expatriates who go overseas, and all our other agreement partners index the pensions of expatriates in Australia. The comparison is extraordinary. We are talking about pensions to which British people have contributed throughout their working lives in the United Kingdom. It is a superannuation pension; it is not a pension just paid by the taxpayer. Yet they do not receive any increase to their pension, in some cases over many years of living in Australia, simply because, for exam ple, they have come to Australia to live with their extended family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These British pensioners are clearly very disadvantaged by the freezing of their pensions. The average UK pension paid into Australia now is less than $40 a week. I just do not know how the United Kingdom government can live with the shame of that. This decision of the UK government that has been running over a long time has implications for Australia and for the Australian taxpayer. But this government has a firm commitment to look after our elderly residents. Let me make it absolutely clear that the government will continue to top up the pensions of former UK residents affected by the lack of indexation of pensions paid into Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to all questions without notice asked of him today.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to assure the rest of the front bench that when they travel overseas we will not be pursuing their itineraries or showing much interest in it because, as Senator Alston today explained, overseas travel is very good, in an information sense. But when we were in government, Senator Alston asked question <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> after question&mdash;snide, sneering questions&mdash;about ministerial travel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having gone to India and back this year, he is now floating off to the Northern Hemisphere, taking leave before he even starts work&mdash;flying overseas, then going on leave. Then, when he actually resumes from leave, we find that the US leg of his trip is being squeezed because of the amount of time he is taking at the UK end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look through the preliminary plan, you wonder why he is travelling. There is hardly a meeting in place. There is one conference and hardly a meeting in place at this particular stage. We would cut a lot of slack for a minister organising an overseas trip but for his track record. His track record indicates total double standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was happy at estimates committees to put questions on notice, to ask questions without notice, to bang in questions to a range of ministers when we were in government, with snide implications. When particular ministers actually took leave and paid for the whole thing themselves, it did not protect them from the sneering, patrician attitude of Senator Alston; it only encouraged him to attack people, suggesting they were wasting taxpayers' money, that they were on junkets. All these sorts of accusations came from Senator Alston with no evidence whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the first opportunity he gets to put his snout in the trough, he is in there like a vacuum cleaner, sucking up taxpayers' money at the rate of knots, going to the old country, taking leave, then heading off for New York, timing it for right in the middle of a weekend so he can have another two days off. Then another day goes in travel to Los Angeles, but he is available only one morning in Los Angeles for one or two meetings before he goes off to Hawaii to attend a conference for half a day. I will bet you anything that he does not spend three days at the conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret raising this today because, by raising it, I have really killed off Senator Alston's holiday. `Senator Hulot's' holiday is down the drain. He will now fill the whole thing up with meetings to prove me wrong. I am going to love being proved wrong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is correct, may I address the question that he answered from Senator Kernot regarding the shares in public enterprises being sold out to private enterprise. She was amazed that shares in some of those former government assets had risen to a high amount and said what a disgrace it was that the government sold off such things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the shares are pushed up by the fact that thinking investors out there look at the stock that is available and can see coming out of such a move better private enterprise management and a better thinking privatised board. That is why those shares go up. The converse can also apply&mdash;that, if you have not got a good board and private enterprise management, the shares will go the other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is wrong, Senator Kernot, with those shares going up? In the case of Telstra, for instance, where only a third of the shares or assets are being sold off, if they go up 20 per cent so does the rest of the asset, which remains in the hands of the government. You get better dividends and all that sort of thing returning to the government. I cannot understand why the Democrats, or anyone else, decry the fact that shares in X government enterprises go up a big or reasonable amount. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investors look at what is behind the company. For instance, in Western Australia, there are a couple of CEOs or chairmen of boards whom I am happy to invest in no matter where they go because they take their management skills with them. The same happens with assets that used to belong to the government. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6542">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot went on to speak further about what a disgrace something was. I forget what it was but she said it went up by a certain amount and that was lost to the Australian taxpayers or to Australians in general. That is not quite right, Senator Kernot, because what happens when they eventually sell their shares&mdash;if they sell them? First of all I will talk about the dividends. Generally, a higher priced company which is doing better will return a better dividend. Those dividends get taxed. That is one side. But people may eventually sell the shares off at an inflated price. Say they went up by 30 or 40 per cent. By any stretch of the imagination, about 48 per cent of that will go straight back to the Australian Taxation Office, which is for all Australians.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So even if there was a massive rise, as you said, 48 per cent of that massive rise will go back to the Australian people via the taxation department. When you criticise a government like ours for selling off these assets, you have to look at the whole picture, not just what you would want to have a look at for your ideology. You look at the whole picture and see what goes back into the government coffers. I said 48 per cent on your capital gains on any shares sold. Of course, you have the bigger value of the shares that are left in government hands. You have to look at all those things&mdash;not just get up and criticise. The fact is that when a government, whether our government or the former government, sells something off it keeps returning dividends into the public purse again. That is something you ought to take note of.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the motion moved by Senator Robert Ray that the Senate take note of the answers given by Senator Alston to various questions today. I found it extraordinary that the minister would stand here in the Senate today and say that his trip overseas was in no way interfering with the release of the Mansfield report. He set the date several months ago. The Mansfield report was to be handed to him before Christmas of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this year. A few days ago it was announced that it would be 24 December. That was clearly reported in several areas of the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then on Sunday, he was interviewed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program and, in a bold&hyphen;faced way, said it would not be appropriate to release this report on Christmas Eve because that is the silly season and people would not be interested. He said he would release it on 24 January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lo and behold, at the same time it turns out this is the exact period he is going to be overseas. The Mansfield report will be sitting there during the junketeering arrangements of this minister, who is travelling to Great Britain and America, and finishing off in Hawaii.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Carr says, he probably hopes to have a white Christmas in Great Britain. The document on the travel arrangements that we have seen says that the minister will arrive in Great Britain and have a private holiday&mdash;and then they want a few appointments in early January. Then the document goes on to ask staff in his department and anywhere else, for the rest of the period that he is away, `Have you got any ideas about how we can fill in a few days for the minister to see a few people?' That is in London and New York. For New York it says, `Keep the weekend free; perhaps the minister can have a cultural activity.' He could probably visit the Museum of Modern Art or something. That would be put down as a study tour for the minister for the arts, I suppose, as an idea that he could bring back and report on to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is as successful as his junket to India when he could not even get the tickets right to Circus Oz. His department gave out 6,000 tickets through the embassy for a venue that held 2,000 people. That created great embarrassment. Then the document goes on. It says he will go to Los Angeles for a day or so and asks whether anyone in the department has any ideas whom he could see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He finally finishes up for six days, according to this itinerary, in Hawaii of which for one morning he will be at an international <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6543"> telecommunications conference giving a speech. The rest of the time obviously he will be lying on the beach enjoying the sun&mdash;all through this period when we could have the Mansfield report out in Australia as part of the public debate. He is holding it up. He does not want to be embarrassed by having to conduct the debate from somewhere in the warmer climes of Hawaii or from a white Christmas in Great Britain. Back here in Australia, the ABC is under its greatest threat in its 60&hyphen;year history while the minister is junketeering around the northern hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Ray pointed out quite properly, we are not having a go at ministers but this minister, when he was in opposition, made it an art form to abuse ministers of the then Labor government and accuse them of having trips overseas. We have already counted up at least 12 to 15 different questions in this chamber, in the estimates and on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> about trips overseas of ministers. None of the other frontbench got into it but he made it an art form. Now he has created a great little junket for himself and delays the Mansfield report for a month to cater to his tourist needs; his shopping trips to Harrods and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked a question today about the post&hyphen;1997 legislation. That report that is coming out on 20 December is germane to that debate but he does not want to have that debate. He has received the report but he said today that he will not decide when he is going to release it. He will not release it while he is overseas; he will wait until he gets back. Yet, on 3 January, he will expect us to start debating this important legislation on the post&hyphen;July first deregulatory model, although we will not have a chance, even at the Senate committee level, to have a look at these important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made the offer to the minister six weeks ago that the opposition would support the legislation over the Christmas break or even earlier and, as soon as he introduced it, go into a Senate legislative committee so we could have hearings and deal with the amendments that may come from various groups. He accepted that. I must say that legislation was to have been introduced in very early October. There are 7&half; days to go before we finish <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this session of parliament and he still has not introduced it. If he does not watch out he will create mayhem and disorganisation in the telecommunications industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find this debate amazing when the other side have just been given a very strong message by the public on 2 March that they are out of touch, that the major issue facing Australia is foreign debt and other issues about the increasing gap between the rich and the poor, the fact that we had interest rates running at levels that we have never experienced before in Australia and we have gone through the deepest recession in 60 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But today we have seen Senator Ray ask a question here about what Senator Alston is going to be doing when he is overseas. I have to say that I went overseas with Senator Alston, when we were in opposition very early on. It was a trip that was not paid for by the public purse. He spent an enormous amount time in London, before we went on to Israel, going around and speaking to people in the area of communications. I was quite amazed at the level of activity he engaged in then, as a member of the opposition, when he did not have to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those on the other side and I know that a minister from the other side was accommodated in the Ritz, one of the most expensive hotels in London, and this was on the public purse. So do not come in here and look at Senator Alston's itinerary, 20 days out from when he goes. Did Labor ministers have all their plans structured and everything they wanted organised 20 days before they went? I do not believe for a minute that they did.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We remember that one of the ministers used to say, `Only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6544"> two or three appointments a day and don't start appointments before 10 o'clock.' That is what they did. They are indicating that Senator Alston should have his itinerary planned out beforehand. Of course he will ask his department, `Are there people I ought to go and see? Can you suggest people I should go and see?' Some of them will have travelled overseas and many will be very experienced in reading the literature and knowing who is up to date and who are the most important people in the field. Of course, you would ask your department&mdash;you would be mad not to ask your department who you should see. Of course he would do that. Fancy imagining that you could pluck the names out of your head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will have people to see whom he has met before and would like to see again. Given the broad responsibility he has in telecommunications and in the arts, he would need to try to get a balance across those things. Those opposite will say he has to work all weekend. He has squeezed in a trip so he has the weekend, because he has indicated that he wants to see something in the arts. That is totally appropriate for a minister for the arts to go and see a production and communicate with people. I did that when I was shadow minister for the arts. I went to France and of course I went to the opera and I went to visit the opera house. It gives you connections and interests. It would be a good idea if Senator Ray went overseas for a change&mdash;instead of watching his videos at home&mdash;and got some overseas experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Senator Ray said when he was speaking was that he would be left on a committee looking at the Mansfield report&mdash;I think he might have said `legislation'; I will stand to be corrected on that. But if he is saying that he is on a committee and he is going to be looking at legislation, let me tell you what they are going to do. When we had the Telstra bill, that bill should have come to a legislation committee. What did those on the other side do? They played a real trick. They did not comply with convention and send it to a legislation committee; they sent it off to a references committee where they have got the chairman and got the numbers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was never done on our side. Legislation went to legislation committees; references went to references committees. They chose to play tricks.

I hope the Australian Democrats will not agree to that again and let legislation go off to a references committee.</PARA>

There was, quite clearly, an undervaluing of the assets that they are seeking to privatise in Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He stated that there must be occasions when you leave something for those that come after. This was not some new found conservation drive that he was seeking. What he was seeking to do was to protect the future exploitation of one of Australia's great public assets. He is not some sort of born&hyphen;again greenie. What he was seeking to do was to protect the profiteers seeking to get their hands on Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, this follows a pattern for him. You do not see the same sorts of attitudes being expressed when it comes to the ABC. There is no interest there in protecting the assets of Australia. There is no interest being expressed there about ensuring that there is something for those that come after and ensuring that there is the protection of one of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6545"> the most valuable institutions in this country&mdash;the ABC. What this government has done is impose cuts of some $209 million over four years. The minister stands in this Senate like Pontius Pilate, washing his hands of the consequences of those deliberate acts to undermine the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the pattern there? From the very night of the election we saw this government announcing that they did not intend to cut the ABC. Then, straight after the election, they made it perfectly clear that that was their intention all along. It was their intention. Despite what they told this Senate and despite what they told the electorate before the election about their intentions to defend the ABC, the reality is that they have embarked upon a program of quite deliberately undermining and attacking the ABC at every possible turn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you see in a number of statements by the government at a senior level&mdash;from the minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;is that they have all indicated their determination to undermine the capacity of the ABC to meet its comprehensive broadcast responsibilities&mdash;to undermine the charter of the ABC in such a manner as to be able to reduce the effectiveness of the ABC in such a manner that it will reduce public confidence, ultimately, in the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you notice is that the Prime Minister told Fran Kelly from the ABC that the ABC was politically correct to a fault and that there tends to be a concentration around one particular point of view. You saw the Treasurer, Mr Costello, believe there was a lack of accountability. You saw the minister himself say that he thought the budget was very bloated and that they could sustain a 10 per cent cut without a reduction in efficiency or service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, what is happening in terms of the reduction in service is that those understandings are not possibly being met. They could not be met. It was quite impossible for them to be met. What else would you expect? You cannot possibly take $209 million out of the budget of the ABC, which has a budget <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of some $500 million per year, and not affect the quality of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in opposition have seen many members of the Liberal Party complaining bitterly about the concentration of resources in Sydney. What you notice is a direct result of the budget decisions being taken by this government. The ABC has no choice but to remove services from other parts of this country. We have a situation now in my city, Melbourne, where the circumstances are that there is a continuing networking of programs to the extent that we cannot even get a local weather report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the great institution being reduced in this manner by the actions of this government and by a minister that stands in here and says, `Of course, all Australians can afford shares.' We cannot afford an ABC. We cannot afford a decent service that allows for very basic entitlements that this country has a right to expect, and that is a comprehensive broadcasting service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that is determined, as they said, in turn, when they appointed the new chair and the secretary to the department, Mr Neville Stevens, who wrote to the remuneration tribunal saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the new chair will have significant responsibilities. The chair will be required to refocus the ABC, narrowing the range of its activities to concentrate more clearly on its public service role.</PARA>
<PARA>We know what that means now&mdash;that if you are in Melbourne on a Saturday night, you cannot get a local weather report because your services are coming out of Sydney. That is what they mean by `refocus the ABC' and `narrowing the range of its activities to concentrate more clearly on its public service role'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland&mdash;</STATE>
<ROLE>Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), said in his answer to my question today&mdash;and Senator Panizza said it also&mdash;that the Democrats are against anyone making a profit on shares. Now that is absolutely wrong. We were making a distinction between ordinary shares and windfall profits&mdash;overnight profits to the tune of $3.3 billion for German private shareholders at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6546"> expense of the German public purse, $3.2 billion in the case of Britain and $558 million in the case of the Australian public purse and the sale of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is, at what cost do we sell our publicly owned assets and who pays the cost? Senator Panizza argued that you get 48 per cent back at some stage through taxpayers paying tax on shares. What a great return that is! A 100 per cent loss of the future profit stream for the wonderful return of 48 per cent from those who do not engage in tax minimisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second assertion made by Senator Alston was that everyone can afford to buy shares. He said everyone has enough to buy shares. How many shares you buy depends on how much you have. `It is a judgment for all to make,' he said. Try to tell that to the coalition's battlers! If you look back at the first tranche of the purchase of Commonwealth Bank shares you will find that people had to buy a minimum of 400 shares at $5.40 each. The Qantas float required a minimum of 1,000 shares at $2 each. In the Commonwealth Bank's second tranche, you needed a minimum of $2,000, again, just to apply for shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the point we are making: coalition battlers fighting to feed their families, send their children to school and pay the mortgage are going to miraculously find $2,000 worth in their back pocket just to line up to buy shares. They do not need to because Telstra is publicly owned. It is owned by them at the moment. Its future profit stream will be shared by them in the future. If the government is saying everyone can afford to buy shares, is it suggesting that it is going to sell off individual Telstra shares so that people can find $1, $2 or $5.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that really annoys me about the coalition's approach is that they do not think there is anything wrong with an accumulation of $1.5 billion in rip-offs from the systematic undervaluation of publicly owned assets by the previous Labor government, which has been continued by this government. If it continues in the case of Telstra, we are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> looking at a $1.6 billion rip-off from taxpayers, from the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in the context of a very mean budget&mdash;a budget which has priorities in severely cutting entitlements, in severely cutting a range of services at both the federal and state level, such as child care, in taking money out of the public school system, and so on. On the other hand, in contrast to a mean, savage, petty budget&mdash;particularly the Commonwealth dental program&mdash;what do we have? It is okay to rip out $1.6 billion from the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What kinds of priorities are these? These are the priorities of those who think the financial markets are paramount and that undervaluing assets is fine because it is an incentive to future shareholders&mdash;the lucky few&mdash;at the expense of the current shareholders. That is what is wrong with this policy. It is very bad policy. It is bad enough to sell Telstra. It is very bad economic policy to sell it for at least 20 per cent below cost and to visit a loss of $1.6 billion on the taxpayers of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The necessity for the recommendations of the cross&hyphen;party Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on the proposed lifting of bans on imported cooked chicken into Australia to be implemented in full by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA>Today we are addressing a matter of extreme urgency. I want to point out that there are two issues. One is the issue of urgency and the other is contained in the motion itself&mdash;that is, the necessity for the recommendations to be implemented in full. I believe that these two matters are the subject of this debate, and certainly they ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this matter urgent? It is urgent because all of the signals are that the Minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6550"> for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is going to ignore the Senate report and its recommendations and allow the importation of cooked chicken meat into this country&mdash;against the advice of every single one of the farmer organisations, against the advice of all of the chicken producers in this country and against the advice of the peak bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this is a gross dereliction of duty on the minister's part. Instead of listening to what is being said to him, objections&mdash;proper objections which have been raised&mdash;have been met on every occasion with abuse. Let me read to the Senate a notice of motion that I moved in this place some weeks ago. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) notes that, in answer to a question on 5 November 1996, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announced that `the Government was determined to seriously consider allowing imports of cooked chicken meat'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That was before the minister had read the report, before he had responded to its recommendations and before the Nairn report had been handed down. Let me point out that the Nairn report has still not been tabled in this place, in spite of the fact that it quite clearly was leaked to certain sections of the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the people whom the minister is supposed to represent&mdash;the people whom he abuses&mdash;were not allowed to see the report upon which he based his abuse. The parliament, which is supposed to consider this issue, has been ignored, and a very responsible report by this Senate&mdash;I might underline that by saying that it was a unanimous report of all the parties represented&mdash;has been ignored by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is not the end of the matter. Let me read what an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article reported the minister as saying a couple of days ago about chicken growers in this country. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . yesterday, Mr Anderson launched a stinging attack on the chicken industry for its continued opposition to an AQIS recommendation that imports of cooked chicken meat be allowed into Australia from the United States, Thailand and Denmark. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Referring to opponents of the move as "immature reactionaries", Mr Anderson told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS>  he was "fed up" with their inability to look at the future of the industry in a broader context of world trade and quarantine realities.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me remind the Senate that Mr Anderson was not talking about a bunch of trade unionists out on strike against some primary industry or other. He was not talking about his political opponents. He was not speaking about a group of terrorists trying to destroy the country. He was speaking about people he is supposed to represent. He was talking about farmers who quite naturally believe in their own industry and want to continue farming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can they draw the title of immature reactionaries? I would suggest that there are a lot of people in this country who believe in farmers and who want to continue farming. Are they all immature reactionaries, simply because they want to protect their own industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me add to this. In August 1995, Mr Anderson wrote to Mr John Clarke, President of the Victorian Farmers Federation Chicken Meat Group. He pointed out just how concerned the coalition was about AQIS. His letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition has for some time been concerned about the quality of the investigative work carried out by AQIS. Our concerns have been heightened in recent weeks by comments from senior CSIRO scientists who have referred to a brain drain in AQIS and suggested there are serious deficiencies in our quarantine arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the extent of concern raised about the adequacy of AQIS's quarantine risk assessment process warrants a thorough investigation, and in the case of Newcastle Disease the conduct of an extensive Environmental Impact Statement.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, having been elected to government, all of a sudden the commitments given in that letter have disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the Senate that almost every one of the peak bodies concerned with this issue agree with the Senate and its report. They would urge the minister to take note of what is being said, to read the report and to implement its recommendations. Lex Buchanan, from the Queensland Farmers' Federation, says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6551">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations by the Senate Committee inquiry into the administration of all aspects of the importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia pave the way for significant and long overdue changes to the way quarantine issues are managed by AQIS.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Rural industry in Queensland fully understands the trade implications of raising and lowering quarantine barriers under the new international trading arrangements," he said. "We have had this trumpeted to us by Government officials for long enough. Unfortunately those same officials do not appear to be listening to industry and the community who are saying that there are other considerations in addition to trade matters which must also be taken into account."</PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Farmers' Association put out a press release, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Farmers' Association has called on Primary Industries Minister, John Anderson, to reconsider the proposed importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This follows the release of recommendations from a Senate Committee for more tests to be carried out on whether the commercial processing of foreign chicken meat can prevent the entry of Newcastle Disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"NSW Farmers' has always been concerned about the scientific basis of AQIS's decision on this matter and these concerns have been echoed to some degree by this report," Mr Comensoli said.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland farmers and the New South Wales farmers agree with the report of the Senate inquiry. The Minister for the Environment in New South Wales put out a press release which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Government today launched a public education campaign on the deadly dangers of imported cooked chicken products to the poultry industry and native birds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environment Minister Pam Allan said the campaign was the result of a resolution passed by parliament earlier this year.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This Federal Government decision will destroy jobs on the Central Coast, Hunter and rural areas of this state," said Ms Allan.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .      . . .      . . .<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Imported meat is a real threat to local jobs, as this industry employs 17,000 people nationally," Ms Allan said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Federal Government's action flies in the face of the advice from the all party Senate Committee for Rural and Regional Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>Everybody around this country, except the minister, seems to understand the concern that our own chicken growers have. I could go on and add to what I have just read to you by quoting the concern of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who often are on opposite sides of the fence are united on this issue. What is the consistent recommendation they are giving? They are saying to the minister, `For goodness sake, before you make this decision, take note of the recommendations of that Senate inquiry.' It is urgent that the minister hears the voice of the Senate again today on this matter, that he listens to what the Senate is saying to him and that he takes account of the recommendations which were made. Added to that urgency is the fact that not only is our own poultry industry under threat but Newcastle disease infects many different species. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(3.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of Australia's quarantine policy is critically important. It is one which is critical not only to rural and regional Australia and our primary producers but also to all Australians in terms of the contribution to agriculture, to the Australian economy and to our export efforts. It is in this context that we are discussing Senator Woodley's motion today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's national interest in quarantine policy has two dimensions. The first is to protect the health of humans, plants, animals, fisheries and our natural and built environments through a conservative, disciplined and scientific approach to quarantine, including effective border controls and assessment of import access requests. The second is to safeguard and enhance our trading interests, including gaining access to export markets by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6552"> conforming with the international obligation that Australia has, and in which it has been instrumental in establishing and adopting relevant international systems and standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has made clear on numerous occasions, this government has no intention of moving away from a conservative approach to quarantine policy justified on scientific grounds. If the science does not add up, then the product will not be allowed entry&mdash;contrary to a view I sometimes hear expressed. AQIS is constantly refusing requests for import or is turning shipments around because they do not conform with our strict import protocols. This has included recent well&hyphen;publicised cases of rejected shipments of fertilisers and farm machinery as well as fruit and other products from the Pacific, Africa and the subcontinent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, as Senator Cook and Senator Bob Collins will well appreciate, Australia has worked hard to put in place a set of international arrangements through the WTO sanitary and phytosanitary agreement which seek to ensure that quarantine is not used as a non&hyphen;tariff barrier. The same international rules which have required Australia to address, in a timely way, import access requests for products previously restricted by quarantine barriers are being aggressively used by Australian negotiators to open up significant new access opportunities for Australian products in other markets. Given that Australia exports five times more food than it imports, this is clearly in our national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1995-96, AQIS was successful in gaining access for nearly 70 products in 38 markets. These included poultry and poultry products into Malaysia, citrus products into Thailand&mdash;estimated to be worth $1 million in the first year&mdash;and rising citrus exports from the Riverina and Sunraysia into California and Florida.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us be under no doubt about the importance of the issues for our primary industry sector and the communities of rural and regional Australia. Our approach is under careful scrutiny internationally. As the minister has said recently, our current negotiations with the EU over the new veterinary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangements will have a direct impact on our $400 million agriculture export trade with Europe. It is against this background that we need to address the issue of proposed imports of cooked chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This chamber well knows that this is an important request that has been under assessment for six years. The IRA was completed in 1994, including detailed work on the science of the cooking proposal. The previous minister was advised by AQIS in May 1995 that the scientific assessment was complete and that under strict conditions imports would be permitted. He noted this advice and did not challenge it. He apparently was going to undertake some final consultation with industry. We can only speculate on what he did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the situation Minister Anderson inherited. He held consultations with industry in May and June and initiated two government&hyphen;industry working groups to enable final consultation on the technical quarantine protocols to be applied and on the possible economic adjustment which might need to be considered as a result of cooked chicken meat imports, which are estimated to comprise between two and five per cent of domestic chicken consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Independent scientific advice confirms AQIS's time&hyphen;temperature parameters. The industry has also confirmed in writing that they agreed the cooking parameters will deactivate diseases of concern. The minister has to weigh this evidence, along with the view of the Senate committee. As non&hyphen;scientists, they did not consider it appropriate or wise to arbitrate on the scientific issue. Indeed, they noted that AQIS had put forward a considerable amount of evidence supporting the view that the science is sound&mdash;consisting of reputable, scientifically based opinions, including those of most of the state veterinary authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Animal Health Laboratory, the Bureau of Resource Sciences and Dr Dennis Alexander, a renowned national virologist, support AQIS's view. Nevertheless, the committee recommended cooking tests be done on chicken products in collaboration with industry. This will need to be considered. The minister also has to weigh up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6553"> this view in the light of strong industry concerns about the introduction of Newcastle disease in cooked chicken meat. Requests have also been received from the same industry to ease the import arrangements for hatching eggs from Denmark, where there have been recent occurrences of the Newcastle disease. It is interesting to note that the company concerned noted that ill&hyphen;informed rumours have circulated in the Australian industry regarding the biosecurity of allowing the hatching egg shipment to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry has also expressed concern about the import protocols and the question of the inspection of processing plants. With regard to the Thai plants, it is interesting that a consultant representing the Chicken Growers Council said before the Senate committee inquiry into AQIS in November 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . their plants are as well equipped, or better equipped, than our plants. So there is no Third World status in terms of the Thai food processing industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate committee expressed its satisfaction that AQIS's approach to processing contamination is appropriate. The committee went on to observe that industry had been slow to understand and accept the basis of certification procedures between trading countries and the difficulties that Australian exporters would undoubtedly face if such procedures were discontinued. Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the plants in all countries proposing to export chicken to Australia should be inspected. This will also need to be considered carefully by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, the committee also recommended that the Quarantine Act be amended and that final responsibility for quarantine decisions be placed in the hands of the minister and/or the government. The committee goes on to recognise that any decisions must be consistent with the provisions of the agreement. This is a very important issue and one that needs to be weighed up carefully by the government, along with the many recommendations in this area made by the Nairn committee of review whose report will be released shortly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, I reiterate that the Senate committee report is under active consideration by the minister. Given the short time since its delivery to the Senate&mdash;less than two months&mdash;and given the previous government's very tardy track record in responding to committee reports from RARAC, animal welfare and other committees, I suggest that the Senate be patient and allow the minister time for due and proper consideration of all the issues in light of what I have raised here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is on that basis that the government must oppose Senator Woodley's motion. This motion demands a decision be made ahead of the Nairn report being released. It demands a decision be made by the minister in a time frame of weeks and not months rather than the years taken by the previous government on a variety of issues. As I said at the beginning of my speech, there is no argument that quarantine issues are of vital concern not only to this chamber but also to all Australians. No-one is more acutely aware of that than the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I think if Senator Woodley had waited to see how the minister takes up all the suggestions that have been made&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Brownhill) on the moderate response which he has just delivered on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson). If the minister had responded in similar style, I suspect we would not be here this afternoon <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6554"> debating this urgency motion&mdash;and I see Senator Woodley nodding in assent. I know that the parliamentary secretary has a job to do on behalf of his minister. I also know about the personal representations that the parliamentary secretary has made to his incompetent minister on this issue. I know about the representations that he has made on behalf of this Australian industry&mdash;and I am pleased to say one of the few bits of the Australian food industry still substantially owned by Australians&mdash;to this fumbling, bumbling minister who has made a mess of this issue from day one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliamentary secretary did not attempt to defend the outrageous abuse which has been heaped on the leaders of this important Australian industry which employs thousands of Australians. It is one of the biggest&mdash;if not the biggest&mdash;industries in the Hunter Valley. It is bigger than the wine industry in the Hunter Valley. It is one of the most substantial Australian industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Australian leaders of this Australian industry that provides thousands of Australians with permanent work had the temerity to stand up for their own industry&mdash;and the minister might have disagreed with the position they were taking&mdash;what was the minister's response? It was to heap gratuitous abuse on them in the national newspapers of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I read this I was honestly surprised. I was so surprised by what the minister had to say that I checked it in parliament. I gave the minister an opportunity to correct the record and to say he had been misreported. Honourable senators would remember I put a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer&mdash;and I see Senator Woodley nodding assent. The minister said that the minister confirms the accuracy of the quotations in the newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said that the leaders of this Australian industry were `infantile opportunists'&mdash;people who could not see the future of their own industry. You can imagine the reaction of the people in this industry&mdash;I know them only too well; in many cases they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been doing this for a living for their entire lives&mdash;to that piece of gratuitous abuse heaped on them by the minister for primary industries. How then do you reconcile the difference in the minister's attitude to this industry and his own industry, the grain industry, where he is a producer? He pulled the plug&mdash;and this is a quarantine issue&mdash;on imported grain trials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the height of the drought when things were very bad&mdash;thankfully they are not that bad any longer&mdash;and grain had gone beyond $300 a tonne, grain farmers around Australia were hoarding grain on their properties. Who could blame them? They were having a very hard time and the price was going up $10 a day. They were hanging on to it a bit longer.</PARA>
<PARA>When the feedlot industry and the consumer industries in Australia were desperate in terms of the prices they could no longer afford, we announced as a government, rightly, that we would carefully consider the importation of grain under strict quarantine conditions. ABARE in fact measured the response. Within two weeks of that announcement the price had dropped something like $50 a tonne because people thought, `We had better not hang on to it any longer', and that is why we did it in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We instituted careful trials to provide a protocol&mdash;not to necessarily import grain now&mdash;to provide the basis for these important feedlot and chicken industries in Australia that depend on grain. On the basis that you get at least one major doubt every 10 years in this country, we did not want this crisis to occur again. So we put into place a careful trial to at least lay down the protocols for the importation of grain to keep these vital Australian industries going. The future of the Australian beef industry is with the expansion of the feedlot industry in Australia, not the contraction of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the minister's response to this? Within weeks of taking office&mdash;I mean weeks&mdash;he pulled the plug on the grain trials. What happened to free trade then, parliamentary secretary? What happened to all the GATT conditions there? They went out the door. It was closed borders as far as the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6555"> minister was concerned. Little wonder the chicken industry is now asking: `free trade or fowl play?' in respect of this minister. Have a look at the public record. On 17 April, within weeks of the 2 March election, the minister said this about the grain trials:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am prepared to have the panel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the assessment panel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">meet again on this matter but would indicate clearly that I believe the suspended trial should now be abandoned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be advising the panel there will be no further Commonwealth support for the trial.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no doubt in anyone's mind that that statement by the minister ended the imported grains trial. Let me tell you, that was the finish of it. We have kept in close touch with those consumer industries of grain in Australia, and nothing has happened since. It has all been put on hold. I daresay we will go through the same circus next time we have a major drought in this country. On the issue of quarantine for imported grain, as far as the minister was concerned it was brick walls up all around Australia. The barriers were there. It was closed borders, finished.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. I put the fair question, and people in the chicken industry are putting it now: what is this minister's attitude to the same quarantine issues when the chicken industry is involved? He heaps abuse on the leaders of the industry. The minister says that they cannot see the future of their own industry. What is the answer to that question? Why is there a difference with this industry? It is because this minister is a grain farmer, not a chicken farmer. That is the difference. For that reason, I have no hesitation in saying, parliamentary secretary, that the minister's stand on this issue is contemptible and very partisan in terms of his own interests as a producer, and the chicken industry is well aware of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if the minister disagreed with the position that the industry is taking on this, he could have been far more temperate in his treatment of his own constituency in the public press. Then we may not have been having this debate here today. If the measured and moderate response that you, parliamentary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> secretary, delivered in here this afternoon had been the response of the minister&mdash;as I suggest to him it should have been&mdash;maybe this debate would not have been necessary. If you do not take the abuse that was heaped on chicken farmers by the minister in the public press, and confirmed by the Minister for Resources and Energy in here on the minister's behalf, as being a rejection of the recommendations of this all&hyphen;party unanimous report, then everyone in the industry does&mdash;and I think not unreasonably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at the history of this matter. Four weeks after the minister's speech to the grain industry, where he put up the shutters on imported grain and closed down even any consideration of that being done, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> carried a headline` Fowl tempers feared'. It said this, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At 5 p.m. last night the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, had signed off on a politically sensitive protocol allowing the importation of cooked chicken meat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If he hasn't already, he soon will have," an aid said confidentially.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conversation with our correspondent then proceeded something like this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Us: "Has he told the National Party colleagues?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aide: "Um"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Us: "Has he told the industry?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aide: "Er"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Us: "There are some pretty lively chook farmers out there. Just ask Ron Boswell.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aide: unintelligible gurgling noise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Us: See you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suddenly it was 5.30: the aide was on the line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aide: "I was wrong. The minister hasn't signed off after all. He's going to consult with the industry first."</PARA>
<PARA>So then began a very long and sorry public saga that led to this recent all&hyphen;party Senate committee report. At the centre, we had Mr Anderson trying to fob off his responsibilities and once again&mdash;the parliamentary secretary did it in a little more measured way&mdash;he was running the furphy that `It was nothing to do with me. It was all the fault of those terrible Labor people and that Bob Collins who made this decision last year in May.' Let me put one commonsense question to you: if I took the decision in May last year to allow the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6556"> importation of cooked chicken meat from Thailand, why aren't we up to our ears in it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the decision was not taken. No less a person than the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) had to admit that in writing to the Mangrove Mountain Districts Community Group, representing members of the chicken industry. In a letter to them on 26 June the parliamentary secretary stated that the previous government had made the decision. He was forced to correct it one month later in a subsequent letter where he said correctly that the AQIS brief had simply been noted by me. I signed it; I remember only too well what I put on the bottom of that brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the bottom of any ministerial brief are usually&mdash;more often than not&mdash;the words `agreed', `not agreed', `noted'. It is self&hyphen;explanatory. When you put `noted' on the bottom, what that is means you have read it. That's it. That is the status it has got. That is the status it had. That is the status I intended it to have. On that basis, with the documentation in the hands of the government, the minister was happy to deliver this whopping untruth and continue to deliver it in parliament again last week, saying that the previous government had made the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have got any further doubts about it, I refer you to the evidence put before the committee that we are debating the report of today. It was provided by AQIS. There was no such decision taken by the previous government. I was not satisfied that all the work had been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any further doubt about it, this is a letter I wrote to the same organisation on 28 August last year&mdash;during our last few months of office&mdash;where I made it clear on the second page of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS is now in the process of finalising its risk assessment and risk management recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>AQIS might have been satisfied that they had finished it, but I was not&mdash;and they knew it. The jury was still out as far as I was concerned and there was more work to be done. That was on 28 August last year. For your own credibility, Parliamentary Secretary, stop trying to save the completely shattered credibility of your boss and do not quote that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> furphy again. I seek leave to table the three pieces of correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we know, the minister did something else that makes this sorry saga even worse and is not just trying to fob off his responsibility onto somebody else. When this was a red hot issue&mdash;and it was&mdash;in the primary industry sector during the run-up to the last election, he had no hesitation in giving the Australian chicken industry written assurances that there would be no decision taken on the importation of chicken meat until the Nairn report had been completed and `its recommendations acted on in full'. I thought that was an astonishing commitment to give at the time, even in an election campaign. I thought it was fairly ratty, frankly, to give your imprimatur to recommendations you had not even seen yet; nevertheless, he did it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further than that, the minister actually promised in writing a full environmental impact statement process under the EP(IP) Act to the chicken industry because of the problems that Newcastle disease potentially has for our own native bird life in Australia&mdash;and those problems are potentially significant. They were written undertakings given by the now minister, and he tore them up without the slightest compunction after the election. To add insult to injury, when the industry tried to hold him to it, he not only tore up his promises but also heaped abuse on them in the national press of this country for having the temerity to stand up for your own industry. I commend you again, Senator Brownhill, for the measured way in which you responded in here this afternoon, rather than the childish five-year-old, intemperate nonsense that was indulged in by your minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to the report, these recommendations were deliberately constructed as moderate recommendations. This committee took its work very seriously indeed. I am not interested in putting up any false barriers to trade in Australia either&mdash;never was and am not now. There is still more work that needs to be done and, totally consistent with our GATT obligations, should be done. It is totally arguable from an Australian perspective.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6557">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have scientific testing which has not been done on the pathogen in question, Newcastle disease, or on the product we are importing, which is cooked chicken meat, but has been done on an associated disease, bursal disease, and on eggs in a laboratory five years ago, I think it is reasonable, for the chicken industry&mdash;to be blunt, for industry politics apart from anything else&mdash;to say, `Can't we have some testing done on Newcastle disease which we are worried about on the actual cooked chicken meat that we are proposing to import?' I do not think that is unreasonable. That is what the committee has recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has also suggested that if the decision should be taken to import the product, then we impose the tariff which is our right to impose under our obligations under GATT. That has had a negative response from the government as well&mdash;to my astonishment. The Senate committee was told that the bound rate for getting our chicken meat into Thailand is 60 per cent and the applied rate is about 40 per cent. So there is a 40 per cent barrier for Australian chicken meat going into Thailand. We are proposing to put on a 13 per cent tariff, immediately phasing down to nine per cent by the turn of the century&mdash;totally consistent with our GATT obligations&mdash;and that gets attacked by the government as going back to the dark old days, which it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this committee has not made radical recommendations. They are reasonable recommendations that some further scientific testing be done on the actual pathogen on the actual product that is going to be imported into Australia. They deserve to be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great relief to me that we are at least beginning to have the debate within the community and within this chamber in relation to what the egg industry calls free trade or fowl play. We are beginning to talk about the issue in its context, and that is extremely important. It is extremely important for any further Australian international negotiations in relation to so-called free trade. It is also extremely important for Australia to be able to gain some idea, finally, of the implica <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tions of the obligations to which Australia has agreed under the World Trade Organisation and to which we became a party as a result of the signing of the Uruguay Round of GATT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, a couple of years ago the farmers federation were asking for an investigation and inquiry into environment and the GATT. I am not sure whether that has gone any further but I think it would have been a good idea to find out what the total implications were for Australia. I have never said that we should just be talking about the environment in relation to the implications for Australia of the signing of the Uruguay Round of GATT. I have always said that what we should be looking at are the social, economic and environmental implications of Australia's obligations under the Uruguay Round of GATT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is for the Senate to demand full implementation of the committee recommendations. While I certainly believe that the implementation of these recommendations would be a good idea, I do not think that they are of themselves enough to give me confidence to believe that it will lead to the importation of cooked chicken meat being a safe option. I believe the precautionary principle should be followed. Certainly, it would help to test the cooking, handling and packing procedures under commercial conditions. If tests have not been done on the pathogen, as Senator Bob Collins has just suggested, why haven't they been? This is just basic good sense, since real conditions will be markedly different from those where procedures are undertaken by trained scientists in a laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the issues here. My concern is that real conditions may vary considerably, and not just because of the difference between laboratory and commercial equipment, or because of the volume and speed of handling. We also need to consider that equipment will be run for years and that failure to remain within required parameters does not always result in equipment stoppage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also pressure, especially in developing nations, to make do and mend and keep equipment running. The focus is liable to be to keep production going as fast as possible, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6558"> rather than keep it as free as possible from variations that might allow avian disease to arrive. This is especially the case where workers are not well educated, and education and training focuses on production rather than on sanitary measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what are the real issues? We have had a debate about cooked chicken meat and we have had a debate about salmon. We are having the debate now about industry self&hyphen;regulation and inspection. I have brought to the Senate issues of Codex Alimentaire. That is part of what we signed to under the Uruguay Round of GATT, which translates to the lowest common denominator. It also translates to different methods of handling issues like foot and mouth disease. Senator Bob Collins mentioned it could be a tariff barrier that would protect us. The interesting thing is that that is part of the agreement under the World Trade Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, a nation like Australia has to prove there is a problem, and that becomes extremely difficult until there is a problem. So proving there is a problem when there is not yet a problem is extremely difficult. That militates against the precautionary principle. Secondly, Australia would have to prove that quarantine is the least restrictive method of dealing with it. That also becomes extremely difficult. If we are left only with the potential of using tariffs, and if the minister has ruled that out, then maybe we have to realise that it is time Australia did look at the implications of so&hyphen;called free trade. We should find out whether it is fair trade and what the implications&mdash;social, environmental and economic&mdash;are, so that we can argue intelligently on world fora in relation to what the future might be. We should get intelligent input into whatever the next round is. They are talking about the environment. Maybe this is the kind of thing which we have to argue positively for in Australia&mdash;that it is not good enough, the implications were not clearly seen in Australia and other nations when we signed. We have to start changing that in world fora and not just accept that which could destroy industries.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Parliamentary Secretary <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the Minister for Trade and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Brownhill) on behalf of the government in speaking against Senator Woodley's urgency motion. The importance of quarantine practices and processes cannot be underestimated. As a senator from Tasmania, I am especially concerned to ensure that nothing is done which could compromise the disease&hyphen;free status of Tasmania, a competitive market advantage which cannot be overestimated. The Tasmanian economy is small, has few competitive advantages when it engages in world trade and, consequently, the maintenance of the agricultural advantages of Tasmania are paramount to my state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators would be aware, two important agricultural industries in Tasmania are the apple industry and the aquaculture industry, particularly salmon raising. One is a long&hyphen;time signature industry for Tasmania, the other is an exciting emerging industry of world renown. As senators would also be well aware, both industries are presently involved in investigations by AQIS. These investigations involve the assessment of the potential risk of various diseases being introduced into Australia if action is taken to allow certain foreign products to be imported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, the relevant investigations are at different stages of consideration. I will not go into the details here in respect of those investigations as the process, particularly for the salmon industry, has been long and not without controversy. Rather, I would like to focus on the reason why we should accept and indeed welcome these investigations and why we must continue to stress the importance of scientific assessment and evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether we like it or not, we live in an age where trade in products is competitive and there is the possibility for all the peoples of the world to buy and sell their products on a world market. This is particularly the case for agricultural and rural products. Australian meat, cereals, fruit, wines, fish, cheese, sugar and numerous other products are exported throughout the world for the consumers of the world who demand quality at a reasonable price. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6559">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, we Australians know that our agricultural products are, at the very least, comparable to the very best available anywhere. We want all the nations of the world to buy our products. Trade brings great income to Australia. It brings jobs and it secures the future for our children. Given that trade offers these benefits, should we be surprised that other nations want to sell their products to Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want to enjoy the benefits of international trade, we have to accept the trade rules that have been negotiated between nations in the World Trade Organisation. We are too small to go it alone. Those rules require, quite reasonably, that nations do not create artificial barriers to trade. Artificial restrictive access policies, which may be good short&hyphen;term domestic politics, will do us more harm than good in the long term. This is not to say that we do not have the right to protect our natural environment from disease. We have an obligation to demonstrate that our quarantine restrictions are validly established and justifiable. That is, we must be able to show, through scientific evidence, that our refusal to allow another country's products into our land is based on a real risk to our natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The obligation to undertake this assessment derives from agreements reached in the GATT Uruguay Round. Australia's commitment to the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement of the WTO imposes five requirements on us as a nation: firstly, quarantine decisions must have a sound scientific and technical basis; secondly, those decisions must flow from a proper process of risk assessment; thirdly, AQIS must adopt a consistent approach to risk management, that is, not arbitrarily adjust the acceptable level of risk from case to case; fourthly, the access decisions must be designed to achieve the determined level of risk in the least trade restrictive way; and, fifthly, the decision making process must be transparent and open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those obligations are no more than Australians would reasonably ask of any other nation on this earth. Put simply, these obligations require that we use the best science available to assess what risk the importation of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> product imposes on our country, make a determination of what is an acceptable level of risk and then stick with this outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Naturally, there will always be a difference of opinion among people, particularly politicians, as to what is an acceptable level of risk. Some people accept no level of risk. What these people have to accept is that such an isolationist approach to world trade will mean that our country is excluded from selling our agricultural products to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that, as a result of the GATT Uruguay round, it was estimated that Australia would benefit from an increase of around $1 billion per year in agricultural exports. Taking the isolationist approach not only puts this growth at risk but also imperils our present rural exports of over $20 billion a year. At the other extreme would be those few people who might suggest that we simply open our shores to all foreign products regardless of risk. This view, too, would be a disaster for Australia, and my state in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In between these extremes is the rational understanding of risk as a feature of life. This view suggests that we should look both at the possibility of an event occurring and the consequences of that event. Whether the risk is such that action should be taken to prevent the possible event should then be considered. This is rational and reasonable.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just have a look at the advice Senator Collins was given on this very important issue. On 23 May 1994, AQIS advised the minister of a position paper on cooked chicken meat, which recommended the importation of chicken meat subject to the prescribed quarantine conditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 30 May 1995, 18 months ago, AQIS advised Senator Collins that its technical assessments were complete and that access would be granted to the USA and Denmark for cooked chicken meat, subject to the fulfilment of specified conditions, and that access to Thailand would also be granted, subject to the outcome of processing plant inspections.

I seek leave to incorporate the statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and to move a motion in relation to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to report to the House on my recent visit from 22 to 26 November to the Philippines for the APEC leaders meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This meeting marked the start of the hard work of turning APEC's free&hyphen;trade rhetoric into reality. It began to turn vision into action. I believe that the meeting was very successful both as a forum for leaders to exchange views and in making progress on APEC's trade agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Manila each APEC member economy tabled an individual action plan which set out steps each would take towards the Bogor commitment of free and open trade and investment for developing economies by 2020 and developed economies by 2010.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These plans were reviewed and recommended by APEC trade and foreign ministers at their meeting just before the leaders meeting. I want to thank Mr Downer and Mr Fischer for their contribution during the year to producing a successful outcome in Manila.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While for the most part the plans contain steps to which economies were already committed under the Uruguay Round or unilaterally, they provide proof that APEC economies remain committed to removing tariff and non&hyphen;tariff barriers to trade and to freeing up investment. They thus set an example we hope non&hyphen;APEC members will take note of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish neither to exaggerate the achievements of the plans nor to undervalue them. They were a good beginning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They contain some new commitments of direct and early benefit for Australian business which in turn will create jobs for Australians. That is why we will continue to press for greater liberalisation of trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in the mining sector the Philippines will lift import restrictions on coal. Thailand will liberalise its natural gas market. In agriculture, Hong Kong will relax import restrictions on rice by 2000 and controls on the stockpiling of frozen meat and poultry. Japan will introduce new quarantine measures expected to expedite Australian exports of fruit and flowers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be other new opportunities for Australian business in banking and investment where access has been improved. China, for example, has agreed to increase the number of licenses for foreign banking, insurance and securities organisa <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6564"> tions. Thailand will increase the number of joint ventures in the insurance sector. Singapore will gradually open up the domestic banking sector to greater participation by international financial institutions. And the Philippines will review foreign investment restrictions on investment institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also promising new commitments with regard to opportunities for Australian professional services. Singapore will remove commercial presence restrictions on engineers and architects. Japan is to review laws relating to foreign lawyers operating in Japan. Korea will review restrictions on the commercial presence for foreign accounting firms and improve market access for foreign lawyers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plans provide for each economy a consolidated picture of liberalisation&mdash;in the case of some APEC economies for the first time&mdash;thereby giving a higher degree of certainty and transparency for business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plans also lay down a baseline for the future. In a rolling process, the plans will be continually reviewed, updated and improved over the next 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will now do all it can to encourage the production of better plans over the next year or two. APEC leaders committed themselves in their declaration to improve them by the time they next meet in Vancouver next year. APEC trade ministers will review them next year and in doing so will take into account the views of the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government welcomes the increasing involvement of the business community in APEC as insurance that APEC will focus on business's needs. The government sees a major role for the APEC Business Advisory Committee in monitoring the improvement of the action plans of the member economies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The business community has long asked governments to facilitate travel among member economies. I was pleased therefore to announce during the APEC meetings, agreement with Korea and the Philippines to trial Australia's proposal of an APEC business travel card which will provide business people with easier and faster access, including streamlined arrival arrangements. The government hopes that, once the trial has proved the worth of the scheme, other APEC members will join in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has already reduced tariffs and other barriers more than most member economies. Like every other government, mine will take account of what other economies are doing in deciding future steps. But our position is a positive one based on the assessment that liberalisation will bring overall benefits to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's own action plan demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to trade <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> liberalisation. This commitment is not a matter of ideology but a consequence of the government's conviction that liberalisation within the region will help sustain the region's economic growth, will open up increasing market opportunities for Australian exporters, will help promote Australia's own economic growth, and will create jobs and improve living standards in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC can help ease the costs of economic adjustment caused by liberalisation and globalisation through maximising the opportunities those same forces provide to increase our exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said in my first intervention during the leaders meeting, globalisation is the most potent economic force in the world today. It is important&mdash;in order to ensure public support for the economic and social adjustments that have to be made and to ensure that we can take advantage of the opportunities globalisation offers&mdash;that governments explain to their electorates the overall benefits of liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent survey of Austrade's exporter clients showed that nearly 60 per cent either had increased employment or expected to do so as a result of exporting. Sixty&hyphen;four per cent said that they expected improved profitability as a result of exporting. Likewise, a survey of the growth and performance of small and medium sized enterprises survey released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in September shows that a higher proportion of exporting businesses increased employment than non&hyphen;exporting businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC's ambitions will be realised only if all participating economies continue to liberalise. Not every economy will move at the same pace in the same area. And APEC does not require mathematically precise reciprocity. But for APEC to work there has to be continual movement across all sectors, and all economies have to see the benefits for them. That is, in APEC language, the principles of comprehensiveness and comparability are important to the success of APEC's trade liberalisation process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that respect, I found the APEC leaders meeting encouraging. My impression was of a strong commitment to APEC and to the goal of free trade as the centrepiece of APEC. I was particularly heartened to hear the President of the United States repeat his support for maintaining the momentum of liberalisation, as expressed during his visit to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC is an important element in the government's efforts to improve market access, growth and employment&mdash;but only one element. Externally, APEC is only one strand of our trade policy which focuses also on gaining access at the bilateral and multilateral levels. APEC can be of assistance by providing opportunities for bilateral discussions on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6565"> action plans and in imparting greater dynamism to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The call by APEC leaders for the WTO to conclude an information technology agreement is one such example.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And in turn, the government's trade policy is only one element in its overall strategy to lift growth. Living cheek by jowl with the fast&hyphen;growing Asian economies does not assure us of success. We not only need the market access, we also need to be competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's budget deficit reduction strategy, its reforms of the labour market and reduction of red tape are likewise important components of the government's programme to lift economic growth, employment and living standards. All of these are key ingredients in the government's approach to industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Manila and at the leaders meeting itself, I took the opportunity to underline my government's commitment to engagement with our region&mdash;and to APEC as a core feature of that engagement. I reiterated that our participation would be whole&hyphen;hearted in achieving the trade and investment liberalisation goals laid down at Bogor. I emphasised my personal commitment to continuing the work of my predecessors who established APEC and suggested the leaders meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC reflects the integration of the various strands in the government's regional policies. It demonstrates the mutually reinforcing roles played by our alliance with the United States and our partnerships with major Asian friends. It creates a sense of community among a very diverse group of economies by building on their common interests in promoting economic growth. It thus makes a very material contribution to the stability of our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The leaders meeting in particular is a most valuable institution&mdash;for Australia and the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. It provides an unparalleled opportunity for face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face contact between leaders in the region. It helps underline shared interests in growth and stability. It has a special character which can only be maintained if there continues to be a personal commitment on the part of all leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authority and expectations that leaders bring to the APEC process are essential to maintaining the momentum of APEC's core trade and investment liberalisation agenda and delivering the results our business sector and communities at large look for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the great strengths of the annual APEC meeting is the opportunity for the Australian prime minister to meet&mdash;in a very short period&mdash;a range of other leaders from our key regional partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a very useful and productive meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China. I was able to assure the president that the government saw close <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cooperation with China as important both politically and economically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As very different societies we will not always see eye&hyphen;to&hyphen;eye on everything. But a strong relationship is mutually beneficial, given the substantial interests we have in common. I look forward to giving practical expression to this when I visit China next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government sees China's full participation in regional and global structures as a force for stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a valuable first meeting with President Kim Young Sam. Korea is now our second&hyphen;largest export market and the ties between our countries, including at a people&hyphen;to&hyphen;people level, are growing strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My meeting with Dr Mahathir built on my discussions with him earlier this year and enabled me to underline the strengths and value of the bilateral relationship with Malaysia. I hope to be able to pursue this further when I visit Malaysia in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had good discussions with the prime minister of Singapore, Mr Goh Chok Tong, and I plan to visit his country also next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My meeting with Mr Chretien, the prime minister of Canada, enabled me to reaffirm our commitment to the traditionally close relationship between Australia and Canada. I look forward to attending the next leaders meeting under his chairmanship in Vancouver in 1997. His positive view of APEC's dynamism and capacity to produce results was encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was able to renew my acquaintance with a number of other leaders, including the Japanese prime minister, Mr Hashimoto and President Soeharto. It was a pleasure to see them again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I would like to thank President Ramos and the people of the Philippines for the generous hospitality they extended to me. President Ramos's strong and successful chairmanship of APEC during such a demanding year is a tribute to him and his government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The holding of the APEC meetings in the Philippines gave me the opportunity to restate the value the government places on Australia's relations with the Philippines. It also allowed me to see at first hand something of the benefits of the substantial reforms President Ramos has introduced&mdash;and in particular, the rapid economic growth the Philippines is now enjoying.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was pleased while in Manila to be able to speak at a reception held by the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand Chamber of Commerce and to meet many Australian business people who are seizing the opportunities in the Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I assure them, and all other business people operating in the APEC economies, of the government's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6566"> interest in their success and the priority the government gives to doing all it can to support them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  a statement relating to the late tabling of legislative instruments and to move a motion in respect of the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present sittings has seen many instances of the Senate exercising its right to scrutinise delegated legislation and, in a number of cases, of disallowing individual instruments. This close scrutiny of legislative instruments is a major contribution to our system of parliamentary responsible government, under which the executive branch is responsible to Parliament. During the sittings the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has also continued its non&hyphen;partisan scrutiny of delegated legislation, ensuring that individual instruments comply with high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights. The Committee does not, of course, raise policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>  at present provides the legislative basis for parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation. This will change if the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> present Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 becomes law and it was in respect of these changes that I reported to the Senate last week. However, it is the Acts Interpretation Act which provides for existing safeguards. One of the most important of these is that virtually all disallowable legislation must be tabled in both Houses within 15 sitting days of making, failing which an instrument will cease to have effect. Such tabling enables individual Senators both to be aware of what legislation has been made and, if thought appropriate, to set in train procedures which may lead ultimately to its disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore disturbing to report that in the last month there have been at least seven instances of disallowable instruments not being tabled in the Senate within the required 15 sitting days. Of course such instruments then cease to have effect, sometimes with unexpected legislative or administrative effects. Nevertheless, the result is that Commonwealth legislation has been made and has been in effect for those 15 sitting days, which may be the equivalent of several calendar months, without the Senate even being aware of its existence, much less being able to scrutinise it effectively. These present seven instances illustrate a number of other undesirable features of late tabling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two of the instruments which were not tabled in time were Marine Orders made under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Navigation Act 1912</EMPHASIS> . These instruments related to the safety of life at sea and as such are important. One of the Orders included, in the words of the instrument itself, a penal provision, in relation to ships carrying toxic, corrosive and chemical gases. The other included mandatory safety provisions. These Orders were sent to the Committee for scrutiny under a covering letter signed on a date when they were already invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two Marine Orders were then remade, with different citations, more than a month after the original Orders were made, with a prospective date of effect. It would not, of course, have been possible to remake penal and mandatory provisions to operate with retrospective effect. These fresh Orders were, however, themselves void because they were made within seven days of the last day on which the original Orders could have been validly tabled. The Orders were therefore in breach of section 48A of the Acts Interpretation Act, inserted in that Act in 1988 at the suggestion of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in order to give the Senate the fullest opportunity to scrutinise legislative instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final result, therefore, is that two instrument dealing with compulsory requirements of safety at sea, breach of one of which is an offence, were made and operated for a time, then, apparently without the knowledge of the administering agency, ceased to have effect because they were not tabled <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6567"> within the statutory period. They were then remade, after the staff of the Committee drew the invalidity to the attention of the authorities, with the intention that, after a period of hiatus, they would operate again. These two Orders were, however, void and, again without the knowledge of the agency, were never in operation. The Committee understands that the instruments will now be made for the third time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another instrument which ceased to have effect because it was not tabled was made by the Minister for Family Services under the National Health Act in respect of additional funding for isolated nursing homes. This instrument was validly tabled in the House. The Committee understands that an error was then found in the instrument and that, rather than repeal the incorrect provision and make it again with the intended effect, the Department decided to withdraw the instrument from tabling in the Senate. The result was that the instrument ceased to have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee points out that such use of the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, which are intended to give both Houses the opportunity to scrutinise delegated legislation, is not appropriate. The correct course in such a case, indeed the only course which properly recognises parliamentary propriety, is to table the instrument in the second House and to make a further instrument which corrects the oversight, as far as this is possible. In the present case the invalid instrument does not adversely appear to affect anyone except the Commonwealth, so it could even be made with retrospective effect, which would appear to have been the proper procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two instruments which ceased to have effect were made by officers of the Department of Industrial Relations as Determinations under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Service Act 1922</EMPHASIS> . One of these Determinations was tabled in the House of Representatives after it had ceased to be valid, even by the standards of the fewer sitting days of the House. The Department of Industrial Relations then withdrew the instrument from tabling in the Senate after advice from Senate staff that it was invalid. That Determination was sent to the Senate for tabling and scrutiny under a covering letter dated on a day when the instrument was already invalid. In the legal context, of course, it makes no difference whether the instrument is tabled or not. If the Determination has ceased to have effect then tabling will not revive its provisions, all of which are ineffective. Indeed, under the express provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, if an instrument which is invalid for late tabling purports to repeal an existing provision, then the repealed provision is revived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second invalid instrument made by the Department of Industrial Relations was tabled within time in the House of Representatives on the last possible <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> day, but this was too late for valid tabling in the Senate, which sits for more days than the House. Here again the covering letter from the Department to the Senate was dated on a day when the instrument was already invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final instruments which were not tabled in time were two sets of Rules of the Industrial Relations Court, each made by ten judges of that Court. Honourable Senators will recall the activities of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in respect of the first set of Industrial Relations Court Rules, which were almost 300 pages long. The Committee advised the Minister and the Chief Justice that these original Rules appeared to be void for prejudicial retrospectivity. The Committee was in turn advised that, although in the opinion of the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Chief Justice the Rules were not void, they would be repealed and remade in order to put the matter beyond doubt. This was then done, with the exception of one provision which everyone seemed to agree was void.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present two sets of Rules were both quite short, providing for the powers of judicial registrars and for the Court's power to determine costs. Neither provided for a commencement date and so both commenced on gazettal, which was a fortnight later. I add that the Committee would usually prefer that gazettal be earlier than this. In summary, Rules were made, gazetted two weeks later and ceased to have effect 15 sitting days after making, which was four weeks ago. The Committee has, so far, not received any replacement Rules to correct the invalidity, insofar as this can be done. Any action taken by the Court or a judicial registrar in reliance on the putative Rules during this time would, of course, have no lawful authority. The fact that the invalid Rules were made by the judiciary, not by the executive, illustrates the range of instruments which must be tabled in the Senate, in order for it to carry out its function of scrutinising legislation made under the tabled authority of an Act of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These two Rules of Court were included in the Statutory Rules series, most of which consists of Regulations made by the Governor&hyphen;General. The Committee understands that this is the first time for many years that Statutory Rules were not tabled within time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These recent failures to table illustrate aspects of the operation of legislative provisions which safeguard the ability of the Senate to scrutinise the operations of the executive and the judiciary. The nature of several of these failures, however, is such that it could be beneficial to reintroduce a previous provision of the Acts Interpretation Act under which instruments which were not validly tabled were void rather than merely of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These failures to table are of course not the only ones which have come to the attention of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6568"> Committee in the present sittings. I have twice reported to the Senate on the consequences of the failure to table a particular instrument made under the Native Title Act. In that case the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs advised the Committee that the Act would be amended retrospectively, apparently with prejudicial effect, to correct what the Minister advised were thousands of invalid administrative actions taken over a period of more than two years. Also, the Committee recently received an unusual instrument made under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Road Transport Commission Act 1992</EMPHASIS>  by a majority of the members of a Ministerial Council. In that case, however, most of the signatures of the Ministers were dated earlier than the required 15 sitting days. The Committee considers that the instrument may therefore have ceased to have effect and we have written to the Minister about our concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Senate is sitting for a period of four weeks, including two weeks when it will sit for five days. This means that the required 15 sitting days for tabling legislative instruments will lapse within a shorter period than usual. The Committee understands that the Clerk of the Senate has written to the heads of all Departments of State pointing this out and advising of the need for prompt tabling. The Committee supports this action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr should know by now that ministers are not always standing in the lobby waiting to come in. It was expected that debate on a number of other issues might have taken a bit longer than they did. Senator Vanstone is here, and to suggest that this was some sort of egregious contempt of the Senate, which, I think, was the suggestion that Senator Carr was trying to make, is entirely wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone takes this matter very seriously. What is very disappointing from the government's point of view is the fact that the attitude that has been evinced by some people opposite has not been as constructive as Senator Vanstone's comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note from the time that I have been on duty when this bill has been debated that Senator Vanstone has been extremely patient and has, in fact, been complimentary to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6569"> honourable senators of all viewpoints when she has agreed with their comments. To suggest that Senator Vanstone is, somehow, not treating this matter as serious is a grave disservice to Senator Vanstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly agree with the very fine comments she made when this bill was being dealt with in committee just prior to question time. The issue that the opposition should be focusing on is not that of trying to score some sort of easy point because Senator Vanstone was dealing with her other ministerial responsibilities. What the opposition ought to be focusing on is the essential point of principle, which is: why do they stand for a system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by Senator Carr, it is grossly unsatisfactory that he should cast aspersions on the minister. The central issue to which the opposition should address themselves is: why is the party that claims to be the party of the workers trying to oppose reforms to the education system which put people who are privileged&mdash;people who get a university degree, and they are 30 per cent of the population or less&mdash;in a situation where they get an income producing asset for life, and the truck drivers, the plumbers, the electricians and all the other people who will not get the privilege of a university degree have to subsidise that education with their taxes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the issue to which the opposition should be directing its attention. This rude little interruption we had from Senator Carr by calling a quorum because he did not like what was being said just goes to show how frail the Labor Party is on this. The opposition would know if it had any decency that the system that it is advocating sees the privileged few subsidised by the taxes of the workers. That is something that this government is trying very hard to rectify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they had any social conscience at all, and if Senator Carr was really interested in the class struggle that he claims he is interested in, then he would in fact be over here supporting the minister instead of interrupting her and instead of taking her name in vain as he did before he called that quorum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) strongly oppose the imposition of undergraduate fees. We have stated our previous opposition when we talked about our opposition to postgraduate fees. We believe this is a move that will prevent access to higher education for disadvantaged groups, the barriers of which are already high due to inadequate levels of student income support in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move is designed to advantage higher socioeconomic families who can buy a place based on privilege rather than merit. The Greens fundamentally oppose the move towards an elitist higher education system which will reward those already privileged with education and work opportunities. The Greens stand behind students who chant `Education for all, not just the rich.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the statements which the minister made when we were last dealing with this bill this morning, it is the fact now that many students are being priced out of the market. If there is going to be a gap which will be filled, if the government has its way with fee paying students, it is  because those students who are less able to pay are being priced out of the market. There is already rental related poverty. There is already evidence that there was pressure from some universities to lower the standards in relation to getting people across the system into the university system. The reality is that the system is not adjusting to demand. It is ratcheting up the prices to depress demand, and that is quite different from what is being suggested by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you ask students why they are choosing or not choosing to go to university, I am sure you will find out that student poverty, the difficulties faced whilst inside and outside study and the current employment situation are all rolled into that decision.

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats, of course, are on record a number of times now for voicing their opposition to the proposition that fees be charged, that undergraduate fees be allowed to be charged, by higher education institutions. There are a number of issues in this debate on the higher education funding bill that are of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We feel very strongly that there are equity and access principles here that have been overlooked. I would like to refer to the earlier comments of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) in this debate and the assertion that the abolition of fees in no way changes the make&hyphen;up and the proportion of students from traditionally previously disadvantaged backgrounds and their participation in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will refer to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's review of efficiency and effectiveness in the higher education sector in 1986. This review found that since the abolition of fees in 1974 there had been significant increases in the participation rates of women&mdash;I think that is undeniable&mdash;as well as older students. Many of these people were early school leavers or those who had previously been unable to access higher education for economic or social reasons. This review noted that older students tended to come from disadvantaged backgrounds and quoted research showing that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was an important part of the movement to redress the imbalance of participation of lower socioeconomic groups in higher education.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that comes from page 85 of that report. With regard to the participation of lower socioeconomic groups, the review noted that the abolition of fees coincided with the declining levels of student income support and the phasing out of teacher and public service studentships. The review concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is arguable that lower income groups would have been even less well represented had fees not been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>That was from page 94 of that document. We really have to hit on the head this notion that fees are not a disincentive to participate in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> higher education. There are a number of reports, a number of reviews and evidence that demonstrate that fees are psychological and financial disincentives to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has accused me of wanting to deny students some kind of choice. I think it is a false argument that these changes are being made under the guise of choice. I ask the minister: if we have two students and one has money and can purchase a place and the other student is poor and cannot, what kind of Hobson's choice is that? What kind of choice is that for students? Clearly, you would have to admit that, logically, people who can pay up&hyphen;front and full cost fees are advantaged by this system. Those people are people with money. They are people with access to wealth and money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I put it to the minister that this not only marks a massive shift in the way we view higher education in this country, as it does, but also represents a shift from public to private in the higher education sector. It is a shift that not even the private universities in this country deny. I have no doubt that the minister's office, just like my office and various others, has received correspondence from private universities such as Bond and Notre Dame&mdash;obviously they have their own interests to protect; I do not deny that for a minute&mdash;acknowledging that this represents `the privatisation of public universities in Australia'. So we are looking at a shift&mdash;a mental shift, an economic shift&mdash;in the way we view higher education in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it again to the minister that her concept of choice is false. There are economic and equity considerations in this whole proposal. I find it extraordinary that, once again, the minister has come in here to justify her position by claiming that somehow there was not a shift, a change, in the composition of participation in higher education after the abolition of higher education or tertiary fees by Whitlam in 1974. Again, it is an argument that she put to this chamber in Senate question time only a couple of weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats strongly oppose this move to up&hyphen;front, full cost fees. We know the vice-chancellors are divided on this one. We know that there are vice&hyphen;chancellors who have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6571"> spoken out against this. We know that there are institutions that are going to be advantaged by this decision and that there are going to be less well&hyphen;off remote and regional institutions that are going to find it more difficult to attract students and to maintain their infrastructure and various courses. We know that the vice&hyphen;chancellors and administration are divided on this one because they know that the rich institutions are going to get richer and that the poor institutions are going to suffer most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night, before this debate was adjourned, I asked the minister about the guidelines. I am happy to save this for a later stage when we deal with guidelines specifically, if we indeed deal with them. I have to look at safeguards if this bill is passed. I reiterate my question of last night to the minister: we accept that you are attempting to enshrine in the legislation the notion of a 25 per cent quota, but why not put other protective mechanisms and other safeguards into this legislation? Why not specify under what conditions fees can be charged for various undergraduate courses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, as I say, will be supporting Senator Bolkus&mdash;and I am glad to see that there is support from other areas in this chamber today&mdash;but we do see this as a fundamental shift, just as Dr Bruce Chapman, who is largely credited as being the architect of the HECS scheme, recognises that this is a shift from public to private in terms of higher education provision in this country and that it will advantage those people with money. Yes, Minister, I do believe it will lock out and provide no choice for those people from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds and for the poor kids who are aspiring to get into university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not make a mistake about it. You seem to think that these people do not necessarily have university aspirations. Of course they do, and these are the people who will be most affected by this change. We are talking about some families that have not necessarily had access to higher education in the past. Fees and charges do not make it easier for these people&mdash;this is not real choice. I ask you how this provides real choice for people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who do not have money and who cannot pay up&hyphen;front and full cost fees. I put it to you that that is not a real choice for these people.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stott Despoja has a different level of confidence in Australian universities than I do, and in their capacity to manage themselves and to find what it is they are best at and compete at that. Almost immediately, without any thought to the quality offered in regional universities, she assumes that they will be worse off vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis their capacity to sell places. I am presuming therefore she means in a proportional sense; she would not expect a small university to sell as many places as a large one&mdash;that is inevitable. But, proportionally, she assumes immediately that they have a lack of capacity to sell places without recognising, for example, that at James Cook University there is a great deal of specialty in marine biology that is world&hyphen;class capacity. That well may be an area in which James Cook chooses to further specialise and in which to take international as well as Australian students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Charles Sturt University concentrates on the niche of viticulture and viniculture associated with the wine industry. Why would Charles Sturt not seek to sell places, and have the capacity to sell them, in its niche area where it is so good?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to something completely different, Southern Cross University, with its course in modern music management, as I understand it, pretty much has to turn people away from that course. Why would Southern Cross not get the benefit of this opportunity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I make it abundantly clear that the government does lack confidence in regional universities and their capacity to offer excellence in areas of their choice, just as the older institutional universities can. If you believe that the world can move on from a few big, large, established universities that are the elite above all others then you must accept that newer, younger universities have the capacity to grow, develop and excel in areas of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You simply cannot have it both ways. You cannot on the one hand say, `This will only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6572"> be good for the big universities,' implying that that is not what you want, that you want everybody to have a go, and then in the next breath say, `When everybody is given a go, it'll only be the big ones that'll do any good' and express a lack of confidence in what the regional, smaller and newer universities can do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja invites me to comment on the choice aspect. She says that this provides no choice and, with respect, falls into the same trap as Senator Crowley&mdash;a trap or willing guise, I am not sure which. That is to say, `Look, what is the choice in paying when you didn't have to pay before?' As I said in response to Senator Crowley&mdash;and, Senator, you may not have been here&mdash;that gives a completely misleading tone to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we come to the actual debate on this, let us at least not pretend things are what they are not. Let us understand that this debate is premised on the knowledge that this government wants to offer more government funded undergraduate places next year, the year after and the year after that than would have been the case under the previous government. So let us not come in here and say, `Under this proposal the poor will miss out,' when the poor, as you so readily refer to them, Senator, have a share of increased government funded places. They will get more and they will get the same share more by the increased number of government funded places in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me recap the first point because I noticed you were on the phone, Senator. With an increase in the number of government funded places, it is more than a bit rich and a bit misleading for you to come in here and suggest that under the government's proposals somehow a group&mdash;and you refer to the poor, lower socio&hyphen;economic groups&mdash;will have less access when you know full well that if these proposals are passed those people will have greater access because there will be more government funded places. That is the first way they will get greater access, because they will get the normal share of the extra government funded places.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But you know that the proportion of people from higher socio&hyphen;economic groups that get into university is very substantial. I do not have the figures in front of me; someone might take the opportunity to get them for me. But something like 60 per cent of the benefits of tertiary education go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. We all know that if you are born bright and born into a wealthier family, you have X times more chance of ending up in university. That is what we are subsidising here. We are not subsidising poor kids in university. We are subsidising middle and upper income kids in university. We are in fact compounding the opportunities those kids have had by government subsidy. It would be a different matter if all government funded places only went to people from lower socio&hyphen;economic groups, but they do not and you know that, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, Senator, you know that some of those people who have, as you rightly identify, access to greater wealth will use that, perhaps to get to the university of their choice. They might live in my state of South Australia and go up to Darwin to do law because they did not get into law in Adelaide. They might decide that rather than pay boarding fees in Darwin, they would rather pay a bit extra and do law in Adelaide. Or they might always have wanted to be a physiotherapist and accept a second vocation because they did not get into physiotherapy. These are not the rich and thick, Senator. These are people perfectly capable of completing physiotherapy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, you know full well that some of those people who miss out on physiotherapy have the capacity to do it. You understand how the TER scores work. You understand that the TER scores are not a reflection of the intellectual skills required to get into a course. You understand full well that they are a reflection of the spaces available in the course and the number of people who want to do it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6573">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, you also know in your heart of hearts that there will be people who will accept a government funded place in the course of their second choice but would, if given the chance, be prepared to pay to get into the course of their first choice. In those circumstances, if they are given that opportunity&mdash;which is what we want to give them&mdash;those people whom you refer to as the rich and thick may move out of a government funded place to get the course of their choice, and pay more. But what will be the consequence of that? Because of the two rules&mdash;the 25 per cent rule and the government funded places rule&mdash;the government funded place they move out of will have to be filled by another student who otherwise would not have got in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are two ways in which government funded students who do not get in now will get in. Some extra students will get in because of the increase in undergraduate places&mdash;which are government funded places&mdash;that we intend to provide. Students who otherwise would not have got in to a government funded place will get in. Under the proposals we put forward, some people whom you so loosely refer to as the rich and thick will pay to get out of a government funded place and move into a privately funded place to get their first choice. They will leave their government funded place for another student who otherwise would not have got in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are saying, `Well, these people don't have any choice.' You are pretending that I expect they will be able to afford it. In the early stages of such a policy, there will not have been the capacity for a family to plan and save to provide such opportunities. I would think in the longer term families would do that, but in the shorter term they will not have had the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is certainly not saying, `Everyone will be able to afford this.' What we are saying is that we should give those people with wealth the opportunity to pay for their course and get out of a government funded place, if that is what they are prepared to do. Then we could put in people who otherwise would not have got those places.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has never marketed this policy as being a simple choice for all people&mdash;as though everybody has a substantial income, or everybody has prepared their savings, or everybody has the capacity to borrow against their mortgage, or whatever. For example, in so many Asian countries people borrow against their mortgage. The government has never said that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, it is a little irksome for you to come in and display some sort of condescending passion to those you describe as the poor and speak of them in some platitudinous way, as though this government is shutting them out. You know full well that this government is providing more government funded undergraduate places than the previous government would have provided over the next three years. You also know that the implementation of this policy would mean that some government funded students who can afford to pay will pay, leaving a space for a kid who otherwise might not have got in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not pretend that this is some policy designed to get at the poor. Could we at least keep the debate on the level of policy intentions and opportunities. Quite clearly, more government funded places and the requirement that they be filled before universities can sell places create two opportunities for students who otherwise would not have got in to get in to government funded places.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you this way. The number of undergraduate students in 1995 was 355,315, as measured on an EFTSU basis. That is some 8,710 EFTSUs above the targeted student load. The targeted undergraduate load for 1996 was 351,775, an increase of some 1.5 per cent on the 1995 targeted load of 346,605 EFTSUs. Is it not the case, Minister, that the actual load for 1996 is not yet available? Therefore, how can you possibly claim that there will be an increase of 6,000 positions in 1996?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do understand the difference between a forward estimate and this year. That is the first point. The second point is that you would also understand that the government is talking about the places it is prepared to fund. In the end, however many students roll up and take up those places is a matter that can be decided or calculated at the end of an academic year. But the government is prepared to fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me repeat those places for you. In what are described as undergraduate load reductions, we have a 6,000 increase next year, a 10,000 increase the year after and a 13,000 increase the year after that. I turn to the total load reductions. Senator Carr, you may not have been here this morning, but I indicated this morning that, on an EFTSU basis, with the variation between 1996 and 1997, there would be 2,675 more places. But when you move to 1998 and 1999, the variation between 1996 and 1998 is 4,245 down and the variation between 1996 and 1999 is 4,010 down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government made it unequivocally clear that we were not asking universities to teach the same number of students with fewer dollars, that they could drop student load and that their first port of call should be the postgraduate course workload, for which the previous government quite happily introduced access for fee paying places a number of years ago. We recognise the good sense in that and say that is an area that can continue. Universities should have undergraduate places as their last port of call. This government wanted to provide more undergraduate government funded places, more chances for students to get the foot in the door.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we are doing. Quite simply, we are providing more government funded undergraduate places. We have never made any bones about the fact that there would be reductions in government funded postgraduate course work places. We have never made any bones about that and I do not make any bones about it now. If you have to make a choice about where your money should go for higher education, it should go into giving young Australians their first chance&mdash;not giving a select few Australians a second and a third chance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is stated quite explicitly that you are seeking to remove $1.956 billion from the higher education system. You are calling upon this parliament to agree to measures to draw back, to scrape back, from the student body of this country a further $1.12 billion. You say that, therefore, on that basis, there are only minor changes to this budget. These are horrendous changes. Your own officials indicate that the effect of the cumulative reduction in places at higher education institutions under your measures is 17,055. It is quite explicit that these are the effects of these changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have any actual load figures for 1996. You cannot possibly claim that there will be 6,000 extra places. Your own officials do not acknowledge that. You are stating quite explicitly that the total load numbers for 1996 are not yet available. You claim that these measures are being undertaken as some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sort of giant equity measure. I find this an extraordinary proposition that George Orwell would have great pleasure in subscribing to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this proposal, we are seeing you suggest that less is more. That is what you are trying to suggest to us&mdash;that somehow or other we can take 17,000 places out of the system and we will end up with more. That is a ludicrous proposition that defies any logical assessment. But to say this on the basis that you are providing opportunities for working class children to go to university is absolutely beyond belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we get when we ask the department: how do you reach that conclusion? The department has said to me in answers time and time again&mdash;it has rote responses on this now&mdash;that it is not in a position to be able to predict the socioeconomic profile of fee paying domestic undergraduate students. It is quite clear. Your claims are not supported by your department, by the answers that are given. I cite the answer to question No. 10, asked by me on Monday, 28 October 1996, which I presume, Minister, you signed off on before it was sent to me. It says quite clearly, `The department is not in a position to be able to predict the socioeconomic profile of fee paying domestic undergraduate students.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For you to suggest that this is a measure of social justice is quite extraordinary. You are saying, `We will make it more difficult for working class students to actually go to university because we will make it more expensive.' No other conclusion can be drawn from these measures. You are saying that you will remove and undermine the student assistance programs, that you will increase their payments to the higher education contribution scheme and that you will increase the levels at which payments have to be made by lowering the threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are then going to say, `If you cannot get into one of the reduced places that we are going to make available&mdash;and we have cut 17,000 places out of the system&mdash;then you can pay fees to get a place. There will be an arrangement where your TER score will allow you to slip into one of these places.' That is all right if you have a few bob in your pocket, but that is not the way the world works. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6576"> Most working people do not have a few bob in their pockets. They do not have the extra money that it will cost to go to university. They require the government to provide assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all about providing equality of opportunity for all people and ensuring that there is a capacity for every citizen in this country to participate in higher education. That is what the government should be there for. What you are saying is, `If you have the money, you will get a fair go. If you have not got the money, you will not get a fair go. We will make sure you do not. We will increase the barriers for participation and equity.' The minister then comes in here and suggests that all this is about is providing opportunities for the sons and daughters of working people to go to university. That is an extraordinary proposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People understand that the government's savings measures are made up of two parts. Yes, it is correct that partly there will be direct cuts to universities against their growth forward estimates. It will still leave them next year with more&mdash;not with much more, but it is still more&mdash;in operating grants than they had this year, but one per cent less than they were planning on getting. Those cuts to operating grants are cuts against the forward estimates. That is, in a sense, what is coming out of universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good part of the savings measure, as you well recognise, relates to a higher contribution from students. That is not more money coming out of universities; it is more money coming from students. It is a shift in the public&hyphen;private balance which some senators have been sensible enough to recognise. I think Senator Stott Despoja has recognised that. There is no point in touting around the place that there is some pretence that $1.9 billion is coming out of universities. The amount coming out of universities is much less than that. It is in the vicinity of $680 million against $5 billion per annum in expenditure over the next three years.

I was not sure it was particularly gracious of you to assert that Senator Crowley would automatically remember what matriculation was. Sometimes she looks very young to me. Perhaps, Senator Crowley, today is not one of your better days. I do not know. That is a most unusual slip on your part, Senator Cooney, for which you are immediately forgiven&mdash;on my part at least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do understand the point that you are making, but a number of points need to be made in quite fair response to what you are saying. The proposition you put is that if one in four can go to university, should we not choose them on merit and merit alone? Before going into the question of whether we should choose them on merit and merit alone and what merit means, you do highlight that it is one person in four who gets this opportunity, one in four for whom taxpayers fork out about $20,000 as a minimum&mdash;up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for courses like medicine. Only one in four gets that. And we want that to happen; it is in the nation's interests that it happens and that it happens with more people. We do not give that to TAFE kids and kids who go and get a job, and apprentices are asked to pay for tools. There is already an equity question across school leavers, an equity question that a lot of higher education students do not want to address. But it is there and, intentionally or otherwise, you highlight it by pointing out that it is one in four who gets that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal with the question of getting in on merit. Senator, I am sure you understand that the TER scores, the tertiary entrance rankings or ratings, are a function not of the intellectual skill required to complete a particular course but of the spaces available and the number of people who want to do it. The spaces available are partly a function of the degree to which the Commonwealth is prepared to fund. That is the limitation that we have got here. The number of people wanting to do a particular course is, in large <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6578"> part, a function of how much they think they are going to earn for the rest of their lives. That is not the only reason people study&mdash;I certainly hope it is not&mdash;but it is what motivates many to make their choices. When the government cannot afford to fund as many places in the courses that people would choose to do, we design a cut&hyphen;off point, and that is the TER score. But it does not relate to the intellectual skill required to complete that course&mdash;certainly not at the high TER score levels; it may when you come to the lower ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I assume the proposition you must be putting is: that is the only way we should choose them. I see you nodding. But we have some medical schools and some faculties outside medical schools who already recognise that the TER is not the only mechanism, and may not be the appropriate mechanism, for deciding who should get in. The young female or male who can get 99 in five or six subjects and get into medicine may not be the sort of person you want to come and tell you that your number is up. Their bedside manner might be a bit cold. There are horses for courses within the medical profession. There are some who are going to need what is loosely referred to as a bedside manner. There are some who are going to practise in fields where skills way beyond intellectual skills will be required, skills that cannot be taught in university. Universities are recognising that. The first point I make is that the TER alone is not it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I would make relates to how merit is determined. The government could decide that TERs will do, combined with some other mechanism that universities devise. Some medical schools have interview arrangements now. Even if we could say that we could agree on what the appropriate merit mechanism was, what I would say to you is: you are right, that is the appropriate mechanism to decide those whom the government should fund. On that point we completely agree. I agree with you completely on that point; we are in 100 per cent agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I go on from that and say that if other people are prepared to invest in themselves and are lucky enough to have the money or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are prepared to borrow against a mortgage or whatever, then do not stop them doing so. Do not stop people getting an education just because this is the limit of the government funded places. If people are prepared to pay, let them. I believe because of the socioeconomic make-up of university students that&mdash;because there is such a propensity for the subsidy that is provided by the taxpayers to go to the children of middle and high income earners&mdash;many of those people who win government funded places, if you give them the choice to pay, will take that opportunity to pay to get the university or the course of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, just in case you mistakenly think I am now saying that the poor will pay, I am not. I have always identified that some of those people who have that capacity to pay in cash or that capacity to borrow will do so. I said when you were not here earlier today, Senator Cooney, that I often hear the chant `make the rich pay'. Now we want to let them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those people are going to move out of government funded places to get to the university of their choice or the course of their choice and if we stick to the requirement that we want to put in the legislation that universities cannot sell places until they have filled their government funded places and not sell more than 25 per cent, then that will leave the government funded places for students who would not otherwise have got in. What happens when a so-called rich and thick student accepts physiotherapy but wanted to do medicine&mdash;must be particularly thick, I suppose. That is a most unattractive proposition to be using.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note Senator Carr's interjection. I just cannot see why a kid that accepts physiotherapy at the moment but would like to get into law&mdash;law is probably a better example&mdash;should not be able to move out of a government funded place into a fully funded place and leave that government funded place for another student who otherwise would not have got in. I believe that is what is going to happen. A very substantial proportion of the places that universities sell <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6579"> will be to government funded students who move out of that place in order to get the university or the course of their choice. That will leave a government funded place for students who otherwise would not have got it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Be that as it may, even if that was not the case, even if I am wrong in that respect and universities are made up of students whose parents do not have that capacity&mdash;and the facts clearly show that is not the case&mdash;I would still say to Senator Cooney as a matter of principle: yes, use the measures that you rightly identify to choose how many and whom the government will fund. If there is government funding going, of course, it must go first to those on merit. But what I do not understand is why you then say that you will not allow people who are prepared to invest in themselves the chance to do that. You will not allow them to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It happens in secondary schooling where we have kids that go to private schools and we have kids that go to state schools. Incidentally, it also happened with postgraduate course work under your own government, Senator Cooney. Your own government recognised that it was appropriate to allow fee charging for postgraduate course work. There has been a boom in places since. Why is that? Because people are prepared to invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not everybody wants everything from the Commonwealth. Many people are prepared to say, `Look, if that is all the Commonwealth can afford and I didn't get in on merit, fair enough.' In a sense, it is similar to the way that the Commonwealth scholarship arrangements worked. If you did not get one, then it was up to you to decide whether you were prepared to invest in yourself. What your party is saying is that you will not allow that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja was having a go at me earlier today about recreational learning. I think she and I would agree that recreational learning&mdash;that is, what I describe as learning not engaged in for the purposes of earning an income but for the purposes of advancing one's mind&mdash;is a good thing and should be encouraged. There will be no recreational learning at universities. There will be no second and third degrees by people who want <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to do them for that reason, if you will not give them the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will give them the opportunity to do so if you allow universities to charge for those extra places. Senator Cooney, one of your colleagues in the other place brought to my attention the example of a surgeon who had earned so much money by the time he was 55 that he was able to retire&mdash;lucky fellow. He had decided at 55 that he would retire and that he would go off and do another degree. He actually became an archaeologist and he is now in Egypt working with former Democrat Senator Sowada on a very important archaeological dig, which I am pleased to say the previous government supported with ARC research funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is some complaint now that they would like more. That is a matter that has to be looked at. As Senator Stott Despoja knows, while the recommendations for research funding are signed off by ministers, they are&mdash;from my experience anyway&mdash;not interfered with by ministers. I would be interested to know if ministers have in the past interfered with ARC recommendations. This particular research project did not make the grade in the last round and wants to make the grade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making here is that, if someone like that can go and get a second degree to amuse themselves at government expense, then they are locking out someone who would otherwise be getting their first degree. I feel reasonably confident that, if this surgeon had sufficient money to retire at 55, he would be happy to pay for his place&mdash;I do not know this person&mdash;but you will not allow him to pay. The chant is to make the rich pay, and you will not let them. You will not let them move out of government funded places. You are absolutely committed to the idea that government funded undergraduate places are the only way you can get to university&mdash;that you cannot invest in yourself over and above what the government is prepared to invest in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will accept it for postgraduate course work&mdash;somehow that is different&mdash;but not for undergraduate students. No, if you have a bad year in year 12 and you do not make the grade, then that is bad luck, sister or brother, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6580"> you are out of the game for the rest of your life. You cannot come back and buy a place at any later time. We want to change that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney, the bottom line is that I agree with what you say for the purposes of deciding who gets government funded places. But that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about whether, over and above that, you should allow Australian citizens to take a chance of investing in themselves if they want to. This side of the chamber gives an unequivocal `yes' to that question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I  understand what you say, Minister. I also agree that the concept of merit varies from one person to another. But I think everybody would agree that no part of the concept of merit would include the concept of being able to pay for your course as a means of getting in. As you have said, you can justify it on other grounds, such as trying to raise money for the universities, and all those arguments that you used. My point was that that concept is not encompassed in the objects of the act as they now stand. The objects are set out in 2A. I am concerned that if you are going to introduce this concept&mdash;and, as you said, it was there before, with postgraduate studies&mdash;of people being able to pay to get into university and that that is a factor other than merit to allow them to get there, shouldn't you be amending 2A, the objects of the act?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you are, of course, right that when we move from considering how to allocate government funded places, we appear to agree that they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should be on merit. We appear to agree there will be different assessments of merit in different people's minds, but certainly for different faculties they will be different. That is a point on which we agree. Where we disagree is that we on this side of the chamber say, `If you want to invest in yourself after that, we will let you.' We have a genuine belief that some people will do that, will move out of government funded places and, therefore, create government funded places for people who otherwise would not have got in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the question of how those people who have that capacity get in, that is what you raise: what about merit? Is that the merit there? I say to you: no, it is not. Senator Cooney, please do not come into this chamber with such an apparent lack of faith in Australian universities. The whole redesign of the higher education system has been described by Senator Carr as involving the most radical changes. It is not for me to say whether he overstates the case, but they are very radical changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government simply wanted to save money, if it simply wanted to have a go at getting more money and higher education had to pay its contribution, like everyone else, there is a very easy route to do that. The government, as you know, does not need legislative approval to take money from universities, that is, to not provide them with more operating grant. Instead of that, Senator Cooney, I ask you to consider that this government has chosen the more difficult path of arguing the case that university students do have a very substantial private benefit and, because of that, should be asked to make a higher contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not an easy political message to sell. Students are no more selfish than anybody else. Nobody lines up to say, `Quick, get out of the way, I want to get to the bank and pay you more money more quickly.' Nobody I know does that. So it is a difficult policy package that we have tried to adopt, one where we ask students to pay more, as a greater recognition of their greater private benefit than is acknowledged through the existing HECS system, where less money <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6581"> would therefore be actually cut from universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done that because we think this is a better package. We have described it&mdash;and I think this is a fair description&mdash;as an architect's plan that does, nonetheless, have an accounting seal of approval. If we simply wanted the accounting seal of approval, Senator Cooney, we would have gone straight to operating grant. There would be no argument here, no argument out in the community that we need to take any notice of, because we could do it by executive fiat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of that, we have chosen to come here with a well&hyphen; considered plan that we believe is better for higher education, a plan that protects undergraduate places and in fact offers more undergraduate places for more young Australians to get their first chance in. We have openly said, up&hyphen;front, on the first day of the higher education budget, that, yes, there are cuts against forward estimates and, yes, we expect universities to take them out of postgraduate course workload. We say, `Don't take them from kids who are getting their first chance, take them from people getting their second, and possibly moving on to their third.' We have never made any secret of that. That is what these changes are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We further said that universities need more money. If people are prepared to pay, we should let them pay, and let the universities keep the money. They need more money. It is not just a function of Beazley's bankcard. The previous government was facing this problem and it would have been facing it even if it had been fiscally responsible. It would still have been facing the question of how much more it could put into higher education. Governments globally are stressed in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have decided that, for a number of policy reasons, including the opportunity for universities to have more money, we would allow them to sell some places to domestic students. Equally, to acknowledge their need for more cash, where they did over&hyphen;enrol, we would not, of course, fully fund them, but we would give them back the HECS money that your government was not prepared to give <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back. So we would give universities income earning capacity, give them very small cuts to the system in the sense of Commonwealth money going to universities&mdash;not much less at all, when you consider the total expenditure of it&mdash;and take on the difficult task of openly saying to new students next year, `Yes, we think you should pay more.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not an easy ride. This is no grab for money from the government. This is a well thought out plan. Your party may disagree with it, but it is a well thought out plan for higher education. You might disagree. You might have other views, but let us not pretend that it is nothing more than a grab for cash. If that were the case, we would not bother having the argument here, we would not bother trying to get support from the parliament for the plan, we would simply take it out of operating grant, and that is the alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that Senator Brown has come into the chamber. There are a couple of things he might be interested to know. I do not know if he has raised with my office the future of higher education in Tasmania. In the debate the other day he was making some slightly disparaging inferences vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis Senator Harradine, with whom I have had some discussions about the University of Tasmania and the needs of higher education in Tasmania. I am not aware that Senator Brown has sought to have such discussions with me, but I would be happy to have them with him should he choose to show an interest in higher education in his state to the extent of wanting to know what the future opportunities are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats the other day described Senator Brown as a camera chaser. When he was having a go at Senator Harradine I thought, `One Tasmanian against another, both Independents; what is going on here? Is there some camera chasing going on?' Then I thought `No', and put my mind back to the serious issues at hand. So I make Senator Brown the same offer: I am happy to discuss with him the needs of higher education in Tasmania&mdash;any time he shows such an interest. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6582">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown might be interested to know that the university reports that there have been increases in applications for some courses and decreases in applications for others. Senator Brown might be one of the senators who has raised the matter of engineering and science enrolments, a matter the government is determined to keep a close eye on. It has been raised by Senator Stott Despoja and others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that there has been an increase in applications for some courses. At the time this letter was written, 2 December, applications for education courses were increasing, with most of that increase being applications for a new Bachelor of Adult and Vocational Education course. Applications for engineering surveying have increased, and there has been over a 30 per cent increase in pharmacy applications in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not asserting that, as a consequence, every regional university would be experiencing the same trend but I am saying that the blanket assumption that regional universities will not be able to cope is somewhat unfortunate. A 33 per cent increase in pharmacy is a strong increase. If you had asked me to bet on it, I would not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are drop&hyphen;offs in other areas. In particular, Tasmania has suffered a drop&hyphen;off in applications from interstate Year 12 students. Why that is, I do not know. But, because Senator Brown came in, I thought I would provide that information for him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of questions for the minister arising from her comments and answers to previous questions. I am glad that the minister noted that there might be courses which have experienced a decline in applications. In question time, I put to the minister that there had been an overall reduction in enrolments in science courses in this nation. Yes, along with the Council of Deans, I am one of those persons who would attribute that decrease to the proposed changes to HECS arrangements for science students. That is something that the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr McGauran, would acknowledge. He certainly conceded that the new HECS bands might act as a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `discouragement' to young people wanting to enrol in science and engineering courses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I put to the minister that there might be a reduction in enrolments to that degree, I thought it was very sneaky of the minister to point to the example of the University of Sydney, where there was a five per cent increase, because the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> from which she was quoting was titled `Sydney University bucks the trend'. That article also reported that there was a reduction across the board of 20 per cent in enrolment in science courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of other things have arisen in this debate. Halfway through the minister's response to Senator Cooney's first question, she referred to medical students and the idea of wealthier students being able to pay. I assume that the minister acknowledged that she has exempted medicine from up&hyphen;front fee courses?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also found interesting the minister's comments about the physician who had done a second degree. I wonder why, back in 1993, the coalition joined with the Australian Democrats to propose a double HECS for second degrees. Perhaps the rationale has changed.

I put to the minister that they also have difficulty in attracting fee paying students. Certainly, the evidence in regard to postgraduate fee paying courses is quite alarming in that regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Not so much as an aside from the debate but by way of comment on the general politi cal process, Senator, your party has not changed its view. I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) giving your party at least some credit the other day for not having changed their view vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis privatisation, but pointing out to the great amazement of a large portion of the electorate that members sitting opposite in this chamber&mdash;before you came here, Senator&mdash;said in a number of elections, `We wouldn't privatise the Commonwealth Bank. Heavens, no, we wouldn't do that.' And they then went and privatised half of it, and in privatising half of it, said, `Cross my heart and hope to die. We would never ever consider selling the rest.' They won the next election and proceeded to sell the whole lot. It was similar with Qantas and the Australian National Line&mdash;and there is a very long list of things that when we were previously in government we may have considered privatising, and certainly, from opposition, in policy would have said we should do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, from opposition, taken what you can only describe as a political bagging from the Labor government of the day saying how shocking it was to privatise things, only to find that that government that had made political capital out of saying what a bad thing it was would turn around and do it in any event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now what do we find? That government, having been dispossessed of office and put into opposition, says, `Privatisation of one&hyphen;third of Telstra! What a shocking thing!' There is a very clear view on this side that the now Leader of the Opposition&mdash;then Deputy Prime Minister or perhaps a mere minister at the time&mdash;Mr Beazley, made it abundantly clear to Telstra that, had they won the previous election, all of Telstra would have been up for grabs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not like to think that my party has displayed in any matter the same degree of fickleness and political opportunism that Labor displays vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis the privatisation question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for that answer. I appreciate the clarification. I suspect that Senator O'Chee is interested in James Cook University, being Townsville and Cairns based, and I look forward to a response on that matter also. Minister, I am glad you are concerned about inconsistencies in policies. I did not raise the double HECS for second degrees for that purpose&mdash;I was just curious about your government's policy on that issue&mdash;but you have raised the matter of policy and consistency and, given your concern about that matter, I suggest that perhaps going to an election and promising, first, to maintain operating grants, second, to maintain Austudy at real levels, third, to maintain the threshold, fourth, to strengthen regional and remote campuses and, fifth, then coming in here and doing all this might seem a touch inconsistent. I am glad that you are concerned about opportunism in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take on board, as all my Democrat colleagues do, the fact that many of these changes were set in place by the former ALP government, such as the move to charge full fees for postgraduate fee paying places. I have yet to understand&mdash;and maybe this will be fleshed out during the debate&mdash;the rationale behind the former government's change in regard to ministerial guidelines. Perhaps this is an opportunity for us to change the guidelines regarding fee paying students, whether <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6585"> postgraduate or&mdash;hopefully not&mdash;undergraduate. Perhaps opposition senators might be keen to rethink their former policies. Minister, I am more than happy to acknowledge that. They started a process of user&hyphen;pays education. They entrenched it; and we are just moving on from that point. I think it is sad on both counts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, you have talked about those students who can afford to pay taking advantage of the opportunity to purchase a place and thus `freeing up'&mdash;your terminology&mdash;a government funded place in an institution. Do you honestly believe that wealthier students who are awarded a place in a higher education institution&mdash;a fully funded government place&mdash;will move aside for students from less wealthy backgrounds? I do not necessarily see that freeing up taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that is important to remember in this debate is that although we are talking about government funded places, even that rhetoric is incorrect these days because we have seen increasingly this government and the former government abrogate responsibility&mdash;a responsibility I feel you have&mdash;to supply and provide a publicly funded and accessible higher education system. There are other factors that determine participation of those traditionally disadvantaged groups and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds&mdash;and you talked about me referring to the poor. According to most research and surveys, 25 per cent of Australians would qualify as coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and yet 6.59 per cent, when it comes to fee paying courses, of lower socioeconomic groups are represented in fee paying courses. So I am glad you at least acknowledge that the option of full and up&hyphen;front fees is not necessarily available to people who do not have the ability to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dispute the notion that richer people will buy these places, thus freeing up Commonwealth funded places for people who are less wealthy. I ask you to bear in mind the fact that there are still other barriers to entry to universities&mdash;in fact, barriers that this bill seeks to increase in the form of the higher education contribution scheme, in the form of a changed HECS. It is a differential HECS <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system, an increase overall. You have to remember that the other key to ensuring that people from lower socioeconomic groups can access higher education is the level of financial assistance available. Financial assistance to students has decreased markedly over the years. Again, proposals in your budget seek to further decrease the eligibility of students and the availability of Austudy for Australian students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do you really believe that those places are going to be freed up in that way and that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are given incentives or options for participating in higher education? I am finding it very difficult to believe that there are anything but barriers facing these people when it comes to accessing higher education.</PARA></SPEECH>

In response to the chant `make the rich pay', I say let them. Let those kids move out of government funded places and let another kid who otherwise would not have had the chance move in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to briefly remake is a point I made to Senator Cooney. Do not underestimate Australian universities. Do not assume that they are going to let any Tom, Dick or Harry with a few bucks in their hand have a place at their university. You do understand, Senator, with your longstanding interest in education matters, that the reputation of a university is very largely affected by the quality of graduates it turns out, the jobs that those students get and the influence that they later have in the community. Alumni activity is very much regarded as an indication of the quality of that university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply not in a university's interest to let students undertake courses that they cannot complete.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You indicate that this measure does not give aid and comfort to those who do not have the necessary ability to secure university places, but that it will protect merit as the method for selection of university students. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6587"> Yet everything you have said this afternoon highlights the point that, if you have money and you cannot secure a government funded place, you are able to purchase a place, the presumption being of course that you have money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, what is the government's responsibility&mdash;because no doubt you will say that the method of selection ultimately is the responsibility of each individual university; no doubt you will make that claim at some point or another&mdash;to protect the integrity of our university systems, given that everything you are doing here today would reinforce the incentive to the cream of our society, the rich and the thick, and to suggest to them that, if you cannot get in on ability, you can get in on the basis of wealth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the responsibilities of government on the basis that we assume that a cohort of students in a course is made up of 75 per cent HECS liable students and 25 per cent fee paying students? In terms of this example, I would presume that 25 per cent of these students would be admitted in descending order of their TE score, that therefore a number of potential students in a TE group could not afford fees, and that therefore a university might have to select a lower number on the TE score scale.

I am trying to disabuse you, Senator Carr, of your ignorance. You claimed that the only people who could afford to pay to go to university were the rich.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what I did to go to a full fee paying university overseas, where I paid in the vicinity of $12,000 a year. I came back to Australia and the day I got off the plane I started work. I worked at an office for three or four months straight. I would get back on the plane the day after my last day at work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I got over to the United Kingdom, I would work on the weekends taking tourists around the town to earn the money to pay for my rent. I do not consider myself rich; I consider myself motivated. We are saying this is a system that will allow the people who really have the motivation the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of people, as Senator Woods would know, who would be damn good doctors who might be a point or two off the entrance score but, at the end of the day, will do better in their university studies than the people who ended up in the highest one per cent of the school leaver population. It is a fact that the drop&hyphen;out rate amongst people who are in the top one per cent or two per cent in Queensland is exceedingly high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of those people who may not be in the top one per cent may well turn out to be very good doctors. The fact that they are motivated, the fact that they are willing to work hard to ensure that they get that place, means that they are probably more likely to succeed. They are less likely to drop out because they value what they are getting, because they have set their heart and soul on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr, it is foolish to say that just because somebody chooses to pay means they are rich. Maybe they just happen to be working class people or middle class people who are not rich but who are incredibly motivated, who know what they want to do. I think you do a grave disservice to many of the real battlers in this community by making such foolish remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to delay the Senate too long, so I close by addressing a comment made by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6588"> my friend Senator Stott Despoja, who claimed that James Cook University was incapable of attracting any fee paying postgraduate students because it was a regional university and, therefore, would be incapable of attracting fee paying undergraduates. That analysis is rather superficial. The reason why that analysis is superficial is that James Cook University should be contrasted with the North Queensland Institute of TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The North Queensland Institute of TAFE attracts a lot of overseas students who pay fees or whose employers pay fees. In the last two years, the North Queensland Institute of TAFE, which has campuses in Cairns, Townsville, Innisfail and Mount Isa, has marketed itself in the region. Its region is not just North Queensland but eastern Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific. It has been exceedingly successful. It now has contracts to provide vocational education to mines in Papua New Guinea and areas that it had not considered before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not correct to say that a regional university is disadvantaged. The truth is that James Cook University, should it choose to take the right marketing approach and should it choose to push its areas of strength, could be an important exporter of tertiary education because of its geography, not in spite of it.</PARA></SPEECH>

So the concept of an over&hyphen;enrolment does not apply in particular courses. But the 25 per cent limit will mean that once that limit is reached&mdash;the agreed profile limit&mdash;if the university wants to take more fee paying students, it will have to have more HECS students in that place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do have some further information for Senator Stott Despoja. She is right in asserting that James Cook does not have fee paying postgraduate students. But it does have&mdash;I do not think you would deny this&mdash;international excellence in marine biology and a potential to attract students at the undergraduate level. You may disagree with that. But for information&mdash;since they were going back to the department and getting some answers anyway&mdash;Southern Cross attracted more than 500 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fee&hyphen;paying postgraduate students in 1995, which was about twice the number of HECS funded postgraduate students. In 1995 Charles Sturt had almost 500 full fee&hyphen;paying students&mdash;more than twice than the year before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">James Cook might have a problem with postgraduate course work places. I would expect, and/or hope, that their excellence in marine biology would allow them to attract the undergraduate places that we want them to be able to sell. Senator Stott Despoja, I just give you that information about Southern Cross and Charles Sturt as a way of boosting any lagging confidence you might have in the capacity of regional universities to address niche markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is part of what we expect will come from this. This is not just letting the rich pay. I think that is important&mdash;let them pay. If we can get them out of government funded places, well and good. But because money is an attraction to most people and certainly to universities, it will mean that the universities will focus on further improving their areas of excellence&mdash;their niche markets&mdash;and want to attract students to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For example, you will not see&mdash;and I hope we do not see it&mdash;all the universities in one state offering a graduate management course. For example, if Western Australian universities all offered management courses&mdash;or a large number of them&mdash;and there was not a centre of excellence in mining and exploration, how silly would that be for Western Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the capacity to earn extra income for the university&mdash;not for the government&mdash;encourages them to rationalise and realise that, when they are all offering the same, there is not much in it, and if it encourages them to get together and share aspects of the management courses and, equally, specialise in areas where they will have niche markets, that is not only in the interests of the universities. Whose interest is it in if the universities prosper? It is in the students' interest. They will have a better choice in fields where the universities can excel, rather than having them all offering the same, which there is an enormous temptation for them to do now.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6591">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that the experience of the previous government in allowing the sale of postgraduate places highlights that. What has happened in Southern Cross and Charles Sturt highlights that. The universities have chosen areas to specialise in&mdash;areas which, if they specialise and do well in, they can attract fee paying students to and get more money for themselves. That is what has motivated this push for excellence in niche areas. It was the previous government's decision to allow the sale of postgraduate course work places. We think there will be a similar effect from allowing the sale of undergraduate places.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am happy to sit down and let senators have further second reading speeches but, if you ask questions, then you expect answers. It is entirely in the chamber's hands how this debate continues. I simply put the point that we have moved past the second reading stage, and we have not progressed on this. You have had the opportunity to put your views. You are all, relatively speaking, very articulate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people and are capable of getting your message across in the second reading debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now is the time to go to the detail of the bill, and I think the government has been very patient in answering questions in general. If you continue to ask questions and ask them to make political points, you must expect that sort of response.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to take a few minutes to comment on the double standards adopted by this government, particularly with respect to wage increases for building workers. Yesterday in question time, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Alston, whether he was aware of recent increases negotiated&mdash;I stress the word `negotiated'&mdash;in the industry by the employees, employers and their representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also asked the minister why it was that his government, particularly the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Moore), was interfering in the processes of negotiation in that industry in order to try to prevent those increases from being granted. What response did we get from Senator Alston? We got an acknowledgment that he was aware of it. But, beyond that, he clearly did not have any brief because he floundered around for some time trying to address the important issues raised in the question.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important issue is: why is it that this government is so quick to jump in and try to kick the unions, particularly the building industry unions, but is so slack when it comes to addressing, for instance, the massive salary increases granted to executives? As Senator Alston went on in his rambling answer it became clear that his response was ideologically driven. Notwithstanding this government's protestations about a new era of industrial relations&mdash;a supposed new era where the government would not interfere, the market would be allowed to operate and employees and employers could get out there and freely negotiate&mdash;what we actually have on the first occasion an agreement is negotiated is the government getting stuck into the union and the workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what has been said in this regard. On Wednesday, 27 November, it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the federal Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Peter Reith, indicated that he would hold talks with employer groups and state and territory governments to forge a fresh approach to this issue. That is nothing more than rhetoric for calling in employers and the state and territory governments to put pressure on them not to agree to wage increases for building workers, and presumably any other workers, beyond the level that this government believes is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated that it believes that the only increase that is appropriate is a lousy increase of $8 per week for battlers. Yet the same government and the same minister have been waxing lyrical for a number of weeks about how their legislation is going to usher in a new era whereby employees can go out and negotiate more. This is the minister who tried to attack the previous government by alleging, quite wrongly, that workers had not seen real wage increases during the period of the Labor government. That is a quite fallacious claim which needs further discussion at another time. That claim is incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it suits this government they want to talk about the rights of employees and employers to negotiate large increases and real increases. When you have a situation on a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6593"> major construction project, such as that on the Sydney Olympics site, where the workers, their representatives and the company representatives negotiate increases, the government steps in and says, `It is too much. You should not get them.' They then get out the big stick and start beating the unions. They do that because there is a union involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston said&mdash;and this is really what pins this government down to being motivated by an ideological hatred of trade unions members, particularly those members of the construction and building industry unions&mdash;yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, at the end of the day you either have to take a position on this or not. If your position is `Whatever the unions can screw out of management is fine by us', then we understand where you are coming from.</PARA>
<PARA>This minister does not actually know what is happening in the industry. Maybe he has an excuse because he is only the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. However, he really should know. This minister's whole attitude to a negotiated enterprise agreement is `the union screwed the employers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought this government actually wanted to encourage employees and employers to negotiate enterprise agreements. This is a government that said that employees have a right to be represented by trade unions and yet this is a government that, on the first occasion after its legislation has been passed&mdash;albeit it is not operative yet&mdash;and a group has negotiated an increase which the government does not like has hopped in and abused them and lampooned them by suggesting that it is nothing more than union power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that, firstly, these increases have been negotiated because that is what the market can sustain. That has been acknowledged by the heads of the companies involved. I understood that this government claims that the market should prevail. They should not have any objection about the level of increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this is an industry where the employees are involved in a dangerous occupation, particularly when it comes to high&hyphen;rise buildings. Thirdly, this is an industry where <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employees could be considered, in many cases, to fall into the category of battlers. Whilst they might have high earnings from time to time, it is an intermittent industry. Security of employment in this industry is not guaranteed. Therefore, I believe that increases of this order, which will be phased in over three years and which involve significant productivity offsets as has been acknowledged if people take the time to look at the agreements, are warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that the double standards of this government have been exposed. They want to attack building workers. Yet last Friday, I attended the opening of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade building here in Canberra where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) paid tribute&mdash;although I think begrudgingly&mdash;to the building workers who brought that building in on time and under budget. That has happened on construction project after construction project around Australia. I have great confidence that it will happen again on the Sydney Olympics site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time that the minister and this government stopped hopping into the workers, stopped hopping into the unions, and recognised the quality and the productivity of their work and of the entitlements to the wage increases that they have managed to negotiate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L6">Senator EGGLESTON</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.09 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate tonight I want to correct some misconceptions the ALP is spreading in Western Australia in the state election campaign to do with child care, the cost to aged people of obtaining access to nursing homes, and pensions for British migrants in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I would like to deal with child care, which is a matter of great importance to working mothers. The first point I want to make crystal clear is that the government is not reducing expenditure on child care. In fact, the Commonwealth outlays on child care <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6594"> will increase in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget by some $150 million. The Commonwealth will spend over $5 billion on child care in the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be clearly understood that the ALP's and the Democrats' claims regarding the impact of the government's child-care policies on families are causing unnecessary alarm, as their costing assumes families all use full&hyphen;time child care when in fact 80 per cent do not use full&hyphen;time child care. The government has retained its commitment to choice for families, with over 150,000 new child-care places to be established by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Private child-care centres provide 70 per cent of centre based care, catering for more than 220,000 families nationwide. It is important for it to be understood that an operational subsidy has never been paid to these centres. There are 2,748 such private child-care centres around Australia with 122,500 places, servicing some quarter of a million families, of which 96,000 are low income families. It should be noted that these private centres offer over 20,000 places in remote and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast there are 1,112 community based centres, all of which have been receiving operational subsidies. It is these subsidies to these centres which will be discontinued. These community centres will be assisted, however, to restructure their businesses to operate without an operational subsidy, and $8.3 million will be provided to assist long day care centres to restructure their businesses and overcome the loss of untargeted operational subsidies. Removal of the operational subsidy for community child-care centres is all about equity&mdash;equity for the 70 per cent of families who are currently using private sector, employer sponsored or non-profit child-care services which do not receive an operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be asked: how many families using community child&hyphen;care facilities will be affected by these measures? Speaking at the Department of Social Security Senate estimates hearing on 24 September this year, a senior official of the Department of Social Security, in response to a question about the number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> children no longer eligible for child-care assistance, said that only about 500 families receiving a small level of child-care assistance, amounting to a few dollars a week, would lose that assistance. The official added that these people would be middle to high income families, certainly not low income families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is making special arrangements for child care in rural and remote areas of Australia, such as the north-west, where there are no private services and where a community based service is the only available one in the area. If it can be demonstrated that, as a result of a restructuring exercise, the continuance of a child-care service may be compromised, the government will arrange for a disadvantaged area subsidy to be paid to such centres. This means that in country areas where there is only a single service in the area and it is a community based service, if the operational subsidy is critical to the ongoing operation, they will be eligible for a disadvantaged area subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the real situation with respect to child-care arrangements in Australia is very different to the scaremongering story that the ALP is peddling in the WA state elections. I repeat that Commonwealth outlays on child care will increase by $150 million in the 1996-97 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter I would like to speak about is aged care. The ALP in WA has again been peddling all sorts of fearful stories about what the Liberal Party plans to do with residential care for the aged. I would like to repeat that the government's vision for residential care for the aged, as outlined by the Minister for Family Services, Judi Moylan, to the conference of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals in September this year was based on three key elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the government wants to provide more choice and flexibility for older people. People should not have to face the upheaval that goes with being forced to move from one type of facility to another as their care needs change. In the government's view, they should be able to access care as close as possible to where they have lived.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6595">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, providers need incentives to respond to consumer aspirations and to deliver excellent quality services. The government wants to see providers who have time to care instead of being burdened down with red tape and paperwork. Thirdly, the government wants to ensure high quality care for everyone, regardless of income. This means that care remains affordable and accessible. Access to care should be based on need, not on ability to pay, with strong safeguards for financially disadvantaged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> These principles are underpinned by the government's policy of focusing on people, not on processes. It means asking for a fair and reasonable contribution from residents who can afford to pay more. The role of government is to use the taxpayers' money to fund people's care needs, not their lifestyle choices or those of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will not be allowing a two&hyphen;tiered system to develop&mdash;one standard for the poor and another for the wealthy. While people should be allowed to exercise some choice over their accommodation and services, as they do in every other facet of their life, the government will ensure consistent access and quality of care for all. So the scaremongering of the ALP about entry to aged care facilities is without foundation, and elderly people in WA can rest assured that the coalition government is not going to put them at risk of not being able to have access to aged care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> With respect to pensions paid to British citizens in Australia, I wish to repeat the information given by Senator Newman in the Senate today that the story being put about by the ALP in WA that the Australian government may not continue to top up British pensions is simply not true. British pensioners in Australia have their pensions topped up by the Australian government to the tune of some $80 million per year. There is no question that this subsidy will not be continued. The fear which the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has been spreading in his newsletter among British pensioners living in his electorate, in towns such as Rockingham and Safety Bay, is absolutely unjustified.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, I hope that what I have said tonight will help to allay the anxieties of those elderly people in Western Australia who have been deliberately targeted by the ALP campaign machine in a most unprincipled manner, calculated to play upon their fears in the hope that they will vote for the ALP in the state election.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="6595" TIME="7.18 p.m." SPEAKER="Murray, Sen Andrew" NAMEID="3M6" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.18 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management and on the issues of land management, biodiversity protection and ecologically sustainable development in WA. The creation and ongoing operation of the Department of Conservation and Land Management, known by its Orwellian acronym of CALM, is a matter of long&hyphen;running conflict in WA. CALM was created by the Burke Labor government in 1985 through an amalgamation of the forests department, the National Parks Authority and the wildlife section of the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife. For many years, it has been run by our own version of J. Edgar Hoover, director Sid Shea. I must stress that I compare the two in terms of longevity and the ability to survive successive administrations&mdash;and not for any other reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Under the CALM act, CALM has paramount responsibility for the ecologically sustainable management of a large portion of WA, including national parks, nature reserves, conservation parks, certain pastoral leases and state forests. It has responsibility also for administering the state's Wildlife  Conservation Act. CALM therefore has a critical role in the conservation of WA's unique and now threatened biodiversity and in the management of many of our most outstanding natural environments and landscapes. It also has a major responsibility in terms of the protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me say at this point that most people within CALM&mdash;and many people who have been with CALM but have since left&mdash;are people of the highest integrity and professionalism. They are trying, or have tried, in difficult circumstances to hold CALM to its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6596"> fundamental legal and ethical responsibilities. It is most unfortunate that, since its inception, CALM has been dominated by an industrial forestry ethic; an ethic which promotes heavy-handed intervention in, and manipulation and exploitation of, natural systems and resources. This internal industrial forestry ethic, when combined with the economic rationalist mind-set of successive governments, has created a department with an aggressively entrepreneurial approach; an approach which sees the public lands, public resources and natural systems it manages primarily as assets for sale or commercial exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> CALM, this government agency, is centrally involved in a range of commercial and entrepreneurial activities including: the logging, via contractors, of native forests and the sale to industry at ridiculously subsidised prices of native forest logs for woodchipping, saw timber and industrial charcoal; the promotion of sales of WA native forest timber overseas, again at ridiculously subsidised prices; commercial ventures with overseas pulp and paper corporations for the establishment and management of blue gum plantations; the capture and sale of endangered species such as blue bonnet parrots and numbats; the sale of rights to the genetic resources of WA's unique native flora species such as smokebush; and the opening up of national parks to increased tourism, and the conversion of nature reserves to national parks to facilitate increased tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Because of this large and growing portfolio of commercial ventures, there is a fundamental and schizophrenic conflict of interest within the department. It is both manager and exploiter, regulator and operator, custodian and developer, and is often solely or largely responsible for monitoring its own exploitative activities. This is why CALM can also be called `Genghis CALM'&mdash;a pillager or a conservationist, depending on the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> How does this conflict of interest play itself out? Let me give you an example. In February 1992, CALM released two documents for public comment: a draft nature conservation strategy for WA and a draft 10-year native forest management plan. The draft nature conservation strategy was intended to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide a comprehensive and soundly based strategy for protecting WA's immensely valuable and threatened biodiversity. It had an environmental motivation. The draft forest management plan proposed a further 10 years of massive logging operations in WA's native forests. It had an exploitative motivation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forest management plan&mdash;the exploitative one&mdash;was reviewed, finalised and under implementation within less than two years. The nature conservation strategy, on the other hand, still has not been finalised almost five years later. As well as this inherent conflict of interest, the aggressive, domineering, `we know best' approach of CALM gives rise to ongoing concerns over lack of accountability, internal censorship and suppression, and intimidation of critics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some examples of the internal censorship and suppression of CALM's scientific research have been published in national and international journals. I fear that this pressure upon scientists within CALM not to produce or publish information which contradicts CALM's reassurances about the sustainability of, for example, logging and prescribed burning, is a particularly insidious and demoralising aspect of CALM's modus operandi.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an example of this process of censorship and suppression at work. In 1995, scientists at CALM's Science and Information Division wrote a research proposal that identified the need to study fox control in the northern jarrah forest because of concerns over declining numbers of the endemic mammal species known as the quokka. The research proposal stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CALM currently prescribe burns much of the jarrah forest for fuel reduction. In some areas creek lines are totally burnt. Quokkas now appear to be restricted to these areas and it is possible that this fire regime has contributed to the observed decline in quokka populations.</PARA>
<PARA>The clear implication in the research outline was that CALM's deliberately applied prescribed burning could be removing the thick creek line vegetation that was now the quokka's only protection against fox predation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of months later, one of CALM's publications, `CALM News', ran a story on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6597"> the quokka titled `Quokkas alive and flourishing at Jarrahdale'. In this article, it is said that quokkas survive in the area because `densely grassed swamp areas would be difficult for foxes to penetrate'. Crucially, the article then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wildfires however, do pose a serious threat to quokkas, as they destroy the protective vegetation and render them more susceptible to fox predation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the very activity that CALM is undertaking. Not only has the CALM PR machine perverted the real concerns of the scientists by substituting `wildfires' for CALM's deliberate prescribed burning, although that is serious enough; what we also have as a result of this change in terms is a further implicit justification for a continuation of CALM's destructive prescribed burning activities, because CALM often defends its prescribed burning activities by claiming they prevent or lessen the impacts of wildfires. Very schizophrenic!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does CALM get away with all this? Let us look at the recent example of the Court government's new salinity strategy. Here is a long&hyphen;awaited strategy aimed at reversing serious land degradation problems in the agricultural region of WA. Although CALM has an important role in this region because of the small but very important areas of remnant bush and habitat it manages, it is not usually seen as the lead agency for rural land management. But surprise, surprise! CALM, under this new strategy, has effectively become the lead agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The CALM corporate PR machine has an ability to frighten and impress. Ministers and governments are supplied with endless, carefully stage managed public relations events organised for them by CALM&mdash;here a launch, there an award, everywhere a photo opportunity. Nowhere has this machine been used more than in the current state election, where CALM is well supporting the Liberal government's re&hyphen;election campaign. The end result is that governments and ministers come and go, but CALM and its director get more power and more scope for ill&hyphen;considered entrepreneurial activities, and continue to escape any real government or public scrutiny or accountability.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern, and that of the Australian Democrats, is to reform, as quickly as possible, this monster of strange origins and even stranger behaviour. The wonderful natural environment and biodiversity of the state of WA must not continue to be compromised and sold off for the sake of bureaucratic empire building, political convenience, political relations or political obligations. WA's natural environment, as the community and the tourism industry well understand, is the source of our greatest wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If elected to the upper house at the forthcoming state election, the Australian Democrats will initiate a wide ranging Legislative Council inquiry into CALM. The Democrats will push for the creation of a genuine conservation department, truly dedicated to the ecologically sustainable management of our lands and wildlife. We will push for improved legislation to ensure that everyone knows what needs to be done and who must do it; and we will ensure that governments make decisions based on considerations other than their own short&hyphen;term expediency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also give close scrutiny to the relationship between successive state governments and WA's largest corporate entity, Wesfarmers&hyphen;Bunnings. It is now a matter of record that Wesfarmers&hyphen;Bunnings, which is WA's largest native forest woodchip company, is also an exceedingly large donor to the major political parties, especially the Liberal Party.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pay tribute in this adjournment debate to a person who has given wide community service and service to the young in my state. Last Friday, after having survived the rigours of another week in the Senate, I went home to attend the opening night of a production <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Moment in Time</EMPHASIS> . This production coincided with the 40th anniversary in dance of a person in my state by the name of Doreen Thomas, who has long held an interest in dance and theatre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that in those 40 years Doreen Thomas has not missed one production. While Doreen operates a dance school <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6598"> that caters for all ages&mdash;there is a mixture of both young and old in the school&mdash;she does have a particular mix of young people. The dedication that she shows to these young people is commendable indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doreen, from what I have seen&mdash;and my young daughter is involved in the dance school&mdash;gives to the young people a sense of discipline and a sense of skill, with a real sense of maturity, that is sometimes not recognised in our community, and I believe deserves to be recognised here this evening. The countless number of hours that she has given to the young and to the community over a long period deserve the highest commendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rewards for Doreen, undoubtedly, are the exam results that the students in her dance school are able to achieve, as well as the confidence and the air of grace that these young people acquire. Hers is not simply a dance school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated, I attended the opening night, last Friday night, of a production of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Moment in Time</EMPHASIS>. Doreen has the ability to bring together the various skills of the young children in the dance school, as well as those of some of the more senior professionals she associates with, in putting on this full production. It is highly original, written by herself or in conjunction with her son.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also very professional. The mark of professionalism would stand up against any other theatre or dance group around. And she incorporates the skills that she has taught to the people at her school. The young people are an integral part of the production and the performance. It enhances their role in the school and they can see just where the skills that they have been taught and have had developed actually fit into the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were three performances at the Cremorne Theatre, which is part of the Queensland Performing Arts Complex. It was interesting that there were children as young as three and four, who I might say stole the limelight when they came on stage. They complemented the more senior people in the performance, and they stood up like real <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> troupers from what I saw and from what I believe happened in subsequent performances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doreen is and has been supported in all her endeavours by her mother Nan&mdash;alias Kathy&mdash;and her son Damien, who has acted as her executive producer and who has appeared now in some 27 productions. There is a real family flavour to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does not stop there, and this is the important thing. Doreen Thomas takes her skills, her talents and her interest in the community beyond her dance school, doing charitable work, often in nursing homes or aged persons homes. On those occasions, she brings the young dancers with her so that they get a different view of the world and see that they have a role to play in giving their talents to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note from an article that Doreen does in excess of 100 charity shows each year, and that is over and above whatever her dance commitments might be. I think that places her in an elite category of people in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Her dancers over the years have appeared at the opening of the Commonwealth Games, World Expo `88, the Sydney Opera House and the Lord Mayor's gala performance. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Jim Soorley, wrote to Doreen Thomas earlier this year on the occasion of her 40th year in dance, pointing out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your involvement at some of the key points in our city's maturation, such as the Commonwealth Games and World Expo, is of particular note and ensures your contribution to dance in this city will not easily be forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commitment to charity you have shown is also to be commended and, indeed, the list of things you have been involved in is too long to mention in this short letter.</PARA>
<PARA>That stands as real testimony to the work that Doreen Thomas has done as a performer, as a mentor to the young in the dance field, and in the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doreen is a director of the Education in Dance Theatre Arts. She is also a life member of the Royal Academy of Dance in London. Her enthusiasm and energy for her work is second to none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The professionalism of the production which I saw last week&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Moment in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6599"> Time</EMPHASIS>&mdash;was a fitting culmination of Doreen's 40th year in the dance arena. It showed her commitment to both dance and the community and is a fitting testament to the work she has done with young and old alike in our society in Brisbane. I commend the work of Doreen Thomas to this Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware of concerns raised by the honourable senator on behalf of a resident of the locality in relation to damage to the Pine Brush Nature Reserve, which is listed in the Register of the National Estate. The honourable senator has previously brought this matter to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) As I advised the honourable senator in correspondence dated 22nd October, 1996, the Australian Heritage Commission raised his concerns with the Grafton office of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service which confirmed that the land, once State Crown land, has been converted to freehold. The NSW government was not required to consult the Australian Heritage Commission before changing the status of the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Commonwealth's ability to act in cases such as these is limited. The Register of the National Estate is a national inventory of heritage places which alerts governments, planners and the community to the heritage values of places, so they can avoid damaging them. Listing of a place in the Register of the National Estate does not preclude activities of landowners ordinarily consistent with relevant State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major consequence of listing is that the Commonwealth government and its agents are required to refrain from taking actions which would adversely affect the listed place unless there are prudent and feasible alternatives to those actions. In the case of Pine Brush it is difficult to identify a Commonwealth action or decision which would trigger the application of the Australian Heritage Commission Act in such a way as to allow me to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would, however, point out that the current owner of the area in question is subject to any relevant New South Wales controls on land use, including controls on stocking rates; and to any relevant state and local government restrictions on use of fires or requirements for land-owners to take fire protection measures. If the honourable senator has evidence that the current owner is not complying with any of these controls, I would suggest that he contact the relevant New South Wales authorities. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON>
