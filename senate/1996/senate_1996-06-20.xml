<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, view with alarm the high incidence of violence in our community. Of particular concern is the number of random crimes, some extraordinarily brutal, which are eroding public peace of mind and leaving many people feeling personally threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the violence saturating our visual media&mdash;television, videos, newspapers/magazines, films and advertisements&mdash;both encourages and legitimises violent behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The portrayal of violence, in context, which carries a rational message, can be acceptable, however its use as a marketing ploy simply to catch consumer attention and boost ratings or sell products is totally irresponsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We acknowledge social and economic factors play a significant part in motivating violence, nevertheless the sensational portrayal of violence in the media is one important factor that we, as a community, have the power to change, and we therefore call upon the Parliament to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Take Legislative action to prevent gratuitous brutality and suffering being promoted as `entertainment' and/or used as a marketing ploy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the undersigned, being citizens of Australia, make urgent request to the Senate to recognise the rights and freedom of all law abiding citizens and reject the moves by the Prime Minister to tighten gun laws across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask that the Senate recognise both the wisdom of our Founding Fathers in granting certain rights to the states, and to recognise the rights and responsibility of the States to regulate firearm laws according to the wishes of their citizens.</PARA>

This is reflected in the different laws in each State and any change in these laws is currently and should remain the responsibility of the individual State and not the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We request that the Senate reject all moves by the Prime Minister both to tighten gun laws and to impose a Medicare levy on all its law abiding citizens because of the illegal and insane actions of one criminal.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Section 256 of the Migration Act makes provision for access to legal advice by persons in immigration detention but only where the persons in immigration detention seek legal advice. The recent Federal Court case of Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Anor v Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs highlighted a fundamental conflict between section 256 of the Migration Act and paragraph 20(6)(b) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. The proposed Bill will ensure that Parliament's intention in relation to the management of unauthorised arrivals in immigration detention, as reflected by s.256 of the Migration Act, is not able to be subverted through the use of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Ombudsman Act 1976 contains similar provisions (paragraph 7(3)(b)) to those in the HREOC Act and could also be utilised to subvert the intention of section 256 of the Migration Act and it is proposed that the amendments cover this provision.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The proposed Bill will also clarify the duties of the Minister and officials in relation to the provision of application forms, to advise of the ability to apply for a visa, to provide an opportunity to apply for a visa or to advise on the rights of access to legal or other advice.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reasons for urgency</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The introduction and passage of the proposed Bill in the same sittings is required to ensure that the Government's management of persons in immigration detention, particularly its management of unauthorised boat arrivals, is not obstructed. Without such amendments the timely removal of current unauthorised arrivals may be frustrated with consequent increases in the period of detention and associated costs.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 (the Principal Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of the bill is to amend the Principal Act to remove certain restrictions on the restructuring of ownership of projects eligible for the Development Allowance so that a more consistent approach is available to the various types of prospective applicants for the Development Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where all other criteria in the Principal Act are met, these amendments would allow the transfer of the Development Allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred to another entity after application for the Development Allowance but before registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the amendments would allow the transfer of the Development Allowance benefit where ownership of a project is transferred from one entity structure to another type of entity structure after application for the Development Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To maximise the effectiveness of the amendments, they will be retrospective and will apply from 1 January 1993, which is the date applications for the Development Allowance closed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide that any applications for registration of plant expenditure that were refused, or granted in respect of an amount of expenditure that was less than the amount of expenditure whose registration was sought in the application, may be granted in full if they would have been granted in full if the amendments proposed in this bill had been in force when the Principal Act received Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the amendments will provide that any application for registration of plant expenditure that was withdrawn, may be taken not to have been withdrawn if an application for transfer of the benefits of the application for registration could have been made if the amendments proposed in this bill had been in force when the Principal Act received Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also grant the Development Allowance Authority (the DAA) a power to determine that an application by an entity for registra <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1888"> tion of plant expenditure has lapsed in certain limited circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is also taken to make some minor administrative adjustments and to correct certain apparent drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has no budgetary implications as the revenue implications of the proposed amendments were previously incorporated into the Budget estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefit of the amendments (in terms of revenue forgone) to projects which qualify for the allowance under the provisions of the bill is expected to be approximately $10 million per annum. Over the nine years from 1993&hyphen;94 to 2001&hyphen;02, the benefit to projects is expected to be approximately $92 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This benefit relates only to unregistered projects that have already restructured or have developed an intention to restructure before registration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reliable estimate of the prospective benefit to projects of allowing all types of restructuring after registration, but the benefit is unlikely to be more than $3 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A similar 1995 bill had passed all stages in the House of Representatives and was stalled in the Senate during the Spring Sittings last due to the backlog of legislation. At that stage the 1995 bill had enjoyed bipartisan support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The notice of motion standing in the name of Senator Margetts asks that a whole series of questions that was put to the government during the debate on the supply bills be produced to the Senate by immediately after question time today; in other words, in less than six hours. That, quite frankly, is an unreasonable proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised and a bit disappointed that the Greens (WA) have put that motion. The volume of questions put and the vagueness of definition of some of those questions have made the task of supplying the information in the time required difficult. In fact, to comply fully with the motion would put at risk the integrity of some of the answers that would be provided, because the questions need some checking out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record that I did speak to the Greens about this a few days ago. I undertook, on behalf of the government, to provide, hopefully, all of the responses that they had requested by the start of next week. I would still stick to that undertaking. I will not call against the formality of the motion today, but I will have to advise the Greens that, whilst we will be able to get a considerable proportion of the responses to meet the request of question time today, it simply will not be possible for us to provide 100 per cent of the responses today. We will do as much <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1889"> as we can today and will provide the balance at the beginning of next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that basis, I am prepared to have the motion go through as formal. But if that is seen by the Greens or anyone else as contravening the motion, then I am afraid that I will have to call it informal. Perhaps the Greens will respond before the motion is put.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME>
<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I remind the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) that the two weeks was not our request; it was an offer by the government. They made a promise during the debate that they would provide to the Senate&mdash;not just to us&mdash;answers to questions on their own bill in two weeks. That time expired nearly a week ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have not been asking questions about what was the previous government's program, what it is that the current government is planning to do in the future and what is it that causes you to do deep research into a program. We asked: what are the decisions that this government has made already? If it takes three weeks for this government to work out the decisions they are making now, I really wonder what is going on here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators will realise that during the debate, apart from when we had questions about the Department of the Senate, there was one adviser in the chair. I wonder whether that is what the current government is providing to answer the questions. Maybe it has one person trying to find all the answers from the various areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for, and the importance of, asking these questions and for needing the answers is that, at the end of next week, a number of groups in the community and a number of departments and programs will have lost their funding. They cannot get any information at all from the government about their future. The only information that is coming through is `Wait till the budget'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are in an office with staff who need to pay, out of their salaries, their bills and rent I think you would have reason to be worried about the timing. It is not good enough for the government to say, `Wait around until we are ready to tell you,' or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `Wait around until 20 August to find out what is going to happen to you after 30 June.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we will certainly look with interest at what is provided today. Senator Short has said that they will be endeavouring to get the remainder of questions to us by Monday. I will certainly be keeping them to that. It really is not good enough. There was only one staff member available during this debate on the supply bill and there is no estimates process in which to ask what the basis of it all is. This kind of outcome is simply not good enough.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Let me make two points. The first is that the advice I am conveying to you today, in terms of the time in which we can get the answers back to the Senate, reflects advice from the officials of the Department of Finance who have the task of collecting this information from a range of departments, coordinating it and preparing it for response. The advice that I have from them is that the timetable of early next week to get it all to you is the earliest time in which they can realistically provide comprehensive and considered responses to all the questions asked. We will give you the material today. It will not be as comprehensive as they would like or as the government would wish. We will complete the task on Monday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the second point. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) concurred with Senator Margetts's statement that we had undertaken to provide the details within two weeks. The Parliamentary Secretary (Senator Gibson) handled this on behalf of the government in my absence on that particular day. I draw your attention to page 1537 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Friday 31 May, where Senator Gibson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you care to put your detailed questions on notice I can give you an assurance that we will endeavour to give you detailed responses over the next two weeks before we resume the next session here. That is the best I can do for you.</PARA>
<PARA>So he gave a best endeavours undertaking. We have done all we can to meet that best endeavours undertaking, and the advice I am conveying to the Senate today is the official advice we have received from the coordinat <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1890"> ing department as to when that best endeavours can be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no intention at all on our part to delay the response to the Senate. As I say, it will all be there by the beginning of next week. We will be providing some information today. I just wanted to get it on the record straight because we are not breaching any undertaking that we gave to the Senate.

I will not go into the details of why the opposition took a different position in relation to the debate on the committee stage of the supply bills.

Commitments were given by the government to facilitate answering those questions after the senators were encouraged to give written notice to the government of those questions. It is for that reason, given that the government made commitments to handle these questions, even though the opposition had taken a different approach in the debate on the Friday of the last sitting period, the opposition is comfortable to allow formality for this motion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends subsection 333(1) of Part 3 of the Migration Act which contains a `sunset clause' whereby the Migration Agents Registration Scheme will terminate on 21 September 1996, after having operated for four years, unless extended.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PARLIAMENTARY CONTRIBUTORY SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the provisions of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, parliamentary pensions are fixed as a percentage of parliamentary salaries payable to serving members from time to time. This includes the additional pensions payable for service as a minister, which are fixed as a percentage of the additional salaries payable to current ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in the additional salary for non&hyphen;Cabinet ministers, payable after the Election on 2 March 1996, would have had the effect of reducing the accrued benefits of certain scheme members. The benefits affected include the pensions of former members, and spouses of deceased former members, where the former members held office as non&hyphen;Cabinet ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the act to prevent a decrease in accrued parliamentary pension entitlements of current and former members or their spouses resulting from the new ministerial salary arrangements, and any similar salary reductions in the future. Provisions in the bill have retrospective commencement from 2 March 1996. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1893"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the financial impact of the bill. The salary reduction would have had the effect of a minor reduction in the cost of the scheme. The reduction in costs in 1996&hyphen;97 in relation to existing pensioners would have been approximately $80,000, but this saving would have decreased over time as the salary payable to a non&hyphen;Cabinet minister increased to the pre&hyphen;reduction level.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The government&mdash;apart from its unwillingness to even debate the matter today in this chamber&mdash;has not given any indication that it is prepared to compromise on this matter. It has not said that, for example, it recognises that states and territories need security of funding and so, at this stage, it would be prepared to appropriate funds for another year, but not for another two years. No approach has been made to me or my office. No argument has been mounted in this cham ber today. In fact, we have heard quite the  opposite. All we have heard is that the government will not agree to the request. That is why I must say that I at least question the motives of the minister and the coalition in refusing this request.</PARA>

There is no doubt that rents will rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister went to great pains yesterday during question time to point out that she had consulted with many groups over the government's proposed changes to housing. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their response to our proposals this year has been positive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the minister failed to tell us what ACOSS has said about these proposals. She did not say that the ACOSS president, Robert Fitzgerald, had expressed alarm over the proposed changes to the Commonwealth-state <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1896"> housing agreement which he said will almost certainly gut public housing and increase housing poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She did not tell us that, in ACOSS's view, the latest proposal seems to rely on the states introducing market rents for public housing without guaranteeing a sufficient level of Commonwealth subsidies to ensure that future public housing tenants are not required to pay higher rents. She did not say that ACOSS has publicly described her government's proposals as a recipe for disaster. She did not tell us that the New South Wales minister for housing, Craig Knowles, predicted on 30 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney will face a housing crisis with rising rents and increased homelessness under [the] new Federal Government's long term funding proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>He described the coalition government's housing plan as `a social and economic disaster' for New South Wales. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even with an increased subsidy, low income tenants could be paying up to 70 per cent of their income if they want to live in the Sydney region&mdash;if they can find a place to rent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She did not tell us that the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, has said publicly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly on present projections we simply wouldn't build some public housing because the federal government in 12 months time is going to provide a rent subsidy for anyone who is in either a public or a private house.</PARA>
<PARA>Here are all our fears, and I think the fears of others, that there may be no future growth in public housing stock confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dean Brown is making decisions not to proceed with building public housing now, but states and territories will not see the coalition's offer&mdash;as if the states and territories have any choice, given the insecurity of funding for housing in the future&mdash;until it is set down in a letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the premiers in August, after the budget is handed down. All this, I might say, is from a minister who today proposes that the Senate not press this request, but puts forward not one word of argument in support of that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the Committee what I argued in putting the original request a few days ago. I said that Labor recognised that the states and territories would need time to re&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> configure their housing arrangements to put the reforms announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Community and Nation</EMPHASIS> in place. The original version of this bill that was introduced by the previous Labor administration made a commitment to provide three years funding for states and territories. It provided them with secure funding while they undertook the planning and change required to implement these significant reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Housing is something that requires long-term planning. It does require forward planning. We need to take account of the longer term. States and territories are effectively being required to undertake the work of reform in one year with no security of funding beyond the financial year we are about to embark upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said previously in the chamber, the coalition has acknowledged that public housing capital works programs involve long lead times and that the date for the discontinuation of Commonwealth capital grants and detailed transitional arrangements, including carry over of funding, needs to be settled well in advance of the actual switch in Commonwealth funding from capital to recurrent. Those are the coalition's words. The request to appropriate funds for 1997-98 and 1998-99 to give states and territories sufficient security in funding to plan properly for the significant reforms ahead was supported not only by my own colleagues in the opposition but also by the Australian Democrats and Western Australian Green senators. I thank them for their support in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said to the minister on Tuesday when we debated this matter that the opposition in the Senate would undertake to deal with the request as soon as possible upon its return from the House of Representatives, which of course is happening, and that effectively we would facilitate in the opposition the early consideration of the request if the Committee saw fit to support my amendment. We have done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today the opposition is faced with a difficult choice. The fact that the government will not agree to the request to appropriate funds for housing assistance in 1997-98 and 1998&hyphen;99 gives us, on this side of the chamber, very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1897"> grave cause for concern about the level of Commonwealth commitment to housing assistance in the future. When the budget is handed down I think we will find that there is good reason for that very high level of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in these circumstances, even acknowledging these arguments that have been put forward, the opposition&mdash;as I said, in a difficult position&mdash;has determined that it is not prepared to jeopardise funding for housing assistance for the states and territories for the financial year 1996-97. So the opposition will not be moving today to press this request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me say this: the opposition will be watching the minister and the government very closely over the next few months to ensure that commitments given in this chamber in the committee stage of this bill when it was originally dealt with and in the second reading debate, commitments given in a number of coalition policy statements and other pronouncements by relevant coalition shadow ministers at the time and shadow spokespersons, will all be vigilantly assessed by the opposition. We will watch all those commitments closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will demand nothing less than the government honour the commitments it has made when in opposition and now in government. We will certainly be doing that right through into the lead&hyphen;up to the budget in August to ensure that a fundamental commitment to housing assistance in this country is maintained.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) believe that what is happening here, despite the clear indications in the bill, is that the funding will be phased out after a year. The reason we believe that will happen is there is a strong push to untie grants and hand the total responsibility for housing, perhaps with some exceptions like defence housing, back to the states. What you have to do then is look at what the states are doing with that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) have some serious questions about the way the states are currently administering their side of the public housing scheme. I believe that is a very frightening <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prospect for people to think that might be the implication. If you hand that responsibility holus&hyphen;bolus to the states, say, in a year's time, then basically we are letting people down. We believe people are being let down right now by state housing policies in a number of areas and Western Australia is one of those that springs to mind in terms of the current outcome for state housing. We do believe it is wrong to push to untie grants and hand that responsibility to the states when there is no guarantee of the outcomes to the people who most need housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally, I have great fear about the implications. We might end up with some sort of voucher system, which means that you have to top up whatever the market is prepared to pay. Maybe in the end we will see people who need housing assistance getting a voucher that they can take along to their nearest private provider. Depending where the housing squeeze is, they will end up getting shoved into the poorest of poor housing with their little voucher. Where nobody else wants to go is where they will be able to use their voucher. That is what I am afraid of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the fears of the opposition in relation to what might happen in this budget, but I believe that if decisions are made which in the end disadvantage those people who need assistance most from governments&mdash;let's face it, that is what governments are supposed to be there for: to do the things the market can't do&mdash;then the government will be the one that wears the wrath of the community. The Greens' will press the request for amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put on record today the disappointment the Australian Democrats feel at the government's decision. We are of a mind to press the request for amendments, but obviously there is little point in that it will go through. We made it clear in the second reading debate of this bill as well as in the committee stage that we found it a little outrageous that the Housing Assistance Bill provides funding for the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement for only one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1898">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of reasons why we are concerned about that. Some of those have already been put forward. It smacks of the intention to pare back public housing. It also smacks of the coalition government once again breaking an election promise. In their election promises the coalition foreshadowed no funding cuts to public housing, yet they are now dishonouring a commitment, a commitment that Senator Faulkner said they made when they were in opposition. I do not believe this government can go around revisiting the terms of agreements that have been made previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Faulkner pointed out in yesterday's question time, Senator Newman was quite happy to read out a list of groups she had consulted with. Certainly, I think she was getting very different responses from those we were getting. Not only has ACOSS expressed its disappointment but groups such as National Shelter and the National Youth Coalition for Housing have expressed their concern and they are scared about what is happening to the provision of public housing in this country. I think it is sad that this government today fails to honour a promise that has been made, an agreement that was being discussed back in December and January in regard to the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said also in the committee stage of this bill that the commitments the previous government had made were not extreme. When you look at the number of people who are on waiting lists for public housing, you see that there are 235,000 people waiting for housing assistance in this country. Yet the previous government had agreed to a maintenance of the dollar value of specific purpose payments for three years. They even then allowed for a cut in real terms equivalent to the inflation rate for three years. It is sad that this coalition government cannot even maintain or honour those commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, the Democrats express our concern at the fact that we are moving down a path where public housing looks like being pared back. I don't think it is a particularly glorious start for the coalition government in regard to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> housing and its relations with some of those housing groups that I mentioned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank senators for their contributions to this debate. I would first like to refer to Senator Margetts' contribution. She expresses, I think quite rightly, concerns that we should all take on board about outcomes of these reforms. Of all the issues that are before us as parliamentarians, the outcomes that are to be achieved in these reforms, in terms of the protection of the disadvantaged, have to be the greatest and most important challenge. I recognise that. I am addressing that right now in my consultations with these groups. I am asking them for their thoughts, for their help and for their submissions to work together to best protect the outcomes that we think are important. Those discussions have already been held and will be continuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also recognise that there will always be some groups who have special needs for public housing. We are not intending to walk away from those groups. Their needs are vitally important. I think it would be a gross misrepresentation of the government's position or my position to suggest that we somehow see them being dumped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja says that we are walking away from the previous government's agreement. As I understand it, the previous government, in about December last year, made a written offer to the states. They did not include any funding in their bill. Our bill has funding provided for the first year. I believe I made it quite clear in the debate the other day why we believed it was not appropriate to put the funding arrangements for the second and third years in place while negotiations are under way, and also as a recognition of the fact that we did not see this three&hyphen;year interim agreement as having a three-year life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome Senator Faulkner's response. I think, as an opposition that has recently been in government, the decision they took was a responsible one. It was responsible in terms of certainty for the states and it was responsible in terms of those renters who are looking for reform in the housing assistance area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1899">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also responsible in the sense that they know very well that we are not walking away from the reform route which they had embarked upon. It would not have been acceptable to the wider community if the Labor Party had tried to walk away from that now. I also welcome Senator Faulkner's reference to our commitments. As I have just said to Senator Margetts, we are very mindful of our commitments to the disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sad that, in the course of his comments, Senator Faulkner gave the impression that he was arguing against the reform advocated by his party when in government. I do find it strange that he would highlight comments made by ACOSS, on the basis of comments by the New South Wales Minister, Mr Knowles, on matters which are progressing no differently from when the Labor Party was in government federally. I do not believe it is responsible for either the New South Wales minister or the head of ACOSS to be frightening people about badly needed reform which has had bipartisan support, which is continuing along the lines advocated by the previous government and, as I am sure Senator Faulkner well knows in his heart of hearts, is long overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's position remains that one year of funding outlined in the bill is consistent with our negotiation process. Also, I understand that it has been put to Senator Faulkner's office on several occasions, contrary to what he suggested in his remarks. Nevertheless, I welcome his reaction to the House of Representatives response.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 has had a chequered career, and it may well have reached the point where the `cheques' have run out and its career can just continue. When this bill was last before the Senate, it was put to the Senate by the government that it was substantially the legislation that the previous government had proposed and would have enacted. That statement is substantially true. The difficulty with it, though, is what is left over after you take away the word `substantially'. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1900">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an element to this bill which the previous government did not include: a provision for the diesel fuel rebate on the quarrying operation of limestone destined beyond the quarry gate for use on farms for soil de-acidification. In that debate I was careful to make the point&mdash;a startling point, given the current national economic concerns and in particular the decision by the government to embark on a slash and burn cost&hyphen;cutting endeavour across the board, endangering programs in the employment, education, health, social welfare and industry sectors&mdash;that while, on the one hand, this bill was conducting an almost scorched earth type approach to expenditure, on the other hand it contained an outlay. It was an outlay for a specific group, namely, farmers. The way in which it was being tacked on meant that for this group there would be an outlay, a payout, whilst everyone else across the nation was being asked to bear some pain. The obvious hypocrisy of that was startling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What lends some strength to the government's position&mdash;not enough to overwhelm the opposition but which, nonetheless, ought to be mentioned&mdash;is that the outlay was for the purpose of soil de-acidification. That is a national landcare problem and a problem that ought to be addressed. Whether it ought to have been addressed in this way is the question. People in various sectors of the Australian community&mdash;those in higher education, universities, and elsewhere in the education system; those in social welfare who have been advised by Senator Newman that all of their programs are on the chopping block and under the scalpel for consideration in the ERC process leading up to the budget; and those in the health area&mdash;would have cocked an eye at a government that says one thing on the one hand and does another thing on the other hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last time the Senate referred a number of amendments moved by Senator Margetts back to the House of Representatives. I should allow her to argue her own case, but I will not do so. I will make remarks about her case from the opposition's point of view. We were minded to give passage to the bill because of its intrinsic merit, which is that the diesel fuel <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rebate scheme is an important national scheme. However, the scheme has resulted in a number of interest groups carting elements of the bill off to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for interpretation. Thereby decisions made by the AAT have expanded the eligibility so that the scheme was haemorrhaging. People who were never intended to receive the advantage of the rebate were receiving the advantage of it. The opposition had the view that in the national interest&mdash;and I might say it was the view we had in government&mdash;that haemorrhaging should be staunched. This bill was the one referred to in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget by the former government with the purpose of staunching it. It was not able to make its passage through the last parliament for a host of reasons that are well recorded and which I will not go into now. However, it has come back and therefore we are minded to support the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the Greens' approach, the issue and importance of land degradation and the concerns expressed by them about landholders who are not in a position to be taxpayers and thus make a claim under section 71 of the tax act for costs expended on land care to be deductible&mdash;that is to say farmers who are not making a profit and thus do not pay tax&mdash;there ought to be a special consideration for their needs in order for them to be given a positive incentive to conduct soil de&hyphen;acidification programs using limestone. Senator Margetts moved some amendments which we were pleased to support because we believed that the amendments fundamentally had merit and that the government should examine them in a constructive and positive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now seen the government dismiss the amendments in the other place and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 18 June the government set out five main reasons as to why it has done so. First of all the government said that the cost of doing this would be around $7 million per annum. That cost is based on a series of estimates which the tax office has advised the government about. As I understand the tax office's advice, it claims that that cost is a conservative estimate because of other unknown factors.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1901">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the government goes on to say that the amendment could distort taxpayers' choice as to the most appropriate mix of landcare activities to undertake. Thirdly, it say that the amendment would allow those entitled to the cash rebate a greater benefit&mdash;that is 100 per cent of expenditure&mdash;than primary producers who are currently claiming deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act and who receive a tax benefit based only their marginal tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth point the government makes is that it is concerned with the precedent that this type of cash rebate scheme might set for the tax act as a whole and open up the possibility of being unable to quarantine that to this sector of the act and give rise to other claims. That leads to the government's final point about the possibility of tax abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to say a few words about those reasons. I thought that the Senate in exercising its obligation as a chamber of review acted responsibly when it support Senator Margetts' amendment, because it did so in the context of saying to the government, `This is a positive proposal about how a real national need can be met. We really do want you to take it on constructively and work it through in the spirit that it is offered up and come back with a practical way of doing it.' Now we have an expression of view that the government will not do it for the reasons I have outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What troubles me is whether the constructive approach of the Senate has in fact been taken on by the government. The advice that the tax office has given the government is set out in a letter made available to me this morning by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). I have not brought the letter into the chamber with me but, as I recall, the opening paragraph of that letter said something along the lines of `in response to your request for speaking notes to oppose the recommendations and amendments raised by Senator Margetts.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This point needs to be made: the approach, as I understood it&mdash;and certainly the approach of the opposition&mdash;was to put a constructive proposal to the government. When a government calls on a department to provide a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> defensive brief or opposition notes, that is exactly what the department will do. That does not meet what I think was the intention of the Senate, that is, to constructively examine this proposal so that a way can be found in which the intent of the proposal&mdash;if not necessarily the precise form of it&mdash;can be encoded in some form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to record my disappointment that from the very beginning the government sought to demolish the proposal rather than constructively examine it. That said, some of the issues raised by the advice from the taxation department need to be given their appropriate weight. If the department was not asked to provide a case to demolish a point, but rather was asked to examine it and analyse it objectively, they would still make these points. It is because of that difference that I turn to them. I do understand that if a greater advantage is provided by this provision to non-taxpayers than would be provided for taxpayers, that could well distort the choices that land holders would undertake with respect to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is standard form to always say that any change to the tax act will open up the possibility of avoidance and evasion or abuse. I think that is standard form. It is standard form for the reason that it often is the case. I have not been able to undertake a review in the short time available to me to see whether or not I concur with that, but it is something that one approaches with care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of a precedent and whether you can quarantine it to the tax system in this part of the act is another matter again. I would think, consequentially, that if you decided to proceed with the principal idea, you would find consequential changes in order to do that. This debate now seems to be inexorably leading to the point of where is the best place to make these changes, given the desire of the Senate to make them. I am persuaded to the view that while the merit of the case still stands and the principle sought to be applied by Senator Margetts, supported by the opposition, stands clearly shining above others on its merit, this particular bill is not the appropriate place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1902">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the government with all sincerity that it should heed the views expressed in the Senate. It should actually consider how this principle can be best encoded. It should not approach the subject from the point of view of how we demolish it because that will disappoint this chamber, and this chamber will react to this disappointment appropriately. It should look at this principle from the point of view of the tax act and grapple with the difficulties that it has referred to and come back and deal with it at an appropriate time. As my colleague the shadow minister for industry and regional development, Mr Simon Crean, has said in the other place, the opposition, with all the reservations I have made, supports the message.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats supported Senator Margetts's amendments when they were introduced into the chamber and passed. The Democrats still support them on the basis of the substantive issue that every opportunity should be taken to advance the cause of rectifying land degradation. The second very important point which touches the taxation issues generally is that farmers who do not show sufficient profit to be able to benefit from a tax deduction should, nevertheless, derive a financial incentive to encourage them to engage in these activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also in receipt of the letter which Senator Cook mentioned. I am able to assist him and the chamber by directly quoting the comment that was made at the beginning of the letter. It says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have often been struck by the process that seems to take place whenever an issue, amendment or bill is under debate and when the argument runs back and forth as to the value of that bill. Very often the arguments are based on either defending or attacking a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particular position without enough attention being paid to the merits of the case.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see that there is anything wrong with using this opportunity to make necessary adjustments to the amendments to the taxation legislation. Those adjustments should enable, in similar cases, the people who cannot benefit from a tax deduction&mdash;because their income or profits are not high enough&mdash;to switch the incentive, provided it is a worthwhile cause and one that is approved by the Australian parliament as meriting a tax deduction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the debate today as the amendments that are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1903"> being rejected are amendments which I moved and which did get support in this chamber. I note that in the other house the Labor Party also rejected the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard an estimate that it could cost $7 million per year, as a conservative estimate. Obviously, our model of the issue was that it was not anything that taxpayers were not already entitled to. If there is, indeed, a potential cost of $7 million per annum which, on the cost of landcare, is not huge, the signal is that some people who would never use the scheme will be brought into the scheme. I do not think that is a bad idea. The purpose of providing such a mechanism is that there will be some people who, because they do not have taxable income, are not able to put off that reimbursement until a later date because these are straitened times and have been for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is an extra cost, that is a recognition that the current system creates a disincentive for many people who ought to be able to provide landcare activities on their land but do not have the incentive or the ability to do so. That should not be seen as a bad signal; it should be seen as a glaring, flashing light that there is something that we should do to look after that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been mentioned that the proposal could distort taxpayers' choice. I find that extraordinary. We thought that <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the problem at the moment is that many people are left without choice about the times that they apply these measures because of the fact that they may not be able to be reimbursed for those measures when they most need them. There may be arguments on both sides, but I do not think you can claim that it is simply a measure that will distort taxpayers' choice. We think that the balance comes in the other direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time that I put the amendments, I mentioned that we were putting them as a model: this is one way that it might be done. If you feel that you are prepared to take the risk that your scheme is not going to be abused&mdash;quite frankly, we think that there is much more than $7 million at risk in terms of your scheme for treatment for limestone&mdash;we will be watching that, of course. Basically, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what we said at the time was, `Come back to the Senate with some other ideas or with some commitment. If you do not think this is the appropriate bill or the appropriate way to do it, come back and say, "We've taken these concerns on board and we know that the rural community in Australia is keen that such changes be achieved. They would like to see you, as a government, come up with a model."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the outcome of today's debate, I would like to see a commitment that there will be moves towards coming up with a model. If you say that this is not the right bill, the right place or the right way, I would like to see a commitment that you will be looking into how to achieve this goal of that $7 million of claims that are currently not being made per year, to encourage those people who are currently discouraged by the nature of the schemes that exist to engage in important landcare activities.

It cannot be discounted: it was not a matter of going out and defending a position or saying that this is what the government wants. You might recall that in the last debate we indicated that our best estimate, which was a higher level, of the cost was about $600,000. At the time, I think that Senator Cook said that it was really just a handout to mates in the rural community. It really was not. It was addressing the serious problem of acidification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fascinating thing is that we have had Senator Spindler come in here today to reject the proposed amendment that he himself put up last year. This was your amendment, Senator Spindler, of 14 November 1995 that we have incorporated in this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here  is  Senator Woodley again. He still has not understood the fact that what we are proposing is in the best interests of farmers, particularly those who are not in a profit position. The argument used previously on this, by either Senator Spindler or Senator Margetts, was that this was a benefit, that if they were not making a profit they would not go into de-acidification. Whereas the point I was making was that there was a greater benefit in giving them the rebate at the time they purchase the limestone than in waiting for 12 months, when they are in a non&hyphen;profit position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In wrapping it up, let me say that we believe that this is the best way to go. We do not know a better option. We believe that the tax system is not the way to go. I think that the difference between the debate now and the debate then is that we knew that the top level was about $600,000. But on the  information given to us and other senators in the chamber, the estimate of the cost, which is a conservative estimate, could be $7 million. I do not think that that is what the Senate is about. I would like to particularly thank Senator Cook for having taken this on board in the decision making process that went on within the Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether Senator Parer has forgotten what the amendments are or whether he was deliberately trying to skirt the problem. We asked whether landcare, which is a much wider issue than just limestone use, would be considered by this government to be an issue which could be dealt with at some stage in terms of such things as tax treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate we were told that this was not the right place for it, not the right bill and not the right way to go about it. But I was not talking just about the limestone issue. My amendment was about landcare. This is the question I am asking, and I will be as specific as I can be: is there any commitment from the government to address the problem of tax deductibility in landcare, which so many people for so long have said needs addressing, or are you saying that you will make no moves at all? Are you saying that, because there is this scheme on limestone, this is a closed story as far as working towards a better situation about the cost of landcare is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is what you are saying, I would like you to make it clear. I want you to specify that. If there is a potential that you as a government will look at the tax treatment of landcare, or at the affordability for landcare in areas that really need to be looked at, then we would like it on the record that there is some intention to look at it in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what I asked. I did not ask whether this is the best way to treat limestone. We have had that debate. Obviously, anything over $7 million&mdash;even near $7 million&mdash;will have us coming back into the chamber with you saying that we are irresponsible now, and saying, `Let us revisit this issue. Sure, we will come back to that.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to pressure from the Greens movement in Tasmania, a place called Benders Quarry, where they used to mine limestone for the fruit industry in the Huon Valley, was closed. Therefore, because that was closed mainly due to pressures from the Greens, the limestone had to be imported from the north of the state because the alternative mine at Maydena could not be used because the Greens would not allow a road to go through from the Huon to Maydena.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1906">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least now those fruit growers who have been suffering a great disadvantage will be able to use lime again to a greater extent on their fruit, on their apples. As you would know, lime is a very important ingredient they need. If this bill to reduce the price of lime will not assist landcare, I do not know what will. As I understand it, to turnaround now and make it wider is a little irresponsible financially, given the state our finances are in at the moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is probably incumbent on the government to be required to present to the Senate, perhaps in a year's time, a report of how much their current scheme will cost if they are talking about money and if what they suggested is succeeding. Perhaps they should be required to report to the Senate and say why the scheme somehow or other got out of their control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are talking about costs, you should be looking at that. If you are serious about the environment, you do not tie it to the sale of a public asset. If you are serious about landcare, you not only deal with the outcomes of land degradation but also deal with land use and the way it is used. We are talking about measures to prevent river systems clogging up and measures that farmers can use to stop the level of nitrification that is going into the river and water system and the breakdown of soils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are concentrating only on the outcome of trying to fix up the mess, you will continue to come back to this place to find other things to sell if that is the only way you can think of funding it. You will never get on top of it if you are not thinking about land use and the causes of land degradation. That has been the problem all along. It should not be linked to the sale of Telstra. That link is irresponsible. The potential has been presented by the Democrats to use the profits from Telstra to continue to fund anything that you and the public think are important but you do not want to hear about that. Once that portion is gone it has gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, you have to start looking at and understanding the issues of what causes the land degradation instead of throwing money <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the results and the problems it causes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I should offer a bit of advice here, as a former minister: when you are sitting in that chair over there it is best not to make provocative statements because it simply opens up the debate again. Firstly, in this debate on the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 the subject of the partial sale of Telstra has been raised and linked to the landcare issue. I share the sentiment expressed in this chamber that you cannot trade one principle for another. If the government is fair dinkum about landcare it will not link Telstra to it; it will find the wherewithal elsewhere to meet the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1907">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, in view of the landcare and taxation issue raised by Senator Margetts, the proposed partial sale of Telstra is a red herring. Suppose Telstra was partially sold and the government then had the funds that it says it needs to address landcare. It would still need to investigate the provision about which Senator Margetts asks. Whether the government sells Telstra partially to raise the funds or finds the money off budget, it still has to answer the question that Senator Margetts has raised in order to find the best taxing mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The partial sale of Telstra is a nice political flourish. This is probably not the place to debate it, though as soon as it is called on we will all state our positions. Nonetheless, the question before the government already is: what provision would be necessary in the act and how would you construct it in order to respond to the principle that Senator Margetts has raised? The chamber wants to hear the government say that it will look at that question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, who has put a bit of effort into this issue, reasonably asks the government whether it will look at this matter, whether we can see it when it has looked at it, and whether we can contribute to the analysis of how it will be effected. A word or two from the government about that would be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, one aspect of this bill on which you have placed great weight is that farmers using limestone for deacidification will get the benefit of the rebate in their hands immediately. They will if it is passed on. When I raised that point earlier, the quite fair rejoinder&mdash;a rejoinder made previously in this chamber, notably by Senator Panizza who is robust in these matters&mdash;was that farmers will insist that quarry owners who get the benefit under this legislation pass on that benefit without loading their cost structures and pocketing the benefit. In other words, it will be a transparent market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of a number of occasions on which a benefit intended for an end user has been provided to a middle person and has never reached the end user; the intent was thwarted and the middle person grew fat on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a measure aimed at meeting a need further down the line. Senator Panizza and Senator Parer are right in saying that farmers are robust and will insist that the benefit is passed on, but there is no guarantee that it will be. My question is: will the government monitor the situation to ensure that the benefit is passed on so that land owners also get the benefit of it? If they do not, if they only partially get it, the intent of this measure is defeated.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1908">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Late in 1993 there was legislation passed in this house setting up a body to deal with a problem that the then government had, or what it saw as a problem, and that is the very large stockpile of wool which had been gathered together and which the government saw as a liability. The government was spooked by the size of the stockpile and the cost of the debt which was accumulating. The government believed that something had to be done, and I agree with it. I think the whole nation was concerned about that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem right from the beginning was that the government and the opposition at the time saw what should have been regarded as an asset as, in fact, a liability. It was from that point on, I think, that many of the problems which we encounter in the wool industry today really flowed. Professor Garnaut was engaged and came up with the solution, which was to be the fixed release schedule, and so the initiation of Wool International by legislation and the selling of an average of 187,000 bales of wool from the stockpile every quarter was put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time, the Democrats proposed a method whereby the very rigid scheme put in place by the government could enjoy a certain amount of flexibility. We proposed a trigger price by which sales from the stockpile would cease if the price at auction fell below a certain figure, and sales from the stockpile could be increased if the price rose above a certain high trigger price. This would have given flexibility to Wool International in their marketing of the stockpile and, I believe, would have mitigated significantly the current situation we have in the wool industry. However, the proposal by the Democrats was defeated by Labor and the coalition voting together. I believe that what we initiated at that time would have worked and would have given flexibility, as I said a moment ago, to Wool International in the task that they were given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government, the opposition and Wool International continue on a predetermined legislated course to disaster because the fixed release schedule is far too rigid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza, I might say to you that the majority of woolgrowers in Australia agree with me. Wool International was not only bound by a far too rigid marketing device but also forced at times to discount the price of wool sold at auction. Wool International's own memo in November 1995 admits that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put on the record some examples, and this comes from a submission by Tom Silcock to the hearing on 17 June last. The example he gives is that, on Thursday, 23 November 1995, the market closed at 611 EMI. On Friday, 24 November 1995, Wool International sold all remaining December quarter quota for up to 40c under the market price of the day before. On Monday, 27 November 1995, exporters were appalled by the action of Wool International. Their orders and limits had all been reduced for the next day's auction so that, on Tuesday, 28 November 1995, the market fell 36c to 575 EMI. A recently conducted Rural Press survey of woolgrowers asked whether or not they believed a trigger price would improve the fixed release schedule. A survey of 370 woolgrowers conducted in December 1995 by Rural Press Ltd indicated that 74 per cent of Australian wool growers supported a trigger price for wool stockpile sales.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I didn't do it. It was done by Rural Press. There is a terrible distress&mdash;and I am not necessarily trying to make political capital&mdash;in primary industry, particularly in the wool industry, today. We are in a serious situation. We are facing the collapse of the wool industry and, without a strong agricultural sector, no nation can have confidence in its future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wool industry is still the foundation stone of agriculture and the pastoral industries in Australia. Let me read to you what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said in reporting a meeting involving the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Anderson, in May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government warned yesterday that Australia's wool production would collapse unless prices improved soon&mdash;and foreshadowed moves to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1909"> raise a further $70 million to $80 million from industry to promote demand.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper said, on the same day, that the wool industry had been warned it faced collapse. In another newspaper article, Mr Anderson is reported to have said, after an eight-hour crisis meeting of industry leaders:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . plummeting prices and demand were now reaching a dangerous climax.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland's wool industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the industry in my own state&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has been the hardest hit with years of drought on top of a price collapse. The state's production has plunged to its lowest level since records were kept early this century. Queensland Sheep and Wool Council senior vice&hyphen;president, Don Compagnoni said he was pleased the Federal Government had recognised the depth of the crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So I agree the government admits that there is a crisis in the wool industry. The problem is that it will not admit that the solutions which the Democrats proposed three years ago would have at least been a factor in making Wool International's job much easier, enabling them to be much more flexible in their approach to this problem.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are facing a terrible problem in the wool industry in Australia. The legislation which we are debating today will do at least three things: it will enable Wool International to set up a subsidiary company to be known as Wool International Holdings; it will return a proportion of the tax to woolgrowers; and it will enable the wool industry contribution <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be made to the Australian Animal Health Council. It is interesting that a number of woolgrowers have asked that the tax be used to fund retaining the stockpile as an asset rather than selling it at a liquidation sale. However, at this stage, the Democrats will support that part of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding of the Australian Animal Health Council has some problems. One of the problems is using the wool tax for a rather remote purpose from the intentions of the original purpose of the wool tax, and there are some questions that I wonder whether the minister might address in his response to the second reading debate. These questions are: what contributions are other industries making to the Australian Animal Health Council? What is the role and purpose of the Australian Animal Health Council? Is the Australian Animal Health Council meeting some of the gaps which have been caused by states withdrawing from the animal health areas, such as the Victorian government's closure through privatisation of Victorian veterinary laboratories in a number of areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, let me turn to Wool International Holdings. My main concern about Wool International Holdings is that it is being formed in the midst of a crisis of confidence in the wool industry&mdash;a crisis of confidence in the Wool Council and in Wool International. In the midst of that crisis of confidence, I wonder whether Wool International Holdings will be the panacea that the government and the Labor Party believe it should be. If one does not have confidence in those who are promoting the setting up of this particular marketing device, one probably could not have confidence in the device either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had many phone calls both in favour of and against this legislation, and it is very hard to balance out where the majority lies. For this reason I did ask the Senate, and the Senate agreed, to hold some hearings on the matter. These hearings were held on 30 May and 17 June this year. I might add that my concern to hold hearings was based on a number of meetings which I attended, and others which were communicated to me, in Victoria, in Western Australia and in New South Wales.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1910">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on the record some of the evidence given by witnesses at the hearings, particularly evidence given on 17 June. I want to do this because I believe I have to underline to the Senate that there is a lack of confidence in Wool International, in the Wool Council and, therefore, in Wool International Holdings. Mr Massy, a woolgrower from Cooma in New South Wales, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I can be blunt, let us be very clear about cause and effect. The cause is a combination of Wool Council agripolitics and an interfering statutory marketing authority and government, including the bureaucracy, all of whom thought they could ignore the customer and drive a system to their own advantage. They have managed to bring an industry to its knees. The effect is that wounded customers are reluctant to commit capital to the industry because they are fearful of the unpredictability of the industry, owing to ongoing political interference.</PARA>
<PARA>A second speaker at that particular hearing was Mr David Webster, Chairman of the Committee to Reform Legislation, Stud Merino Breeders Association of Western Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the Stud Merino Breeders Association . . . a move was initiated out of New South Wales. . . . New South Wales initiated the current major movement that we are seeing from the woolgrowers&mdash;in fact, I believe it is the biggest movement of growers in the history of our industry in my lifetime&mdash;to express their opinions and concerns about what has happened over the last year.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that there are representatives in each state. He also says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a personal basis, our organisation has the closest grower network of any organisation in this country. We go onto their properties; we talk to them numerous times during the year. We are now seeing instances where kids' education is getting cut off. The very rural social fabric is in decay. The wool industry is the cornerstone in the rural areas because it involves so many people. It is a people's industry, and I do not think we should ever forget that. You cannot run it without people. It is far reaching throughout the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Another grower from Hay in New South Wales spoke about his reticence towards Wool International Holdings because of its close association with Wool International and the Wool Council of Australia. Tom Silcock, a grower from Horsham in Victoria, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has put in place an organisation in Wool International which has little regard for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wool growers or the wool industry but is purely focused on reducing government borrowings and the government exposure through its guarantee. The board of Wool International was appointed to achieve that outcome and, as I have already shown you and can show you more, it has repeatedly shown scant regard to the effects of their actions on the wool industry. If Wool International Holdings has any chance it must be totally separate from Wool International, and real wool growers of Australia must have real input.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hill from Benalla in Victoria repeated the same story. Because I am running out of time, I will not read into the record the many comments which were made. The big problem is that, if we are going to set up a subsidiary company, it must have the confidence of the growers and the rest of the industry. I am saying that certain communities in Australia have a distinct lack of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee handed down a day ago its report on this matter. I put in a dissenting report. I would like to put on the record a couple of reasons why I felt I needed to make a dissenting report. The first reason is that one of the conclusions of this report was that those opposed to the bill represent a minority. I question that conclusion. No figures of the number of wool growers represented by the Wool Council of Australia are available, but a generous estimation is 50 per cent. The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia says 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that report I put on the record all of the bodies which have raised concerns about this legislation. They include the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the South Australian Farmers Federation, and the Western Australian and New South Wales stud marino breeders associations. Many individuals also raised concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern I have is that Wool International did not appear at the hearing but they were the main focus of the criticisms. They did give us written evidence but, in the words of Sir James Killen in a speech to the House of Representatives some years ago, evidence which is not examined is not worth very much. Our inability to examine the evidence <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1911"> given by Wool International in writing seriously reduces its value. I am very disappointed that they did not appear in person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also raised some objections to the style and content of this report in that the arguments which were put in chapters 1 and 2 in favour of the legislation stood on their own but all through chapter 3, which put the arguments against the legislation, contrary propositions were put for every point. It seems to me that is a pretty poor way of dealing with objections to and evidence in favour of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later in this debate I will move a number of amendments, and I will give reasons for those at that time. But I urge the Senate to consider this legislation, particularly this part of it, very carefully indeed.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is important to correct this. To the best of my knowledge, and Senator Crane can correct me if I am wrong, I attended every meeting that the committee held, both public and private.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless there was a meeting of the committee that I did not attend&mdash;and I do not know of one&mdash;Senator Woodley did not make that request. I will go on the record as saying now that, if any senator on that committee had said they would like Wool International to appear in addition to presenting their written submission, I would have said there would be absolutely no problem with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go one step further than that. On the first night of the hearings certainly one but maybe two officers of Wool International were present in the hearing room. A number of technical questions were being asked by Senator McGauran in respect of Wool International, and for only that reason did I turn to the committee secretary and ask whether anyone from Wool International was there who could address those questions if they were not addressed&mdash;and I might add they were subsequently addressed by other witnesses. The secretary said, `Yes, they are over there&mdash;the bloke wearing the green tie,'&mdash;whoever that was&mdash;`They are perfectly happy to appear. They are here for that purpose if anyone wants to call them,' and asked whether I wanted to. I said, `No, I'm happy with their written submission. I don't need to call them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to correct that. I am disappointed that Senator Woodley has flatly stated that in here because it was corrected in the committee. Wool International did not fail to appear. They provided a written submission. They attended the committee meetings. They were available and advised the committee they were available to answer any questions should any members of the committee wish to do so. But to the best of my knowledge, no senator at any private meetings of the committee that I attended did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other things that Senator Woodley mentioned that I want to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1912"> pick up. I do not disagree with him at all, as he knows, about the crisis that the wool industry and, indeed, the beef industry are facing at the moment. There are a lot of people in primary industry at the moment still doing it very hard in this country. This is posing major, long&hyphen;term problems for the country and for the government in respect of not only those industries but the effect this is having on rural Australia generally, on small rural towns and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the reasons why we established a special focus to look at the social impacts of these problems as well as the immediate impacts on the farm, particularly the problems it is imposing on regional towns. There are a lot of problems&mdash;a substantial decline in the price for beef, a substantial decline in the price for wool. I have to tell you, and it is the truth, that I wish I could actually believe the problem with the wool price at the moment&mdash;and that is causing all of the problems Senator Woodley has referred to&mdash;was the fault of Wool International.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Calvert. As I said in the committee, and I want to say it here again, people have got awfully short memories in this business. I tell you what: in respect of the stockpile they have to be very short memories, indeed. You do not have to go back very far. As I said in the committee, only a very short time ago people were seriously suggesting&mdash;and I am talking about senior people in government&mdash;that the stockpile should have been burnt. As I said at the time, that was one of the most positive and, I thought, attractive options available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still remember the delightful interview when one of the senior leaders of the Country Women's Associated suggested that her members should knit the stockpile. It was suggested in a most positive way but it was a far more sensible suggestion than some of the desperate suggestions that were being made at the time&mdash;not 50 years ago, not 20 years ago, not even 10 years ago. It was a very short time ago, indeed. All has been forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the price was okay and it had climbed past 600c in terms of the eastern indicator there were not any complaints about Wool International. The cold hard facts are&mdash;boy, I can relate to it and fully understand it&mdash;the major reason for the dismay and the lack of morale is the price for the product, which in many cases is below the cost of production. I say again: I wish that was the fault of Wool International because then we could all fix it right in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley and the Democrats are always concerned about trying to work out where the numbers are in terms of what position you take on an issue&mdash;and that is a very valid position to take. Senator Woodley said that he got phone calls from some growers saying that this was a good idea and phone calls from some growers saying that this was a bad idea. It is very difficult to work out where the majority lies. That is a common problem. At the end of the day, the only solution is to use your own good judgment rightly or wrongly as to what the correct position is.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1913">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems as far as I am concerned with the stockpile and one of the reasons why, as difficult an option as it is, not to introduce trigger prices or vary the fixed schedule is, I believe, the overhang on the market. That is caused by the stockpile being there in the quantities that it still is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go on the record here and now as saying that, despite the concerns that have been raised, despite what I thought was a positive response from Wool International to those concerns in terms of looking at ways of around the edges of varying their activities, I believe they have done a commendable job in significantly assisting what was a catastrophic problem for the industry only a few short years ago in getting that stockpile down to the point it is now. The sooner it gets back to manageable levels, which it will by June next year, in my opinion the better for the long-term future of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley, I do respect the validity of the arguments on both sides. But one of the potential problems&mdash;and it was raised by Senator Sandy Macdonald on the committee, and I agreed with him 100 per cent&mdash;in varying that schedule, apart from the fact that it was legislated for, is that I do not think introducing that uncertainty back into the equation is going to assist the very experiment that we are trying to get under way here now; that is, establishing a futures market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to remind people again of how that proposal was put together after the 1993 examination of the problem and Garnaut's investigation of it. That is why it is legislated for. It was put together on the basis that fundamentally&mdash;and people have forgotten this&mdash;the stockpile was not worth what was owed. For that reason, a crucial part of the solution was that the people of Australia, the taxpayers of Australia, represented as they must be from time to time by the government, would underwrite that multimillion dollar debt and, of course, continue to underwrite it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no bones about saying this. I said it in the committee. I certainly would have wanted to have done this in government. I think it is crucial to the wool industry that that underwriting continue until the stockpile is disposed of, at whatever time that might be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> post-1997. Part of that arrangement was that the people of Australia would underwrite this huge debt, but on the basis that there would be an agreed arrangement for disposing of the stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Woodley, with the greatest respect, you responded to that by saying, `How do you know what every taxpayer in Australia thought about it?' You cannot know. The best we can manage in this country is a form of democracy, which I actually think is as good as anything else around the world, where from time to time you have to assume as a government that because you have been elected you can take those decisions. I think anyone and everyone in government, indeed even in opposition, and particularly ministers&mdash;I was&mdash;has to be conscious every minute of every working day of their working lives that the money they are dealing with is not theirs but simply there on trust from the people who actually provide it. That is the reason I made that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe&mdash;I do not think it should be overlooked&mdash;that it would be, Senator Woodley, even though I know you disagree, a breach of that agreement which is still underwriting that stockpile to vary the disposal of the stockpile in the way that it was intended, to get the pile down to manageable levels by July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I restate something here that I also said in the committee. There is another industry round table in August. I also believe, whilst strongly asserting that there should be no change in the disposal regime of the stockpile, that it would be to the great benefit of the wool industry if the government could indicate, as a result of those round tables in August, what the post-July 1997 regime for the stockpile is likely to be.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude on one point again in terms of what Senator Woodley said. Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1914"> Woodley asserted that this proposal has been portrayed by government as a `panacea' for the wool industry. I never said any such foolish thing and neither do I believe that the current government would be saying it at all. No-one sees this as being a panacea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do get a bit irritated with this but it is a human trend, I suppose. It does not matter whether you are talking about the wool stockpile or about massive problems like Aboriginal health, everybody is always looking for a magic bullet&mdash;an act of parliament, an administrative measure&mdash;that will instantly fix everything. It just does not happen in the real world. I am not suggesting that this is a panacea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am suggesting, and fervently hope, that it is is a useful additional option for marketing wool for growers in Australia, in the same way that it has become an invaluable option for cotton growers in Australia to in fact sell their fibre. I have to say that&mdash;the comparison has often been made, and I guess as a former grower myself, about 100 years ago, I am very conscious of it&mdash;that is an industry that has been remarkably successful in its domination of the world market in terms of the fibre and its development of things like futures. The last time I had a look, I think 80 per cent of the entire product was being sold on that basis, and the spot price in the cotton industry has become almost irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I fervently hope this experiment is a success. I hope it will result in a viable futures market for the wool industry being developed. If that is the end result, it will be a very positive move&mdash;not a panacea&mdash;in assisting this industry, as we all hope, to have a viable future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to Senator Bob Collins. It is a rare occasion when you can get up and say that you agree with almost everything a member of the opposition says, but in this case I think Senator Collins's contribution was extraordinarily useful. The level of bipartisanship on this issue is very important in terms of showing to the industry that, whilst there are no easy solutions, there is agreement both in the government and the opposition that there are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very few easy options and what these amendments propose may provide some assistance to the industry. Let's hope that they do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The wool industry continues in its sixth year of crisis. The amendments I want to address are those concerning the Wool International Act 1993 in that they provide that Wool International be given the power to undertake through a subsidiary, Wool International Holdings, wool marketing activities including forward trading and the use of futures and currency contracts for hedging purposes. The amendments would facilitate Wool International undertaking a limited program of forward trading to assist in the development of a broader range of risk management options for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is separate from the problems with the fixed disposal program of Wool International. I will keep my comments to the proposals to set up Wool International Holdings. There are a number of reasons for these changes. Firstly, the lack of forward marketing or price risk management tools have been a major weakness in the Australian wool marketing chain. Secondly, despite years of crisis, around 90 per cent of the Australian clip is still sold and priced for spot delivery at the auction market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, in the wool industry the spot or auction price is the determinant of the value of woolgrowers' production and also of their major asset, the wool stockpile. Fourthly, it is interesting to note that, in comparison, the value of the cotton stockpile, which is substantially owned by processors, is determined by a forward market price on a given day. It is not determined by a spot price, however important that spot price might be in determining a futures price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, in the current season&mdash;coming to an end on 30 June this year&mdash;wool prices have continued to deteriorate; they have done so since April 1995. This decline highlights how exposed woolgrowers are in the post floor price deregulated market. That is particularly so when demand is as low as it is now. Some woolgrowers&mdash;hopefully an increasing number&mdash;would like the opportunity to sell forward or to lock in a price prior to shearing or two to three years out, which is essential for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1915"> what I understand is a viable futures market, a true forward market. While there are some opportunities today to sell forward, hedge prices with wool futures, take a basis trade, or take an options contract, these price mechanisms are very much underdeveloped, undercapitalised and frequently not encouraged by some brokers and some buyers who rely heavily on the continuation of the auction system in its present form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation proposes to fill this void in that a subsidiary of Wool International, to be known as Wool International Holdings, will have the ability to conduct a two&hyphen;year development and evaluation program in forward marketing. The proposal has two objectives. Firstly, as a dedicated forward marketing agency, Wool International Holdings will hopefully provide a stimuli for sufficient forward market throughput; in other words, get the idea of forward marketing up and running in a user&hyphen;friendly manner. Critics of this proposal say forward marketing tools have always been available. In response, as a woolgrower, I say that growers and the trade simply have not used them because they don't understand them, and they have not encouraged their clients to use them. This must change. Perhaps in 10 years time or so, this initiative may well be seen as a catalyst of what must be an essential change within the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, this proposal will also have the advantage of showing whether or not forward marketing can be a viable business for a privatised portion of Wool International's non&hyphen; wool assets, which are presently estimated at $250 million. This is a controversial aspect of the question of whether Wool International will have a future role, and that is for another debate. But the share of the assets that is being proposed in setting up Wool International Holdings is minor compared with the overall view of whether growers will wish to take their equity, as soon as they possibly can, out of the assets of the stockpile when they are sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The financing of Wool International Holdings' proposal is to be provided out of the section 51 reserve funds, which come from warehouse rents and a number of other <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> non&hyphen;core marketing activities. It is these funds that are available for Wool International's commercial activities. The reserve funds stand at about $40 million. Wool International Holdings will be provided with a maximum of $24 million from these section 51 reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a misconception that woolgrower levies have been invested in these warehouses. Wool International warehouses are basically a legacy of World War II, when the British government acquired the whole of the Australian clip, funded the construction of storage in Australia and, as far as I understand, gave the stores to the Australian wool industry. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the income from these warehouses, many of which were leased out to non-wool tenants, was used to redevelop and help supplement other wool industry initiatives; namely, research, development and promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation gives Wool International Holdings the ability to proceed past its pre&hyphen;planning stages. We will have to wait and see whether they come up with a proposal which is commercially responsible, beneficial to woolgrowers and the industry and not reliant on a further government guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, Mr Anderson, is on record as saying that the sooner he can let the wool industry get on without government involvement, the happier he will be. Unfortunately, this has not been possible with the continuing government responsibility in terms of its guarantee over the remaining stockpile debt. I remind the Senate that that debt is still in excess of $1 billion, and the wool stockpile is in excess of 2.2 million bales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been considerable discussion in the industry about the pros and cons of the proposal. The Senate rural and regional affairs committee heard from a range of people and organisations, some of whom were for and some of whom were against the proposal. The peak grower body, the Wool Council of Australia, at its half yearly meetings in October 1995 and May 1996, endorsed the proposal and the funding. Subsequent woolgrower meetings at state and district level have either endorsed the proposal or defeated resolutions that have sought to oppose the proposal. The New South Wales Farmers' Wool Committee, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1916"> Victorian farmers, Western Australian farmers and the Queensland farmers' sheep and wool council have all supported the proposal. Some woolgrowers, particularly the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia&mdash;although not opposed to the development of the forward marketing&mdash;are opposed to a statutory authority, namely, Wool International, conducting this trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say to those who oppose the proposal, some of whom are very knowledgeable and have some status in woolgrower circles: go and sort out the problems of the industry and industry representation. If the people who spoke to the rural and regional affairs committee are not representative, as they allege, surely it is for the wool industry to fix. Leadership must come from the wool industry itself. I listened with interest to Senator Woodley's comments that the Wool Council of Australia represents maybe only 50 per cent of growers; it may be as low as 40 per cent, he said. As is the case with any industry body, you cannot make people join a representative body. The Australian union movement has that problem, woolgrowers have it, everybody has it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins might recall that during the committee meeting I said to him that the world is ruled by people who attend. As politicians we understand that. There may be a lot of people out there who are much more able than us, but we were the people who actually happened to put our hands up at the time. That applies to the Wool Council and to any other representative body. Any government that does not take the advice of its peak grower body would be acting at its peril. It would be doing its growers and its major representative body a great disservice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply put, the bickering between sectors of the industry just has to stop. We all have to work together to find a suitable and long term solutions. It is early days and I will be following the development of Wool International Holdings very closely, as will the minister. He has expended a great amount of time and effort getting the agreement together generally and with the industry. I am sure that senators on both sides of the chamber, especially Senator Collins and Senator Crane, will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be wishing this proposal well. For too long Australia has had a selling system for wool&mdash;and I stress a selling system. What we need now is a marketing system for wool and this will certainly help.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all I should declare the fact that I am a woolgrower, even though a very small one, and I have a fair idea of what effect these measures will have for woolgrowers. This goes back to matters raised by Senator Bob Collins when he was the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some interesting comments have been made, particularly by the former minister. I would have to agree&mdash;and he would agree too&mdash;that there are plenty of problems facing the wool industry, but in recent times one of the major problems has been the wool stockpile. It has hung over the industry like a wart and whilst it is still there and the demand is low, it will create problems. It does not matter who is running the industry, whether it is called Wool International or any other name, it is rather unfair to blame them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other issues which was not mentioned and which may have helped reduce demand was the fact that Russia dumped its whole 12 month production in one hit. Those sorts of things have not helped either. This bill and the setting up of Wool International Holdings will provide the industry with another tool for forward selling and&mdash;as Senator Macdonald said&mdash;hopefully allow things to progress in an orderly manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was a bit rich of Senator Woodley to bring up the fact&mdash;and I have heard it myself around the traps&mdash;that when wool prices crashed a lot of the brokers were saying that it was Wool International's fault because it was undercutting the market. We had a briefing from Bob Richardson and we found out that some of the wild claims being made were not quite true. Senator Woodley cannot have it both ways. He is saying on the one hand that that is the reason why wool prices kept coming down and that it was Wool International's fault. Whose fault is it that the price of wool has gone up by 60 cents in the last three weeks? He cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1917">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that once the stockpile has gone&mdash;whenever that will be&mdash;there is no guarantee that that will increase the price of wool either. It comes back to the old story of supply and demand and at the moment demand is pretty weak around the world for all sorts of reasons, as Senator Collins said.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not be too hard. The thing that came through to me during the hearings&mdash;and I did not attend all of them&mdash;was the advantage of the Senate committee system. Those in favour and those against the measures in this bill were able to come forward and put their views to the committee. Whether it was the Western Australian farmers and people like Lyn Johnson, who was totally opposed to it all because she said it was a question of throwing good money after bad&mdash;and I take that point&mdash;or whether it was the Wool Council of Australia putting forward its point of view, it is all there in black and white.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though Senator Woodley put in a dissenting report, the committee considered the arguments for and against in a very good manner and came up with this report. We heard evidence from the minister's representative, Senator Brownhill, departmental officers, the Wool Council of Australia, farmers and graziers organisations from Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and a number of individual growers. They appreciated the fact that they could come along and put their point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Macdonald said, the main interest in the bill is the fact that Wool International wants to set up Wool International Holdings which will allow its wool marketing activities to be broadened to include forward trading and marketing and the use of futures and currency contracts for hedging purposes. This has been done and some brokers told us that, but I think it accounted for only five per cent of the market. This does allow Wool International a bit more leverage. It is not a foregone conclusion that Wool International will use this ability. They may do other things and we are not too certain what they will put forward to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister. At least putting this legislation through will give them the option. It will happen over a trial period to allow the matter to be assessed and there is a two&hyphen;year sunset clause. I am pleased that there is bipartisan support for this bill from the opposition. I expected that, given the strong support that the former minister gave the wool industry prior to going into opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major achievements of this bill is the fact that the wool tax is to be regulated. Last year the minister announced that that additional tax on wool was to be taken off. In the short term that will have a favourable effect for woolgrowers, even though wool prices are so low. As a Tasmanian, I can assure honourable senators that I have been lobbied very hard by the industry in Tasmania to support this bill, just as Senator Crane has been lobbied by some of his constituents in Western Australia, in particular, against the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is very strong support from the woolgrowers in Tasmania for these particular measures. It saddens me to see wool properties in Tasmania at the moment that have existed since the 1800s&mdash;well&hyphen;known properties such as Mt Morrison, for instance&mdash;changing hands from long&hyphen;established families to other buyers. But I suppose that is the result of the way the wool market is at the moment. I just hope that some of the other growers who are household names in Tasmania can survive and keep the superfine wool industry afloat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned, the major problems in the wool industry were addressed by the Garnaut review back in 1993. They recommended the establishment of Wool International. As a backbench opposition committee in those days and now as a government, we have a lot of time for Wool International. Bob Richardson in particular has had a very hard job. I do not know who you would replace them with. It is all very well to be critical of them, as Senator Collins has said, but what else can you do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns I have is that I do not believe there is enough money being spent on promotion at the moment. I do not know where the money will come from to improve that. I recently had the pleasure of being in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1918"> Taiwan. There is a branch of the International Wool Secretariat there. There was very little evidence of any promotion. The International Wool Secretariat in Paris seemed to be starved of funds. Even in our local areas there does not seem to be the promotion of wool that there used to be, even though some interesting developments in fabrics seem to be coming forward at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I briefly wish to mention the arguments that were given to the committee to convince us of the benefits to the industry that the creation of Wool International would have. One of the major benefits put to us was that it would allow woolgrowers to become shareholders in a potentially profitable business, thus diversifying their business investments and, hopefully, increasing their profitability. Another incentive was to inject additional competition into the entire wool marketing sector of the industry. I suppose one would expect to see objection to this from the wool brokers. Hopefully, it will also allow wool producers to hedge their risks and overcome their dependence on the volatility of prices. It could reduce the considerable hidden costs for producers resulting from the lack of price risk management within the industry. Hopefully, it will assist the wool industry to move to an essentially free market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also put to us that it could help assist woolgrowers and other members of the industry in the present situation where financial institutions and brokers are increasing their risk margins associated with finance secured by wool. That may be one of the problems facing some of the older established woolgrowers in Tasmania; they just do not have any more security left. I was interested to see that Mr Fuji, who supported the superfine wool industry in Tasmania so well, has gone one step further now and owns a property. There was some criticism from some areas about that, but I think it will be very good for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were many other reasons put to us as to why we should be supporting this legislation. There were also a number of objections, particularly from Western Australian grower organisations and the Australian Council of Wool Exporters. I suppose they were the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strongest objectors. The major reason was the fact that they felt we were throwing good money after bad. In hindsight, that may well be the case. A figure of $24 million has been mentioned in relation to setting this up. The Wool Council pointed out to us that they would not expect to see any more than $11 million being used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, what more can we do? I think a majority of the state organisations, regardless of what Senator Woodley said, are in strong support of the measures being taken. I am sure, with the support of the opposition, that these matters will go through.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right throughout Australia since 1989 there has been tremendous uncertainty in the wool industry. Many of us have gone around the various growers meetings and listened to all sorts of ideas and proposals that have come forward&mdash;from the return of the floor price scheme to the absolute ultimate in free marketing&mdash;as we have tried to come to some compromise with some way of marketing wool. The amendments today to the wool bill give some sort of hope. At least they give a direction from the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have said they are not satisfied with them. I think Senator Woodley said that they are not representative. I have had some correspondence from some wool growers stating that futures have been tried and failed before and that the wool industry is not a big enough market to sustain a futures industry. My response to all those criticisms <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1919"> is that the wool council has put a proposal before the government and the government has responded to the peak body organisation. If you are not happy with the peak body's proposal, then get in there and change the peak body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day, off the top of my head, I quoted the old `McEwenism' which said, `It is the responsibility of my party to see that your product is marketed in the way that your organisation wants that product marketed and my party will bring it through in legislation.' That was a commitment that McEwen gave in the 1960s and that is what we are trying to do today. We are listening to the peak councils of the industry which have come up with this proposal. It behoves everyone to get behind it and give it support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that surprises me is the dissension in the wool industry&mdash;if you talk to 10 growers you get 13 opinions. I have been dealing with many other rural industries and primary producers and I find that, when you talk to them, there is a oneness of opinion where they get behind their industries and support them. The proposal that has been launched by the Australian Wool Industry Council and supported by John Anderson and this parliament is an opportunity to go forward. It is not just sitting on your hands and saying, `The world's going to fall in on top of us.' It is a direction which deserves the support of the wool industry. It is a new proposal which has the support of the parliament and I think it is the way that we have to market wool, as many of our other primary products are marketed on the futures market. Therefore, I give it my support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 makes six changes regarding offshore minerals, laying chickens, poultry industry assistance, Wool International and the Australian wool research and promotion organisations. The offshore minerals changes appear to be routine. The amendments allow for changes in territorial sea baseline within the defined location of a licence. However, in the event these licences were near national park boundaries, this further highlights the need for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mineral licences to be granted far away from the boundaries of a marine environment of high conservation value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chicken laying and poultry industry assistance changes also appear to be non&hyphen;controversial, the former being about setting levies and the latter regarding funding for research and development. Although the industry has called for these changes, I would like to speak about some wider matters affecting the poultry industry, that is, those regarding the impact of the Uruguay Round of GATT and the greater risk of these diseases entering our country and affecting our markets. Talking about assistance for the poultry industry, we ain't seen nothing yet if we do not take the issues I am about to talk about into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main example is the threat of disease from cooked chicken meat imports once the minister for primary industries decrees the ban be lifted. The proposed lifting of this ban appears to be entirely based on the premise that there is no quarantine reason to maintain it. However, there is no guarantee that AQIS will be able to detect the entry of diseases such as Newcastle disease from cooked chicken meat imports. This disease is one of which Australia is still free and, if it enters Australia, could pose a dire risk to Australian native birds and livestock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also on the edge of being flooded with poultry imports as one of the countries which has unilaterally dismantled tariff protection and embraced the ideology of free trade&mdash;except for the bill that we are going to be talking about further at lunch time, it seems. This flood of imports and the lack of AQIS resources will massively increase the risk of this disease entering our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government and the last have both been prepared to risk the Australian environment and domestic industries for the doctrine of free trade which, basically, removes the power of the nation state to set environmental and health standards and changes the onus of proof on nations in the event they have to ban imports because they are an unacceptable risk. The onus of proof falls on the importing nation, which is a gift to backward logic. Once you have the evidence to prove there is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1920"> significant disease risk, the disease has already entered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chicken meat is not the only example. The examples are ever increasing, with uncooked North American salmon and New Zealand apples and pears joining the list. At the heart of these matters is the legal framework drawn up by GATT under the terms of the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement of GATT and its implementation by AQIS, which is following what they call an acceptable risk strategy instead of a minimum risk strategy with imports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not need to speak at length to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill at this particular stage, other than to give notice that I will be asking some questions at the committee stage. I will go to that aspect of it in just a few moments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation underpins the government's buyback scheme for guns. I place on record that the initial initiative for a buyback scheme, funded by this mechanism under the Medicare levy, was in fact floated by the opposition. We had felt that it was important to bring in a national scheme to control guns in this country. For a number of years the former Minister for Justice, Mr Duncan Kerr, had been working with the states to put a scheme together. That scheme went to issues of importation, control of use of guns, storage and what sorts of guns should be banned in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under that scheme and before the incident at Port Arthur, the range of guns that were to be bought back, that were to be banned in our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> society, were automatic and military style semi-automatic guns. Since Port Arthur, both sides of parliament have moved and the net has been broadened to include all automatics, apart from those used in the very rare and specific circumstances mentioned in the accord reached between the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the state police ministers just a few weeks ago. The accord is something that is important in respect of the underpinning of the national approach to both the banning of and control of the use of firearms in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognise, as did Duncan Kerr in the previous government&mdash;in fact, the previous government formally recognised it&mdash;that for the scheme to work properly there needs to be a buyback arrangement. Consideration of that buyback arrangement was given to how the buyback was to work and where the funding was to come from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme was not implemented in the previous government, because the state governments were dragging their feet in coming to an agreement. The last meeting for reaching an agreement had been scheduled for February this year, but the election intervened and that meeting did not take place. However, the proposal was there and it was picked up. It is a proposal that now has to be funded by this government and has to be funded through this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We felt that the Medicare Levy Act was the most equitable way to go in terms of funding for the buyback scheme. As a consequence, we support the proposals taken and pursued in these bills before the parliament today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do intend, as the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) well knows, to ask some questions about the buyback scheme. The extent to which the buyback scheme operates will have implications on what amount of money is needed by the Commonwealth to fund the buyback scheme. Issues such as the breadth of the scheme and when it is to be introduced are all quite relevant to the extent of money that the government needs to raise to fund it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that it is not Senator Short's fault that he is not able to answer some of these questions. Of course, he has to rely on advice <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1921"> from the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and the Minister representing the Attorney-General in respect of this place. I understand that Senator Short is not able to answer questions because advisers of other relevant ministers in respect of this scheme are not forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I will put the questions on notice. I expect an undertaking from Senator Short that answers to the questions that will be placed on notice can be brought before the parliament very quickly. I say `very quickly' because we have so far found that questions we have asked of the Attorney-General have not been responded to as quickly as we would have liked.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996. The bill makes amendments to the Medicare Levy Act 1986 in order to fund the buyback of certain firearms that are soon to be declared illegal in Australia. In general terms, the Australian Democrats are pleased to support this bill. Our only reservation is that the government has decided to use the Medicare levy to raise the money to finance the buyback of guns rather than establish a new and specific levy. We appreciate that it might be administratively easier to increase the Medicare levy, but we are concerned that it could send a mixed message about what the Medicare levy is actually for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said this, the Democrats regard the need for unity in the drive for gun law reform as far more pressing, and so we will be pleased to support the bill. We do, however, ask the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) to explain what will happen to any surplus funds and to assure us that all money raised will be used solely for the purpose of funding compensation for surrendered guns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our support for the buyback scheme has its origins in the Democrats' longstanding support for gun control in Australia. We had become heartily sick of calling for uniform gun control laws every time there was a mass shooting. We did it after Queen Street. We did it after Hoddle Street. We did it again after the Falkner shooting and then once again after the appalling shooting of Mrs Jean Lennon outside the Family Court at Parramatta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We awoke on 29 April to the horrifying pictures that someone had gone on a shooting rampage at Port Arthur with a semi-automatic rifle that he had bought in the local <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trading Post</EMPHASIS>. I turned to the people in my office and said, `What in heaven's name do we do? How many times does this have to occur before <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1922"> politicians in this country have the guts to take on the gun lobby?' To our collective relief, it must be said that the nation finally was ready for its politicians to take action. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for taking that action. With the various premiers, he has managed to cobble together a comprehensive plan that, although far from perfect, has turned out to be the most ambitious gun control proposal ever to come from an Australian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Friday, 10 May 1996, the Council of Australian Police Ministers agreed to prohibit the importation, ownership, sale, resale, transfer, possession, manufacture or use of all military&hyphen;style centre&hyphen;fire rifles including those which substantially duplicate military styles, all other self&hyphen;loading centre&hyphen;fire rifles, all self&hyphen;loading and pump action shotguns and all self&hyphen;loading rim fire rifles. The council also agreed that the importation ban would be effective immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we welcomed this at the time, we also said that in some ways the joint statement did not go far enough. We would prefer that: firstly, gifted, inherited and privately purchased guns go through the licence, permit and registration permit process; secondly, the buyback of guns cover all guns and not just semi-automatics; thirdly, only practising members of genuine gun clubs be licensed to carry firearms and not people who are simply members of sporting shooters associations in terms of being part of a lobby group; and, fourthly, the advertising of guns be banned. However, we are pleased to take what we can get and, for this reason, will wholeheartedly support the Prime Minister's plan and this bill, which is a fundamental part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note with some concern, however, that the agreement seems to be fraying at the edges with both Queensland and New South Wales baulking at some parts of the agreement and with reports that the government is considering making some amendments to the legislation. We will be watching developments very closely and wish to make it quite clear that we have drafted a referendum bill designed to give the Commonwealth the power to pass national gun laws, and if the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> states welsh on their agreement we will proceed with that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mood of the community suggests that any politician who hinders the passage of strong uniform gun laws after Port Arthur will do so at their own political peril. That might counterbalance some of the other threats that politicians are receiving from the pro gun lobby, and I wish to make some comments about the gun lobby.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, it is worth making the distinction between people who use guns for genuine sporting purposes and professional needs and the extremist elements who attempt to pass for gun enthusiasts and who are peddling amongst others the idea that they need guns to defend their freedoms against our democratically elected government. Then there are those who have incited Australia's gun owners to flout the laws of this country and refuse to hand in their arms and, worse, to spill blood in defence of their political views. Then there is the Vice&hyphen;President of the Firearms Owners Association of Australia, Mr Ian McNiven, who, when asked if there was any place for semi-automatic weapons in Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They're great for shooting Indonesian soldiers who come down here and rape young ladies like you.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, there is Mr Ron Owen from Gympie who suggested that the proposed gun laws were a conspiracy between the homosexual lobby and the ABC. I make the suggestion to other otherwise law abiding and respectable gun owners that they should expel these extremists from their midst if they want to maintain any semblance of credibility. They should avoid becoming a haven for rednecks and racists and should dismiss them as such.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote from one of the letters sent to my office&mdash;and, by far, the majority of letters that we receive on this issue are in favour of gun control. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to express our concern that this legislation might be derailed by a small highly vocal minority.</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that this is a very clear expression of what may happen but the Democrats give their assurance to the people of Australia that we will do all we can to prevent this from happening. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1923">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the Democrats welcome the national approach to gun law reform but believe it is disappointing that it has taken the tragedy of Port Arthur to bring it about. We congratulate Mr Howard for the leadership he has shown on this issue and extend our support for the joint statement and resolutions made by the Council of Australian Police Ministers and the subsequent announcement about the proposal to raise money through the levy to finance the buyback of banned firearms. I make once more the point: the gun lobby is powerless while all parties remain united on gun control. For this reason, the Democrats are pleased to support the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

Agreement to this bill will be a vital step in curbing violence in the homes and on the streets of our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a special firearms meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council held on 10 May 1996, it was resolved that all jurisdictions&mdash;that is, all states as well as the Commonwealth&mdash;ban the sale, resale, transfer, ownership, possession and manufacture of certain types of firearms. The firearms have been listed into categories. I will not go into details of the different categories, but categories C and D list the firearms prohibited except under special circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Commonwealth, for its part, has agreed to ban the importation of all semi&hyphen;automatic, self&hyphen;loading and pump action long arms, and all parts including magazines&mdash;such as firearms included in licence category D&mdash;to control the importation of those firearms included in licence category C. A system of national registration was also agreed to, involving the establishment of an integrated licence and firearm registration system. The databases are to be linked through the Nation al Exchange of Police Information to ensure its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While much of the onus for the implementation of these resolutions has fallen on the states because the matter of gun licensing comes within their responsibility, it has been the federal government which has provided the leadership in gaining nationwide agreement. In addition, the federal government has agreed to shoulder the burden of raising the revenue required to enable tighter gun laws to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final resolution at the meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council included provision for the establishment of a common basis for fair and proper compensation. Firearm owners will be compensated for surrendering their weapons to an amount based on the value of each firearm as at March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the Commonwealth, especially John Howard, which has taken responsibility for the funding of this compensation, with the states bearing the cost of administering the buyback scheme. The government sees compensation as vital because it is a fair and an Australian thing to do. Those who have bought and owned weapons legally and in good faith and for honourable reasons should not and will not be treated as criminals. Their weapons will not be confiscated unless they are found to be in breach of the law after the amnesty has concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The value of the firearms will be set by people with appropriate expertise in the field. I understand these values will be set by a national panel to include a government and gun industry representation as well as independent experts. Under this bill, owners who do the right thing will be given fair compensation. Compensation to those who have surrendered their firearms will also be seen as an incentive to people to hand over their weapons. It is not an easy thing to give up weapons that have been treasured. This is clearly understood, and our Prime Minister, Mr Howard himself, has on many occasions expressed his apologies to those who have to suffer the loss of their weapons because of the outrageous actions of a few.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1924">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I myself appreciate the difficulties of those who have had weapons passed on from generation to generation and whose weapons may be a family heirloom, for those who have collections as memorabilia, and for those to whom they have other special significance. Being a gun owner myself for the purposes of pest control on my farm, I fully understand the anxiety facing those who must surrender their guns. The compensation scheme funded by a 0.2 per cent increase in the Medicare levy will provide some incentive for those who have firearms which have become illegal, to surrender them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of this bill follows the announcement by the Prime Minister in his press statement on 14 May that the necessary funds will be raised by an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent for the income year 1996&hyphen;97. It will be a one&hyphen;off levy. It is not a permanent change to the Medicare rate. The entire revenue raised from the extra 0.2 per cent will be used for one purpose only: to compensate people for their firearms. It is estimated that the extra levy will raise approximately $500 million. Any surplus will be returned via the Medicare levy system. No government likes to impose an extra charge on taxpayers. It is with great reluctance that the coalition has taken this measure. However, with the overwhelming number of Australians wanting tighter gun controls, some scheme to implement those tighter measures must be desired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The passage of this bill will enable the compensation to be put into operation. Tasmanians watched in horror as the tragedy of Port Arthur unfolded on their television screens and in their national newspapers. Most Tasmanians believed their home state was isolated from this kind of bizarre behaviour. The peaceful setting of Port Arthur seemed so immune from violence but, on that quiet Sunday afternoon on 28 April, that immunity was absolutely shattered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The support that streamed in from the rest of Australia was wonderful. As a Tasmanian senator, I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Australians for the warmth of the many expressions of sympathy that they have conveyed and for the way in which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have identified themselves so closely with those who have suffered directly from the tragedy. I believe that, through this tragedy, there has been a strengthening of our ties with each other and a strengthening of our national entity. I want to thank my fellow Australians most sincerely for fostering that. I am sure that, as a tangible expression of their sympathy, an overwhelming number of Australians will be prepared to accept this new charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has not taken this step lightly. It brings no joy to extract this extra levy of approximately $1.40 per week from the average Australian worker. Under the circumstances, this is the fairest and most equitable way of allowing tighter gun controls to be implemented. The increase in the Medicare levy for this purpose is the most desirable of several options, in terms of both equity and efficiency. This is endorsed by a recent study by the University of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill puts the same onus on defence personnel, even though they may be exempt from the Medicare levy. I am sure that those people, who are fully aware of the catastrophes that can result from the misuse of weapons, will be prepared to sacrifice to the same extent as their fellow Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A pensioner in north&hyphen;western Tasmania rang her local member of parliament to make her contribution to this fund, so concerned was she that these laws be made effective. She expressed her belief that all pensioners should be prepared to give $1, knowing that this would help to make their lives safer. She put that suggestion to her local member, even though she had little money to spare and was constantly paring her spending. She was concerned about keeping safe in her home and she was prepared to make a sacrifice for that. I think hers is a useful example of the sacrifice that some people in our community are prepared to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his address at St John's Cathedral in Brisbane on 5 June, the Prime Minister made reference to the link between the murder rate and the proliferation of the possession of firearms. In the United States, the murder rate is 14 per 100,000. There, the gun lobby is so powerful that authorities have been too <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1925"> frightened to restrict or curtail the use of firearms. The gun lobby has intimidated both Democrat and Republican politicians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, the murder rate in England and Wales is about one per 100,000. In England and Wales, firearms are far less widespread&mdash;less widespread than in Australia, and far scarcer than in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, our murder rate is approximately two per 100,000. While that is nowhere near as high as that of the United States, we can do better. We will do better, by taking the measures agreed to by the police ministers on 10 May. If we do not, we will be headed for the murder rates experienced in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wholeheartedly endorse this bill. I commend it to honourable senators as a vital instrument for making Australia a safer and happier place in which to live.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation deals with the issue of financing the government's decision to buy back guns. It does not relate specifically to the buyback, but it is an integral part of the whole buyback proposal. The proceeds from the levy will be used entirely for the buyback operation, to respond to Senator Spindler's point. As the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, the bills will raise the necessary funds to reimburse states and territories for the direct costs of payments that they will have made to relevant gun owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I can assure Senator Spindler, and Senator Bolkus who I think also raised the question&mdash;at least it is pertinent to the questions he will be raising on the buyback scheme&mdash;that any surplus that may occur or accrue as a result of the Medicare levy over the additional levy of 0.2 per cent will be returned to taxpayers through the Medicare levy system. The question of whether there will be any surplus funds left at the end is a matter that cannot be specifically determined <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at this time, but if there is any surplus, it will be returned through the Medicare levy system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus is leaving until the committee stage specific questions in relation to the buyback scheme.

This is specifically a tax bill. The officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's office and department are very heavily engaged in many of the other details relating to the buyback scheme as a whole and I know that the Attorney&hyphen;General is sorry, as am I, that he is not able to provide an adviser today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I can take it one step further, what we are concerned about from this side of parliament is that the agreements have been reached. We do anticipate more legislation or regulation to come in on a national level to cover the issues of importation of guns, the mail order purchasing of guns, and so on. The timing of the introduction of the regulations to ban the import of weapons that are currently being imported obviously is important in terms of the number of weapons that will be in society. So you can take on notice to the Attorney&hyphen;General the questions of when we should expect legislation or regulation to control the import of the weapons that are now to be banned for import and what other objectives the government intends to control in that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

As they come in, the magnitude of the buyback scheme will be affected. So I place on notice an inquiry about when that legislation or regulation is to be brought into the parliament. Also, Senator Short, the day of oper ation of this act will obviously be linked to the date of implementation of the scheme.

The first question is: when do we anticipate those laws will be in place&mdash;when is the scheme actually going to start? I would like you to take that on notice if you could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another question I would like you to take on notice with respect to those laws.

That is going to be important because we are paying from the federal level for a buyback scheme and we need to ensure that it is consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of the buyback scheme is going to be who actually monitors the administration of the scheme. Is there going to be federal government involvement in the monitoring of the buyback scheme? Is it just going to be run by the states? Exemptions will be given. Who will monitor what guns will be exempt from the ban and, as a consequence, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1927"> what guns will be bought back?

As Senator Spindler said as well, we are concerned that the agreement may be a bit more fluid now than it might have been and, as you say, all these questions are still being discussed between the Commonwealth Attorney and the states. Obviously, the ambit of guns that will be bought back will depend on the exemptions, for instance. What I was going to do today was refer you to all the newspapers and ask about the situation, which I think was reflected very well in a couple of paragraphs in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  this morning, where, unfortunately, it stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queensland maintains that it is not breaking away from the police ministers' resolutions, saying its plans to allow farmers access to the high&hyphen;powered centrefire rifles&mdash;Category D weapons&mdash;was `totally consistent' with the spirit of the resolutions.</PARA>

<PARA>It is going to be important, in terms of the buyback scheme, to know which interpretation of the agreement the government is going to settle on. Is it going to settle on the Queensland government's interpretation, or is it going to settle on the interpretation that the Prime Minister has quite strenuously been putting over recent weeks&mdash;an interpretation which the opposition is fully in support of? As I say, Senator Short, the range of guns to be bought back depends on that interpretation. Can you give us an assurance, for instance, that it will be the Prime Minister's interpretation, when he said on Tuesday that any suggestion that people could have the centre&hyphen;fire semi&hyphen;automatic rifle would be clearly outside the agreement?

There has been some suggestion, for instance, in respect of farmers who may have used a weapon as part of their income producing capacity, that such a weapon would now have a written&hyphen;down value for tax purposes. Would they be paid the written&hyphen;down value of the weapon, or would they be paid the actual current market value of the weapon?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, the cost of the scheme that we are endorsing today depends very much on the individual, case by case assessment and the answers to these questions. Do you have any information for us? We would appreciate it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chair, it seems to me that the questions that Senator Bolkus is asking&mdash;important though they be&mdash;have no relevance whatsoever to the two bills that are the subject of this debate. These bills relate to the raising of a levy additional to the existing Medicare levy of 1.5 per cent. We are putting the levy up, as a one&hyphen;off, to 1.7 per cent. That is quite specific. Again, I will take those questions on notice; but, if there <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1929"> are a large number of questions being put in committee in relation to bills or matters that are not before the chair, then I seek your guidance on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>

The concern that Senator Short is raising with you is consistent with what I found to be a breathtaking assertion&mdash;I thought it was astonishing&mdash;which he made a few moments ago in response to some very relevant questions from Senator Bolkus. This bill is for a levy to raise money on a per capita basis for a specific purpose. At the end of the day, as Senator Short knows very well, the individual financial impact on individual taxpayers, as Senator Bolkus has quite correctly said, absolutely depends on the questions that are being put by Senator Bolkus to Senator Short. Indeed, I want to ask a few myself in a minute. They are absolutely crucial. I do not know how many phone calls Senator Short is getting, but I am getting phone calls from strong supporters of this legislation who do want to know, at the end of the day, what it is going to cost. For Senator Short to assert that the end per capita cost is not relevant to these bills is breathtaking, especially coming from the Assistant Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just the other day, the Prime Minister asserted that the crimping and modification of firearms to make them circumvent the ban was something that was not acceptable to him, because the crimping was reversible. However, the government has a committee which has asserted the contrary. Could you make available to the Senate the advice on which the Prime Minister has made his assessment? I do not know whether I can ask for advice which a party committee has before it, but I can ask for and expect advice that the Prime Minister might have had before him in terms of making his assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important issue, because to the extent that the Prime Minister's position is sustainable&mdash;once again, we hope it is, and we support him in his assertion&mdash;it is very important for the community to know what advice the Prime Minister is acting on here.

<TIME.STAMP>(1.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question I have for the Assistant Treasurer is consistent with the questions that Senator Bolkus has been asking. I press the issue because of my dissatisfaction and astonishment with the assertion by the Assistant Treasurer, with respect to this specific levy that will be a per capita financial impost on every taxpayer in Australia, that the question of how much it is going to be at the end of the day is not relevant to the raising of the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept in good faith the answers that Senator Short has given, in terms of the detail that cannot be worked out. However, the government, using all of the resources available to it, and they are significant&mdash;the police forces, the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and so on&mdash;has estimated a ballpark figure, a very important figure, of $500 million. The current public debate is being conducted on the basis that this is going to end up with a per capita obligation by every taxpayer of about $70 a year. I think I am correct about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no question that, in order to assess it properly, everyone in the community&mdash;this is the issue of the moment&mdash;has to at least have some idea of what the cost will be. Figures have been flying around everywhere. I heard, only this morning, in respect of New South Wales, that&mdash;Senator Short would be aware of this and Senator Bolkus referred to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the reports&mdash;there has apparently been a decision taken by the New South Wales government to bring back the legislation after six weeks of community consultation for any potential amendments there may be to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In a report on that issue this morning, I heard it said, and I do not know how valid this is, that if all of the guns that have to be handed in are handed in&mdash;and obviously that has to be the government's intent and ours, I might add, as that could be the only assumption the government can work on in terms of costing it&mdash;then the cost in New South Wales alone could be in excess of $1 billion. In any case, other figures have been thrown about that put the sum, nationally, well in excess of $1 billion. In other words, double the government's estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I understand the difficulties the government has in being precise about this but it is an important question, as Senator Short well knows. There might be a dispute about the odd $100 million but the government has information before it which, as Senator Bolkus rightly points out, we have not seen. Therefore, on the basis of that information, is Senator Short, on behalf of the government, able to reject the assertions that this could be double the cost, per capita?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, I will refer that. As I have intimated in response to the other questions and, as Senator Collins rightly accepts, these matters fall into other portfolios. Senator Collins, I repeat that a figure of $70 per year is the estimated cost to someone on average weekly earnings. Some people will be paying less; some will be paying more. On average weekly earnings, $70 is about $1.40 a week. Senator Collins, I repeat, as the Prime Minister Mr Howard has said, the estimate is that the increase in the levy will raise around $500 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a one&hyphen;off increase of 0.2 per cent in the levy. When the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996 are enacted, they will raise the necessary funds to reimburse states and territories for the direct cost of payments made to relevant gun owners. As has been accepted from day one, it is very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1931"> difficult to get an accurate fix on the final cost. These are best estimates; I am sure he understands that. I will refer Senator Collins's questions for further information.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad Senator Short used the phrase `one&hyphen;off' because that is what preoccupies me. I might add that this has had an impact on the electorate. As I am sure is the case with other senators and members, I have had many inquiries which I have answered personally, as I am now in the position where I have to do a lot of that myself; previously I did not have to do that. This is now one of the upsides of my job. I know Senator Short is aware of these inquiries. A lot of them come from people on not very high incomes who are supporters of these proposals and who have a preoccupation with the uncertainty surrounding the cost they will get stuck with in relation to this proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The expression `one&hyphen;off' is consistently used by the government: this is a one&hyphen;off increase in the levy to raise $500 million. Senator Short did not answer the question: is the government confident&mdash;on the advice currently available to it as a guesstimate&mdash;to reject the suggestion that it could be twice or even three times the estimate? Senator Short states that this is a one&hyphen;off to raise $500 million. There is a necessity for equitable compensation&mdash;and might I say that I personally insist on that. If people's private property is compulsorily acquired when they do not want to give it, they are entitled to fair compensation not to niggly compensation. That is important. At the end of the day, if it is a billion dollars, Senator Short, and if this is a one&hyphen;off to raise $500 million, and an additional $500 million, $700 million or $800 million is needed, how does the government intend to raise that additional revenue?</PARA></SPEECH>

Let me tell you, if you are not aware of it, Senator Short, that that is a matter of very live interest to the people who are going to have to pay this at the end of the day.

This one last question, which is relevant only because of an assertion that has been made&mdash;from memory, it was not a from a state but from the Northern Territory&mdash;concerns something that I need clarification on. One of the things that is very relevant to this debate is public safety. Just a few weeks ago we had a bad shooting incident in Palmerston, in the Northern Territory. It was a multiple shooting. Someone went berserk with a shotgun and, very regrettably, wounded a number of very courageous police officers and some private citizens as well, in a one&hyphen;night spree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This happened only a week ago in Darwin. The gun, as I understand it, was stolen from a private house. One of the things that gun owners have put to me consistently, and the clubs have done for years, is something they have asked the police to do: to actually provide resources&mdash;and, let me tell you, this would be an enormous contribution to public safety&mdash;for a minimum standard of security to be provided as a condition for anyone getting a firearm licence. It could be something as cheap as putting hard wire with a lock through the gun, or some other minimum requirement for security, and someone would have to go and check that out.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Migration Act 1958 to clarify the rights of certain people who are in immigration detention because they have entered or tried to enter Australia unlawfully.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are not Australian citizens or the holders of current visas are not entitled to be at liberty in Australia. Section 189 of the Migration Act requires the detention of a non-citizen who does not hold a visa, and section 198 requires that such a person be removed from Australia as soon as is reasonably practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus is on unlawful non-citizens who arrive without a visa to advise officials as to why they have come to Australia and if they wish to seek legal advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 256 of the Migration Act makes provision for access to legal advice by persons in immigration detention but only where the persons in immigration detention request legal advice. This approach is clearly intended by the Migration Act, and has been upheld by the courts in a number of recent cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, in March of this year the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in Victoria sought access to those on a then recently arrived boat ("the Teal") to provide legal advice. This request was refused as no such advice had been sought by the people on "the Teal". RACS complained to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which then sought to have delivered to the captain, crew and passengers of "the Teal" a confidential letter, in reliance on its powers under paragraph 20(6)(b) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. The effect of this action would have been to ensure access to legal advice, despite the fact that none was requested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, the Department refused to deliver the letter and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission took action in the Federal Court. On 7 June the Federal Court ruled in Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission &amp; Anor v Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, that the letter should be delivered, but agreed to a stay of 14 days of that order pending a decision by the Commonwealth whether to appeal. The effect of this case is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Act 1986 can be used to override the intention of the Migration Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Federal Court's ruling RACS has sought access to all recently arrived boat people. In other words, RACS is engaged in a direct attack on the fundamental underpinnings of our capacity to manage effectively the boat people issue. This requires that boat people have their claims processed as expeditiously as possible. The approach adopted by RACS will encourage boat people to engage in unwarranted, lengthy and expensive processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since November 1994 almost 1 300 boat people have arrived from the People's Republic of China, including over 500 this year. Over the past year almost 1 100 repatriations to China have been effected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain interest groups have always argued that all unlawful non-citizens should, on arrival in Australia, be granted immediate access to legal advice. Such an approach would, however, have the effect of ensuring that all unlawful non-citizens, regardless of their reason for coming to Australia, would invoke lengthy and expensive processing. For instance, the legal action taken last year to prevent the repatriation of the people on the "Albatross" took over 12 months to resolve, resulting in additional detention costs of more than 2 million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed bill will ensure that parliament's intention in relation to the management of unauthorised arrivals in immigration detention, as reflected by s.256 of the Migration Act, is not able to be subverted through the use of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Ombudsman Act 1976 contains a similar provision (paragraph 7(3)(b)) to that in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 and could also be utilised to undermine the intention of section 256 of the Migration Act, it is proposed that the amendments also cover this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed bill will also clarify the duties of the minister and officials in relation to the provision of application forms, to advise of the ability to apply for a visa, to provide an opportunity to apply for a visa or to allow access to legal or other advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is to commence on 19 June 1996, which is the date of the press statement on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Boswell, who has a vital interest in the rural community in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1936"> I remember Senator Collins, who interjected on Senator Boswell, saying during the election that Australian farmers would be opposed to the sale of Telstra. So, Senator Collins, you should read this NFF press release as well. So too, particularly, should the Australian Demo crats, who have said constantly that one of their prime objections to the sale of one third of Telstra is that it could detrimentally affect service to Australia's rural community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This survey demonstrates that the rural community is on side. They believe that they could get a better service from a partially privatised Telstra. Moreover&mdash;if only Senator Kernot were here today&mdash;they also recognise the importance of reinvesting $1 billion in Australia's natural capital. That is not surprising. What is of great regret is that the opposition parties in this place&mdash;the Democrats, the Greens and the ALP&mdash;will not listen to their constituency at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Farmers Federation conducted a survey of 1,325 farmers participating in the farm&hyphen;wide on&hyphen;line pilot project.

Aren't you aware of the fact that ATSIC, on many occasions over the years, as a result of those investigations, has frozen or put conditions on grants, something you said in your answer could not be done; you described that as a constraint? Is it true that you could have issued the same general directions to the Office of Evaluation and Audit&mdash;that has been doing excellent job, I might add&mdash;to give it, and not the special auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, the power to directly stop grants?

Since then, labour costs have blown out by about $100,000 a week&mdash;in other words, almost $1 billion to date&mdash;because of the determination of the MUA to rort the system by working overtime wherever possible, by ensuring that work was not done during normal shift time&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to container rates, before this scheme was introduced, they were averaging about 17 containers per hour. Now what you have in New South Wales is a rate of 14.4 an hour; in Queensland, 15.7. So it is little wonder that the Bureau of Industry Economics now rates Australia's crane rates as 25 to 30 per cent lower than the far better performing European ports. Do not trot out the usual furphy about the equipment being old and out of date, because it simply is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this is a direct reflection on Australia's international competitiveness. Our trading performance is a function of the extent to which the other side of this chamber has been complicit in allowing these rorts to occur. Why do you think that is? I will tell you why it is. There are 30 of them over there&mdash;15 of them have trade union backgrounds, six of them are former parliamentary party secretaries and another four worked for ministerial staff. The combination of party functionaries, union hacks and parliamentary hangers-on means that almost 85 per cent of Labor have never had any experience of the private sector, so is it any wonder that they are totally unsympathetic to attempts by employers to try to lift levels of productivity to try to increase Australia's export competitiveness. Absolutely not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their strategy is, of course, contemptuous&mdash;not interested in the facts, not interested in trying to improve the waterfront, not interested in Australia's international trading reputation. That is the real scandal. If we did have a constructive opposition who were interested in lifting the game, then of course they would be prepared to tackle this issue. But they cannot. They are simply in the pockets of the unions for whom they work, to whom they report, of whom they are never prepared to be critical.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume for a very important question indeed. Yesterday, as Senator Baume said, Senator Faulkner, the failed former minister for the environment, alleged that I had misled the Senate when I said in this place on 17 June that the Treasurer's first announcement about sales tax on Commonwealth, state, territory and local government vehicles, which was made on 11 June, was an offer made to the states. He said that I misled the Senate. It was not me; it was Senator Faulkner who misled the Senate on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Faulkner had taken the time or if he had the wit to read all of the Treasurer's statement of 11 June and the accompanying transcript of his press conference, which was an integral part of it, he would have seen that the Treasurer said, first of all in the press statement, which Senator Faulkner misquoted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has taken this decision in the context of the Premiers' Conference and Council of Australian Governments meeting later this week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to remove sales tax exemptions is an integral part of the Commonwealth's offer document sent to the States and Territories today. Removal of the sales tax exemptions is a condition of the Commonwealth's general offer on financial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1944"> assistance grants. The Commonwealth will seek agreement to the offer as a whole at the Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA>In his press conference at the same time as releasing the announcement, the Treasurer elaborated still further on that. He repeated that the sales tax decision was an integral part of the offer to the states and territories. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That offer is an offer to maintain the real per capita guarantee to the states. It is, however, conditional on an acceptance of susceptibility of state governments to the wholesale sales tax. It is a conditional offer. Let me make it clear that if it were not for the application of the wholesale sales tax or, being more precise, the withdrawal of the exemption in relation to wholesale sales tax, the Commonwealth would not be in a position to make the real per capita guarantee it has made in relation to financial assistance grants.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make it entirely clear that the real per capita guarantee could only be offered on the basis that the unfair exemption is removed.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the states put to us that they would prefer the unfair exemption to remain and give away the real per capita guarantee, we will entertain that proposal from them.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely a black and white case, if ever there was one, of Senator Faulkner having misled the Senate again on a very important matter, just as he did in his former role as environment minister in the Keating government when he narrowly escaped censure in this place for gross incompetence of his ministerial responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolutely clear that my statement in the Senate on 17 June was totally correct.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Act is of course governed by the limits of Commonwealth jurisdiction. `Agent' includes servants of the Crown and employees of corporations, but the Act only reaches corporations which are engaged in interstate or international trade and is rarely used in that sphere.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate (Senator Boswell) today, relating to the proposed partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>No self-respecting, public&hyphen;opinion polling company would put their name to this shonky poll. Let us firstly look at the sampling. What do we find? There were 860 participants on the farm-wide, on-line pilot project. That is no random sample. That is a very selective group of farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us secondly look at the loaded questions. Question No. 1: do you think the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1952"> telecommunications you get at present from Telstra could be improved? Yes, said 79.3 per cent. Question No. 2, which was connected, of course: so, do you think the partial privatisation of Telstra will improve telecommunications services? Yes, said only 41.62 per cent; no and unsure, said 58.25 per cent. This was not dwelled upon in the national farmers press release which went with it&mdash;even after that first loaded question. Question No. 3: do you think the use of $1 billion from the partial privatisation of Telstra is a good idea? What a surprise! Yes, said 73 per cent. What loaded, linked questions are these, when they start with `Do you think that the partial sale of Telstra&mdash;'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that this calls into question&mdash;yet again&mdash;the independence of the National Farmers Federation.

It was purported to involve 400 under&hyphen;35-year-old undecided voters. Guess what question No. 1 was&mdash;do you support or oppose a major increase of expenditure on the environment in Australia? That is a nice little general leading question. How many people are going to say no? Only seven per cent said no. How many said yes? It was 86 per cent. What a big surprise!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second question: do you support or oppose&mdash;this is totally linked&mdash;the coalition's plans to use $1 billion for the Telstra fund? Yes, said 55 per cent; 40 per cent opposed. No other options were proposed, like, `Do you think the government has a responsibility to fund it from the core budget?' or `Do you think that there are other ways to fund the environment?' They were not asked at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast this kind of shonky methodology with the work of Mr Hugh Mackay. These were not totally selective, quantitative measurements but it was longitudinal, qualitative work. It was taking the time to ask in detail what people think. As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 8 and 9 June, this is what he found Australians think:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Government seems unwilling to face it, the reality is that the electorate voted in a deliberate way in the March election. Voters supported the Coalition handsomely in the House of Representatives and, in votes cast for the Senate by the very same people on the very same day, they gave similarly handsome support to the non-Coalition parties.</PARA>
<PARA>So, how strongly is the community opposed to the privatisation of Telstra, and why? The answer is that opposition to the sale of Telstra is about as strong as the community's support for tougher gun laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is suitably impressed by the great weight of public opinion behind his initiatives on that question. Perhaps he will also come to respect the depth of support for the position of Labor plus the Democrats on Telstra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it deserves to be rubbished, in your opinion, because it does not come up with the answers that you want. Some 870 farmers have answered very simple questions such as: do you think the telecommunications you get at present from Telstra should be improved? I could say that many millions of Australians would say that the support they get from Telstra is questionable. The answer is yes. What is more plain than that? About 70 per cent of the people believe that the service can be improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take the last question: do you think that a partial sale of Telstra is a good idea? Some 66.40 per cent of farmers believe that they want Telstra to be partially privatised. Why do they want it? It is clear to them that they will benefit from the partial sale of Telstra. They will get $1 billion spent on the environment. They are aware of the desperate need to improve the environment as far as primary industry is concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, if Senator Kernot was prepared to put the boot in, so to speak, she could not question anyone then coming back and answering her. There are a couple more points I would like to make, and the first related to river care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rivers are full of saline. Another $30 million was going to improve the river systems of Australia. We need clean water. We need clean water for the animals and for the crops. Australian farmers are going to be deprived of that $30 million. The Murray-Darling system is falling to pieces. Anyone with the slightest idea of the need to improve the Murray-Darling system would be only too pleased to support the use of $100 million to improve the Murray-Darling system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you can understand why the farmers have overwhelmingly supported the partial sale of Telstra. They were very surprised that the support they thought they would get from the Democrats was not forthcoming. They believed that the Democrats were genuinely interested in the environment. Senator Kernot and her merry bunch of Democrats over there are on a hide into nothing on this one. They painted themselves into a corner. They cannot retreat. They want it to go away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time this issue is raised, Senator Kernot's constituency scratches its head and says, `I voted for the Democrats to support <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1954"> the environment. Why are we being shunted off in other areas? Why can't Senator Kernot, who said she was committed to the environment, support the sale of Telstra so $1 billion can be spent on improving the environment of Australia?' Senator Kernot, you are sending out a double message that really has your constituency in doubt. I know that this embarrasses you.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how many senators would have seen the episode of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>  where Sir Humphrey Appleby showed Bernard how to design a questionnaire to get the desired result. That is exactly the kind of questionnaire we have before us. It is extremely shonky. It is not a random survey to start with, Senator Boswell. If you want to do a survey which is going to provide you with a result that can be trusted, the first rule is that it must be a random survey, not a survey of a particular group of farmers&mdash;the rich farmers who in fact have an ISDN capacity. They are the farmers who were surveyed in this case. I can assure you that the majority of farmers do not have that facility in their homes, but the ones the NFF surveyed did have on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do not want to attack the NFF because we have given it a bit of a hiding on this issue. I hope Senator Bob Collins is listening because I have an account to settle with him later. It is a big debate about how many farmers peak bodies actually represent. The PGA in Western Australia has estimated, for example, that the Wool Council&mdash;and it has had this checked&mdash;represents about 40 per cent of wool growers. How many farmers does the NFF represent? That is a pretty fair question, if that is what you are going to put up in your argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue which Senator Boswell raised was the fact that he took the last question as giving the strongest result. It certainly does. Again, it comes in a series of questions. Anybody knows that when you ask questions in that kind of order you predetermine that the final question will be the one that you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> really want to read. The second question, however, is very significant: do you think the partial privatisation of Telstra will improve telecommunication services? Only 41.62 per cent answered that question and, as Senator Kernot said, 58 per cent of respondents really did not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you something else. We ran this questionnaire past the Democrats' party room. To question No. 1, `Do you think the telecommunications you get at present from Telstra could be improved?', not 70 per cent but 100 per cent of Democrats responded that telecommunications services could be improved. That is how skewed your questionnaire is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell, I really believe that you should be looking after your rural constituency. It is dangerous for you to be used as a pawn by the Liberal Party to ask their questions so that they can give the dorothy dix answers that they want you and others to believe. The problem for the National Party is that the Liberal Party is giving them a hiding. You should not be part of that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, you have come back. The survey conducted over 2,000 interviews and showed that a majority of Australians now favour the sale of Telstra. Support has gone up 10 per cent since the election. That is not surprising. This matter has the same history as the sale of any public asset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people are unfamiliar with an issue and are asked whether they support it, they give a very cautious response. Generally, they say no. That changes the more they become familiar with the benefits that can flow from the privatisation of the asset. In this instance, the benefits include having a telecommunications company that is genuinely internationally competitive and consumers paying lower prices for calls&mdash;as happened with the privatisation of British Telecom. The more that people focus on the public benefits that flow from resources being freed up by the sale of the asset, the more in favour they are of the sale. That is exactly what is happening with this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The more the community starts to focus on the benefits that can flow from the sale&mdash;the benefits to Telstra and its services; the benefit of the repayment of public debt which will take pressure off interest rates, help small businesses to prosper and to employ more Australians; and the benefit of a $1 million investment in our natural capital&mdash;the more it will support the sale. The graph is up; already a majority of Australians are now in favour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in question time, I do not understand why the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party will not listen to the people on this issue. Senator Kernot had a number of arguments against the sale. She started off by saying that the Democrats were opposed to it because it would result in higher charges, and she used British Telecom as an example. That argument was demonstrated to be false; she was wrong. She then said the sale would harm rural people. Now rural people have said that they are in favour of the sale, so she has lost that argument as well. The pattern has continued and she is left with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no other basis for her argument than ideology, which is where she started.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens and the Democrats have always been opposed to any sale of a public asset no matter what the case for the sale might be. Such are the ideological blinkers in which they operate and always have. At least they are more honest in that regard than the ALP. They say that they are opposed but they were prepared to sell Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, and we all know that had they been re&hyphen;elected they would have sold Telstra in a flash. Their argument is simply one of political convenience because they want to take an opposite position from the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the Greens and the Democrats it is pure ideology. But with their ideological blinkers on, the losers are the economy&mdash;therefore all of us&mdash;and our natural heritage. Never before has there been a chance to invest so much capital in our environment. Never before has the need for that investment been as great.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not too late, Senator Margetts&mdash;if you are going to contribute to this debate&mdash;for you to recognise that you have a chance to come on board and be part of this exciting project: to put all this money into revegetation, into improving our coasts, our seas and our river systems, and into an extended conservation reserve system, things which your supporters would wholeheartedly applaud.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are obviously a few issues I would like to add to today's debate. First of all, what we seem to have presented to us today is an implication that Commonwealth taxpayers&mdash;that is, everybody in Australia who pays tax&mdash;should be left to pay for poor state land use and planning decisions. To give an example, in Western Australia there is currently a massive increase in requests by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1956"> primary producers for land clearance. We are looking at something like 22,000 hectares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not see a change in the decisions made to reduce greenhouse sinks, to decrease the quality of water and to add to the eutrophication of our river systems and we do not ever get to the point of making the changes that will work on the community changing their land use patterns, there are only so many ways we can bleed taxpayers to pay for those mistakes. We cannot continue to assume that we can come in here and find some magic pudding that will fix up the mistakes of the states without ever looking at how we have made those mistakes in the first place and how we can turn around the situation and stop this from happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a lot of very strange statements about the Greens' position in relation to Telstra, but one of the issues that has not come out very clearly is that there are huge problems in the Telstra bill in relation to the environment. Basically, the greater level of privatisation there is in telecommunications, the less control there is of governments or any other bodies in relation to the environmental standards of the telecommunications system, whether it be in provision of telephones or other telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are currently getting shocking reports from communities who are racking their brains in fighting decisions on towers and cables because their habitat is being destroyed in order to put up cables and towers, people's amenities, and if there are local concerns about people's proximity to technology which may cause health problems because of rays and so on, we as a Senate should know how difficult it would ever be to address those problems once we have gone down the road of closing off any direct parliamentary input into the standards by which telecommunications carriers operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently there are problems&mdash;and you cannot put the argument that there are problems now so how would it be any worse if we privatised Telstra. To begin with, we have an opportunity to try to redress the environmental problems that exist in the current telecommunications operation and no effort has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made to do that. It will not happen if we go ahead with privatising Telstra even a little on the assumption that we can pull back and impose state and federal laws on those carriers which do not exist now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who thinks that will be possible has not looked at the history of trying to reimpose rules and regulations on a privatised firm once they have got into contracts and once there is a reasonable expectation from the people lining up to buy it&mdash;in this case, a telecommunications network&mdash;that they will be subject to the same kinds of rules and regulations or lack thereof that exist now. If that is not clearly delineated before any process takes place, what on earth do you think will happen further to the Australian environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard already from community groups right around Australia that they are concerned not only about fights for two lines of cables but about multitudinal fights for multitudinal lines that will occur if we do not address these kinds of problems before we take any other step. Whatever the Greens believe about the step of privatisation, you have no credibility talking about our credibility on the environment till you even acknowledge that those problems exist even within the Telstra legislation.</PARA></ANSWER>

They of course refer to what Telstra's environmental credentials are and whether they will improve or go backwards under a partial privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My strong belief&mdash;Senator Margetts may have this belief as well, if she is anything like me and probably many other members and senators around this building&mdash;is that, in relation to trying to have the people's voice heard through the parliamentary process this year and in past years on issues such as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1957"> Telstra towers and other actions by Telstra relating to environmental matters, the situation could not get any worse. Trying to control Telstra through these parliamentary processes is a failure.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are seeking to change it, Senator Margetts, by seeing that Telstra becomes more efficient and more responsive to the community and shareholders through partial privatisation. One of the problems we have with Telstra that seem to have alluded a number of commentators&mdash;I say to the lady from the AAP sitting in the press gallery that I would really love someone to write a story about this&mdash;is that Telstra is a large and inefficient organisation owned by the public sector. On all of the international criteria for measuring the performance and efficiency of Telstra as an organisation, economically and environmentally it does not come up to the mark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest we look at whether the environment will benefit from the sale of Telstra. Ignoring all the benefits from the Natural Heritage Trust, which the Greens have said they support but want to fund by either higher taxes or more debt&mdash;we want to fund it by equity already there&mdash;we should look at Telstra as an operation. It employs too many to provide the service it does. By international comparisons, it occupies far too much office space for the amount of service it provides and it provides many of the services to people more expensively than required, so it creates economic and environmental waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great benefits of the partial privatisation of Telstra&mdash;and this has quite clearly become apparent to the farmers who were surveyed in the National Farmers Federation survey&mdash;is that consumers of Telstra's services will get economic benefits. There will be cheaper phone calls and better services for rural customers, which is clearly recognised by these farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that, yes, it was a narrow based survey, but it is a very important message to the Australian Democrats and the Greens. They are saying that they are the farmers' friends and they want to keep Telstra <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in public ownership. What they are saying is, `Fund the environment package by putting taxes up or increasing borrowing'&mdash;therefore, putting up interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The farmers know that does not work. They have had 13 years of that response. They have had the Democrats' approach of paying for environmental rehabilitation by putting up taxes and putting up interest rates, but the farmers have said that they do not like that. They like the idea of having a more efficient Telstra. They like the idea of having lower phone calls. They like the idea of having better services. They love the idea of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on revegetation initiatives, river care initiatives and fixing up salinity in places like the Murray-Darling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a win, win, win for the farmers and it is a lose, lose, lose for the Democrats. They have gone way out in front of this debate. They have not listened to the people. These are the Democrats who are meant to go out and run polls and have participatory democracy. When every single poll comes out and says, `We want Telstra sold partially. We want $1.15 billion for the environment,' the Democrats say, `No. That is no good.' It does not matter whether Gary Morgan does the poll or Mr Saulwick does the poll or the National Farmers Federation does the poll. Unless Senator Kernot does the poll, it is not good enough. They would rather ignore it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do ask senators to look at the intrinsic environmental benefits of having an efficient telecommunications company that is not wasting money on office space it does not need and that is not burning up energy and power and creating greenhouse gases. Look at the benefits of its being responsive both to its shareholders and to the Australian public with regard to their very genuine concerns about things such as the placement of towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you fly across the Nullarbor, Telstra dug a great gash through the middle of Australia when it put its optic fibre cable down. The consumers were very concerned about that. It was right past your back paddock, Senator Panizza. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the documents required under the notion of motion which was passed this morning and, in doing so, make a brief statement. I advise the Senate that I consider that the documents provide answers to all of the questions which were asked by Senators Chamarette and Margetts. However, some of the information is not as comprehensive as I would have liked, and that is due to the quite unreasonable time constraints that were placed on us and on departments to provide the material requested. It is clear that some departments were unable to respond in full detail to the questions within the time frame available. Nevertheless, I have provided as much information that is as comprehensive as possible on the basis of the time available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will see, Madam Deputy President, that the information is substantial&mdash;it totals more than 65 pages. Much of the information itself required collation by individual departments of details which were not otherwise available in that form, so it has been a very resource intensive exercise to get these answers together. I hope that the Senate, in particular Senators Chamarette and Margetts, appreciate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it has been very resource intensive and, therefore, a very costly exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Finance was then involved in collating the information from across departments, as I explained to Senators Margetts and Chamarette on numerous other occasions, and that is a very difficult coordinating task in itself. Not only has that been a very difficult task but it has been a substantial task. It has involved officials working right through the night to prepare the information for today. In the light of this, I hope that Senator Margetts is prepared to concede that her request has been unreasonable, given the detail and substance of the answers provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether you heard this, Senator Margetts, but to get this information to you today the officers of departments were required to work right through the night to do so. I would say that, given the time constraints, there may be some lack of full satisfaction with the detail provided by particular departments. It is, of course, open to senators to ask for additional or clarifying information. Unfortunately, given the constraints imposed, this may be necessary in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by putting on the record that in matters such as this the government wants to cooperate wherever it is proper and reasonable to do so in providing documents in a timely fashion. Such an approach is consistent with the government's very strong commitment to open and accountable government. That said, however, I think it is far better to allow sufficient time for information to be gathered so that what is provided to this place is both as comprehensive and as clear as possible to the provider and to those to whom it is being provided&mdash;in this case the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am appalled that the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short) should get up and say that my request, or the request of Senator Chamarette and me, was unreasonable. It was clearly stated from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  that the offer was made and reinforced several times by the government. It was not an unreasonable request from the Greens; it was an assurance from the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can bash themselves on this issue all they like, but that is the reality. I am absolutely flabbergasted that Senator Short is suggesting we should apologise for accepting their offer. Does this mean we should apologise for ever believing an offer that is made to us in the future? How disgraceful! Is that what you are saying&mdash;that whatever you suggest in the future in relation to such offers we should automatically consider is unreasonable and unobtainable and that, therefore, it is unreasonable and unfair of us to expect you to meet your offer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The apology should be coming from the government. You should be giving some explanation as to how the situation that the departments do not know what the ministers are deciding is being resolved. Why is it that it is taking your department so long to work out what the ministerial decisions are? A lot of the time I expect it is because they do not know. They had to find out what it was that was being said in their departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had statements from ministers that there are no cuts; there are no staff losses. But we are hearing from departments that they are all leaving with their redundancy packages because they have been asked to put their hands up to go. If that is what is happening, if when direct questions are being answered by, `There is nothing happening in this department,' it is not surprising that the departments are taking a long time to come up with the answer to the question of what is happening in their departments. A lot of them do not know yet. A lot of them have not been told by their own ministers what is happening. This is disgraceful!

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This Auditor's report could not have come at a worse time for the government in so far as it indicates to one and all just how important ESRA is&mdash;ESRA being the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. ESRA was established some two years ago as part of the Working Nation package. The Working Nation package has seen expenditure in this year of some $2.3 billion and over the life of the program considerably more&mdash;some $9 billion dollars in total.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen through the Working Nation package is quite substantial real improvements in the levels of job opportunities, particularly for those who are long-term unemployed. In the last few years the figures that I have at my disposal&mdash;up to August 1995&mdash;show that long-term unemployment fell by some 23.2 per cent or 231,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, any figure like that is unacceptable, but the fact that the level of long-term unemployment fell by that figure suggests to me that substantial achievements have been made. Working Nation programs were aimed at providing access to job placements through the job compact, at providing access to labour market places for those who fall outside the job compact and at providing individual assessments and early assistance to reduce the risk of long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole model of case management, which stands at the core of the operations of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, is an innovative approach which we have not seen in many places throughout the world. It provided an opportunity for individual attention to be paid to people in our society who have become long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my judgment, it also allows an opportunity for state to become directly involved in fulfilling its responsibilities to ensure that there is the lowest possible level of unemployment in the country as a whole. One of the most important roles that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Youth Affairs could have would be to prevent and to reduce the levels of long-term unemployment in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ESRA was one part of a package of measures that went to Nettforce, that went to government programs, that went to a whole range of issues to do with the training agenda. These measures involved the way in which the Labor government approached matters in terms of TAFE training, schools, universities and other educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did stand very much as an important part of that overall package. The Auditor-General has pointed to the fact that ESRA has worked very well. The report indicates at page 8 that ESRA was able to be measured clearly against quite objective criteria and, when measured against those criteria, performed extremely well. Since the establishment of ESRA in July 1994, there have been some 3,257 case managers set in place. In that period, those case managers have been able to assist some 691,000 clients and provide quite substantial levels of assistance to the long-term unemployed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the program was established, it was set down that there should be quite specific targets to see that the number of long-term unemployed were dealt with individually and were provided with individual attention, rather than be dealt with by an inhuman and at times distant bureaucracy. Case management now accounts for some 37 per cent of persons who are eligible for assistance. That is a significant movement in such a short period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General pointed out that ESRA was able to fulfil the substantive objectives set down for it. The report states clearly at page 5 that ESRA was able to demonstrate that it was following a corporate plan, which set out its values, directions and strategies for the next three years; that it was able to fulfil an appropriate performance level and was able to provide a proper process of review and accountability; that it was able to establish effective means of fraud control and fraud risk assessments; and that it was able to put in place a management strategy that ensured money was well spent. It seems to me that that is an appropriate measure by which one <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1965"> can assess whether or not agencies such as this are performing well. That is what the Auditor-General essentially has indicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report could not come at a worse time for the government because day after day we read of this government's determination to slash labour market programs, to undermine the rights of workers in this country, to turn the clock back to a period in our history when workers could not rely upon effective, individual and appropriate levels of assistance from the government and to leave people to their own devices. They are precisely the sorts of policies that this government has been pursuing. It has been saying that this is an indulgence, that labour market programs of this type are inappropriate and that we are spending too much money on assisting the long-term unemployed in this country. In my judgment, the government has a very inhuman approach to the questions of employment and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have we seen since this government has come to office? We have seen an attempt to denigrate the efforts of the former government. What they cannot hide is the fact that there have been such prolonged periods of employment growth which have led to substantial reductions in the numbers of long-term unemployed at a time when there have been increasing levels of participation and the rights of people to participate in the work force have been exercised, a right being recognised by increasing numbers of Australians. It is appropriate that they should recognise that right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we see from this government? We see constant attacks upon the unemployed, attacks upon labour market programs and constant speculation about the levels of cuts to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. There has been the suggestion that some 22 per cent of the budget targeted cuts should come from this department and that, in particular, some $400 million should come from labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, the Auditor-General's report is quite timely. It highlights that it is not appropriate to attack bodies such as this that are doing a good job, that are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ensuring that people's rights to participate in our society are implemented and not undermined by the government itself. In my judgment such discussion and speculation about removing support for such important agencies as this is inappropriate .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the government's overall program, one can only be led to the conclusion that the effects on economic growth of the proposed cuts of some $8 billion will be a reduction in economic growth. There will be an increase in the levels of unemployment. There will a greater need for agencies such as this. This is the great irony. The government is undermining any objectives it might have about improving the levels of employment in this country. In my judgment it is undermining the democratic nature of this country. One of the most fundamental democratic rights has to be the right to participate. The right to participate at work has to be central to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that this is a very timely report. I welcome it. It needs to be carefully considered by the parliament. I look forward to being proved wrong in the coming budget session. I trust that the government will not proceed with its inhuman, callous disregard for the rights of Australia's long-term unemployed and that it will sustain programs such as this, which have obviously been performing very well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am intrigued by Senator Carr's handling of this report. I agree with him when he says that he wants this report carefully considered by this parliament, but I would suggest that Senator Carr carefully read the report now because his selective extracts from the audit report are incredible. In the first place, what he reported as commendation by the Auditor on page 8 is in fact a response from the departments themselves, praising themselves for their own activities&mdash;totally misleading of the Senate. That was an absolutely incredible performance, but a typical one by Senator Carr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what this audit report really did say. It gives a very different impression indeed from the one just given to the Senate by Senator Carr. For example, when Senator Carr said that the audit found that they had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1966"> made substantial progress in establishing, within the one-year time frame, an appropriate administrative framework, he failed then to say the next bit where the Auditor-General's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the majority of the CCMs had been operating for a short time, it was not possible to establish conclusively whether the administrative framework was operating effectively in practice.</PARA>
<PARA>How remarkable it was that Senator Carr could not read that sentence. Incredible, is it not? As I said, I hope the Senate does take a great deal of notice of this report. It is a very sensible and balanced report, unlike the submission just made to the Senate by Senator Carr. He probably assumes that no-one reads these reports and he can get away with this kind of nonsense. The Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the strategic front, the ANAO highlighted some concerns surrounding the competitive framework, for example ESRA's role in regulation and monitoring the case management system. These concerns were raised by the Department, ESRA and other relevant stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA>But not according to Senator Carr. Everything in the garden is lovely, according to Senator Carr. I am not saying that this audit report proves the thing to be a disaster&mdash;not at all. All I am trying to do is bring some balance into the discussion in the chamber of this audit report. In particular, I thought I should deal with some quite serious concerns that the Auditor-General found. He said, for example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that there were a number of issues central to the framework which were still to be resolved some two years after the then Government's decision to implement competition in case management.</PARA>
<PARA>Two years after the event, issues central to the framework were still to be resolved. You would not have known that by listening to Senator Carr. It is just unbelievable that he would dare to come into this place and misrepresent an Auditor's report, as he has done today. It is absolutely disgraceful but, I might say, not unexpected. The Auditor&hyphen;General further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> agreeing on a timeframe for progressing to a competitively neutral environment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the examination of the application of the regulatory framework to ensure that it is consistent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with creating a competitively neutral environment for CCMs and EAA;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> establishing arrangements for monitoring and reporting functions detailed in the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> agreeing on the funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>There is some disagreement between the departments and the Auditor-General about the state of that matter. I cannot come down either way. All I can do is commend members of the Senate to look at the report and not simply rely on Senator Carr's misleading misinterpretation of it. The Auditor-General then says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The non-resolution of these issues creates a risk to the establishment of a competitively neutral environment.</PARA>
<PARA>The non&hyphen;resolution of these issues over two years by the previous incompetent, hopeless Labor government that Senator Carr has just praised to the skies creates, says the Auditor-General, `a risk to the establishment of a competitively neutral environment'. He further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, an independent evaluation of competitive arrangements was scheduled to commence in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget context (that is, reported in June 1997). Arrangements need to be progressed sufficiently and agreement reached on the basic issues to ensure the maximum value is gained from this evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the Auditor-General posing some problems that need to be resolved but, after two years of Labor, have not been resolved. When you listen to a Senator Carr statement, you would think that there is no such problem whatsoever. It is just incredible that any senator would come into this chamber and seek to mislead it in the way in which Senator Carr has mislead it on this report.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this Australian National Audit Office report; hopefully I will have the chance to speak to it in more detail next time it is listed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> . I would like to make a few brief statements about recommendation No. 4. It is an example of the complexity which exists within the system of case management and why it is extremely difficult to implement competition policy in relation to such a system. There are two reasons for that that I can think of immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1967">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it is not unreasonable that you should base your funding for case management on what you are reasonably expecting to be the outcome of the program. For instance, you could say, `Case management is a useful thing to have. This is how many people require case management, and we can try to make a reasonable estimate of what is required to provide that service.' Unfortunately, that does not tend to be what happens at the moment. Bit by bit we are being told by people involved with case management that they are being offered less and less and that they are being asked to try to produce more and more outcomes. The general principle should be that, if we are saying that case management is a good thing to have, funding should enable those people providing case management to provide the service that they are being asked to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, can you make a cost comparison between one service and another? The answer is: talk to the people who provide services and talk to the people to whom those services are being provided. The Australian National Audit Office mentions on a number of occasions the phrase `recommended that the stakeholders involved'. The real stakeholders in this issue are not the organisations providing case management, they are the people who are hoping to gain enough training or experience or confidence to get back into the work force or to get into the work force for the first time. Unfortunately, they are generally left out of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach taken by providers&mdash;even private providers&mdash;of case management is often different. Quite frankly, the allocation of cases to case managers, whether they are in the private or public system, often reflects that. They know that particular types of services are able to provide particular types of specialties. There is often a mix as well. The approach taken depends on the region of Australia concerned. Some approaches work in some areas whilst different approaches work better in others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All along, in relation to employment and training, we have heard from providers and from unemployed people that if you try to make a direct comparison on a dollar&hyphen;for&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dollar basis, you will miss the point entirely. You have to look at outcomes and you have to have the flexibility to understand that some approaches in some areas will cost more because of the whole nature of the issues involved in those areas&mdash;the people, the types of training available in those areas, and the types of general employment opportunities available in those areas.   </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we drop to the level of competition policy in every area of service provision, we are going to get into deep problems. I believe this is one of those areas where outcomes should be first priority. We should obviously look at the resources that are available to achieve those outcomes, but we have to have a reasonable idea of what we are trying to achieve and how we can best achieve those outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, this is not an easy issue. It is time that we all took the opportunity of consulting the people who are providing services and also consulting the people for whom those services are being provided. Quite frankly, the people who are out in the private sector trying to provide those services are being told nothing at the moment about either skillshare or case management&mdash;about the future of what they are trying to implement. It is really not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the future, I will be taking the opportunity of adding to my remarks today, but there are a whole lot of issues involved with the way we are providing such things as case management, the funding we provide for case management and the basis on which we are assessing case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really do not think that simply judging this on a narrow competition policy basis is going to be a particularly successful outcome. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know there is other business to be done today so I will not delay the Senate. This is a very important document and one that goes very much to the issue of public policy. It deals with the tendering out of services to outside bodies by government. The Industry Commission has produced a report which I think deserves a full-scale debate at the appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission says that there has been evidence of considerable savings by the contracting out of services that were previously supplied by government. One of the conclusions it reaches is this. It says on page 555:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The available evidence on the sources of the cost savings from contracting is mixed. It appears that the cost savings may be due to a combination of productivity improvements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which, of course, we would all agree to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the use of better combinations of the factors of production, and transfers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the worrying issue, because the transfers come mainly from labour. It is a matter of concern that public services may be made cheaper at the cost of proper remuneration to those that carry them out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission is somewhat tentative in the conclusions it reaches, and it says that people interested in this area should look for further empirical evidence about all these matters. If we are gaining benefits from contracting out&mdash;that seems to be the situation, from what the Industry Commission says, and it is a report that everybody should read&mdash;at the expense of reduced wages and conditions, then I think it is a matter that we ought to have some concern about.</PARA>

For example, the report goes into the issue of hospitals and supply of medical services and what have you. If we are getting those basic services carried out at a cost which is unreasonable, then that is a matter for great pity.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>It is a pleasure to be able to move this motion today because a matter of significant national pride for me has been the way in which our unique industrial relations system has provided a fair balance between the rights of employers and employer organisations and the rights of workers and trade unions. The way in which our system has protected the rights of workers with limited bargaining power has meant that workers in this country such as shop assistants can earn a living wage for their families.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have copious notes. That is a very cheap point, I should note. Let me repeat: the way in which our system in Australia has provided a living wage for workers such as shop assistants has been a matter of pride for me. This is not like the environment that has applied, for instance, with the working poor in the United States where 11 million workers are on a minimum rate of an Australian equivalent of $5.30 per hour. This leads to the situation where a family of four with two adult wage earners working full time would only marginally be above the poverty line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concerning element of the political climate with respect to industrial relations in the United States is the attitude towards trade unions and worker representation and collective organisation. I was able to witness this in around 1991 in a visit to the United States, post the `Justice for janitors' campaign, where janitors in the United States, on very reduced hourly rates of pay, saw no other alternative but to take collective action. The unfortunate component of that collective action was a violent response by police in Los Angeles. This is action you would not expect in this day and age. The crisis developed because a pregnant woman miscarried because of her mistreatment by police. I hope that Australia will not go down this path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposals are fundamentally flawed because they ignore the unequal bargaining power between employers and employees. They ignore the unequal position <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> between that pregnant janitor and her multinational employer. Under the guise of promoting cooperative workplace relations, these proposals weaken the protections for workers whilst boosting the flexibility for the employer. Let me flesh out some of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's focus is on cooperation. I applaud that, but they see cooperation as being versus the principles of dispute prevention and settlement. They ignore disputation and they ignore inequality. Let me refer to some comments made by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Reith. In describing the proposals, he said that they represent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a break with a system of industrial relations that has been based on a view that conflict between employer and employee is fundamental to the relationship and that an adversarial process of resolving disputes is appropriate and inevitable.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WOODS" NAMEID="1K4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will expand upon that point. Mr Reith also said that the proposals reject:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the highly paternalistic presumption that has underpinned the industrial relations system in this country for too long&mdash;that employees are not only incapable of protecting their own interests, but even of understanding them, without the compulsory involvement of unions and industrial tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me flesh out these points. Would Mr Reith have similar views about our legal system or our Westminster parliamentary system? Both of these are adversarial and ironically consistent, I would argue, with his parliamentary conduct. My own view, some would argue despite my profession of social work, which is often argued incapable of dealing with conflict situations, is that cooperation is best fostered by acknowledging diverging interests and conflict as well as mutual interests, not by a system that pretends that conflict or diverging interests simply don't exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government view on the need for protection is to ignore that disadvantage exists. At least yesterday Senator Herron had the good grace to acknowledge a different position with respect with Aboriginals and Pauline Hanson's comments. The government view on flexibility is to ignore the question of flexibility for whom or for whose benefit. They talk of choice simplicity; the rhetoric <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1970"> goes on and on. As I shall demonstrate, no case for the benefits for workers has been put. A rock solid guarantee is, in fact, empty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over 61,000 accesses to the Internet home page of the Department of Industrial Relations have been made in recent times. The Secretary to the Department of Industrial Relations, David Rosalky, says that the clear interest in the bill reflects that access to it is eagerly anticipated in the private sector, the public sector, academia and even some overseas interests. What about the concerned parties? Don't they exist or don't they know how to access the Internet? Surely some of those 61,000 people are actually concerned about the implications of this bill. The minister is also in fairyland, with recent comments describing the changes such as these:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because awards will be simplified, there will be more choice about how work is to be organised at the workplace. With simplified awards, employers and employees will find themselves talking to each other more about how they would like to organise, to their mutual benefit, matters that, until now, have been dictated to them by the award.</PARA>
<PARA>Has nobody heard of managerial prerogative? How do we prevent dictating to workers how their work will be organised? We only have to look at outworking in the textile clothing industry to see exploitation of women and their families in the name of flexible homework. Ask these workers about Mr Reith's notion of choice and mutual benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that some commentators are wondering whether Mr Howard's rocks from his rock solid guarantee are actually in his head. Naivety or stupidity have been words used to describe elements of the government's proposals, but the government's limited response to date to the numerous genuine concerns raised has led some to wonder whether duplicity is a more accurate description.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion focuses on women in particular because women have generally relied on the protections stemming from our system of arbitration and awards than have men. This is because women are more likely to work in low skill and low wage jobs, with little industrial muscle, and to be employed on a part-time or casual basis. Our system has delivered for women. The industrial relations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system has played a significant role in reducing the gender gap in award wages through the equal pay cases of 1969, 1972 and since 1989 in adjusting minimum rates of pay for the low paid through supplementary payments and flat wage increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The award system has resulted in higher female to male wage ratios than in other comparable countries, Australia being second only to Sweden. Test cases through the commission have been an important vehicle for introducing employment conditions into awards such as maternity and family leave and how we will do this in the future. There is already considerable evidence that an overly deregulated labour market is not desirable for women. Recent Western Australian, Victorian and New Zealand evidence on wage equity has clearly shown this. Research across the OECD finds that pay equity depends more on a centralised wage fixing system than, in fact, on enactment of equal employment opportunity legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me refer to some of the detailed concerns about a move away from the centralised wage fixing system, such as removing protections for part&hyphen;time workers. Most awards provide a minimum number of hours per week for part&hyphen;timers in order to ensure that they are given reasonable work opportunities and income. The removal of the requirement that part&hyphen;timers be given a minimum number of hours would allow them to be employed for as little as one hour per week. I am not being hypothetical here. There are examples of Victorian contracts where companies such as Toys R Us have sought to introduce one&hyphen;hour minimum starts for part&hyphen;time workers. Also, hours could vary from week to week so that income stability is lost while the weekly child&hyphen;care costs remain essentially the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistency in rostering arrangements for part&hyphen;time employees with family responsibilities is crucial. The removal of requirements for a set number of hours, and notice in advance if this is to be changed, will be disastrous for many of the women who are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1971"> currently juggling work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of concern is restricting access to federal awards. Access will be restricted for the vast number of women workers in industries which have traditionally been covered by state awards in states such as Victoria where standards have been significantly reduced. These are areas such as clerical, retail, hospital and health workers, many of whom are women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to workplace agreements, under the current legislation there are significant protections for employees in the enterprise bargaining process, such as measuring agreements against existing awards in order to determine whether employees are disadvantaged. From my own experience I can say there have been enough problems in introducing enterprise bargaining in areas such as the retail industry, which have a significant number of women workers, without those protections also being removed. The government is proposing that agreements be measured only against a set of minimum standards which leave out significant award entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make some further comments on the issue of equal pay. The federal Labor government acted in 1994 to introduce powers for the commission to remedy instances of discriminatory over&hyphen;award payments and the government proposes to remove those. The government claims that adequate provisions are in place through the anti&hyphen;discrimination bodies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, despite the comments by the commissioner herself and also despite provisions in the Industrial Relations Act which allow alternative remedies to be used before referring to the act, if such remedies are regarded as reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The commission is the appropriate body for dealing with these pay related issues. It has the knowledge and the accessible procedures that give the provisions clout, as evidenced by successful settlement of claims under the provisions there to date. The ACTU, utilising these provisions, has had some major successes in negotiating&mdash;not arbitrating&mdash;the removal of clearly discriminatory over&hyphen;award pay ments, especially among female process workers in the manufacturing industry. These are all the types of concerns that have been raised by women's organisations, Labor academics, church and community groups who are alarmed by the changes that are likely to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the concerns which led 47 of the 49 women represented at the national women's organisation round table discussions with Minister Newman to raise several concerns in areas where they believe the bill should be amended. These concerns were as follows, and I hope you do not mind if I read at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a compliment, Senator Patterson. The main point of all this is that the government simply is not listening. Let me give an example of how the government is not listening. As I said, last week 47 of 49 women attending the national women's organisation round table discussions&mdash;chaired all day by the minister&mdash;signed a petition seeking several changes to the bill. But what was the government's response? The government's response was this document, which we presume was prepared by baby animals. It is headed `How the Workplace Relations Bill will assist women.' If you look at it, there is nothing in this whole document which shows anything which will assist women, not even a rhetorical discussion about how something might assist women. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strong emphasis is placed on the development of work practices which allow for a better balancing of work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Okay, it has strong emphasis. How? It does not say. It talks about the employment advocate who will pay particular attention to providing support for young women and people of non-English speaking backgrounds. But again, how? It does not say. It does not describe how it might occur. It says that awards will continue to provide a safety net, fair minimum wages and conditions for all employees. It says that awards will continue. That is not new assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It talks further&mdash;again&mdash;about the development of mutually beneficial work practices with employers, about the benefits of this for workers with family responsibilities. But it does not talk about what is going to happen when things are not mutually beneficial. There are no protections there. There is also talk about the benefits for part-time workers, who will have reasonable predicability as to hours worked. It does not tell us in any way at all, though, how this reasonable predicability is going to be guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To highlight this document, there is not one single description in these new proposals of how assistance will be rendered to women. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> All they talk about is how things are going to be continued or how they may be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps a worse example, which will highlight why the government needs to be condemned in this area, is yesterday's performance by the member for Dickson, Mr Tony Smith. I do not know whether senators have had the opportunity to read his speech, but even the member for Mackellar, Mrs Bishop, had the courtesy to interject on his comments yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Smith wanted to look at some practical examples of how the bill will affect women. He claimed that people from our side never do that. He said that half of them have never been in a workplace situation. Perhaps this is the time for me to answer the comments by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) about how many union hacks there are on this side of the chamber. I presume that he is counting me as one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that I do have private sector experience. I worked in the retail industry before I worked for the union. I suppose it would be a bit of a worry to be a hack at the age of 34. I doubt whether I am stereotypical of what the government claims the union movement represents at the moment. So I am not quite sure how he classes people on this side when he talks about people working in industrial relations and being union hacks. I am also a social worker by profession and have worked in that industry as well. So, if he is classing me as a trade union hack, he might want to look at how he is assessing people, because there are several other areas in which he could class my background as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to Tony Smith. He said that he was an article clerk and started work with a female. Good heavens! Everybody knows that an article clerk is a general dogs body. He said that he had equal pay but that it was not equal work. Whenever heavy lifting, carrying or anything of a heavy nature had to be done, guess who had to do it? The males had to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether Mr Tony Smith would suggest that I should not have had full senatorial pay during the period that I was not able to lift heavy weights. Did that affect my <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1973"> performance, I wonder. Maybe a pregnant woman should not be in this House, according to the way he classes these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The synopsis of my comments here today, though, is to point out that the government to date has provided no evidence of benefits for workers in its workplace relations proposals. It has found no evidence to date that this sort of deregulation will provide any benefits for workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main people who will be disadvantaged, of course, are the workers who are already disadvantaged in the work force. The predominant number of those are women. We on this side say that the government needs to be condemned for the proposals in this. Whilst their rhetoric is that they are doing things for women and women with family responsibilities, there has to date been no substance to those claims. They have not been able to demonstrate clearly how any of their claims will provide improvements for women or women with family responsibilities. I commend the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>I did not hear much about that in Senator Collins's speech. She condemned the government for continually failing to acknowledge in particular women's concerns while defending the rock-solid guarantee of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no worker will be worse off. The government has been in power now for 16 weeks. If you think that for 16 weeks we have continually denied women's rights, then you have been in a different place from me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I had no objection to Senator Collins reading her contribution today. It is the same old contribution that we have heard year after year and time after time from people on the other side when it comes to industrial relations matters. You would want to make sure that you got it right. If I were you, I would keep reading it too, because nobody over this side, no matter how many times you tell us, will believe the things that you were trying to express today in moving this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You started off by saying that our industrial relations system is unique. It is unique all right. You have run it for 13 years. Any changes that have been made to our industrial relations legislation in the past 13 years have been made by the members opposite. After 13 years people finished up being worse off than they were when you started in this government 13 years ago. That is your record in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you are right: our system is unique. That is why we are going to change it. What we want to do is make sure that the workers and the employers in Australia have a better system to operate under, one which will make both better off. Up until now that has just never happened. It never will happen unless we make some changes and introduce some choice into the system that we already have.</PARA>

If we are going to talk about overseas evidence that the majority of Australian workers will be disadvantaged by our proposals, you could look further than those few very narrow examples you used with regard to the experience overseas. I am not quite sure that the old saying `Comparisons are odious' does not apply to some of the comparisons that you used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You also talked about people on this side using rhetoric. If anybody ought to talk about using rhetoric when it comes to industrial relations, we need look no further than those senators sitting on the opposite side of the chamber. We have heard nothing but rhetoric for 13 years, probably nothing but rhetoric since 1893&mdash;my history is not that good but I think the labour movement started in about 1893. We hear the same old rhetoric year after year about protecting the worker, looking after the disadvantaged. In fact the rhetoric that you use has never been put into practice, and you proved that over the 13 years when you did nothing to improve the lot of the workers in Australia between 1983 and 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can continue to use that rhetoric because, as Senator Alston said today, many of you have never been in the real world of taking a risk. The risk takers are the people of Australia who will make this country thrive or not; they are the small business people. Under your government those people were continually taking a risk. You have done nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reiterate that the risk takers in this world are those small business people in Australia for whom you have made life so difficult. I can give you a number of examples of people who have been in small business over a period of time who used to be employers. Many of those people are no longer employers. They will do what they can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do working on their own, without employing anybody else, because they are not prepared to take the risk because of the unfair dismissal laws that you put into place, because of the amount of red tape that goes with employing. You can talk about the large businesses and the people who might employ 20, 30 or 40 people or more, but let me tell you this: those people who used to employ one or two people no longer wish to employ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you wanted me to, I could cite a number of examples in my own home town of 1,000 people where there are at least four builders who now work on their own or with each other. They do not employ one person, whereas they used to employ 15 people between them until 1983. So, if you have been in the real world and taken the risks, you will understand the difficulties that you will find under the current industrial legislation and the impediments there are to employing people.</PARA>

It has got worse under you, Senator Neal. You are the ones who had the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons this bill has been put into place is that currently we have what you could call a highly paternalistic presumption that has underpinned our industrial relations system in this country for too long. That assumption is that employees are incapable of protecting their own interests or of even understanding them without the compulsory involvement of unions or industrial tribunals. That just simply is not the case. There are many employees in Australia who would like to conduct their own affairs and make their own arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been an employer in the past, only of one or two people, in our own farming enterprise. There was never a need for anybody to help the understanding between us and our working men.</PARA>

The other people who were employed were always employed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at above the award arrangements that were in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that is currently before the House of Representatives, and the one that will be introduced into this place, in contrast to the legislation that you have tinkered with over the past 13 years, seeks to restore the focus of the system on those who really matter&mdash;that is, the employees and the employers. They are the ones who really matter at the workplace and enterprise level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something you have never been able to do. You have tried to. You have attempted to. Your own previous Prime Minister was quite concerned and reached the stage where enterprise bargaining was to take place. We have reached the situation where we believe employees should have the right to make their own arrangements if they so choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said that Australia needed a model of industrial relations `which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards'. That is exactly what is proposed by the current government. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the words of your great hero, the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone has any doubts about the need for genuine reform in industrial relations&mdash;reform of its institutions and arrangements&mdash;they need go no further than the ABS statistics which show that we still have the intolerable unemployment rate of 8.9 per cent, with the rate of youth unemployment at just under 30 per cent. If ever there was an indictment of 13 years of Labor rule, it is in the area of unemployment, and much of it can be attributed to the inflexible working arrangements that you put in place. In many instances, they led to employers not being prepared to employ people. They chose instead to work as hard as they could without the use of employed labour in order to make a living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion refers to the `overwhelming evidence' that the majority of Australian workers will be disadvantaged by the proposed legislation. If you have already reached <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1976"> that conclusion&mdash;I see that Senator Jacinta Collins has left the chamber&mdash;it seems there is no real need for the political junket we are going on. I refer to the inquiry in July that will look at such things as: the implications of the bill for our economy; whether the provisions of the bill will fulfil our international obligations; and the effect of similar provisions in other countries. I do not know how much we are expected to fit into the 18 or so days of this inquiry but if we were to go into detail on all those matters we would not be reporting on 22 August 1996, we would be reporting on 22 August 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact on small business of the proposed legislation is one area where we will receive plenty of evidence. The people who feel most disadvantaged by the legislation put in place by the former government are the small businesses in this country. The people in this chamber who understand small business best are those sitting on this side because many of us have been involved in small business and know the difficulties that exist. There are other things besides industrial relations matters that impact on small business but it is having the biggest effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of this inquiry is to determine whether the bill in whole or in part is constitutional. Why on earth would the economics committee be looking at whether a bill is constitutional when we have a legal and constitutional committee in the Senate. This was debated at length when the committee's terms of reference were before the Senate but I still cannot understand why an economics committee should be investigating whether a bill in whole or in part is constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other speakers on this side who wish to speak on this motion so I do not intend to take up much more time. In conclusion, I say to senators opposite that they would do well to read some of the newspaper articles that have appeared the past couple of months and which have been written by people of various political leanings. There was an article today by Judith Sloan about the work of this committee and I could do no better than to quote her conclusion. She writes:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian taxpayer would have been much better served if the Bill had been considered, as it should have been, by a Senate legislation committee.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that Judith Sloan wrote that. It is the very argument we put forward in this place some months ago when it was first suggested that this bill be sent to a references committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins's motion referred to evidence from Australia and overseas that workers would be disadvantaged. I am yet to see that evidence. I find it difficult to believe that any inquiry will take overseas evidence. I certainly reject the assertions contained in this motion. It was obviously cobbled together late yesterday just so there would be something to debate in general business today. I would have thought that the time for giving notices of motion would have provided a better debating arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly reject the assertion in this motion that Australian workers will be disadvantaged. That is simply not the case. As for the suggestion that we continue to fail to acknowledge women's concerns, let me say that people on this side of the chamber treat everyone equally. Women's concerns and men's concerns will receive equal consideration under any legislation that comes into this place from this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a motion by Senator Jacinta Collins relating to the government's proposals to change the industrial relations system in Australia. The first part of the motion refers to `overwhelming Australian and overseas evidence that the majority of Australian workers will be disadvantaged by the government's proposals to reform Australia's industrial relations system.' There is a couple of ways of looking at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there is recognition, even by supporters of this bill in the media and elsewhere, that the bill is designed to shift the bargaining power from workers and their representatives to employers. Those people who advocate this change believe that that is a fair change. I do not happen to agree with that, but there is a recognition that that is the nature of the proposed changes that will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1977"> implemented if this bill is passed as presented. If you go along with those advocates of the change in the system who say that the thrust of the bill is to change the relative bargaining power away from workers and their representatives to employers and business in general, then what are we looking at? Who, in this system, our current system, is in a strong or even an equal bargaining position?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me work backwards from here. Are the young in a strong or equal bargaining position? No. Clearly, that is not the case. They do not have a great deal of information, they do not have a great deal of confidence and they are new to the system. Standing up for your rights is provably very difficult, if not impossible, if you are young and looking for a job&mdash;or even if you are young, trained and working in the system. Are the unskilled in our society, male and female, in a strong or equal bargaining position? Clearly, that is not the case. If it was the case, then we would not have to put clauses into legislation to make sure that those people are advised, or, as in previous legislation, make sure that those people are asked their opinion. Are migrants, people who have English as a second language or people who have no real understanding of their rights under the system in a strong or even equal bargaining position? Clearly, that is not the case. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, such issues as have come out through the outworkers inquiry give an indication that it is that sector of employees who really are getting the rotten end of any stick in relation to our current industrial relations system. Are people who are still unemployed and looking for a job in a strong or equal bargaining position? Quite frankly, ask most unemployed people and they would say no, their bargaining position is not very strong. And it looks like it is going to get worse, especially if they apply for a job or send for a job application and they are handed terms and conditions of employment which they know&mdash;even with inexperience&mdash;are not fair. The proposal from this government is that that employer be encouraged to dob you in to take you off unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, that very low bargaining power is getting worse. What about remote area <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employees? What real chance would a person living in a remote area, where everybody knows each other, have of inviting a union into a workplace if everybody knows them and if their employer happens to be against union involvement&mdash;now or in the future&mdash;or if there is a change of power arrangement where they think they can get away with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the issue of women in the work force? We are not talking about a minority group in our society. We are talking about 50 per cent of the population. Are women in the work force generally in a strong or equal bargaining position? Clearly, no, and that has been the concern of many people in relation to industrial relations. Do you judge the nature of your industrial relations system on what a good employer may do to people who have confidence, knowledge and a good bargaining position? The answer is no. You cannot base an industrial relations system on that kind of mechanism or that kind of scenario, because it is clearly not realistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to now concentrate on the issue raised in the second part of Senator Jacinta Collins's motion in relation to women because it highlights the fact that this government is pursuing workplace changes without giving any consideration to the impacts that those changes have on the lives of workers. What have we been told by the new government? We have been told by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, that no worker will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women have been fighting for equity in the workplace for decades. What a revolutionary concept! Just imagine the gall of these people, half the population, actually suggesting that anyone who is employed on work of equal value should expect equal pay! It is a sad indictment of our society that, so many years after the suffragettes fought for the right to vote, their granddaughters and great&hyphen;granddaughters are still fighting for equality in the workplace. Unfortunately, the government's workplace reforms will place women back in a similar position to their grandmothers, and it appears that the coalition is comfortable with this return to the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me talk about a few of the concerns that have been forwarded to me in relation to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1978"> these issues. I quote from a letter from Women in Industry and Community Health. This is a migrant women's association. They are happy that there have been some amendments to the workplace relations bill as a result of some of their concerns. However, they are concerned that many problems still remain, in particular:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the narrowing of the definition of equal pay to include only minimum award pay instead of whole pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* the stripping of awards to a bare minimum number of provisions, removing such conditions as paid maternity leave, predictable hours and days of work, EEO, affirmative action and workplace harassment clauses, and superannuation arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA>They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the bargaining power of women in general, leaving it to women to bargain back these entitlements at a workplace level via agreements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>they believe&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a very poor option;</PARA>
<PARA>They are concerned about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the active promotion of secret non-union individual agreements (Australian Workplace Agreements, or AWAs) as the basis for employment conditions, such agreements not being open to public scrutiny, whether by unions or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC), by anti&hyphen;discrimination bodies or even by workers in the same workplace . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What kind of equal bargaining power is that? There is no indication that we are talking about equal bargaining power here. They are concerned about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the absence of any scrutiny by the Office of Employment Advocate prior to certification of an Australian AWA agreement to ensure that it meets the minimum safety net standards set out in the Bill;</PARA>
<PARA>They are concerned that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the reduction of the safety net standard the AIRC is to apply in the case of union&hyphen;negotiated agreements . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And they are concerned about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the removal of special requirements to consult with and inform disadvantaged groups in the workplace (e.g. women, people of non English speaking background, young people)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>part of the list that I was reading before&mdash;</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about a proposed workplace agreement before it is finalised . . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>What kind of choice is it when you get given a workplace agreement of which you have had no part in compiling? What kind of choice is it to say no in those kinds of circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are concerned about the abolition of paid rates awards and their replacement with minimum rates awards and the fact that many women work under paid rates awards, including those in community services, health and education. They are concerned that the abolition of paid rates awards in those areas will lead to a reduction over time in pay to those areas and to an increase in the gender gap in Australia. We know it exists already, but they are concerned about the increase in this gap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They believe that those changes go far beyond any changes that were mentioned by the coalition during the election campaign. In relation to that, a number of media commentators&mdash;who think that these new reforms may be the best thing since sliced bread, especially for business&mdash;have commented in sheer outrage that the Senate should dare to consider that these issues are important enough to be looked at carefully and should be properly taken to the community for their comment and response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind you that the removal of the discrimination provisions was not foreshadowed before the election. The elimination of the requirement for inserting the model anti&hyphen;discrimination clause was not foreshadowed. The limitation on conditions that awards can cover was not foreshadowed or specified. There were no changes foreshadowed to the equal pay legislation prior to the election. The only reference to equal pay was that it would be a minimum condition for Australian workplace agreement. Of course, this hardly seems to be the case if you are only talking about minimum awards. Removal of the requirement for award reviews to address discrimination was not foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically what we are talking about is a whole lot of areas. We are talking about delays in sick pay&mdash;not foreshadowed; changes to supported wage provision&mdash;not foreshadowed; eliminating the requirement to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1979"> consult with employees who may be disadvantaged&mdash;not foreshadowed; eliminating the requirement that agreements not be discriminatory&mdash;not foreshadowed; elimination of single bargaining unit provisions and provisions for multi-employer and multi-union certificate agreements&mdash;not foreshadowed; the removal of protection against discriminatory dismissal&mdash;not foreshadowed&mdash;and it was said that there were to be changes to that agreement; and the imposition of filing fees&mdash;not foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are concerned that the system will be problematic for disadvantaged groups, including women. Their weaker bargaining position and the lack of knowledge and support and representation available to them are going to be real challenges for the system to overcome. The role of the AIRC in protecting the interests and concerns of vulnerable groups needs to be ensured. They believe that a pro&hyphen;active role of up&hyphen;front checking of awards and agreements as well as complaint provisions offers the best option for doing that. They believe, and I agree, that the operations of the industrial relations system should be opened to the public. Knowledge and analysis of how it is operating should be made available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, if you are looking at any industrial relations system, you have to ask the questions: who has bargaining power? How will that bargaining power change? What will the possible outcomes be? Because of those questions and because of the information I have given today, I believe the concerns that are being expressed today in Senator Jacinta Collins's motion are real. The Greens support those concerns and believe that the process that we are going through in talking to the people of Australia will bring some of those out but not all of them, because you conceivably will not have the time to bring all of those out. Quite frankly, there is a lot of interest in the community about these issues. If the government is not listening to those concerns and it is not prepared to change its proposals in relation to those concerns, the proposals do not deserve to be supported.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the election, John Howard said that no worker would suffer a cut in take- <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> home pay as a result of the coalition's reforms. He has made a mockery of this statement already. The general business motion today is this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes the overwhelming Australian and overseas evidence that the majority of Australian workers will be disadvantaged by the Government's proposals to reform Australia's industrial relations system; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the Government for continually failing to acknowledge women's concerns in particular, whilst defending the `rock solid' guarantee of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no worker will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>The changes proposed by the coalition are attacks on workers, pure and simple. They are in the same vein as attacks on workers in the United States, in Britain, in New Zealand, in Western Australia and in Queensland. What is worse, these attacks will particularly affect the people who are in the weakest position in our society: workers in industries which have a majority of women, part-time workers and workers in helping professions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the Liberal Party in recent times have prided themselves in the number of women on their back bench. I applaud any increase in the number of women in our parliaments, but I am amazed and dismayed that these women are prepared to capitulate to the leaders of this government and allow this leadership to attack the industrial relations in this country, particularly to attack women workers. The women in this parliament, by not taking this up on the government side, have sold out their sisters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence we have collected over the years shows that women do better under a centralised wage fixation system. Women on awards receive 93.8 per cent of a man's wage. That is the position at the present moment. Yet, in Australia women still receive only 54.7 per cent of the average over&hyphen;award payments received by men. That reflects our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women already trail men in over&hyphen;award payments. The coalition's legislation will worsen this situation in two major ways: firstly, because over&hyphen;award payments will become a matter for negotiation between, in this case, women and their employers&mdash;and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1980"> these negotiations will be recorded in secret workplace deals&mdash;and, secondly, because the government intends to remove the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's powers to enforce equality in over&hyphen;award payments. That is a vital issue in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Discrimination in over&hyphen;award payments has been addressed by many women's groups and unions and in reports such as the 1990 National Women's Consultative Committee pay equity report and the 1992 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Just rewards</EMPHASIS>. Our Labor government acted on these concerns and in 1994 introduced new equal remuneration provisions in part 4A of the Industrial Relations Act. These amendments gave the Industrial Relations Commission the ability to remedy instances of discriminatory effects in over&hyphen;award payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACTU, using these provisions, has been able to ensure women in several key industries are now not disadvantaged in their access to over&hyphen;award payments. The coalition government now proposes to remove these amendments, although it said nothing about this during the election. So that is the king hit that this government is going to render to women in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims adequate procedures are in place through anti-discrimination bodies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. If you think about that, it is ridiculous. However, procedures under existing equal opportunity and sex discrimination legislation are complex and lengthy and can only deal with individual injustice. The legislation cannot improve conditions for whole groups of women. That in itself is completely inadequate and the coalition's solution in this case is a fraud on all women workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the Industrial Relations Commission's ability to deal with unfair contracts involving independent contractors will affect women classified as independent contractors or outworkers in industries such as clothing, cleaning, child care and many other clerical and professional areas of work. I have seen, in my role on the Senate economics committee, the effects of these unfair contracts on workers.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The economics committee is currently examining the position of outworkers in the clothing industry in this country. I believe most Australians would be appalled at the exploitation of these workers. I acknowledge that is under the existing law. Industrial law is always subject to the most recent challenges to undercut or undermine standards of conditions in industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the progress that has been made by the unions, employers and retailers in the clothing industry. I certainly hope that when we consider the industrial relations legislation we make sure that the existing protective clauses that are the key to solving the problem in the clothing industry are included in any new legislation and extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people are the most exploited people in our community. They do not have the English language skills to easily complain about their plight. They will be the future of the Australian work force if we are not careful, because what we see in some of the outworker examples is the way the coalition industrial relations policy would work in a whole range of other industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, the federal government withdrew funding for a project designed to improve conditions for outworkers. Our Labor government had promised to fund a $400,000 project for outworkers where outworkers were to be informed of their rights and entitlements in their own languages and employers were to be educated about their responsibilities. Three weeks after the election, the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union was notified that the project had been cancelled. The funding the Labor government had given to the union had gone. The union has been asked to repay funding it has already received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not only that. Peter Reith has already said that he will oppose the adoption of a home work convention at the current meeting of the ILO. So it is a consistent pattern, unfortunately, that this government is following&mdash;of undermining conditions and, in this case, where you have a problem, making it more difficult for the employers and the unions in that particular industry to solve their problems. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1981">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's industrial relations proposal will pull the safety net out from under the most vulnerable members of our society who are working. Before the election, John Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No worker will suffer a cut in take home pay as a result of the coalition's reforms. Employees would be given the choice to remain with the current award system, or a certified agreement, or enter into a workplace agreement . . . We are not going to abolish the award system.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that paid rates workers will not have the choice of remaining in their awards. This paid rates award issue is a big issue. About 1.7 million Australians work under a paid rates award&mdash;about 25 per cent of the Australian work force are on paid rates awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Mr Reith is now proposing is to remove from the Industrial Relations Act the present sections which provide explicitly for the making of paid rates awards. He also proposes to amend the act to prevent the making of paid rates awards. He is talking about blanket action rather than a case by case examination of awards. Each paid rate award would be converted to a minimum rate plus a frozen dollar amount equal to the difference between the minimum and the previous paid rate award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This means a substantial component of the wages will be frozen in time, never to be readjusted. This could be up to 25 per cent of a worker's pay and conditions. Workers who will be affected include nurses, teachers, police, vehicle manufacturing employees, maritime workers and thousands of others&mdash;many people in a whole range of callings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take nurses for an example of the effect of the proposed changes from paid rates to minimum rates awards. Nurses stand to lose not only pay but also annual leave and career opportunities. They may even lose their rostered days off and safe rosters, leading to greater uncertainty and stress and making regular arrangements such as child care very difficult. The majority of Australian nurses are currently at a grade two level in their profession. A grade two nurse earns about $30,000 per year&mdash;little enough for the physically difficult, complex and emotionally <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> draining job that nursing can be. Yet the coalition proposals will drop them even lower down the pay scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Nurses Federation estimates that a grade two nurse will lose up to $150 a week, dropping her to the minimum annual salary of the equivalent of an entry level position of about $23,000. Even if this difference is made up now with a fixed payment of $150 a week, this component of a nurse's wage will not increase unless individual employers decide to give their staff more. With the massive cuts the coalition is proposing to the health budget, the medical employer will not have the means or the inclination to top up nurses' pay because this is one of the industries, if we are to believe the constant rumours floating about, that is going to be devastated by government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Important as this $150 per week drop in wages is, it is not the only issue for nurses. Nurses value their career structures, professional development and guaranteed access to training very highly. They are covered by the paid rates award. They will not be included in a minimum rates award. That is another area they run the risk of losing which is important to their personal esteem and professional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clerical workers provide another example of the potential loss to workers if the conversion to minimum rates awards proceeds. This industry involves thousands of women. A clerical worker under a paid rate federal award at ASO5, for example, currently earns $37,607. A Victorian clerical worker on an comparable level earns $27,963. That is a 25.6 per cent difference&mdash;the equivalent of $185 per week or $9,000&hyphen;odd annually. That is the threat to people under those federal awards as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well to say that the workers can negotiate with individual employers for the difference. This is not going to happen in practice. It will definitely not happen in the public sector because the coalition is slashing and burning the public sector. We are being asked to believe that a minimum wages policy like those of the United States or Britain will benefit Australia. Of course it will not, but that is the model the government is looking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1982"> at. It might provide a short&hyphen;term benefit to some employers, but it certainly will not benefit workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of growth in the United States economy have accrued almost exclusively to the top half of the top one per cent of individuals in the United States. That is, multimillionaires are doing better than ever. At the same time, as already mentioned by Senator Jacinta Collins, the debate rages over whether the minimum wage for United States workers will be increased from $US4.25 an hour to $US5.15. That $US4.25 is $A5.70. United States full-time workers on the minimum wage earn $US8,500 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That amount is not even half the official poverty line for a family of four. About 3.7 million Americans earn the $US4.25 minimum. Another 10 million earn between $US4.25 and $AUS5.15. That is still below the poverty line. The American Democrats want to raise the minimum to $US5.15. Of course, the Republicans in the United States have been resisting that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some economists predict disaster, yet recent economic research suggests that raising minimum wages will actually have no effect, or will have only a small positive effect, on employment figures. Certainly employment is not highest where real wages are lowest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Attacks on workers' minimum conditions have become the order of the day in Britain also. The conservative government&mdash;once again, the friends of this government&mdash;with the Confederation of British Industry cheering them on, has abolished the &pound;3 per hour minimum rate. We refer in this motion to the common action of conservative governments that this government is now copying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason why British workers, for the most part, have not experienced the same drop in real wages over the last 15 years as American workers have, is the strength of the trade unions in Great Britain. In the United States, union membership has continued to fall. It is currently one&hyphen;eighth of the work force. In both countries the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. These are the examples of conservative governments and the mechanisms that they have applied in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industrial relations that this government is trying to introduce into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet despite this evidence from overseas, the coalition government wants to follow these examples and do to Australian workers what has been done to workers overseas. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised that no Australian worker would be worse off under a coalition government. Already the attacks on the weakest have begun, as I have already indicated, and attacks on the unions that protect them have begun. All members of the government instinctively&mdash;and they have done it again today; they cannot help themselves&mdash;attack the organisations that are there to protect workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's industrial relations policy will isolate and disadvantage those workers who already are most disadvantaged in our community. Social Darwinism is the term best used to describe the coalition's proposals. The strongest will survive and prosper. The weakest will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard said that no worker would be worse off under his government. Tell that to the nurses around Australia, as I have described the position they face. These are the real examples for the vast majority of nurses in that profession at this moment. That is because of this paid rates award issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good talking about negotiation between employers and workers when many of those workers have poor English&mdash;in a typical factory where there are 20 or 30 former nationalities represented or people with very poor English all being asked to negotiate with an employer. Of course, that employer always has in this system the access to the legal advice, the access to the knowledge of what is in the industry, the access to every bit of advice&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also told us that their policies will make it easier for employees to blend their family and workplace responsibilities. That is nonsense. It is particularly important that male senators opposite listen to this, because of the threat it represents to a whole range of women. The government proposals to remove the minimum and maximum hours requirement on part-time workers will wreak havoc for workers with family responsibilities. Workers will have no way of knowing whether they will be working one hour this week or 40 hours next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any worker with family responsibilities will tell you how difficult it is to find child care at short notice. It is women particularly, as indicated in this motion, who are going to be affected by that catch-all word that members of the government are using&mdash;flexibility. It is flexible, all right&mdash;flexible so that women will not know from one day to the next how their child care will be organised. The hours people work have been regulated in a commonsense way. This government is now going to chuck that out the window.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can a family budget when they have no idea how much money will be coming in from week to week? Talk about the family! That worry, that anxiety, of people losing the ability to have some control over their lives is a problem that particularly affects women because it is a responsibility they often primarily handle.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I highlighted the importance of this government's proposed industrial relations reforms to provide a better, more direct and flexible relationship at the workplace between employers and employees. In the middle of those remarks, I was interrupted by sustained applause and verbal support from that very large audience of small business people in the hospitality industry. Those in the growing hospitality and tourism sector know that this legislation will provide the opportunity for them to create more jobs because of the fact that they will be able to operate more effectively and efficiently. That is hot off the press, first&hyphen;hand experience of the benefits that this legislation will provide for job creation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the Labor Party have set up a straw man as far as the legislation is concerned. They are putting out a farrago of lies about this legislation, saying that maternity leave will be removed from awards where it exists; that workers' wages will be cut; that the legislation will apply the principle of equal pay for equal work of equal value only to the base award minimum; that the legislation is an attack on part-time workers and seeks to casualise the work force&mdash;we heard that a moment ago from our Labor colleague; that employers will be able to vary the hours for part&hyphen;time workers at will; that this legislation involves the removal of restrictions to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lessen protections for part&hyphen;time workers; and, that federal agreements can be overridden by state agreements. Each one of those propositions is an absolutely false claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite who have spoken on this motion have shown a feigned concern about the position of women under this legislation. Let me remind the Senate what a high priority the labour movement, particularly the trade union movement, places on women's rights: they don't place any priority on it whatsoever. Let me remind the Senate of the actions of Jenny Booth of the textile and clothing workers union when she marched into a clothing factory in Sydney.</PARA>

The arrangements were to allow them all to start work earlier in the day, to work their normal working hours, and to finish work earlier in the day, so that they could blend together their work and family responsibilities. They would be finished work in time to either pick their children up from school or be at home when their children arrived home from school, thereby meeting both their family and work responsibilities.

It does not care about the actual circumstances and situations of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1985"> workers at all. That is clearly demonstrated by the way it acted in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="FERGUSON" NAMEID="EP5">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, they did. They entered into that arrangement voluntarily, at their own request. So much for the concern of the labour movement and the trade unions with regard to women's rights in the workplace in particular. The real concern of the trade union movement is the maintenance of its own power: firstly, to maintain their power as organisations; and, secondly, to maintain the power of their elected officials, who are far distant from the rank and file members who work in enterprises at the coalface. They are all about maintaining their own power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know only too well that the Labor Party in this place and around Australia is merely the creature of the trade union movement. It is the trade union movement that started and established the Labor Party. The Labor Party has always been here to do the bidding of the trade union movement. That is why they set up this straw man and this farrago of lies about the government's proposal. That is exactly what Senator Jacinta Collins has done today in bringing forward this motion for debate. She is doing the trade unions' bidding in trying to undermine this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation has the trade union movement frightened because it involves some loss of power for them. It will require that trade unions provide real and genuine service to their members; otherwise they will continue to vote with their feet and walk away from the trade union movement in droves, as we have seen happening in recent years, with trade union membership in free fall. Under this legislation, unless trade unions start to provide genuine services for their members, that loss of membership will continue apace. That is what the trade union movement and the Labor Party are frightened about. That is their real motive in wanting to undermine this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us deal further with the labour movement's treatment of women in the workplace, indeed, in the union movement itself&mdash;because that is the essential issue that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this motion seeks to raise. Despite the fact that, at long last, the trade union movement has a female president, there is no doubt that it is a male dominated institution. Its creature, the Labor Party, has not matched its own rhetoric with regard to female representation in politics.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing archaic industrial relations system that this legislation seeks to reform has traditionally given primacy to the interests of full-time adult males. As I have said, the trade union movement is dominated by full-time adult males. Women are very poorly represented in trade union hierarchies. Of course, unions negotiate deals that are consistent with their own agenda&mdash;the agenda that has been set by those dominant males.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example of the way in which unions have neglected the circumstances of women in the work force is their resistance to the insertion of part-time provisions in awards. These part&hyphen;time provisions, of course, would be advantageous to female workers.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MACKAY" NAMEID="9L6">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, how?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because there are a number of women who would like to work part-time. It would enable them, again, to blend work and family responsibilities. Women would like those provisions to be inserted in awards to give them that opportunity&mdash;and the trade union movement resists it. As I have said, the union movement has resisted those part-time provisions being inserted into awards. On those rare occasions where agreement has occurred for such provisions, the unions have hedged on quotas and the minimum and maximum hours of work. Again, of course, I come back to the example of the clothing factory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1986"> It is also worth noting that the awards which have been the last to make provision for part&hyphen;time work have been in those indus tries that are dominated by what might be described as the macho unions&mdash;unions in the transport and building sectors that desire to keep women out of their particular industries. So a direct consequence of this failure on the part of the trade union movement has been an increase in casual part-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August 1988 casual part-time employment represented 12.8 per cent of the work force. By August 1995 that had risen to 17 per cent. Casual employment does not provide for pro rata benefits with regard to safety net provisions&mdash;and again that shows up the failure of the trade union movement in protecting females in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, permanent part-time employment, where there is some opportunity to have protections in the system, only increased from 6.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent over that seven-year period&mdash;a very modest increase compared with that very significant increase in unprotected casual employment. As a consequence of that, we find that marginalised groups, such as women, have no predictability as far as working hours are concerned, or access to sick leave, or access to maternity leave. Indeed, existing awards still contain substantial restrictions on non-casual part-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the record under the trade union movement; that is the record under the previous Labor government. In marked contrast to that, the new Howard coalition government, through its workplace relations bill, will reverse that bias in the current system which favours casual work as against permanent or regular part-time work. The legislation will promote predictable hours and will allow for family responsibilities and child-care arrangements. It will also provide pro rata conditions for sick leave, carers leave and maternity leave. It will also enable a greater involvement of permanent part-time workers in the established work force. It will also offer the additional benefit of providing improved training and career opportunities for part-time workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is the contrast: the absolute failure of the trade union movement and the previous government with regard to part-time workers, who are predominantly females, as against <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what this government and its legislation offers. That needs to be considered very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, another reason for the Labor Party's opposition to this legislation is that it likes to foster a mentality of dependence. Woe betide anyone suggesting that people can manage their own employment affairs. That is the attitude of the Labor Party, and we have heard it expressed in the debate today&mdash;`They cannot manage their own affairs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What sort of attitude is that towards mature adults? We let them manage most of the rest of their lives. We let them manage their financial affairs, their family affairs, their marriage and the bringing up of their children. But when it comes to work, the Labor Party does not believe that people can manage their own affairs. It does not accept that people are capable of making reasonable and fair arrangements with their employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would refer back to what I said at the outset of my remarks. I gave the example of those females in the clothing factory who initiated changes and sought and obtained the agreement of their employer with regard to more appropriate working hours&mdash;and it was the union who came in and knocked that down. Do not tell me that people cannot manage their own workplace affairs. If they want to do that, they ought to have the choice of doing it, they ought to have the freedom to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people want someone to represent them in those affairs, they should also have the choice of doing that. If they want a trade union to represent them, they should have the right to do that. But if they do not want to be represented by a trade union, they should not be forced to be so represented against their will. If they want a solicitor or some other negotiator to represent them, they should have the right to choose that form of representation as well&mdash;and they also should have the right to choose, if they so wish, to do their own negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this legislation offers people: that flexibility, that freedom and that choice, in marked contrast to the existing legislation. Of course, again, that is why this legislation is so important but why the trade union <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1987"> movement and its Labor apparatchiki oppose it. They know that the trade union movement will have to offer real service and real benefits to its members if it is to retain their interest and their support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put on the record some of the other benefits that this legislation&mdash;and it is legislation now, it has been introduced&mdash;offers to people. It offers a comprehensive safety net, and that is spelt out in the legislation. As far as the proposed Australian workplace agreements are concerned, there is a comprehensive safety net spelt out in the legislation, and of course there is also the continuation of awards that provide the optional safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That safety net relates to allowances, penalty rates, loadings, the hours of work and time that work may be performed, annual and long service leave together with sick and bereavement leave, and also carers leave. There is also the legislated minimum for maternity, paternity and adoption leave, provision for public hospitals and redundancy pay. All of those safety net provisions are there in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also provides, as a minimum condition, equal pay for equal work of equal value. In particular, the safety net provisions will emphasise meeting the needs of the low paid. There is protection in the legislation against unfair dismissal. Employers will be specifically prohibited from dismissing employees on the grounds of sex, marital status, family responsibilities or pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation also provides very severe penalties against employers who apply duress in relation to the making of Australian workplace agreements. Again, let there be no suggestion that employees will be forced into these agreements against their will. That is specifically proscribed in the legislation, and heavy penalties will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said a few moments ago, one of the important parts of the legislation is giving workers the freedom to choose who will represent them in negotiating their workplace agreements&mdash;whether that be a union or some other consultant they might choose with expertise in the area or whether they choose to directly negotiate themselves. Again, that is a marked contrast to the present legislation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the record of the previous Labor government. Their employees had absolutely no choice; they were forced to be members of trade unions and it was only the trade union that was given the right to negotiate on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often employees were not just forced to join a trade union, but also forced to join a trade union when they would have perhaps preferred to join a different trade union. That is a very important choice that we will give them under this legislation. By removing the `conveniently belong' clause from the legislation and by allowing for de&hyphen;amalgamation of unions, we will allow the establishment of new unions, which will more directly and more effectively represent the interests of those particular workers who choose to have them established and choose to join them. That is a very important part of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the issue of female workers. No woman has received equal pay under the existing system when the Industrial Relations Commission has made orders in regard to over&hyphen;award payments. That is another shortcoming of the existing system, which our legislation will overcome. Let it not be said that this legislation in any way threatens the standards that workers might attain. In particular, it does not threaten the standards that female workers might attain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the process of developing this legislation and bringing it into the parliament, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith, has had several consultations with women's groups and has adopted several of their recommendations. He has made it clear to these groups that the door is very much open to suggestions. The women's groups themselves have acknowledged this. I wish to indicate some of the groups which the minister has consulted. This is by no means an exhaustive list. He has had meetings with the Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women, the National Pay Equity Coalition, the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Australian Non&hyphen;English Speaking Background Women's Association, the Women's Economic Think Tank and the Council for Equal Opportunity in Employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1988">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that as a direct consequence of those meetings, Ms Eva Cox, the co&hyphen;convenor of the Women's Economic Think Tank in Sydney, only as recently as yesterday said, `full marks to Peter Reith' with regard to the degree of consultation that he has undertaken with women's groups in relation to this legislation. Again, women have been very much to the fore in terms of the drafting of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth contrasting the minister's determination to consult on this legislation with what happened under the previous government when at midnight it ratified ILO convention 158 on unfair dismissal without any consultation whatsoever and then incorporated that convention holus&hyphen;bolus into the 1993 legislation. As a result of that we know only too well that many employees&mdash;in particular, small businessmen&mdash;have been forced to pay out on bogus unfair dismissal claims. In addition, many people have been denied jobs as a result of the employment&hyphen;deterring nature of that system. That is a contrast between this government and the minister, Peter Reith, and his consultative process and the jackboot way in which the previous government operated by ratifying that ILO convention on unfair dismissals at midnight without any consultation whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of their strategy to attempt to undermine this legislation, the opposition parties&mdash;not only the Labor Party, but the Greens and the Democrats&mdash;have referred this legislation to the Senate Economics References Committee, not the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that was set up for the very purpose of examining legislation. They bypassed that and sent it to the references committee. Professor Judith Sloan made some very pertinent comments about that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning. However, that is what they have done and that is the process which will now have to be publicised. There is absolutely no doubt at all that this reference is part of the delaying, filibustering tactics of the opposition parties on this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are to go through this process, the very least that the Labor Party ought to do, including the shadow minister for industrial relations, Mr McMullan, is make public the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more than 200 amendments which Mr McMullan claims he has drafted for this legislation. He has only made a very few of them public. He claims he has more than 200 amendments. If he has, let us have them on the table, let us see them and let us have them before this committee so that they can be considered as well as the proposals of the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. What is he hiding? They ought to be provided to us now. Again, the failure to do that simply highlights that all the Labor Party is doing in regard to this legislation is a filibustering exercise to seek to undermine it. What is being done through that committee contrasts markedly with the way we, when in opposition, treated their so&hyphen;called Industrial Relations Reform Bill of 1993. We opposed a substantial part of that quite bitterly because we knew that, instead of taking industrial relations into the 21st century, it was returning it to the 19th century. Despite that, we dealt with it constructively through relatively brief committee <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1989"> hearings and we did not conduct this filibustering exercise all over Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That committee examined that legislation with respect to three terms of reference only, compared with the 15 terms of reference that the present opposition parties have put before the Senate Economic References Committee. That is a clear indication that, when in opposition, we dealt constructively with legislation; the present opposition is dealing destructively with legislation. That simply shows that the Labor Party is not genuine as far as this legislation is concerned. Let me draw my remarks to a close by quoting a former President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, a former Prime Minister of this country and Labor Party leader, in relation to the goals of this legislation. What he said late in May was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for its part, the trade union movement must recognise . . . the right of an employer and an employee, freely, to enter into individual contracts underpinned by an independently determined safety net.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear political message to the Labor Party to face the realities of the 1990s, yet it is the message that the present Labor Party wants to ignore. It is the message that has been given to them by one of their former leaders, yet they clearly want to ignore that message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workplace relations bill put forward by this government offers exactly that opportunity, as it also offers a wide range of opportunities to employers and employees to get together and negotiate the most appropriate terms and conditions of work, subject to that independently determined safety net, so that they can enjoy the shared benefits of their particular enterprise, recognising that together they can make an enterprise successful and that they should share the success of that enterprise. They should get rid of the `us and them' mentality that for so long has been fostered by the trade union movement, the Labor Party and our current archaic industrial relations system.</PARA>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition said during the election, `Under a Howard government you will not be worse off.' You certainly will if you happen to be a woman. It may come as a shock to some of those opposite that in 1994 women made up 43 per cent of the paid work force and that 52 per cent of married women were in paid work. More than ever, women are combining work and raising families. This government continues to fail the women of Australia and is doing so yet again with this industrial relations bill. It is failing them through changes to the award system and with its workplace agreements. It is failing them in terms of equal pay. It is failing them by not protecting part&hyphen;time and casual work provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An important aspect of the current award system is the safety net, a set of employment conditions contained in the awards. The government is proposing to strip the industrial commission of its power to arbitrate above a basic minimum standard. Many issues affecting women will be removed from awards. These include, to name a few, equal employment opportunity and workplace harassment, minimum breaks between shifts, occupational health and safety, paid maternity leave, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also plans to abolish paid rates awards, which set actual rates of pay as an alternative to over&hyphen;award payments. Paid rates awards apply particularly in the public sector and their abolition will greatly affect nurses, teachers, community sector workers and lower and middle&hyphen;ranking public servants&mdash;in other words, predominantly women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at state awards: 54 per cent of female employees are covered by state awards. This legislation will make it harder, if not virtually impossible, to move to a federal award. This will severely disadvantage workers in female dominated industries traditionally covered by state awards, such as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1990"> clerical and retail areas and the hospitality, health and community services industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federal awards and agreements will be overridden by state employment agreements. Women starting new jobs in areas otherwise covered by awards and agreements&mdash;even women in existing jobs&mdash;will be required to work under state enterprise agreements. In some states, including my state, Tasmania, these have substantially reduced minimum conditions. These women workers will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about workplace agreements? An Australian workplace agreement as proposed by this government is a secret document. It must be signed by each employee. The agreements are not supposed to go below the minimum entitlements but it is up to the individual worker to ensure that they do not. They must know in detail all their award entitlements. These workplace agreements can be made before the employee starts work. You do not have to be too bright to work out that you have to sign the agreement or you do not get the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the effects on some real people. Christine is a prospective Tasmanian worker. Her situation is typical. Work is going at a new glass manufacturing firm. Christine needs a job and has the required skills. She is lucky, luckier than most unemployed Tasmanians, and gets offered a job. But the job is dependent upon her signing a workplace agreement. She reads it and it sounds okay. She cannot honestly say that she understands it, but she does not have a choice. If she wants to get employment, she has to sign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government plans to make certified agreements, that is, the collective agreements between unions and employers, subject to those new objects of the act which talk about so-called flexibility and productivity&mdash;a euphemism if ever I have heard one. The effect of this on women would be to  encourage agreements which undermine award conditions such as hours of work and penalty rates. The government intends to drop the current requirement that all unions at a workplace negotiate as a single bargaining unit. So in a workplace where the women employees <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are in a minority union, for example, a clerk in a motor repair shop, they are in a very vulnerable position indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example of the case in point: Meredith works as the sole office worker in a smash repair firm. The seven male employees have thrashed out an enterprise agreement with the boss. It suits them and their work conditions. It does not suit Meredith and her work conditions. What can she do? Nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at equal pay. Women already lag significantly behind men in terms of over&hyphen;award payments. The position of women relative to that of men in terms of total remuneration will get worse. Why? Discrimination on the basis of gender will be untrammelled under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, women earn only 54 per cent of the over&hyphen;award payments made to men. The federal Labor government acted on this obvious inequity and in 1994 introduced new equal remuneration provisions. Using these provisions, unions have had major successes in negotiating the removal of clearly discriminatory over&hyphen;award payments, especially for women process workers in the manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission will lose its power to redress discrimination in over&hyphen;award payments. Employers will now be able to discriminate on the basis of sex. The notion of equal pay for equal work will apply to only the minimum basic award. It will not apply to over&hyphen;award payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election, the coalition pledged its support for equal pay. With its hand on its heart it said, `Trust us, we are here to help you.' The federal Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) now wants to repeal the equal pay provisions in the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;a massive step backwards would be a complete understatement. Mr Reith claims that there is already adequate jurisdiction in the area of equal pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition proposes that equal pay will be adequately enforced by the 1969 and 1972 equal pay test case principles, the Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements having equal pay for work of equal value as a minimum standard, and the federal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1991"> Sex Discrimination Act 1984. There are obviously problems with this proposal. These three areas of jurisdiction are clearly inadequate to redress the remaining discrimination in women's wage rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the case of Roberta. Roberta knows that the workplace agreement that she has signed breaches the equal pay standard. When she asks what she can do about it, she is informed that she can take her concerns to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. She may have to wait for up to two years to then go through a complex and daunting process. So what does she do? She gives up and cops the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission is the appropriate body for dealing with these pay related issues. It has the knowledge and the accessibility to give the provisions clout. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Just look for yourselves at the successful settlements of claims under these provisions so far.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at part-time work. The Industrial Relations Commission will be stopped from setting maximum or minimum hours of work for regular part-time employees. Women form the bulk of casual and part-time workers&mdash;75 per cent, in fact. Of working women, 41 per cent work part time. These workers need a regular minimum income to meet family commitments. In the interests of the euphemistic flexibility, the government is proposing to remove all restrictions on part-time work. This will create great uncertainty for these workers, particularly women, and will mean a reduction in wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current award provisions provide for a minimum number of hours of work per week for part-time workers in order to ensure that they are given reasonable work opportunities and income. Consistency in rostering arrangements for part-time workers with family responsibilities is absolutely vital. The removal of requirements for a set number of hours and notice in advance will have a disastrous impact on the many women who are currently juggling work around creche and school hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider this Tasmanian case: John and Mary Smith have two small children. John works full-time as a driveway attendant. His <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hours are variable. Mary works part time as a shop assistant. She has been able to arrange her child care around her reasonably consistent hours of work. She and John are reliant on her contribution to the household budget. Under this legislation, Mary will have no idea from week to week when she will be working, or if, in fact, she can expect to work at all. Her capacity to plan her children's care and to budget has disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new arrangements, employers can arbitrarily pare back an employee's hours one week to virtually nil and increase them dramatically the next week, making it impossible to budget or to organise family commitments around work. Flexible? Sure. Fair? I do not think so. Family friendly? Definitely not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the past weeks, literally dozens of people have contacted by electorate office&mdash;and I assume the same for my colleagues&mdash;expressing their concern about changes to industrial relations and how it will affect them. Many of them have been women, women like those I have mentioned&mdash;Mary, Roberta and Meredith. For this side of the chamber, this legislation strikes at the very heart of our belief in principles of social justice. We believe this legislation is a blatant betrayal of the working women of Australia who voted for the coalition. Let me tell you, they will not forget it when they get a chance to vote again in 1999.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the motion moved by Senator Jacinta Collins, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> notes the overwhelming Australian and overseas evidence that the majority of Australian workers will be disadvantaged by the Government's proposals to reform Australia's industrial relations system; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> condemns the Government for continually failing to acknowledge women's concerns in particular, whilst defending the `rock solid' guarantee of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no worker will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not an area in which I have participated in the Senate before. I want to start my speech by putting into context why I most probably feel so strongly about these reforms. Some time ago, former Senator Richardson <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1992"> asked me&mdash;and I do not suppose we are supposed to reveal conversations held outside in the corridor&mdash;`How did the New South Wales Right ever miss you when you were at university? Why didn't we get you?' I did not have time to fully explain to former Senator Richardson why the New South Wales Right never got me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They never got me because I was politicised as an 11&hyphen;year&hyphen;old when my mother, who was a single mother at the time, had to work full time. She came home one night in tears. She was crying because she worked in a hotel and did not want to join a union. The union had said that they would black ban the hotel if she did not join. She was put between a rock and a hard place: she was either not going to have a job, with a child she had to rear on her own, or she was going to have to join the union. That is not social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can Senator Mackay come in here and talk about social justice when my mother was forced to join a union because her employer, the hotel she was working at, was not going to be supplied with grog unless she joined the union? There were a lot of women who worked with my mother who were not going to join the union. The employer finally paid their union fees so she could get the beer, grog, cigarettes and everything else delivered to her hotel because she was going to be black banned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the major issue that politicised me. I decided from then on I would never ever be forced to join a union. I would go to the wall, I would go to gaol, I would do anything not to join a union. I could not see what benefit my mother was getting. She was working for an employer who was incredibly compassionate. In fact, she was working for a long distant relative by marriage of Senator Parer who was one of the most compassionate employers. None of her workers wanted to join a union yet they were forced to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A bit further down the track, when I was at Monash University, the problems for women in particular when they are forced to join a union were reinforced for me. I happened to be deputy warden of a halls of residence at a time when there was a cleaners strike. The general staff of the university went on strike <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over some issue. We had students who were unable to get food because we could not get food delivered. There were all sorts of things. There were lots of inconveniences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that concerned me most was when the woman who used to clean my apartment came to me in tears and said, `I hope you didn't see me picketing outside the university.' I said that I had not seen her. She said, `I didn't want to picket. I chose to go at 5 a.m. because I was rung up and told that if I did not picket my kids would not find their way home from school.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the social justice in that, Senator Mackay? Where is the social justice in a woman being threatened to picket? We can stand here and talk about employers who are unfair, who have done things that are not appropriate&mdash;and we all know that that occurs&mdash;but I have just given examples, and I am sure other colleagues can give example after example, where unions have not played the game properly either. There would be examples where they have not behaved appropriately, where they have abused their privileges, where they have abused their membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can find fault on both sides. We are prepared to stand up here and agree that there are employers who have not always done the right thing, but I do not hear the other side getting up and saying that unions have not always done the right thing. Not one speaker on the other side has said that. It is as though the unions are always right, always do the right thing, always do things for the social justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see someone on the other side shaking his head. He most probably has examples of where they have not actually performed their duty but in fact done a disservice to their members. That is one of the positions I am coming from. That issue most probably continued to cement my politicisation towards the Liberal side of politics because I could not see women, in particular, being served very well by unions in either of those instances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side is saying the world will fall in because of this workplace relations bill. That is not the case. There are protections, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1993"> there are safeguards in place which mean we will have a more productive society. I have family who run small businesses and who now will not employ people because of the unfair dismissal law&mdash;and do not raise your eyebrows! They prefer not to increase production because it is too hard to get rid of somebody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only the other day I was talking to an organisation in Melbourne which wrote to me because somebody had engraved their name and various other bits and bobs all over the furniture in its building. It has cost that organisation something like $80,000 in legal fees to finally dismiss this person, who continued to engrave all over the office furniture, doors and all sorts of other pieces around its office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can raise your eyebrows about that but lots of people would be better off if employers were in a position to employ them. They are not employing them now. Business after business comes to us and says that they are not putting people on. The pharmacist down the road from me said, `I am not going to put anybody on because if they are hopeless I can't get rid of them.' So really they are saying that they will not create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who have the unions been protecting? They have not protected the three quarters of a million people who are presently unemployed. I have not heard one speaker from the other side talk about all the people who are unemployed because unions have the sorts of policies that they have and because of the sorts of industrial relations rules that exist. Not one person on the other side has talked about rights and social justice for the unemployed&mdash;not one. Many are unemployed because of the current union inability to accept that the unfair dismissal laws in particular discourage employers from employing people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill workers will be better off, despite what the Labor Party says. They will be recognised and respected. They will not be disadvantaged in the way Senator Jacinta Collins asserts in her notice of motion. The bill respects and values the fact that the Australian work force is diverse. It will open up the industrial relations system to workers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who traditionally have been neglected by the system, and that includes women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the primary ways this will be done is by focusing on individual employers and employees rather than on traditional industrial relations institutions. Currently, unions can enter into an agreement with an employer and have it certified by the commission without even getting the support of the employees who will be affected. The commission should look into the agreement and make sure that workers are not disadvantaged but, in practice, the commission just takes the union's word that they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is implemented is what is best for the union rather than what is best for the worker. In many cases what is implemented is what is best for male unionists without taking into account what is best for the female members of a union. The coalition wants to reverse that situation. We want deals negotiated that will not leave workers worse off, and we want deals negotiated without the unions unnecessarily influencing the outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go through some of the things that various speakers have said. Senator Jacinta Collins talked about the exploitation of outworkers under a deregulated labour market. Labor has been in power for 13 years. Some of you might say that this issue is about federal and state awards, but it was not a Labor member of the Senate who decided to initiate a Senate inquiry into outworkers. If Labor members were so concerned about this matter, why didn't they initiate such an inquiry? For Senator Collins to talk about the exploitation of outworkers when Labor has been in power for 13 years reflects more on Senator Collins than on the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts said that you cannot judge an industrial relations system by the behaviour of a good employer. I think you could argue that you cannot judge an industrial relations system by what a good union does either. As I have pointed out before, there are situations in which unions do not always work in the best interests of individual members. Unions have not worked effectively to protect the rights of workers. I will talk about that more in a moment when I talk about part&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1994">time work and what has happened in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Childs said that the legislation was social Darwinism&mdash;the strong prosper and the weak suffer&mdash;and was going back to dinosaurs. He talked about people working in factories whose first language was not English and how disadvantaged they would be. I can only think that he is talking about one of two possible situations, the first of which is where there is a non&hyphen;union certified agreement, the terms of which will have been approved by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second is where there is an Australian workplace agreement. This agreement will not have been vetted by the commission&mdash;I admit that&mdash;but the worker, if they so choose, can be a member of a union and have a union person negotiate on their behalf. If the worker is not satisfied or if there be some breach of the Australian workplace agreement, they have access to the employment advocate. This will be a specialist advisory body that will give advice and pay legal fees if the employer does not meet minimum standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill enables the employment advocate's advice and assistance function to be contracted out in accordance with suitable funding and accountability arrangements. One option which has been given close consideration is partially contracting out some functions of the advocate to non&hyphen;government community organisations. Workers who have been traditionally marginalised, such as women from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds, may feel more comfortable seeking help from community based organisations. They will have access to both those sorts of organisations and an employment advocate to deal with their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Mackay was speaking it appeared as though the only right workers had was to go to the equal opportunities or human rights commission and wait two years. When she was talking about Christine, Roberta, Mr and Mrs Smith and the other few inhabitants of Tasmania that she knows by name, Senator Mackay made no mention of the fact that if they had an Australian workplace agreement they had the right to go to an employment advocate. Labor avoids telling all the story. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> They like to run around spreading myths, stirring up anxiety and peddling untruths in order to take away from the debate on the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, they do not say how unions could assist in this exercise. No doubt there are some unions and some unionists who will participate. They will have to because the union movement is now haemorrhaging. Obviously, people do not feel that the unions are representing them because membership is dropping. Campaigns are running here and there to increase union membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are people leaving the unions? Because they do not think the unions are doing the right job by them. Hopefully the unions will lift their game and, under the new regime, represent those who choose to join a union. And it will be by choice. That is the important thing. There will be the choice to join a union or not to join a union. Hopefully, the union will, in fact, participate in what we believe will be a much more effective workplace and environment, both for workers and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Jacinta Collins went on about the motion disadvantaging women. The current system has disadvantaged women enormously. What has happened is employers are not prepared to put on people on full&hyphen;time awards. The unions have not encouraged permanent part-time work, and what that has done is force people into casual employment where they do not have the benefits of sick leave and other protections. They have been forced into casual work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are those people who have been forced into casual work? Mainly women. But the unions do not worry about that. As long as its union membership is protected, it does not worry about the people who have been forced out into casual work&mdash;people who cannot get permanent part-time work or permanent full-time work. As long as its union members' jobs are protected&mdash;especially those who are in the organisational section of the union&mdash;it does not worry about social justice for, in particular, those women who have been forced into part-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the unions have resisted part-time work, there has been a large growth in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1995"> part-time work over the last few years. Part-time employment has increased from 6.5 per cent of employees in August 1988 to 8.8 per cent in August 1995, and casual part-time employment has increased from 12.8 per cent to 17 per cent of employees over the same period. What people are saying is that they want part-time employment. Many of them would prefer permanent part-time employment so that they can have access to sick leave and the other benefits, but, of course, as I said, very few of the unions have been advocates for that and have pushed for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industrial relations system in this country has traditionally favoured the interests of full&hyphen;time adult males. It is a result of the position that unions and the previous government played in the system and, as I said, the fact that the majority of unions have been dominated by full&hyphen;time adult males.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the workplace relations bill, compulsory unionism will be outlawed, which will result in agreements only being certified by the commission if they have the support of the majority of the work force. This will mean that unions will do what the workers want rather than telling workers what they want. The unions will be the workers' agents, as they should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I look forward to participating further in the debate as the legislation comes forward. I look forward to seeing more and more articles like the one that appeared yesterday. Senator Ferguson talked about an article by Des Fooks in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday. He wrote at length about the importance of the industrial relations bill and the impact it will have on training and training for young people. In particular, again, this will affect women who want to increase their training or particular women who want to re-enter the work force. As he said, the bill makes sense for trainees. It will, in fact, be a positive for women. There will be more and more people coming out telling about the advantages, not only for women but for workers in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms in the bill are a response to the community's needs and demands that action can be taken to create more jobs, train young people, recognise the value of women workers and achieve a higher standard of living for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workers and their families. The crucial point for all workers, particularly women workers, is that all work agreements cannot lead to employees being paid less than they would get under the award. In other words, workers will be better off under the new system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the workplace relations bill is a bill for  all Australian workers and one which will see them better off and in control of their own destiny. It is a bill about freedom of choice, and I emphasise that. I started my comments on that note and I end on the note that it is about freedom of choice, better working conditions and recognition of the value of each individual worker.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that many thousands of Australian workers and their families will be disadvantaged by the actions of this coalition government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now see the manic drive by the coalition government to cut expenditure, and that is producing situations where people are going to become&mdash;and are becoming&mdash;worse off because they are losing their jobs. Massive cutbacks to occur in the Public Service will result in the retrenchment of many hundreds of workers. The closure of CES offices and Department of Social Security offices throughout the country will not only affect the workers directly employed in those organisations but have a consequential impact upon those people out there in the community who rely upon the services of the CES and the Department of Social Security in looking for work and in other social security areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will have the workplace relations bill before the Senate in the next session, following its consideration by the Senate economics committee. This bill is nothing more than an ideologically motivated attack upon workers in this country and their representative organisations. This is the culmination of the Prime Minister's long desire, now an obsession, to reform&mdash;the words he used&mdash;the labour <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1996"> market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the coalition's policy document that they took to the last election, misnamed `Better pay for better work'. In the very title there is the inference that Australian workers do not work hard enough or well enough.

It is about attempting to destroy or dismantle the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you read the Governor-General's speech, which was presented on behalf of the government at the opening of parliament, again right up there in lights at the very start of the speech is all this rhetoric about reform of the labour market. Consequently, there are attacks upon the trade union movement, because the coalition has this obsessional belief that the trade union movement is an impediment to reform in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to have some grasp of what is in store for workers in this country under this bill, you need to first of all have a look at a bit of history to see where the coalition government is coming from. What we have seen in the bill and what we have heard in the speeches from the government members this evening is what we have heard for years and years. They are the sorts of insults and attacks upon trade unions and upon trade union leaders. That is essentially the extent of the contributions they make to any rational debate about industrial relations in this country. Get stuck into the union officials. Get stuck into the union officials who happen to be members of parliament. Make snide remarks, like Senator Alston did today and like Senator Chapman has done, that somehow these people are not worthy of even being called workers or are not worthy of even becoming members of parliament because they are trade union officials. How terrible! They say they have never lived in the real world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not seem to consider people like Senator Alston, Senator Hill and Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Vanstone, who are members of that great trade union&mdash;the legal profession, the Law Society, which sets its charges. There is a scale of fees for lawyers, a minimum set, and they charge well over it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. What about the farmers? What about the farmers union of Western Australia? You do not hear us over here on this side attacking the motives or the integrity of members of the government because they happen to have had some previous professional career and have been members of a representative organisation. Nevertheless, according to you over here we have us trade union officials who do not represent anybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that people like Senator Collins and myself are very proud of the fact that we came from the trade union movement. I am proud of the fact that before I went into the trade union movement I worked in the oil industry, the building industry, the liquor industry and in the rural sector. When I was working for the trade union movement, I travelled the length and breadth of this country. We talked to workers and represented workers because that was our job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's look at the history. The history of the coalition whilst it was in opposition was what? It was to oppose every single national wage increase that was ever sought, except for the last two. The now Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his previous career as a barrister represented the National Farmers Federation on a number of occasions in cases that I was involved in&mdash;and Senator Crane knows this full well&mdash;and opposed national wage increases for shearers and other rural workers time and time again, opposed them getting superannuation. Then you have the hide to come in here and say to us that you are on about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1997"> protecting low paid workers, that you are on about giving them freedom of choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that during that same period, the Hawke and Keating government&mdash;whilst the coalition were out there opposing national wage increases, opposing other improvements such as superannuation and other social wage benefits, the introduction of paternity and maternity leave&mdash;the Labor government was involved in improving the lot of ordinary working Australians: improving their real wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally incorrect, as a number of speakers in the coalition have said, to say that real wages declined during the Hawke and Keating years. Real wages, in fact, increased during that period. They increased quite substantially. Real wages, in terms of real average weekly earnings for full-time adults, increased by 7.3 per cent over the 13 years of the Labor government. Real average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time adults increased by 5.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is about time speakers in the coalition got their facts straight. Those increases do not even include the additional benefits that came through in terms of superannuation, ratcheting up to the equivalent of nine per cent by the year 2000. Where was the then opposition, the now government, when all of this was happening? They were busy opposing all of these improvements and attacking trade union leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to the evidence from overseas. It is quite clear that the coalition is still locked into Thatcherism and Reaganism in terms of their approach to industrial relations. During the Reagan years in the United States between 1980 and 1988, the minimum wage was frozen&mdash;frozen for eight years. Each time there was an attempt to increase it, it was vetoed. The only reason any increases in the minimum wage have come about is essentially through the actions of the Democratic Party and President Clinton. In England, under Prime Minister Thatcher, virtually the entire industrial north of England was destroyed in terms of its capacity to deliver jobs for people in those regions and growth for the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the small amount of time I have left, I would like to concentrate on one or two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues relating to the workplace relations bill. The coalition government says that it is going to maintain minimum standards in awards. But what it is doing is actually legislating to remove a huge range of conditions that currently apply in minimum rates awards. Such things as superannuation will no longer be a requirement&mdash;by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are conditions that have been negotiated, agreed and put into awards, or have been arbitrated by the commission and put into awards in this country. But under your legislation, they will be removed. Things such as superannuation; meal breaks; training; travelling, transport and fare allowances; accident pay; time and wage records; and right of entry will be removed. There is a long list of them. As Senator Crane would know, pick up any award of the Industrial Relations Commission and you will see those things enshrined in minimum rates awards. They have been regarded as entitlements for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that once you remove them by legislation and you seek to move to a system of either workplace agreements or non-union based enterprise agreements, the balance is tilted and those conditions will disappear very quickly. When the employee fronts up for the job and is presented with the contract of employment, prepared by some industrial consultant on behalf of the employer, it will not have those conditions in it. The story will be: if you do not agree to that, you do not get the job. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste. The report, which was released in April 1996, is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">No time to waste</EMPHASIS> . The committee received many submissions in relation to the issues of the production, transport and storage of radioactive waste in Australia. A lot of work was put into this committee and its outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For me, perhaps one of the most important outcomes of the main report was that, despite what could be considered to be very short-sighted approaches by many bodies, including government bodies, the preferred option of the committee, after hearing all the evidence, was that any storage site, if there is to be a national site, should be an engineered above&hyphen; ground site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is really important. Often communities have felt that the choices were that they would either have a minimum engineered solution in a site that was considered, for some environmental reasons, to be appropriate or minimum risk or some such category, or there would be some sort of attempt at engineering, within a price range, a site which might be in a suburban area, near a water course and so on. So the choices for many people have seemed limited. It is not surprising that the response from communities around Australia asked to host radioactive waste dumps, whether it was a proposal for a national waste dump or for a state facility, have been antagonistic in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many aspects of the report which are worthy of consideration, including the ability of communities to be involved in decision making and so on. But there were areas where I disagreed with the main body of the report. In that sense, I joined with Senator Bell from the Democrats to write a dissenting report to the report of the radioactive waste inquiry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas that we were concerned about included the creation and handling of radioactive waste from hospitals and research institutions. We did not believe that there should be a general exemption from these institutions because part of the problem was that we often talked about the cost of these decisions. We believe that the real cost, even the health and environmental cost, ought to be taken into consideration. The argument could not simply be that we are doing this research to benefit human health when the benefits and costs to human health, if there are any, should be considered when a decision is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at the issue of user pays and the pricing of radioisotopes. We did not believe that the taxpayers of Australia should be heavily subsidising the price of radioisotopes because, once again, the real costs of transport, storage and final outcomes of radio nuclides should be incorporated somehow in the decision that is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at the need for regulatory controls of industry which create nuclear waste. We felt they should be independent of the industry's ability to pay. You do not start from the end point of what this industry is prepared to pay for waste monitoring or disposal, such as a tailings dam, and work from there. You should look at what is a safe method of disposal. If it happens that that method makes the industry unprofitable, then that is the reality. In my opinion, those figures should be included in the calculation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern was expressed to the committee in relation to the handling of spent fuel rods from the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor. Many members of the Senate would have seen recent media reports about the concerns of people from Dounreay at receiving Australia's nuclear outcomes from Lucas Heights&mdash;fuel rods. When we visited Lucas Heights the fuel rods were in a temporary bay which was in a pond. There was a rail which came up to just over one's waist. It was not impossible to bend down and put your hand in the pond. That was a fairly scary concept to me. Whatever the real or perceived risks&mdash;they were considered to be highly radioactive sources&mdash;you could put your hand into the water which was between you and the radioactive sources.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1999">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were also areas where those rods were stored in a shed in a concrete floor. Each rod was in a hole in the floor with a cap. It is still a scary thing that what is happening in Lucas Heights tends to be like a holding pattern: you hope that you can push the rods off to somewhere else but eventually Australia gets them back. One wonders what the implications will be for Australia supplying uranium, say, to 12 nuclear power plants in Indonesia eventually. Will we then be able to refuse to accept receiving fuel rods back from those power sources? What do we intend to do with them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at the feasibility of dumping low or intermediate level radioactive waste in active uranium mines. Certainly at that stage we were still looking at terms of reference which only looked at radioactive waste and excluded mention of uranium mining and milling. That is why for me it was a logical conclusion to use the structure of this committee to go on to the next terms of reference, which we now have in relation to uranium mining and milling. It seems silly that we should be talking about using uranium mines when there had not been any parliamentary scrutiny of the safety or dangers of uranium mining and milling since the Fox report&mdash;and that was not specifically a parliamentary inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were concerned whether a national radioactive storage facility is an acceptable proposition, whether the preference should be&mdash;and, in our opinion, could be&mdash;for state&hyphen;based facilities. It was rather concerning that a large part of the perceived problem from the communities was the transport of radioactive waste around Australia. If you had one designated national radioactive waste dump, you would have a lot more risk involved with transporting radioactive materials across Australia in various forms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was concern about the promotion and use of photoelectric smoke detectors&mdash;that is, it is a growing source. There is not a huge amount of radioactivity in each source but we are looking at whether we are putting the right price signals into such things and whether we should be putting a price signal into other forms of smoke detectors. That was what made photoelectric smoke detectors <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more attractive in comparison to radioactive sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at the export of used medical radiotherapy sources as aid. We make points of criticism in relation to whether we are actually assisting countries by, if you like, dumping radioactive sources on them without checking whether they have the ability to properly store the waste that they will have to deal with in the long run. We were assured that those sources were still useful. They took longer to take X-rays but they were still useful. But I do wonder whether it was an ethical thing to, if you like, prey on the vulnerability of many developing countries by offering them sources which we had no intention of checking whether they could be stored safely after their useful life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at the general issue of the practice of dilution and dispersal of radiotoxins. I would like to thank Senator Bell for working with me on the minority report. I would especially like to thank Senator Coulter for his time on the committee and the work that he did, especially when he was suffering from ill health during that time. He did a lot of work and it was extremely useful for the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay special tribute to the secretariat&mdash;Theresa, Geoff and Winifred but in particular Cheryl Scarlett, the committee secretary&mdash;and to the chair, Senator Chapman, for the work that he has done. I think it was a useful report. I think it provides a good basis. I am glad that we now have a uranium mining and milling inquiry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;As chairman of this select committee, I conclude the debate in the context of having opened it last sitting Thursday but having my remarks cut very short by the imminence of the adjournment. As we know, the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste was tabled out of session on 29 April. It was a very timely presentation because that date was the 10th anniversary of the then Soviet government's admission of the Chernobyl disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia does not have a nuclear power industry. The amount of radioactive waste <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2000"> created in Australia is only a minute fraction of what is produced in some other countries. Therefore, fortunately, it is not possible for Australia to experience a Chernobyl-type accident. Nevertheless, the disastrous consequences of Chernobyl are a salutary reminder of the need for adequate regulation of radioactive materials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radioactive materials used in industry and medicine, some of which save lives, do provide benefits; however, they also have potential health risks if the radioactive waste is not managed safely. Radioactive waste cannot be destroyed. Radioactivity decays naturally over periods which may take millions of years. In using radioactive materials to obtain benefits, there is a price to be paid. That price is eternal vigilance in managing the waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was concerned at the lack of up-to-date information on Australia's radioactive holdings. A national inventory of radioactive waste has not been prepared since 1986. The committee was told that radioactive waste is stored in approximately 100 places around Australia, but it seems that the exact figure is quite uncertain. The committee has therefore recommended that an up-to-date inventory be compiled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some conservation groups argued that the way to eliminate radioactive waste is to eliminate the use of radioactive materials altogether. This is not realistic because of the important uses of radioactive materials. Nevertheless, that does not diminish the importance of minimising the creation of radioactive waste and safely managing the waste which is created. We can achieve both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our report stresses this need to minimise the creation of radioactive waste. The hierarchy of waste management&mdash;reduce, reuse, recycle and treat before disposal&mdash;should apply as much to radioactive waste as to any other category of waste. Research projects which create radioactive waste, in hospitals for example, should undergo rigorous justification processes to weigh the likely benefits against the difficulty of handling the waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Consideration should be given to increased funding for research into alternative technology, such as cyclotrons, to replace technolo gies which use radioactive materials or create radioactive waste. There is potential to recycle</PARA>
<PARA>radioactive sources in domestic smoke detectors because the sources are much more long lived than the other parts of the smoke detectors. The committee suggests that more research could be done in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A user pays system for storing waste in a central, publicly owned facility would seem to be an obvious way to discourage creation of radioactive waste. That brings me to the question of a national repository for radioactive waste. This was one of the major questions before the committee. The issue of a national repository has been considered since 1979. The previous government's proposal was for a shallow burial site for permanent disposal of low level waste and some intermediate level waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee heard two main views on the merits of a national repository. Those in favour thought a national repository would be a safer place for waste than the many small private stores which exist, often in populous areas across the country. Those against the establishment of a central repository thought it would encourage an `out of sight, out of mind' mentality and reduce the incentive to minimise the creation of waste. These witnesses thought that bodies creating waste should be forced to store it on site to ensure that the full costs are borne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, the majority of the committee favours the first view. A national facility is required; however, we do not favour as a repository a shallow burial site for permanent, irretrievable disposal. The committee favours an above-ground storage facility. The main reason for this is that storage, rather than permanent disposal, would allow for easier recovery of radioactive material in future for recycling or conditioning if technological advances make this viable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not surprisingly, the committee found the issues involved in implementing an appropriate user pays system for a central storage facility quite complex. In some cases, waste from obsolete technologies is stored, but those bodies responsible for this waste are no longer adding to those stores. This raises the question of how much should be charged to solve <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2001"> problems which were unforeseen 30 years ago. Other bodies, such as the Department of Defence, have adopted the waste of others over the years since it could be added to its own stores without cost. Again, this raises the question as to whether those bodies should now be charged for waste removal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other issues concerning a user pays system include identifying criteria for setting charges to cover long-term costs, valuing uncertain costs and benefits&mdash;for example, the benefits of medical research in saving lives against the costs and risks of managing the waste for long periods&mdash;and the need to pre-empt the temptation to dispose of waste illegally or hold it in inadequate stores to avoid the payment of charges. The committee believes that these issues should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A clear distinction must be drawn between historic waste and future creation of waste. For historic waste, the concept of user pays as an incentive to minimise is irrelevant. The overriding issue is the safe management of an inherited problem. It would be appropriate, in the interests of safety, to accept this waste at a central facility on a subsidised basis. On the other hand, bodies continuing to create waste in future should meet the full cost of managing the waste. They should either pay to use a central facility or make their own arrangements on site&mdash;subject, of course, to adequate regulation and monitoring. In this way, the cost of managing waste will remain an incentive to minimise the creation of waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for adequate regulation and monitoring cannot be understated. Under the constitution, regulation of radioactive materials is primarily a matter for state and territory laws. However, in practice Commonwealth bodies, mainly the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, produce approximately 90 per cent of Australia's radioactive waste. As these Commonwealth bodies are not generally bound by state laws, this leaves a regulatory gap which was of concern to many witnesses at the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The previous government proposed the creation of an Australian Institute of Radiation Protection with appropriate power to control Commonwealth bodies' use of radio active materials. The committee strongly supports this proposal. International standards require an independent regulatory authority. This would go some way to repairing community concern, evident in many submissions, about the authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the committee does have some concerns about whether the Institute of Radiation Protection, as now proposed, will be truly independent of the industry which it is supposed to be regulating. This is an inherent problem in a small specialised field, such as nuclear science, where the staff of the regulator may look to the industry for future career moves. There will need to be particular care to design the Institute of Radiation Protection so that it really is seen to be at arm's length from bodies such as ANSTO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like also to mention evidence received by the committee from the Australian Federal Police and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission in relation to the alleged importation of radioactively contaminated equipment into Queensland. The Queensland CJC discovered in a Gold Coast shopping centre stored X-ray equipment which had been imported from the United States. A faxitron radiographic inspection system was confiscated by the Queensland Health Department because the owner did not have a licence. Initially a TI&hyphen;204 thickness gauge probe was also seized, but was later returned as it did not constitute a breach of the relevant state act. This evidence touched on other aspects of Operation Wallah and Operation Gallon, which was dealt with at length in in camera hearings of the committee and about which there are some continuing concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, as chairman of the committee, I would like to commend the other members of the committee who worked very hard on this matter. I join with Senator Margetts in particularly commending former Senator Coulter, whose scientific expertise was very useful to the work of this committee. I thank the secretary of the committee, Cheryl Scarlett, and her assistants, Theresa Rodgers and Geoff Dawson, and other members of the committee secretariat, together <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2002"> with my own research assistant, Andrea Bell, for their outstanding work during the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was a busy one. We held 11 public hearings as well as several in camera hearings, to which I referred a moment ago, and on some occasions we met on half a dozen occasions in the same fortnight. The secretariat worked tirelessly to support our schedule, as well as providing the scientific expertise that was so necessary for this inquiry.</PARA>

In many areas, this represents only about seven per cent of the total funds, which means that an awful lot of the funds are being siphoned off before they reach the groups that they are really meant to service. The second is the use of national landcare funds by state government agencies at the expense of landcare groups.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2003"> That is disgraceful. That is a rorting of the tax system. I will be writing to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) tomorrow about this very mat ter&mdash;to highlight that and ascertain whether the Tasmanian Conservation Trust ought to retain its tax deductible status when it behaves in a fashion such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the taxpayers of Tasmania recall that, when Senator-elect Bob Brown retired from the Tasmanian parliament, he got a payout of, I think, about $250,000 from the parliamentary superannuation fund. Good luck to him. He was entitled to it. But for him now to try to have his costs paid at the taxpayers' expense, through the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, I have to say leaves a very nasty taste in my mouth. It would be fair to say that, in relation to what he was campaigning against, I happen to agree with what was happening. It was the very successful link road linking the north&hyphen;west of Tasmania with the west coast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Tasmania are very appreciative of the fact that the Tasmanian state government finally undertook the construction of that road and completed it, when I think it was Labor Party policy to construct such a road as far back as 1946. I think both sides of politics have been promising the road for about half a century. It is finally being built. But, whilst it was being built, Senator-elect Brown and others engaged on a campaign for which he was found guilty of wilful obstruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a democratic system. I do not condone the breaking of the law, and he was found guilty of that. In fact, that makes me smile somewhat, because some people accuse me of being a `conviction politician', saying that I stand very firm by the convictions I hold. Senator-elect Brown will bring a different meaning to that term when he enters this place as a convicted politician.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point that I really want to make is that the Tasmanian Conservation Trust is going to allow itself to be used in this way and, undoubtedly, Bob Brown would know that his legal costs are going to be assisted through this mechanism. That really needs to be exposed, and, once again, it highlights what a number of us on this side have been saying for some time. That is that the Greens and&mdash;dare I say&mdash;the Democrats for some strange reason try to say that the way they play politics and do things is on a higher plane than the old parties&mdash;the Labor Party and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Liberal Party. They are the old parties. We do everything above board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have another classic example where the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, very closely intertwined with Dr Bob Brown and the Tasmanian Greens, is playing a stunt&mdash;which I think would even make Gary Gray, from the Australian Labor Party, blush&mdash;on the taxation system. I do not think they even tried that stunt for the defence of Carmen Lawrence when they were trying to raise money. They tell me, Kim, that that fund is still a bit short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, we will see how that goes. I hope that the Australian Labor Party, when they try to make up the funds for the Carmen Lawrence defence campaign, do not embark on a similar system whereby donations can be made through what is ostensibly an appropriate organisation and people can get tax deductibility for them and then, in effect, launder the money out for a purpose for which the trust, I would suggest, was not&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to place on record some concerns I have with the process for assessing the Jabiluka mine proposal. I do this on behalf of some of the Aboriginal people in that area who have deep concerns about this proposal.  The senior traditional owner for the area, Yvonne Margarula, has expressed not once but several times the complete opposition of traditional owners to the project going ahead. The impression, however, has been created that the majority of the traditional owners are of another view. I understand that this is not the case. We are assured that the majority of the traditional owners are opposed to a go&hyphen;ahead for the Jabiluka project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yvonne Margarula talks of the poison to her people and the poison to her land resulting from the mine. She is concerned about the impacts on the river system and the impacts on the health of her people. She is worried about alcoholism and death rates in her family and her community. I might add that I have had 35 years experience with Aboriginal communities&mdash;living in them, working with them and supporting them&mdash;in almost every state of the Commonwealth. I can underline the devastating effect that development close to traditional Aboriginal communities has had upon those communities. What is being said by this woman is not being lightly said, but is very much a cry from the depths of her heart. She is worried about her family and her community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill has stated repeatedly that he regards the consent of the traditional owners of Jabiluka as essential. However, now that the traditional owners, represented by the senior traditional owner of the land, have so clearly indicated their opposition, the Democrats trust that he will listen to them and respond appropriately.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday in this chamber I raised a series of problems about the JORN project of the Department of Defence, in which Telstra is the major contractor. These concerns emerged out of an Auditor-General's report into the progress of this $1.1 billion contract. I rise again tonight <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2005"> to deal with it because of some matters that have been raised in the media as a result of that Auditor-General's report and the speeches made by Senator MacGibbon and me on Tuesday. I also rise because a more detailed reading of that audit report, which I have had since then, increases my concerns about the extent to which neither the defence department nor Telstra have, it appears to me, come fully clean on what the situation really is. How much of a loss does Telstra really face? What sorts of cost overruns are there really in this multi&hyphen;billion dollar contract?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are well aware of the fact that the 1994-95 annual report of the defence department was criticised by the Auditor-General for saying that JORN, the over-the-horizon radar program, design activity is nearing completion, confidence that the specifications would be met was high and the radar hardware was in production. The fact is that the situation is nothing like as cheerful as that. The matter is very much behind time, over cost and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Auditor-General, Defence explained that the comments made in that annual report were made on good faith on the basis of advice before Telstra's JORN technical audit report became available late in 1995. As I said on Tuesday, the audit office considers that Defence needs to pay more attention to public accountability for expenditure of public funds and the basis of its comments about JORN in its published annual report. This is evident from the fact that over previous years it was clear to Defence and Telstra that this contract was not going well and it was well behind. There were indications as early as 1992. The Auditor-General deals with that at some length.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What also concerns me&mdash;perhaps probably more than this failure by the defence department to come clean in its annual report&mdash;is the failure of Telstra to mention this $1.1 billion matter, in which it is the prime contractor to the tune of $800 million, in its annual report. It might argue that the damning remarks were made after its annual report was closed off. That is simply not so. There have been substantial comments about this matter <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on internal Telstra reports, which surely would have come to the attention of the people preparing the annual report and the chairman who signed it off and the chief executive who had some lengthy statements in this report. For example, the Auditor-General reports on page 22:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lesson to be learnt from this is that risks associated with complex work handovers should have been identified and reduced long before 1995, as they were reported to the JPO in Telstra's Risk Management reports of 13 March and 1 June 1992 . . . Instead, the contracting team problems remained significant despite senior executive representations by Defence in 1993 and 1994. One of the key adverse findings in the contractor's JORN Technical Audit report in 1995 was the degree of diffused and avoided responsibility within and between the contracting teams.</PARA>
<PARA>What strikes me as of major concern is that the directors of Telstra state in their annual report, dated September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Directors are not aware of any matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year that in the opinion of the Directors has significantly or may significantly affect the operations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of Telstra. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Economic Entity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Telstra&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in subsequent financial years.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, that is just bunkum. They knew that this potential multimillion dollar loss was there to the extent that they even described it as follows in Telstra's response to the draft of the report which the Auditor&hyphen;General showed them:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra's initial inexperience served only to compound this situation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem of a badly constructed contract. Telstra continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As such a fixed price, fixed schedule contract was clearly inappropriate and Telstra believes it will continue to incur unreasonable losses until this issue is resolved.</PARA>
<PARA>Unreasonable losses, according to Telstra itself, yet there is not one mention of that in its annual report, not one mention of it to the Senate committees that have, over time, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2006"> inquired either during the estimates process or in the annual report process and not one word from Telstra during the time of the previous government about the potential for multimillion dollar losses. Much to my astonishment, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  today reports a Mr Morrison, who is apparently in charge of this project in Telstra, as saying:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra remains confident that it could deliver a radar working to specifications despite the delays arising from software development.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without further technical hitches, he believed the company could also break even on the contract it won in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>Either Mr Morrison, in his comments to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> , was being excessively hopeful and cheerful, or the Telstra response to the Auditor&hyphen;General in which it said that Telstra believes it will continue to incur `unreasonable losses' was being excessively gloomy. Perhaps one of them is just plain wrong and misleading the Australian people. This sort of thing is absurd. I notice also that Defence officials, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>  story, say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra could be forced to spend up to $125 million over the contract price to deliver the network that is designed to become Australia's `trip wire' over a huge arc to the north of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>With all these differing views about the exposure Telstra has to this enormously mismanaged contract, I think it is about time we had some truth. It is about time Telstra came clean. I know that might be something that Telstra does not like doing much because it still has this monopolist approach and attitude to saying anything to anybody. Senate estimates committees have had great difficulty getting the facts out of Telstra. To see the dimensions of the problem, the Auditor&hyphen;General's report says on page 23:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has to bear the impact of this problem, the likely cost of which is partly indicated by Defence's payments to the contractors for JORN Project Management. These payments have now reached $130 million, $56 million above the $74 million target price of this component.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a 75 per cent blow&hyphen;out of some substance. I do not know to what extent GEC Marconi is a subcontractor, but they have had to restructure Telstra and GEC Marconi have restructured themselves. It is worthwhile noting that, when he was minister, Senator Ray was not terribly convinced about the assurances he continued to get that everything was going well. In fact, at Senate estimates on 2 June 1995, when he was asked how the project was going, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have talked to GEC Marconi and I went and saw Lord Weinstock at the very top. The latest weasel <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> words . . . are that they are running on time with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. Most information cited in the Sydney Morning Herald was taken from statements of information published by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services following outcome standards monitoring visits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As reported one third of all nursing homes in NSW meet all the 31 criteria and fully comply with the Commonwealth standards. This does not, of itself, however present a clear or fair picture of the actual quality of care provided. For example, a home might be marked down against criteria relating to building design or structure because of its age, yet provide very good care in a safe environment because of its practices and the commitment of staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where homes do not meet standards to the extent that there is a serious threat to residents' health and welfare and the proprietor is either not willing or able to comply with the standards, a declaration can be made under the National Health Act 1953 that the home does not satisfy standards. Currently there are only 41 out of 1450 (3%) Commonwealth funded nursing homes which have been declared. Nursing homes declared as not satisfying the standards may also be subject to financial and other sanctions. In the last resort, a home may have its approval revoked thereby ceasing to be  eligible to receive Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In some instances specific matters raised in the articles  were up to two years old and related to issues which had been investigated and have been resolved satisfactorily or are being addressed by Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Nursing homes which do not satisfy standards are treated on a case by case basis with Commonwealth officers working closely with proprietors to ensure their standards of care improve. The Government is committed to quality of care in nursing homes and where improvements do not occur action, including imposition of sanctions, will be taken.</PARA>
