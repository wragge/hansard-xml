<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's rationale for amending the conveniently belong provision is that it wants to encourage competition between unions.

We also accept the Bill's repeal of s118 (which permits the Commission to consult in making a s118A order). For reasons already stated, the Opposition believes that if the existing `conveniently belong' rule is to be modified to permit greater competition between unions any restraints on that competition should be removed. Consistent with this, the capacity for employers to seek these orders from the Commission should be removed. Consequentially, Commission consultation provisions must also be removed.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Ms Rehn</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PROPOSED PART XA OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT 1988&mdash;VALIDITY OF UNION REPRESENTATION AND MEMBERSHIP PROVISIONS IN AWARDS AND CERTIFIED AGREEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated 13 August 1996 seeking advice about the validity of provisions included in awards and certified agreements and which are concerned with union representation and membership. The background to this matter, your questions and my answers to them are set out below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Senate Economics References Committee, which has been conducting an inquiry into the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 (the Bill), has sought the views of the Department of Industrial Relations (the Department) about the validity of provisions concerning union representation and membership which are included in awards and certified agreements. The Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) has submitted to the Committee that proposed Part XA of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations Act 1988</EMPHASIS>  (the Act), which is set out in Schedule 16 to the Bill, will, once it is enacted, preclude provisions of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The SDA has given the following clauses as examples of those which have for many years been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> included in consent awards and certified agreements to which it is a party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For the duration of this Award/Agreement the company recognises the SDA as being the Union that shall have exclusive representation of the employees who are covered by this Award. This exclusive representation will extend to all terms and conditions of employment, whether those terms and conditions are subject to this Award/Agreement or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is the policy of the company that all its employees subject to the Award/Agreement will be encouraged to join the SDA. Accordingly, the company undertakes to positively promote union membership at the point of recruitment by strongly recommending that all employees join the SDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All new employees will be given an application form to join the SDA at the point of engagement together with a statement of the company's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All employees not currently members of the SDA will be given an application form to join the SDA together with a statement of the company's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The company undertakes upon authorisation to deduct union membership dues, as levied by the Union in accordance with its rules, from the pay of employees who are members of the Union. Such monies collected will be forwarded to the Union at the beginning of each month together with all necessary information to enable the reconciliation and crediting of subscriptions to members' accounts.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">QUESTION 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Department's view is that cll. 1 and 5 are not presently enforceable under the Act, and would remain unenforceable after the enactment of the Bill. The department's particular views are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 1 purports to provide for `exclusive representation'. This is beyond the capacity of the parties to establish by agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clause 5 deals with subject matter which is beyond the scope of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's (the Commission's) existing award&hyphen;making power and all five clauses would be beyond the scope of the Commission's award making power under the Act as amended by the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Clauses 2 to 4 appear to be no more than statements of policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You ask whether these views are correct? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5593"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SHORT ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. In my view, cll. 1 and 5 are not enforceable under the Act. However, I think cll. 2, 3 and 4 are more than statements of policy and could, at least in theory, be the subject of enforcement action under the Act. I agree that none of the clauses would be enforceable under the Act if it were amended by the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REASONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Clause 1 is not a matter which, under the present Act, two parties can establish conclusively by agreement. That is because the Commission has the power to make an inconsistent award or order in relation to any demarcation dispute which results from a union's attempt to procure exclusive representation rights (see the definitions of `industrial dispute' and `demarcation dispute' in s.4(1)of the Act and social security.111(1)(b) and (f) of the Act). In that sense, the SDA has no conclusive right to exclusively represent employees which could be enforced under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. A dispute about the deduction of union dues cannot be an industrial dispute for the purposes of the Act (see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">R v Portus; Ex parte ANZ Banking Group Ltd</EMPHASIS>  (1972) 127 CLR 353; and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Re Alcan Australia Ltd; Ex parte Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees</EMPHASIS>  (1994) 123 ALR 193). Accordingly, the Commission's award making powers do not extend to making a provision in the terms of clause 5. It follows that a provision of an award in the terms of clause 5 could not be enforced under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Clauses 2 to 4 appear to me to go beyond statements of policy and specify obligations with which an employer is to comply. Accordingly, I think it would in theory be possible to establish that an employer had breached one of those clauses and to sue for that breach under Part VIII of the Act. It may be, however, that a court would, despite the language used in the clauses, interpret them as not imposing enforceable obligations. Even if the clauses were interpreted as imposing enforceable obligations, the consequences of a breach of any one of those clauses seems to me to be negligible. A court may not be disposed to impose more than a negligible penalty for such a breach. Accordingly, cll. 2 to 4 may be practically unenforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Assuming the Act is amended by enactment of the Bill, none of the matters referred to in the clauses could constitute an `industrial matter' in relation to which the Commission could make an award. Proposed s.89A(2) of the Act, contained in Schedule 5 to the Bill, sets out exhaustively the matters which can constitute an industrial dispute in relation to which the Commission may make an award. The matters included in the clauses do not fall within the matters listed in s.89A(2). I note that proposed s.89A(5) of the Act provides that `the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commission may include in an award provisions that are incidental to the matters in subsection (2) and essential for the effective operation of the award'. While it is arguable that the matters dealt with in the clauses are incidental to the matters in s.89A(2), they are not essential for the effective operation of an award and therefore would not come within the Commission's award&hyphen;making powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">QUESTION 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would any of the clauses contravene proposed Part XA of the Act? In particular:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Would inclusion of any of the provisions in a certified agreement contravene proposed Part XA of the Act?; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If inclusion of any of cll.2 to 4 in a certified agreement as presently expressed would contravene proposed Part XA, could any modification or qualifying statements be added to avoid contravention of Part XA? For example, could contravention of Part XA be avoided by including a statement emphasising that employees are free to join industrial associations of their choice or not to join industrial associations and that employees will not be discriminated against or victimised because they are, or are not, members of industrial associations?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SHORT ANSWER</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. In my view, inclusion of all or any of the provisions in a certified agreement would not involve conduct which contravenes any of the provisions of proposed Part XA of the Act. It is therefore not necessary to answer the second part of your question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REASONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. Proposed Part XA of the Act prohibits a range of conduct which may be engaged in by employers, employees or industrial associations. The operation of the proposed Part is described generally in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and, relevantly, is as follows. The provisions of Division 3 of the proposed Part prohibit an employer from doing, or threatening to do, for a `prohibited reason', or for reasons that include a `prohibited reason', a range of actions, listed in proposed s.298K(1), being actions which harm persons who are employees in relation to their employment. Speaking generally, the prohibited reasons are related to an employee's membership or non&hyphen;membership of an industrial association. The provisions of Division 4 of the proposed Part prohibit employees from ceasing work for specified reasons. The provisions of Division 5 of the proposed part prohibit conduct by industrial associations for proscribed reasons against employers, employees and members. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5594"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. Clause 1 does not involve any conduct by an employer, an employee or the SDA. It is simply a statement that the SDA is to have exclusive representation of employees covered by an award. Clause 2 requires an employer to positively promote union membership at the point of recruitment by strongly recommending to employees that they join the SDA. Clause 3 requires an employer to give new employees an application form to join the SDA and a statement of the employer's policy about union membership. Clause 4 requires an employer to give to employees who are not members of the SDA an application form to join the SDA together with a statement of the employer's policy. Clause 5 requires an employer, upon authorisation by an employee, to deduct union dues from an employee's wages and to forward them to the SDA. None of the clauses requires an employer to take any action which is prohibited by the provisions of Division 3 of the proposed part. However, Part XA could be contravened if an employer stated to an employee that the employee would receive preferential or advantageous treatment if he or she joined the SDA or if an employer in fact accorded preferential or advantageous treatment to employees who joined the SDA (see proposed s.298K(1) and proposed s.298L). The clauses do not in their terms involve any action at all being taken by employees or industrial associations. Accordingly, compliance with the clauses could not involve any conduct which contravenes the provisions of Divisions 4 or 5 of the proposed part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. I note that proposed Part VIB of the Act, contained in Schedule 9 to the Act, sets out provisions about the making, and certification by the Commission, of certified agreements. Proposed s.l70LT provides for the circumstances in which the Commission is to certify an agreement. Proposed s.170LU sets out the circumstances in which the Commission is to refuse to certify an agreement. Subsection 170LU(2) provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Despite section 170LT, the Commission must refuse to certify an agreement if it is satisfied that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the employer has, in connection with negotiating an agreement, contravened section 170NB or Part XA (which deals with freedom of association); or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the employer has caused a person or body to engage, in connection with negotiations for an agreement, in conduct that, had the employer engaged in the conduct, would be a contravention by the employer of section 170NB or Part XA; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a person or body has, on behalf of the employer:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (i) so engaged in such conduct; or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (ii) caused another person or body so to engage in such conduct'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the Commission must, under s.170LU(2), refuse to certify an agreement will depend on whether any conduct of an employer, or an employer's agent, in negotiating the inclusion of the provisions in an agreement, could constitute a contravention of proposed Part XA. The facts of each case would need to be considered separately to determine whether any such conduct had been engaged in during the negotiation process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect to the correspondence that has been incorporated and Senator Harradine's comments, I want to say that Senator Harradine is quite right. The opposition, like Senator Harradine and, I assume, the Greens, as I have not discussed this particular matter with them, believe that our amendments 328, 329, 337 and 338 remove any doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make two key points in respect to schedule 16, freedom of association. The first is the issue of preference. The opposition firmly believes the commission should be entitled to grant preference to unions if it thinks it is appropriate. The commission frequently grants preference arrangements in order to ensure that individuals who wish to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5595"> bargain collectively can do so effectively through organisations that might not otherwise be viable and effective. Such preference arrangements do not infringe the rights of those who are not unionists, as the existing section 122(3) provides that notwithstanding an award preference an employer is not required to give preference to a unionist over a person who holds a conscientious objector certificate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition also believes that the parties to a certified agreement or AWA should be entitled to agree to a preference clause if that is what they wish. Often preference clauses are desired by employers, unions and employees in order to give order and certainty to the conduct of industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand that the Democrats are unlikely to support the retention of preference in either awards or agreements. That is one of the few matters on which the Democrats have been consistent. It is interesting that they are consistent only when it comes to opposing the interests of the union movement. So we are going to move some fall&hyphen;back amendments. Senator Murray said in his Senate report on page 359:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would support the inclusion of clauses by agreement in awards and agreements whereby unions and employers agree to promote the value of participation in responsible unionism, provided, at all times, employees have a right not to join a union.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the precise effect of our amendments, Senator Murray. So here is yet another chance. Vote with us to give effect to the sentiments that you have expressed and outlined in the Senate report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The second issue which is vitally important in this schedule is the application of the freedom of association provisions. The problem is that they do not apply to all employers. They only apply to corporate employers and to some other odds and sods. So, if you are a non-corporate employer, you are free from these provisions. What are the consequences of this? Most fundamentally, this will remove a range of protections from employees of non-corporate employers: freedom from dismissal because of membership of a union, freedom from prejudicial treatment because of partici pation in a proceeding under industrial laws and freedom from discrimination from being absent from work on official union business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on amendments 328 and 329. Opposition amendment 328 allows the parties to awards or enterprise bargaining agreements to regulate their own internal affairs on two issues: firstly, to promote and encourage membership of an employee organisation; and, secondly, to recognise one employee organisation as the exclusive bargaining agent on behalf of affected employees employed under the relevant award or enterprise bargaining agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendment does not provide for compulsion, preference or any mandatory requirement to join an employee organisation. Amendment No. 171 to be dealt with later seeks to retain the current conscientious objection provisions in the act and we do not oppose that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP amendment 328 is relevant to a range of industries which are highly unionised and allows for employers and unions to formalise and make regular their own agreed internal practices. It would allow those parties to develop policies and practical guidelines for the conduct of their own business. The amendment is philosophically similar to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendment No. 157 in schedule 15, registered organisations, which we have recently dealt with. That amendment allows a presidential member to refuse to extend the rules of an applicant organisation if workers might more conveniently belong to an existing registered organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 157 allows the IARC to choose between a new organisation and an existing organisation. It is expressly designed to limit choice, encourage the dominance of existing organisations and seeks to severely limit the option of workers to join or form new organisations when existing organisations can represent their interests. Amendment No. 157 was the result of intense lobbying of the government and the Australian Democrats by employer interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed opposition amendment 328 is the logical extension of amendment 157 previously supported by the government and the Australian Democrats. Put briefly, opposition amendment 328 seeks to formalise or make regular policies and guidelines that promote membership of a particular employee organisation which is respondent to a particular award or enterprise bargaining agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, my questions to Senator Campbell and Senator Murray are relatively simple. Do the freedom of association provisions allow parties to awards or enterprise bargaining agreements to design rules and guidelines which facilitate the promotion and encouragement of union membership or non-membership of employer organisations? Secondly, if not, which sections of the act prohibit that type of activity?</PARA></SPEECH>

It is something for the organisations themselves to go about their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5598"> business in promoting membership and that need not be encouraged within this new regime.

The various additional protections given to the rights of unions to organise and the amendments to the objects clause encouraging the ability of unions to operate effectively, consistent with our international obligations, further enhance the ability of the commission to include such clauses and awards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make some remarks at the beginning of the committee's consideration of schedule 18. Senator Murray, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, has raised with the government a number of important points about the human rights of crews on foreign vessels entering Australian waters. It is fair to say that that is a matter that has been raised by a number of other honourable senators. I thank the honourable senator for raising these matters&mdash;and, indeed, other honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to state on behalf of the government that we take this issue very seriously. There is no doubt that conditions on some foreign vessels are completely unacceptable. The government is committed to ensuring that crews on foreign vessels in Australian waters are properly protected by Australian law and that all appropriate international standards are adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I would like to state clearly that the Australian government is actively working towards the ratification of International Labour Organisation convention 147 which deals with minimum standards for merchant shipping. In accordance with the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy of both the previous and current governments, Australia does not ratify ILO conventions until law and practice are in compliance with the terms of the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are currently working on ensuring that the law and practice in this area does so comply. This will assist efforts to ensure that the human rights of seafarers are properly protected. Senator Murray has also raised the issue of criminal conduct on board foreign vessels. It needs to be understood that Australian law can apply to offences committed on foreign ships.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.12 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond specifically to the point that has been raised by the parliamentary secretary. I had hoped when he set out a moment ago to respond to an approach from Senator Murray of the Australian Democrats he was going to announce a provision&mdash;a change; an amendment&mdash;to this legislation which would allay the fears of maritime unions as well as many other citizens that their ability to take on the ships of shame is not going to be effectively kyboshed by this legislation. But of course he did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation then remains that, if section 18 passes unchanged, and that appears to be the aim of the government and Democrats, the ability of the maritime unions to be able to assess what is going on on ships of shame which come into Australian ports and to act to rectify the violation of human rights on those ships is going to be effectively trammelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ships of shame are that big percentage of the 50,000 merchant ships around the world which ply under flags of convenience, often from places like Liberia or Panama. It is well known in this country at least that conditions aboard those ships fall way short of not only what is expected by Australian standards but also what is expected by international agreements and covenants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are heart&hyphen;rending cases of seafarers on those ships who have been working, often for more than a year, without any pay at all. If they leave the ship to escape the conditions on it, then they lose the money that they have worked to rightfully obtain, and the wages are very often low. If they stay aboard they are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5602"> there captive under sometimes slave conditions to unscrupulous ships captains or ships owners from elsewhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been horrendous cases of appalling conditions of maltreatment and the physical abuse of seafarers. People have been thrown overboard when ships leave ports where there has been a protest about the conditions on those ships. If this proposed section remains as is, it means that the most active people in protecting the rights of seafarers on the ships of shame&mdash;that is, the maritime unions in Australia&mdash;will lose their ability to effectively boycott work on those ships until the owners come good and do the right thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one member of the unions that have been lobbying in this place to keep their ability to defend foreign seafarers put it, they will be able to do no more than picket on the wharf and hold a placard. You can imagine what effect that will have as far as nefarious captains or owners are concerned; the owners may not even be here but may be looking on from the other side of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A situation will pertain similar to the one that occurred in New Zealand after the industrial relations act was instigated there. When seafarers come into port and tell the local unions that they are not being paid and fed and that they are living in appalling conditions, where there are no showers or working toilets on the ship, all the unions there can do, after the passage of legislation similar to what is now before the Senate in Australia, is say, `We hope that you are going to Australia, because that is one place in the world where you can expect some justice. You can expect justice because the maritime unions over there will come aboard your ship and make sure that the conditions are okay for you. They will not allow that ship to move until it is fixed up.' Any decent Australian will back the ability of the unions to act on behalf of people who have been so terribly treated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation says that the unions cannot do that any more. If they do, they face a fine of $0.75 million; that is, they face the potential of being destroyed. There is a lot more in this section, and we will get to it. The secretary has led off with the ships of shame. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action of the government and the Democrats in apparently denying the effective action which unions can take in this matter needs to be nailed. In so taking this action, we will be a country where people coming in and working on Australian ports will continue to have their rights violated under both domestic law and international covenants, because these unions will not be able to go to their aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretary says that the government is concerned about this and will act on it. The question arises as to why that has not happened before. Governments have taken action to make sure that rust buckets are fixed up and that infrastructure is corrected, but when it comes to the human dimension on those ships the recourse to action has been through the maritime unions. This legislation, particularly this insidious proposed section 18, strips the unions of the ability to go to the defence of human rights in our territory in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not reassured, if the Democrats are, by the government saying that it will fix it. I heard that last night when the Greens and people on this side of the House fought to prevent a measure which says that, in the future, those in the workplace will not be able to engage in a work to rules campaign, even if it is a matter of conscience, because their employer must stop paying them if they do. You will be penalised from the minute that you act on a matter of conscience in the workplace, even work to rules campaigns. On that occasion, the Democrats said that it is okay because the government has assured them that, if that happens, the government will bring in some remedying legislation to fix it. It should be fixed before it is brought into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, this is a case where the Democrats in particular have a constituency, a policy platform and human rights to consider. In this legislation that has been agreed to&mdash;the Reith&hyphen;Kernot amendment&mdash;those human rights are being left to the vagaries of a government promise. That is not good enough.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(1.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to make some broad comments about our fundamental opposition to the reintroduction of the secondary boycotts provision of the Trade Practices Act. There has been some debate up to this point on ships of shame. There was some debate on this during the last sitting week. I intend to make some specific comments about this issue. I am waiting to see Senator Murray's response to the matters that were raised by the Labor senators who spoke on that debate over a week ago and the response of Senator Brown. Senator Murray rose to his feet in that last sitting week and indicated that he shares our concerns on a range of issues to do with ships of shame. I will come to that in a bit more detail shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The provisions with respect to secondary boycotts, at their core, suffer from the same defects as common law actions in industrial disputes. They are very blunt instruments. They permit employers to access injunctions, including ex parte and interim injunctions, against unions which effectively terminate industrial action, without, at any time, permitting the parties to argue the merits of the dispute. Secondary boycott actions can also lead to massive damages awards. Such damages awards have the potential to prevent an organisation from properly representing the interests of its members because of their fear of being sued out of existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The existing act contains provisions which require a 72&hyphen;hour cooling off period before action can be commenced, during which time the commission can examine the merits of the dispute and seek to conciliate an outcome. These provisions ameliorate the worst excesses of the secondary boycotts provisions. They strike a proper balance between the rights of the unions to pursue the legitimate interests of their members by industrial action and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need to ensure that unnecessary economic damage is not inflicted on innocent parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition's preferred position is the status quo. We make no apologies for that. For the reason I have just outlined, we believe the existing provisions are the most appropriate. Unfortunately, we know the Democrats will not join with us in deleting the secondary boycott provisions. This is very disappointing. The Democrats made an explicit pre&hyphen;election commitment to oppose the reintroduction of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. It was only as a result of the now infamous government&hyphen;Democrat deal that the Democrats reneged on their position. There was a ray of light, however, last sitting week in Senator Murray's response to our appeals in respect of the ships of shame issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I get to that, we have two fall&hyphen;back positions. Firstly, we are very concerned about the proposed section 45DB(1). This is not even a secondary boycott provision. It is prohibition on primary boycotts and its terms make it clear that it is specifically directed against the Maritime Union of Australia. The problem is that the provision is so broad it will attack not only the legitimate activities of the MUA but also the legitimate activities of many other trade unions and environmental and consumer groups. The Democrats know this and they will say legitimate protest action will be protected by the proposed defence in section 45DD, but we have grave reservations about that defence. We are concerned that it has been drafted far too narrowly to catch legitimate protest activity by environmental and consumer groups, not to mention trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is considerable doubt about the ambit of the provision. This, in itself, is unacceptable, more so because of the sanction that will apply if an organisation discovers that the activities fall inside the prohibition but outside the defence. Given the extraordinary width of the prohibition and the extraordinary narrowness of the defence, we believe this could become a common occurrence, or it may not. Groups will not be willing to run the risk, so they will shy away from what the community would regard as legitimate activity. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5604">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing is certain about the defence: it will not protect the MUA in any protest about protection of international seafarers. It will not support the MUA in any protest about breaches of international or Australian safety standards. In the previous debate on this matter, I touched on some very heart&hyphen;rending examples of exploitation verging on slavery in many areas of the international seafaring industry&mdash;some disgraceful stories. Senator Brown has touched on that again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My father spent 10 years as a merchant seaman. I certainly would say that the standards of safety and general conditions of employment in the Australian merchant marine shortly after World War II were far better than those which existed in most other parts of the world. I can recall him relating stories to me about his contact in various ports and of the dreadful conditions of employment in many of the ships at that time. Unfortunately, it does not seem to have got any better. In fact, I think we could probably argue in many countries it has got worse, particularly because of the flags of convenience issues. When you try to catch up with the slave like conditions that exist on many of the ships around the world, you find they have shuffled themselves to other world economic centres like Panama and Liberia. The Central African Republic, which is totally landlocked&mdash;it does not even have a sea border&mdash;has a merchant marine. These are the sorts of disgraceful flags of convenience activities that have been going on. I recall extraordinary heart&hyphen;rending stories about the appalling conditions that seafarers underwent at that time and, as I say, it has not improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that these are legitimate grounds for protest. We will be moving amendments to ensure that these protests are not prohibited and are not subject to huge sanctions. Why should the defenders of seafarers be subject to huge sanctions in defending the legitimate health, safety and basic human conditions of seafarers, when you cannot catch up with international fleet movers who make massive profits in this area by their appalling exploitation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sanctions is the other matter about which the opposition has grave concerns. Injunctions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and massive penalties are there and threaten unions. They are there to scare protesters off. Unions which run the gauntlet will risk being sued out of existence. This cannot be right in a democratic society. The other significant amendments we will move will restrict access to injunctions and at least place some cap on damages. Previously I explained the effect of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, regrettably, have not had the courage to date to oppose the reintroduction of section 45D and 45E. They can at least have the courage here today to knock out the worst excesses of the provisions that are in this bill. I wish it to be noted that, in the fallback amendment that seeks to protect protest action concerning international seafarers, there would be an additional requirement that a certificate had not been issued under section 166A of the proposed workplace relations act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, this confines the defence even further because a respondent to a boycott will be able to approach the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for a section 166A certificate to, in effect, close off the defence to the other party. This is very much a second&hyphen; or even a third&hyphen;best solution but at least it means the commission may have the opportunity to consider the dispute on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5605"> In conclusion, I will seek to incorporate a range of further comments on the amendments, and I wish to make this appeal to Senator Murray. In the last week of the debate, he listened to and acknowledged our concerns over this legislation. He acknowledged we had a point. In this chamber today, we would like to see Senator Murray outline what he is going to do specifically on the amendments before the chamber, not just to protect Australian seafarers and the Maritime Union of Australia but also the other areas I have just highlighted. Senator Murray, we certainly contend that a lot more will need to have come from the discussions between the Democrats and the government over the last week than the very few glib and superficial comments we have received from the parliamentary secretary on this issue. What is Senator Murray going to support today by way of amending and minimising the appal ling provisions with which the government has confronted us?

We believe that the "next best thing" is to modify the injunction power so as to considerably reduce its destructive potential against unions. This can be done in two ways&mdash;ensuring that an employer cannot "rush off to court behind the union's back" to get an interim injunction; providing very strict requirements before an interim injunction will ordered. This ensures at least that the merits of the dispute will be heard by the Court before an injunction will be ordered. We also believe that the "next best thing" it to place a cap on damages to considerably reduce the destructive potential of unlimited damages. Indeed, when Margaret Thatcher reintroduced common law actions against trade unions she also introduced a cap on the damages that could be recovered. The cap we recommend reflects the amounts introduced by Thatcher.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment replaces proposed subsection 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act. The provision that appears in the Bill would have prohibited persons, acting in concert, from engaging in conduct where the purpose and effect (or likely effect) of the conduct is to prevent or substantially hinder a third person from engaging in trade or commerce:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">between Australia and other countries; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">among the States and Territories; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">within a Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed Government amendment will confine the prohibition in subsection 45DB(1) so that it applies only to conduct the purpose and effect (or likely effect) of which is to prevent or substantially hinder another person from engaging in trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some concern has been expressed that the provision, as amended, still imposes a very broad prohibition on conduct that constitutes a primary or secondary boycott. The concern appears to be based on a view that the expression "trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia" covers a very broad range of activities, because a great many manufacturing and distribution operations have some connection with the export of goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concern is ill-founded. The intention of this amendment is that the prohibition in section 45DB will not apply in respect of the production and distribution of goods within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The boycott conduct that the section is designed to prohibit is conduct that has been undertaken for a particular purpose and which has, or is likely to have, a particular effect. The purpose and effect of the conduct must be to prevent or substantially hinder a third person from engaging in a particular type of trade or commerce. That is, trade or commerce involving the movement of goods <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> between Australia and places outside Australia. In this context, the use of the expression "trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia" does not mean merely that the trade or commerce affected includes the movement of goods into or out of Australia, or that the movement of goods into or out of Australia forms some part of, or is related to, the trade and commerce. Rather, it means that the trade or commerce that is affected must entail, or be rolled up with, the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focusing of this prohibition on conduct which affects trade and commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia reflects the importance the Government attaches to preserving Australia's competitiveness in international trade. Unnecessary delays in the movement of goods can have a profound effect on the nation's trade. The Government believes that strikes and bans unconnected with the wages and conditions of the workers involved must not be allowed to jeopardise international trade, which plays such an important part in our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Boycott conduct involves conduct taken in concert between a first person and a second person. Section 45DB is drafted so that the prohibition does not apply if the target is the employer of the first person. This reflects the Government's policy that where employees engage in boycott conduct with unions, the employees are not to be subject to penalty. Unions engaged in prohibited boycott conduct will be subject to the penalty provisions. However, unions and employees will be exempt from the prohibition where the boycott conduct is directly related to the terms and conditions of employment covering the workplace in which the employees work. This exemption is provided in section 45DD.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Amendment No. 164 proposes to also exempt from the boycott provisions conduct, the dominant purpose of which is substantially related to consumer protection or environmental protection.</PARA>

On behalf of the government, I put our concern about the plight of foreign seafarers. Senator Sherry did not seek to debate the issue and just said that I had made some glib and superficial remarks. I think anyone who reads the record of proceedings will see that Senator Sherry has sought to play the man, not the ball.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5607">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will reiterate for the benefit of other honourable senators, in particularly Senator Brown, that the government's view&mdash;as I have already stated in some detail&mdash;is that there are significant avenues of redress which exist under Australian law for seafarers on foreign ships subjected to behaviour which is unacceptable under our laws. Senator Brown may not believe that those avenues for redress are substantial enough. As I have already said, this government&mdash;as the previous one did&mdash;was progressing that both domestically and internationally. We will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, members of the maritime union or any other person for that matter, including Senator Brown because I know he does take a strong personal interest in this, have the right to bring to the attention of the relevant authorities instances of criminal abuse committed on board ships. That does not mean that the MUA should be allowed to take the law into its own hands by imposing industrial action. There is obviously a fundamental disagreement between the two sides of this chamber on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In specific response to Senator Sherry, the provisions of section 170DB are not extraordinarily broad. The section prohibits only conduct which is aimed at preventing, or hindering, the movement of goods into and out of Australia. It is not intended to apply to the production and distribution of goods within Australia. Senator Sherry referred to these as `blunt instruments'. However, this chamber should be informed that these so&hyphen;called `blunt instruments' are available only in respect to illegitimate, industrial action; that is action unrelated to workers' pay and conditions of employment and which wreaks damage on innocent third and fourth parties.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support amendment No. 163 and I will make my remarks in relation to that amendment and the ones all the way through to No. 170. These amendments represent a significant modification of the original bill and also a significant divergence from the government's stated intention to reinstate the old section 45D. Amendment No. 163 dramatically restricts the use of primary boycotts under the Trade Practices Act. Instead of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> general prohibition on primary boycotts affecting trade and commerce, the prohibition will extend only to trade and commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside it. This provision will pick up only the act of movement; it will not pick up any other aspect of trade and commerce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some commentators have suggested that it will pick up any aspect of trade and commerce if some aspect of that trade and commerce were to involve the movement of goods. I wish to state categorically, as a joint mover of the motion, that this is clearly not the intention of that provision. This provision is targeted purely and solely at movement, at shipping, for example. The reason for that is that primary boycotts on the wharves affect many other people. The effect is not limited to the immediate parties involved. If the waterside workers refuse to load perishable goods, the supplying factory might be forced to suspend operations and stand down workers, resulting in innocent employers and employees being hurt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a similar effect to a secondary boycott in that third parties are involved. That is why the Australian Democrats agreed to that provision being included. We did not agree&mdash;and the amendments reflect that&mdash;to the coalition's intention to expand movement to include that between states and territories. Wharves and ports are natural monopolies. They are different and require special attention. We would not agree to the extension of coverage to include other primary boycotts. Primary boycotts will remain the responsibility of the AIRC with the retention of the 72 hours cooling off period under section 166A before common law actions can be commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 45DB will remain subject to the defence in relation to employment related matters in section 45DD. Indeed, few, if any disputes will be picked up by the provisions given the defence and the broad interpretation which we have insisted on being given in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Access to section 45DB remedies are further restricted by new section 87AA in amendment 168 which will require that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5608"> court must have regard to whether the applicant has taken or could have taken proceedings in an industrial tribunal, particularly in relation to conciliation. This provision, based on section 163N of the current act reflects the importance not just of stopping the boycott but of resolving the underlying causes while balancing the economic damage which might be caused to an innocent third party in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 164 is a further important amendment. This establishes a full exclusion from 45D, 45DA and 45DB where the dominant purpose of the conduct is substantially related to environmental protection or consumer protection. This exclusion does not exist in the current law. A secondary boycott under the current section 45D of the act, renamed 45DA, prohibits boycotts with the purpose, and likely to have an effect, of substantially lessening competition. The provision will also exclude secondary boycotts under 45D and primary boycotts under 45DB from any action as long as they do not involve industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The preclusion on industrial action reflects the current Labor law where boycotts under the current Labor Industrial Relations Act are limited to industrial action, thereby precluding any other conduct being picked up. In drafting exclusions, the Democrats have opted not to define what is meant by environmental protection or consumer protection. It is our clear intention in moving these amendments that the clauses be interpreted broadly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court, in the 1990 case of the Crown v. Murphy, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its ordinary meaning `environment' signifies that which surrounds and long been understood to include the conditions under which any person or thing lives.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the High Court has adopted the natural and ordinary meaning of the term. It would, in my view, extend to environmental issues affecting indigenous people, such as the protection of sacred sites. It would extend to urban environment issues and pollution issues. It would extend to environment issues such as preservation of historic buildings. It should and will be interpreted very broadly. It would include boycotts in relation to nuclear issues <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the impact they could have on the environment. It would extend to the protection of living things in other countries, such as South&hyphen;East Asian rainforests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, consumer protection will be given a wide interpretation by the courts. The courts in England&mdash;for example, Middlebrook Mushrooms v. TGWU in 1993&mdash;and the Australian High Court case of Mengel v. Northern Territory suggest that the courts are prepared to give a very wide latitude to the ability of consumers and protesters to engage in protest action without impinging on secondary boycott or common law tort actions. The Australian courts have, in the past, proved very reluctant to grant injunctions which might impinge on free speech or advocacy, and we would commend that action by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The explanatory memorandum also requires a broad interpretation to be given to the term `dominant purpose'. The term `dominant purpose' means the purpose which governs the actions of the relevant person&mdash;that is, the `governing purpose'. In adopting this interpretation, we expressly reject the very narrow interpretation used by the Federal Court in the early litigation on section 45D, and note with approval the broader approach of later cases&mdash;such as, Justice Von Donassa's interpretation in the GTS Freight Management case v. TWU in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in passing that, since 1995, the Trade Practices Act has had an objects clause which sets the object of the act as simply enhancing the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection. Clearly, the exclusion, read with the objects clause and with section 51(2)A, provides clear guidance that consumer issues are not intended to be restrained by boycott actions. The exclusion will also apply to the National Competition Code by amendment 169&mdash;this being the code which the states are pledged to implement in state law as part of competition policy reforms. So this statutory protection for environmental and consumer protection will also be part of state law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those remarks which are very important as the joint mover of the amendment, I want to deal with some of the issues <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5609"> that have been raised in terms of this ships of shame issue. In doing so, I should note for the record that the correspondence tabled between the minister and us by the ALP was not given to the ALP with my permission, but I do not object to it being tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened with great care to the sincerity and the manner in which the MUA have put their case to me. There are others in the debate who exaggerate the facts and use hyperbole to make points which, frankly, are not helpful in trying to resolve an issue on which there is fundamental bipartisan agreement: on resolving the ships of shame issue. I have not heard any coalition speaker. I have not heard any Green speaker from either of the two Green parties, nor have I heard a Labor speaker, an Independent speaker or an Australian Democrat. I have read the information arising out of the reports of the House of Representatives and there is universal agreement that the ships of shame issues have to be dealt with properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Brown of the Tasmanian Greens raises the issues in the way he does, I am concerned that the exaggeration and the hyperbole may eventually lead to minimising the problem, and that is certainly what I do not want to do. I would make three remarks at the outset. The boycotts to which he refers are illegal right now under the Labor act. Both Labor and the coalition fully supported that secondary boycott legislation under which they are illegal, and they have always been so. Health and safety issues are dealt with by AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. There is the issue of this huge fine. Unions are not up for fines unless the ACCC launches an action, which it has been capable of doing and has not done for 20 years. Why the workplace relations bill should suddenly result in this huge change is going to&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are dealing with an issue such as this abuse, how should we deal with it? The concerns raised by the Maritime Union of Australia are real enough and should not be minimised. They do reflect the unions' traditional interest in protecting the welfare of those in their industry who have found it difficult to help themselves. Those concerns are widely shared by a wide number of political and non-political groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ILO convention 147 has been isolated by us as being of importance. It has not yet been ratified by Australia. In due course I will seek leave to table a letter from the Labor minister at the time concerning ILO convention 147. ILO convention 147 was not ratified by the Labor government and it has not yet been ratified by the coalition government. There is some doubt as to whether ratification would assist in addressing the full concerns on these ships of shame issues. The relevant operative provision of the convention&mdash;article 4&mdash;is not mandatory and, in any case, current law and practice in Australia already comes close to exhausting the scope of the powers that can be conferred on the Commonwealth by formally ratifying the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to ensuring that wages and conditions are of an appropriate standard, it would probably be impractical for anyone other than AMSA and the union to pay attention to those. Under international law, the prime responsibility for ships' safety in the wider sense of the term rests with the owner of the vessel and the country where the ship is registered&mdash;the flag state. That is our fundamental problem. The ships that come to our shores are not owned by Australians. In articles 27 and 94 in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, these articles seek, in part, to protect the sovereignty of flag states and they may bar the further extension of Australian inspection and policing powers. In other words, we have limited rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A more practical concern is the number of flag states thought to be in breach of the current conventions. Of concern are the simple practicalities of enforcing existing standards and ensuring that any contraventions are detected and reported in a timely manner to the relevant authorities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5610">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to human rights matters and possible breaches of the criminal law, there is some doubt as to the respective roles that can be played by the Australian Federal Police and the state police. But the Attorney-General and the government are looking at ways and means&mdash;and were looking at it under the Labor government&mdash;of improving cooperation and interaction by those police services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A legislative framework already exists for federal-state cooperation in relation to the issues raised. The relevant federal act is the Crimes at Sea Act 1979, which is known as the CAS Act. Complementary legislation applies in the states and the Northern Territory. The last two reports of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department also refer to a redrafting of the present legislative scheme. A special committee of solicitors-general provided a report in December 1993 proposing a new application of laws regimes for crimes occurring at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, who rejoice in the peculiar acronym of SCAG, adopted that report in November 1994. Draft legislation to implement the new scheme has been prepared by the South Australian Parliamentary Counsel. The draft legislation has been adopted by SCAG as a suitable model. The 1995-96 annual report of the Attorney-General's Department records that negotiations are continuing between the Commonwealth and the states regarding the introduction of the draft legislation. My purpose here is to show you what is being done as opposed to the hyperbole and the exaggeration that we have been subjected to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the CAS Act applies the criminal laws of the appropriate state or territory to offences committed on or from Australian ships on overseas, interstate and territory voyages. The CAS Act also applies and prescribes circumstances to offences on foreign ships beyond the territorial sea. The Commonwealth law applies the criminal laws in the adjacent state or territory to offences and offshore areas beyond the territorial sea. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few brief remarks regarding the proposal for the reintro <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> duction of section 45D and attendant provisions of the Trade Practices Act. At the outset, I wish to fully endorse the remarks made, particularly by Senator Sherry and Senator Brown. I will make some comments about the ships of shame issue shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the proposal here from the government and now supported by the Democrats, contrary to their pre-election promise, is to reintroduce sections that have one purpose; that is, a provocative attack upon the trade union movement in this country. It is clear from the insertion of section 45DB(1), for instance, that unions are to be subject to massive penalty provisions for both primary and secondary boycott conduct, whilst there has been a recognition that other groups are to be exempted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not complain about employees being exempted. That is fair and appropriate. I do not even complain about environmental organisations, be they Greenpeace or whomever, or consumer organisations being given some recognition by way of exemption when they engage in conduct which might otherwise contravene the proposed sections 45D(1) and 45DA(1) and 45DB. But when it comes to action being taken on serious issues&mdash;whether they be related to environmental concerns; consumer protection; human rights, which is something that we hear a lot about from the Democrats&mdash;or issues which involve some of those considerations and also involve certain industrial considerations such as the ships of shame issue, what we get is this wishy-washy, wimpish attempt by the Democrats to justify what really is a sell-out of the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5611"> I make no apologies for the fact that there have been occasions when trade unions in this country have taken action on issues which may not necessarily have been directly related to industrial issues, such as their terms and conditions of employment. For instance, the TWU took action with respect to Air France over Mururoa Atoll. The trade union movement, led particularly by the TWU and the Maritime Workers Union because of their strategic position, took action in respect of the coup which removed a democratically elected government in Fiji. The trade union move ment for years supported action against the repressive regime of apartheid in South Africa in support of UN sponsored and approved sanctions. So there is a long history of this action being taken, and being taken specifically in relation to very important issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst Senator Murray gives us a learned opinion here about what may or may not be currently legal or illegal, the fact of the matter is that what we are dealing with in this legislation is a return to the bad old days. They are the days when the coalition conservative government relied upon trade practices legislation to prevent what otherwise is regarded as legitimate industrial and political action by trade unions&mdash;often the only groups that can bring about a real change in the circumstances. Who knows, there may be actions required in the future over the abuses of human rights in Burma or Tibet. I would be interested to hear what Senator Murray and the Democrats would have to say if that situation ever comes to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have in these provisions, of course, is discrimination against the trade union movement. They are still to be held out as the one group that will be caught by this legislation if they engage in conduct which might otherwise be exempted and, therefore, legal by other groups or by individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move very quickly to the ships of shame issue. I think Senator Brown covered it very well in terms of the terrible tragedies that exist in relation to that issue. I believe Senator Campbell was glib in his reply. Whilst he said that the government are concerned about this issue&mdash;and we have just heard Senator Murray telling us that he is concerned about it, and we are all concerned about it&mdash;the fact of the matter is that they are dragging the chain in terms of trying to do something about it. With indecent haste they are pushing through legislation in this chamber that will stop the one positive action that can be taken by the trade union movement to stop this terrible practice that occurs&mdash;at least in so far as it impacts in Australia.</PARA>

Will the minister inform the Senate of some recent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5613"> measures the new Howard government has taken to protect the environment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Heffernan, you are quite right: previous coalition governments have had an outstanding record in protecting the environment. The Howard coalition government is intent on achieving the same objectives. I remind you that in fact it was the Fraser government which stopped sandmining on Fraser Island, which led the international charge to ban commercial whaling and which pioneered the first listings under the world heritage convention&mdash;the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu Stage 1 and Willandra Lakes. Of course, it is the Howard government that now wishes to implement the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust; the largest investment by an Australian government in the natural heritage of Australia in our history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the trust, a number of announcements have been made in very recent times that I believe are landmark, three of which I would like to take the opportunity to mention to the Senate today. First, I am pleased to announce the appointment of Professor Tor Hundloe, an environmental economist, as the new chairperson of the board of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. He is an excellent appointee with a longstanding commitment to environmental protection. It is pleasing that his appointment has received bipartisan support at the state level in Queensland. In fact, Labor in Queensland described it as an outstanding appointment. I do not expect it will receive the same grace from this Labor Party down here. He will be responsible for leading an authority that has a number of very complex issues before it, in particular, finalisation of the management plan for the region and protection of world heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second announcement relates to protecting the albatross. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Howard government has decided to nominate 11 albatross species for listing on the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, otherwise known as the Bonn convention. Albatross are under significant threat from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> commercial fishing operations. This initiative is well worth while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting&mdash;the Labor Party might not like it, of course&mdash;that the initiative has been recognised and applauded by Greenpeace, by WWF, by the Australian Marine Conservation Society and by HSI&mdash;Humane Society International. It is pleasing to see conservation organisations in this country praising the Howard government for its environmental initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to make mention of the whales task force, a promise that we made in the last election and that we have set up. It will be holding its first meeting tomorrow. That task force is to work towards a permanent international ban&mdash;not a moratorium&mdash;on commercial whaling. I remind you that it was the Fraser government that passed the Whale Protection Act in 1980, banning whaling in Australian waters. Now the Howard coalition government is taking it a step further and seeking to create an international environment where&mdash;finally, and long overdue&mdash;the international community might look to a permanent ban on commercial whaling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, it is pleasing to receive the public's support for these initiatives that we are taking. In relation to whaling and the setting up of that task force, I remind you of what Project Jonah, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. We sought to disallow it, but you would not join us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Tierney rightly identifies, the regime that is in place has been there since Kim Beazley, as the minister for communications in 1991, allowed powers and immunities to enable the building of new national infrastructure networks. Let me be clear: it is very important that those networks are in place. I think all Australians want to benefit from lower competitively based telecommunications charges&mdash;in other words, cheaper local phone calls. They want to get access to cable television or at least have the option to do so, and they also want interactive broadband services and the Internet. All of those things flow from the revolution that we are seeing and the new infrastructure that needs to be erected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember the basis on which that legislation was put in place and the window of opportunity that was therefore provided to the two major carriers and consortiums which then proceeded to embark on $3 bullion to $4 billion roll&hyphen;outs. That has been proceeding apace. Let us not have any hypocrisy about Labor's capacity to have tightened the rules. They had every opportunity to do that. They were well and truly briefed. It was well known that the cables would be going overhead more than two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What we have inherited is a regime that, on the one hand, seeks to ensure people get access to the highest quality range of services but, on the other hand, responds within those constraints to genuine residential concerns. In the context of that, we are not simply doing nothing prior to 1 July, when we will introduce a much tougher regime. I hope to an nounce the details of that in the not too distant future. The highlight of that will be that there will be no more overhead cables unless it is with the permission of the relevant state or territory authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that there will be a fundamental change in approach beyond 1 July. Prior to 1 July, within the constraints I have identified, it is very important to try to minimise the visual impact and the concerns that are expressed by residents about the cable roll&hyphen;out. We will stop short of allowing powers of veto, because that would clearly be a breach of the arrangements that were in place and would obviously fundamentally jeopardise the business case of the carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have in mind, and what we have been working on for some weeks now on the basis of a public inquiry that we had not so long ago, is to make some significant changes to the current code to tighten it so there are provisions that will seek to improve the situation. For example, it will be necessary for coaxial cable to be grey, not black&mdash;one of the things that people often complain about very loudly. It will also be a requirement that carriers use best practice to  minimise the potential degradation of environmental amenities and visual appeal associated with facility design and deployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, you will have to hide towers wherever you can. You will have to keep them in such a position, you will have to collocate within reasonable limits, so that these things are not intruding all over the place. It will also be a requirement that subscribers have the option to put the cable underground between the street and their home if they are prepared to pay the incremental cost. Subscribers will also benefit from seeing cables go underground at major intersections. So there will be a number of improvements to the existing code. We are committed to those changes, and we are currently working that process through. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice. Can the minister assure the Senate that the additional expenditure which the government has authorised to fund the continued pursuit of the assets held by Christopher Skase is commensurate with the importance the Prime Minister has rightly attached to this pursuit? Minister, you will recall that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5618"> the Prime Minister said in the House on 10 October, `I will simply say to the Australian public that we will act if there is any earthly likelihood of recovering Christopher Skase's ill-gotten gains.' How much additional expenditure has the Attorney-General authorised to fund the continued pursuit of the assets of Christopher Skase? How will the funds be appropriated&mdash;through the Advance to the Minister for Finance or in the next budget?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins for the question because it gives me the opportunity to remind her of the government that was in power when all of the horror of the 1980s went on&mdash;when so many people fleeced little taxpayers and got away with it. It was under a Labor government; that was when all of this happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wonder whether Senator Collins had actually thought of this before she got put up to ask this question. Clearly she did not because otherwise she would have been smart enough not to ask it. All of this is another mess, isn't it; it is another mess that you created. What a mess you made of the bankruptcy rules. What a complete mess you made. You even messed it up when you tried to fix it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Christopher Skase got away under you. Former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch was not successful. Mr Skase clearly got away when you guys were in power and all of the mess was created when you guys were in power. There are plenty more areas I could get into on that matter if I had the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has made it abundantly clear that he thinks the battlers of Australia deserve some sort of explanation and the Commonwealth is doing what it reasonably can to bring people like Skase back to Australia and to find the assets that many believe are hidden around the globe. We will make appropriate decisions with respect to that, Senator Collins. I feel absolutely confident that they will be better decisions than what your government made, because under your government the mess was made and you let Skase get away. As to the specific detail of your question, since you asked it so nicely, I will get you an answer as quickly as I can.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ellison for the question. There can be no doubt that the special auditor process was extremely valuable to ATSIC, the government and the indigenous community as a whole. As I said in my speech on Friday, ATSIC has told me that the findings of the special auditor will be useful to it in improving grants administration. Perhaps equally importantly, it will enable me to assure the indigenous community, my colleagues in government and the wider Australian community that accountability in ATSIC is as high as in any other area of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators will recall, the special auditor had completed a review of approximately 95 per cent of ATSIC funded organisations when the process stopped. Only 11 per cent of the organisations reviewed were in full compliance with grant conditions. The special auditor expressed serious concerns regarding 292 of the 1,252 organisations reviewed. Those organisations received $172 million in funding in their last year of funding receipt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators may also recall that I undertook to provide details of the final costs of the special auditor when they became available. I have been informed that the final cost of the special auditor is $1,556,315. That cost comprises $1,232,600 for professional fees for the review of organisations; $135,999 in management and reporting fees; $164,149 in out&hyphen;of&hyphen;pocket expenses; and $19,370 in additional training costs due to ATSIC officers in Perth and Melbourne rescheduling reviews, which was agreed to by ATSIC in advance. There was also $4,197 billed as precontract variation fees which is still being discussed. The cost will be met from ATSIC's running costs and will not impact on any program activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of the special auditor was higher than initially estimated because the complexity of the task proved greater than first assumed. The cost of scrutinising organisations about which there were compliance concerns was much higher than that of blemish free <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5622"> organisations. Only 11 per cent of organisations were blemish free. ATSIC has allowed a figure of $1.18 million for the special auditor in their budget this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By any measure, the special auditor provided excellent value for money and will greatly improve outcomes by ensuring that money no longer goes to organisations that are not accountable. As I mentioned earlier, ATSIC has advised me that they found value in the special auditor process. It has provided lessons in accountability requirements and in the importance of training and monitoring outcomes and performance rather than just financial inputs. It raised issues about the number and small size of many organisations that ATSIC funds. ATSIC also advised me that they are closely monitoring those organisations which have been the subject of serious  accountability concerns. I intend to discuss the matters raised by the special auditor with the new board of ATSIC.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, do you stand by your comments made on numerous occasions to the effect that community service obligations and, in particular, free directory services, will not be diminished by either the Telstra sale or any other current telecommunications reforms? Are you aware that, as from yesterday, Telstra has reduced its directory assistance so that it no longer provides addresses and will no longer give telephone numbers to those who require a high level of assistance or do not have the exact address?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5623" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the community service obligations which, as you well know, are enshrined in both the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 and the telecommunications package will certainly remain in place. We are very much committed to them. As far as the changes to directory assistance are concerned, I am sure you are aware that, at the present time, Telstra receives something in the order of 400 million directory assistance calls per year. Ninety&hyphen;six per cent of those relate to inquiries about phone numbers. The other four per cent&mdash;in other words, about 20 million&mdash;range from inquiries concerning not only addresses, but even things like recipes or the weather and all sorts of other extraneous information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is understandable that Telstra is particularly concerned to ensure that people have immediate access where possible. The benchmark that is set in a number of overseas countries is around 10 seconds for answering those calls. To have the system clogged up by people who are effectively using it for purposes for which it was never designed simply deprives others of the opportunity of getting numbers as quickly as they should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, we need to make special arrangements for the visually impaired and print handicapped because they do not have the ability to access White Pages. Therefore, special arrangements will continue for those people. I think you ought to acknowledge, given that it is a free service, that the numbers are growing in the order of 20 to 25 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent a year. There are an extraordinary number of people who choose not to look up numbers in the White Pages but simply take advantage of the service that Telstra provides. The system should not be exacerbated by those who are using it for other purposes including addresses. So, from yesterday, that will no longer be available.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Tierney today, relating to the roll&hyphen;out of telecommunications cable by Optus and Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>In the answer the minister gave he probably ran out of time to give all the information to his own dorothy dixer about what appears to be new government policy on this issue of cabling. Therefore, my comments are to try to seek more information or get clarification from the minister, if I understand correctly what his announcements were when he answered the question from Senator Tierney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the minister outlined the fact that the national code would be amended to take account of new arrangements the government wished to put into place to ameliorate some of the community hostility about overhead cables. Amendments to that code would take place between now and 1 July next year when presumably the post&hyphen;1 July 1997 Telecommunications Act would come into place.</PARA>
<PARA>In particular I note that the minister said that it would be a requirement under the new code for carriers to place the cables underground at intersections. What I am interested in in particular is how that will be imposed under the code. If carriers refuse between now and 1 July to put the cables underground as they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5626"> continue the roll&hyphen;out, will they be eligible for any penalty for breaking the code that the minister outlined? What will that penalty be? How will it be imposed? In addition, I am intrigued to seek further information from the government about whether, if there is going to be a penalty, the penalty will require amendment to the legislation? For example, there is speculation in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  that, if the code is broken, fines of up to $10 million may be imposed against the carrier who breaks the code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would certainly like clarification as to whether such a penalty can be imposed under the code. From my reading of the present legislation, it makes no mention of penalties. Do there have to be amendments under the legislation so that some authority can impose the penalty? The government should clarify quickly what is required in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is possible through this code between now and 1 July to tell the carriers to go underground at an intersection with cabling, why cannot the code also be used between now and then to tell carriers to go underground everywhere, or have the carriers agreed voluntarily from now on to go underground at an intersection? If they refuse between now and 1 July, how will the minister apply the penalty for it? The minister has opened up the matter by his answer. I agree that he ran out of time; there may have been further information coming. I am raising these further queries in the hope that he may be able to answer some of them because, at the moment, there may be confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that, in the press reports today, some government backbenchers&mdash;a Mr Hardgrave and a Mr Neville&mdash;have both said that the issue that has been outlined here by the minister is still not the end of it as far as they are concerned. Although the Prime Minister appears to have rejected Mr Abbott's suggestion of a telephone levy, Mr Hardgrave in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> today said that the idea would not go away and that one option would direct contributions from three levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> It appears that there is still genuine debate going on amongst the minister's own govern ment and amongst his own backbench, and I do not decry that. That debate is going on in the community; it is going on in all political parties. The real issue I want to hear about from the minister, if it is at all possible today is: how can he impose a penalty or a direction on putting cables underground at an intersection under the present code? I would be very appreciative of an answer to that. If we do not get a reasonable answer, I think it will create more confusion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked: if you can stop them from going underground at major intersections, why cannot you stop them going underground everywhere? We get back to the fundamental issue here, which I know you are very much aware of, and that is that the carriers have their rights. They have been in place since 1991. They have built their business cases accordingly. They have incurred significant supply contract obligations. They have embarked upon strategies for roll&hyphen;out. They have obviously taken all of that into account as far as the imminent float of Optus Communications is concerned and to move the goal post or fundamentally change the rules well into the final quarter would be a devastating <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rejection and would leave the government open to liability on a number of fronts.</PARA>

There are two ways to do it. One is to set up a better interconnect arrangement between Telstra, Optus and the other players. If you had done that, perhaps we would not have had to go through all this nonsense. The other <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way to do it would be to collocate the cables underground.

The point about major intersections&mdash;indeed, all intersections&mdash;is that there may be compelling reasons why you have to go underground anyway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it has been a spectacle here this afternoon. We have watched the two major parties accuse and counteraccuse one another of being guilty over this issue. I think it is time both parties accepted that mistakes have been made and that this is now the time to start to deal with this problem in some serious way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I suggested in this place yesterday, the government could start by instructing Telstra to put its cables underground. I would have thought that one of the great advantages of owning corporations such as Telstra would be that the government had control over what it did. However, the government has chosen not to take that direction, and I think there will be quite considerable concern out there in the community because of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said this afternoon, both by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and by members of the government, about a national code and the need to `tighten up'. I think that was the phrase that was used. As I understand it, the minister already decided some time ago to abandon the national code. The senators need to be reminded that we have already had two attempts, neither of which was satisfactory to anybody. In fact, there are plenty of arguments that suggest the second attempt was no more satisfactory than the first one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take the opportunity today to read from some of the hundreds of letters that I have received on what people think about the situation. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The City of Unley does not accept the view, "that nothing can be done". Information available to us <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strongly suggests that not only will the cable roll out activities of Optus and Telstra be more costly in the longer run, but they will be contrary to a State which promotes itself as a technologically "smart State".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We suggest that with cooperation between all three levels of Government, together with Optus and Telstra, that a most satisfactory outcome could be achieved for our South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on. The city of Mitcham in South Australia says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this Federal Government inherited the rules governing the matter in which telecommunications networks are rolled out. This is generally understood, and even former Labor Party members such as Senator Chris Schacht and Kim Carr have conceded the former government "got it wrong"&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>They got it wrong&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">when they framed this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Australian community is not concerned about whose fault the current inadequate legislation is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think we might disagree with that point from the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I will go on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are concerned about how this Government will allow this inadequately regulatory framework to continue, resulting in more and more urban streetscapes being ravaged by thick ugly cables which are outdated and unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA>I have another letter. This time it is from the city of Burnside. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overwhelming majority of our residents do not believe that the provision of advanced telecommunications justifies the use of aerial cabling for construction of cable networks. A survey conducted in the City showed that three quarters of the population hold this view and the number of complaints and queries we constantly receive from residents only reinforce Council's view that there is serious disquiet in a large proportion of the community, about the liberty telecommunications carriers have under the current legislative framework to erect aerial cabling despite community objection.</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on reading from the letters that I have, and they are much along these lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I heard this afternoon from the minister is that all it needs is some finetuning, that we should not push too far and that we should be encouraging a competitive model. But I ask: what about the consumers? Nobody has gone to them and said, `Is aerial cabling <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5630"> acceptable to you. Are you prepared to pay a little extra to put it underground? Do you want your trees demolished in your street in order to make way for cables?' The answer is no. At no stage has the government, either this government or the former government, asked people from the community for their own views about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So tightening up the code will not be an answer to this problem. Turning the black wires into grey ones will not be an answer to the problem. Certainly saying that major or minor or intermediate intersections should have it underground will also not save those trees in people's streetscapes. It will not solve the problem of the visual blight that aerial cables are providing to our streetscapes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think this afternoon's spectacle of accusation and counteraccusation simply demonstrates to the community that nobody is willing to take the necessary steps on the part of the government to solve this very serious problem&mdash;one which a very large community in Australia is very much opposed to.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ellison today, relating to the report of the special auditor of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday in question time it was revealed&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;the completely hopeless grasp that this minister has of his portfolio. Now, of course, it is getting towards a year in the job. It is eight months at this point. This minister knows so little&mdash;and, in my view, cares so little&mdash;about what goes on in his portfolio that, in a prepared speech that he himself described as a major speech which would indicate new directions in Aboriginal affairs, he was advocating only last Friday that Aboriginal people have regard and access to a very successful program, a program which I administered when I was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, a business advice in rural areas program which his <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government had, in fact, abolished in the last budget. Then, when caught out on it, instead of simply saying, `Yes, I wasn't aware of that' he compounded this nonsense by pretending that he knew the program has been abolished. He then made up a story that the ATSIC board had, in fact, abolished it but he was going to go back and talk to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I raise this point is that it is the same answer that he gave in here again today. When women's organisations complained about the closure of women's centres in the Northern Territory, which provide such invaluable input into a community, the minister's immediate public response was, `Oh, yes, the ATSIC board made that decision, but I will go back and talk to them about it.' When the 206 organisations that are going to have to close the doors which were raised here today, the minister's immediate response is to say, `That's ATSIC's fault. ATSIC did that. It is nothing to do with us. I will go back and talk to them.' He does it all the time, and it is starting to wear a little thin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But these are really minor issues compared to the inherent contradictions in Senator Herron's rhetoric and actions. The minister continues to totally ignore his statutory responsibility to seek advice from ATSIC on major issues, at the same time as promoting this so&hyphen;called new policy of self&hyphen;empowerment. I thought Pryor got it right yesterday in his cartoon. He was spot&hyphen;on, as Pryor often is. He defined the difference between self&hyphen;determination and self&hyphen;empowerment as being one syllable and $400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister talks about self&hyphen;empowerment at the same time as he admits before Senate estimates that thousands of Aboriginal people will no longer have the option of working for unemployment benefits&mdash;the only people in Australia who do so, I might add&mdash;because of cuts to CDEP. He admits that thousands of Aboriginal trainees will be out of a job, as the 206 organisations that I have referred to, which provide essential services for child care, disabled care and elderly care, will have to close down. Why did these organisations start in the first place? Because of an identified lack of services provided by the so&hyphen;called <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5631"> mainstream services the minister wants Aboriginal people to have regard to. Because of the failure of mainstream services to provide these needs in the first place, these organisations existed. They are now going to close, to the great detriment of the people that access their services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister talks about self&hyphen;empowerment at the same time as he busily reinforces the myth&mdash;he did so again today&mdash;that most Aboriginal organisations are not accountable by quoting the special auditor's report. And he deliberately distorted what the report says, yet again. He does so gleefully. He salivates at the prospect of putting down an Aboriginal organisation. The cold hard fact is&mdash;people can rely on it&mdash;that if you get in the press by attacking Aboriginal organisations, you have got an almost gilt&hyphen;edged guarantee that whatever you say will be repeated in here with great glee by the minister for aboriginal affairs on your behalf. He did it again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that point 1.1 on the first page of the bare 26 pages of the special auditor's report&mdash;the first point in the report&mdash;says that the audit has cleared 95 per cent of all Aboriginal organisations for funding in Australia. And yet we have the appalling performance by this minister who said again, with great glee, that only 11 per cent comply. Mr Deputy President, as you would be aware as a long serving  member of the Senate, that refers to organisations that did not get a single qualification by the auditor. That test would apply to hardly a single organisation in this country. Just look at the reports of the National Audit Office on statutory authorities and government departments. It is an almost impossible hurdle to leap over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister knows that that is what the special auditor's report actually says. It is to his utter discredit that he came in here again today and quoted with a great deal of glee that same distortion of the report to again put down an Aboriginal organisation that he as minister should be supporting.</PARA>

<PARA>I think it is highly illustrative of the differences that are appearing within the coalition ranks of the Liberal Party and the National Party that, 10 days after the National Party federal conference, the federal minister&mdash;a Liberal Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs&mdash;has not seen or had drawn to her attention any of the resolutions from the conference; a conference which discussed HECS and other higher education and rural education issues. I think it is an indictment of this particular minister and her staff that she has not taken into consideration what is being said by parts of the coalition about the impact of the coalition's policies on people in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite obvious that the Liberal Party is taking absolutely no notice whatsoever of their National Party coalition colleagues on education issues or, for that matter, on any other issue which the National Party and its members may be experiencing in the bush. This is almost a repeat of the speech I gave yesterday on the same issue. The neglect and disregard that the coalition's senior partners show to their junior partners is almost criminal. The members of the National Party are very keen to point out that, within the federal parliament, they have had an increasing number of representations from members of their party who represent rural areas. But it does not seem to make any difference to the coalition's policies. Their policies still ignore people living in the bush and still impact badly upon farming areas. As I said earlier, I think it is an indictment of the minister that although this conference took place 10 days ago, she has not taken any notice of the resolutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is dead right but, if your government gets its way, there will be a lot less broadcasting on the ABC in the years ahead, with the draconian cuts that you have outlined and have imposed on the ABC as a clear and absolute breach of your own election promises only eight or nine months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the Senate that the coalition government said during the election campaign earlier this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in their better communications policy statement of 18 January 1996. They also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio.</PARA>
<PARA>To make sure there was no doubt about this, on the night of the election after the result of the election was clear, Senator Alston, the incoming communications minister, was asked a few questions in the tally room by ABC reporter Jim Middleton:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First of all the commitment close to home about the ABC and the commitment to maintain funding in real terms over the term of the coming parliament, does that stand?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alston: Absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no equivocation, no qualification. He said, `Absolutely.' Jim Middleton then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if you discover on Monday that the budget's bottom line is much worse than the government's been saying?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alston: Oh yes. I think John Howard's made it very plain that we want to maintain&mdash;honour&mdash;all our commitments and the ABC is a very important part of that.</PARA>
<PARA>That promise has been comprehensively broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Senate estimates committee hearing a month or so ago, when Senator Alston was asked about this clear breach of his own promise both as a shadow minister on the night of the election and when it became clear that he would be the new minister, he said, `Well, you have to understand that my words were affected by the euphoria of the moment.' It seems to me the word `euphoria' is probably a description for the fact that he might have had too much to drink. I do not know. That was the only limp excuse he could give. The `euphoria of the moment' meant that he said `absolutely'. He did not qualify it in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, we have seen the impact on the ABC. Why this opposition has moved this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5637"> very important matter of public importance today is that in recent weeks we have started to see the impacts of the first cuts to the ABC, not the total cuts. We have seen the impact on the ABC and the reduction of programs particularly in radio and metropolitan radio as a result of the efficiency dividend cut across the board, which was about $11 million for this year of 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is yet to come to the ABC is the imposition of the cut announced in July of this year by the government of $55 million over the subsequent three years. It means a $209 million cut to the ABC over the next four years&mdash;$209 million, a clear and absolute breach of their own promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen already, with the first cut of $10 million, is massive bleeding, massive haemorrhaging, in the ABC. Goodness knows what is going to happen next year when the first of the $55 million cuts will be imposed on this great national broadcaster that has been operating since the early 1930s and is recognised worldwide as one of the best of two or three national public broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen around Australia in the last few weeks changes in broadcasting at metropolitan radio stations. These changes have been quite dramatic and have created real concern for the community as well as for the ABC. The stations being affected are: 5AN in Adelaide, in my own state; 3LO in Melbourne; 2BL in Sydney; 4QR in Brisbane; 6WF in Western Australia; 7ZR in Hobart; and 8DDD in Darwin. They are the major AM band radio stations that provide quality community information&mdash;quality interviews, including some talkback, on current events of interest to the broad range of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not get that quality with commercial broadcasters that are driven purely by ratings and talkback that is aimed at reinforcing what the listener wants to hear. The ABC quality radio stations that I have listed are about providing extra and additional information to improve the quality of discussion about these issues in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first $10 million in cuts is being directed at those radio stations. We know this fits the political agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Howard), who wants Australians to feel comfortable and relaxed and who does not want the ABC broadcasting things that he describes as politically correct or what he described last night in his Menzies memorial lecture as so-called people who wear a black armband for Australian history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Howard again outlined last night that he thinks the best time for Australia was in 1955 when the Menzies regime was at its height. That is what he hankers after. That is what he believes was the best time in Australia. It is an extraordinary position to have a Prime Minister in the last five years of the 20th century saying that the best time was nearly 40 years ago in the middle of the Menzies era, that this is what we should try to emulate. I do not think there are many people in Australia across the board who would like to go back to that time, unless you happen to be in a particular small segment of Australian society who dominated the way the country was run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the attack has come upon these radio stations so that quality broadcasting comes to an end. In my own state the horrendous attack of these cuts is on 5AN. This is in a state that has one monopoly daily newspaper, owned by News Limited, the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, which under no description could be said to be providing a broad base of community discussion. The ABC in Adelaide is the only alternative major voice for news and commentary for a population of over one million people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keith Conlon, one of the most successful broadcasters on 5AN for many years, has announced that he is resigning from the position at the end of this year. He said that the cuts make it untenable. Last week the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> gave coverage for the first time in detail&mdash;and I have to compliment the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>; I wish they would do more of it&mdash;of what was happening to the ABC in South Australia. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conlon believes that cuts to 5AN are being generated for the "most cynical" of reasons&mdash;fear of hard questioning from politicians who dislike the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If you ask well-researched questions, you are regarded as the enemy," Conlon says. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5638"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Elements of the Coalition are not interested in  vigorous questioning, which should be applied to any political party. Serious analysis makes you part of the enemy."</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Keith Conlon said in Adelaide last week. It is one of the reasons he is leaving. One of the other journalists, Matt Abraham, is losing his position because right across the board mid&hyphen;morning and late morning programs on metropolitan radio have been combined into one as a cost cutting measure. That is the period when most people are listening to ABC radio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the most successful radio programs are being cut. Whether it is 5AN, 2BL or 3LO, they are all being cut and reduced in their ability to provide a forum for people to air important issues&mdash;issues that probably do make the present Prime Minister uncomfortable and less relaxed but important issues for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to 2BL, we find a station that services 600,000 or 700,000 listeners every morning. A program format developed by the late great Andrew Olle is now being destroyed because of the imposition of these cuts. This station does all of this with 31 staff. There are very few radio stations in the world that service a listening audience of this size with this quality with only 30 staff. It is not overstaffed. There are not slackers and people sitting in back rooms doing nothing in the running of 2BL. It is a very efficiently run radio station, as are all the metropolitan radio programs. But they are being targeted first in these cuts and we are going to see a reduction in the quality of the ABC as a result of these savage cuts by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to oppose the motion and to speak about `our ABC' but from a very different perspective to that presented by Senator Schacht. Our view of the ABC is all about the future. It is about government creating the conditions for creative renewal. It is about positioning the corporation for what will be a radically different environment. It has everything to do with assisting the ABC to reposition and redefine itself as a first class public broadcast <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> er, one that defines and reflects who we are and what we aspire to as a community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me outline why there is every reason to be optimistic about the future of the ABC. Surely by now there cannot be anyone left in the community who sincerely doubts the government's commitment to the ABC. There is a compelling case to be made for a public broadcaster of independence and integrity. Nothing the government has done threatens the integrity or the future of the organisation. Although the ABC ought to be preserved, and the government is committed to this outcome, it cannot be frozen in time, impervious to change and the real world of technological change, if it is to be the vital cultural organisation all Australians want it to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to recount the positive steps taken by the government towards allowing the ABC a real opportunity for change without damaging changes to what it produces. To start with, the government has maintained its commitment to current levels of funding to the ABC, subject to the two per cent cut to running costs which was generally applied to all government departments and agencies. This of course reflects and responds to the fiscal mess the government inherited from Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No credible case could be made to quarantine or exempt the ABC from these reductions. It could not be seriously suggested that other programs such as education, health and hospital allocations should bear a disproportionate cut and leave the ABC untouched. In any event, the ABC will receive in total approximately $531 million of taxpayers' money in 1996-97 and approximately $496 million in 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite dire predictions, the sky has not fallen in&mdash;contrary to what Senator Schacht has said. Those more measured in response are quick to see the opportunity for the ABC to make improvements, to make efficiencies, to develop a streamlined operational structure and to become better focused, better able to deliver quality services and activities and be able to justify the cost to the taxpayer of maintaining it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it should come as no surprise that, despite the hand-wringing of Senator Schacht, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5639"> when Mr Gareth Evans was communications minister way back in 1988, he outlined an approach for the ABC which sounds uncannily familiar. In 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We simply cannot seriously or sensibly address the question of funding for the ABC without at the same time looking seriously or sensibly at its role and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>One might echo a well&hyphen;known retort of a former Labor leader&mdash;`What are they going on about?' Only the wilfully misinformed or the most flagrantly self-interested would suggest that there is no room for change and improvement in the ABC. To attribute cuts in programming to funding cuts is going off half&hyphen;shot, if I may say so. It is a false premise which fails to establish the causal connection between program changes and funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take radio for instance. The changes that have occurred to programming within ABC radio have not been made by the government. We have said it a number of times before, but it bears repeating: ABC management is autonomous; the ABC board is independent; the government does not control programming. Many of the hard decisions that the ABC has taken, the decisions that have seen changes in radio programming, have resulted from the ABC's own $13.5 million budgetary blow&hyphen;out, not the government's decision to reduce funding by two per cent in line with across-the-board measures. This has meant the taxpayer has had to find another $13 million, and another $13 million added on the national debt. Well before the budget, the Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Brian Johns, publicly acknowledged that the ABC had an internal shortfall and was in need of fundamental restructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Answers provided in estimates suggest something other than a national crisis for the national broadcaster. Firstly, it should be noted that some $6 million has been isolated as being saved in management and infrastructure without any impact on programming. A million dollars in savings is anticipated from reductions in non-program related travel and the purchase of office equipment. Five million dollars in savings are expected to be from management and administration costs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC has stated that there will be no effect on rural, remote and regional communities as a result of a reduction in operating expenses. There will be no effect on children's programs or sporting programs. There will be no effect on entertainment programs. No news or current affairs programs will be removed. There will be no impact on the amount of Australian content on ABC radio. In areas where changes have been made, say, in terms of in-house documentaries and dramas, there will be no impact on documentaries, but the Radio National radio play <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Box Seat</EMPHASIS> will be discontinued and resources directed into the Sunday play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already much of the ABC's drama and documentary outputs are co-productions or made by independent producers. What is the magic then of the ABC producing this product itself if it can save costs and retain Australian content by commissioning or buying it from independents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local radio will have some changes with morning programs combined on metropolitan radio and regional stations accessing part of the program. There will be regional&hyphen;metropolitan links in early afternoons. Aside from Western Australia, there will be a national evening program. Victoria and South Australia will have state wide programs on Sunday mornings. There will be some changes in programming to Radio National, with certain programs being shortened or combined and incorporated with other similar programs, but these programs will not be taken off the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC's unsuccessful and costly venture into pay TV was no myth. While efforts have been made to cut the losses incurred with free to air news and current affairs, this remains a singularly unsuccessful and costly venture. I can go on, but instead I would rather be positive. This government has recognised that, if the ABC is to meet the challenges ahead not only in terms of funding but also in terms of the technological transformation of the communication industry, it will need assistance to redefine and reposition itself for the fast approaching 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mansfield inquiry announced in July is charged with responsibility to review the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5640"> future role and functions of the ABC and to report to the minister. At long last there is an opportunity for real reform of the ABC and for the targeting of services and activities in key areas. It has been 15 years since the Dix review, the last independent review of the ABC. Of course the broadcasting and communications environment has changed. It is a different landscape and the Mansfield inquiry is timely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is to truly be `our ABC', action must match the rhetoric. The review is the first time in 15 years that the community&mdash;the real stakeholders in the future of the ABC&mdash;has been able to have a say on the roles and priorities of the ABC. If the ABC is truly to be for all of us and not just some of us, we should welcome this examination and embrace the outcome.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats in this debate today to support the matter of public importance before the chamber which has been proposed by Senator Chris Schacht and which we endorse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixty-four years ago Australia's only independent national broadcaster was born. It was committed, in the words of former Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, to `service all sections and to satisfy the diversified tastes of the public'. Obviously the ABC has evolved since then&mdash;I hesitate to say that it has `grown', because that would imply that it is, perhaps, a larger version of what it was 64 years ago. It has evolved. It has changed, diversified, embraced new technologies and evolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From its humble beginnings as a radio broadcaster it now consists of six Australia wide radio networks, nine metropolitan radio stations, 49 regional stations, Radio National, ABC Classic FM, the Parliamentary and News Network on radio, a national television service, Australia Television, six symphony orchestras, 24 ABC shops, over 110 ABC centres and an on&hyphen;line Internet service. It has done all of this only with guaranteed and adequate federal government funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal and National parties' election document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Communications</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this vast network provides a diverse range of programs and performances of cultural value and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intellectual integrity. The ABC has a proud record of offering high quality and diverse programming across a broad spectrum of human interests including news, current affairs, drama, sport, and the arts.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it has. The Democrats endorse that statement wholeheartedly, and I am sure this view is supported and shared by the majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact in June this year an AGB McNair poll found that 61 per cent of respondents opted for the maintenance of government funding to the ABC at existing levels. Twenty&hyphen;four per cent declared that the funding should be increased. That is 85 per cent, a powerful majority, supporting the work of the ABC. The poll, incidentally, included regular ABC listeners as well as those Australians who do not listen to or do not avail themselves of the national broadcaster's services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must ask what has happened in the past few months to change the mind of the coalition government. Before the election, clearly the coalition strongly supported the ABC. Why, since then, has the coalition government opted to break the ABC's triennial funding arrangement when it said it would honour it? Why has the government suddenly decided that the ABC should contribute to budget reduction measures when the ABC was quarantined from the so-called efficiency dividend under its funding arrangement? Obviously this was merely election propaganda on behalf of the coalition parties&mdash;or should I say the cabinet, because it appears that the government does not have the full support of its own members on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have to look at the National Party conference which has opposed funding cuts to the ABC. The National Farmers Federation has opposed the ABC cuts. Even the Young Liberals have come out quite outspokenly and opposed the cuts to the ABC. Why have they done so?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="LUNDY" NAMEID="7G6">

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am looking too, Senator Lundy, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to find people who support the cuts. Clearly the polls show us that they do not. We cannot find members in the coalition ranks who support the cuts and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5641"> certainly the other parties in this place do not support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't people then support the cuts? Clearly because they know the damage that these cuts will have on the ABC and, most importantly, the damage that these cuts will have on rural, remote and local communities who rely on the ABC for information and entertainment as well as locally produced and relevant material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come to believe that the ABC is protected by legislation&mdash;the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act of 1983. But is this act really enough to protect the ABC from the viciousness of successive governments intent on destroying the ABC through funding cuts after funding cuts? No, it is not. There are several reasons, but there are two specific reasons why this legislation appears to be no longer fully protective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, in its charter, the ABC is required to `provide services which are comprehensive . . . of a high standard . . . which inform and which educate'. Politicians of all persuasions and other powerful groups are sometimes discomforted by the ABC's pursuit of their activities, perhaps even irritated by their independence. In fact, we heard Senator Schacht earlier refer to the fact that on occasions even our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was a little less relaxed and was uncomfortable by the scrutiny that the ABC provides of his role and also that of other politicians and other parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But a broadcaster which seeks to inform the community of the disadvantage of a particular government policy, say, is not something that the government of that day wants to hear. The government would prefer that the community actually took what was served to them&mdash;that they listened to programs that fully supported and favoured their particular views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But do we really want an ABC that is run with some kind of national totalitarian stance? Do we really want to be fed the views that are comfortable to governments and decision makers? Of course we do not, and I, for one, strongly dissent from that notion. Secondly, and to further guarantee that the legislation is not sufficient protection for the ABC, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has now announced the Mansfield inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to a question on notice at the estimates committee, the minister stated that the budget provided guaranteed funding levels for the ABC in 1996-97 and 1997-98. That is true. There is a guaranteed cut of $67 million. What happens to the ABC after the 1997-98 financial year? Again, I will quote from the minister's response to the estimates committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . funding levels of the final two years of the new triennium will be determined in the 1997-98 Budget, following consideration of the Mansfield report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure people in the ABC hope that this is not a euphemism for further cuts to the ABC budget. I am confident that Mr Mansfield will judiciously review ABC funding. I hope that, if this is a truly open and politically free review, Mr Mansfield will seek to have the funding of the ABC restored to the level that it should have been this year, which is $560 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Budget cuts in and of themselves do not mean that an organisation will necessarily become more streamlined or productive. This is contrary to the remarks that we have heard previously from Senator Coonan. Cutting a budget does not make an organisation more efficient and productive and more able to fulfil its legislative objectives, retain or retrain its employees or offer stable and ongoing employment&mdash;of course it does not&mdash;but this seems to be the false belief of coalition members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that the ABC, now trimmed of its fat, will be able to operate more effectively and efficiently. It is time for a reality check. In the months since the budget was brought down, the ABC has been forced to axe programs on Radio National and ABC television. So the cuts are taking place. Contrary to what we heard the speaker before me say, we are aware of funding cuts having an impact on programming. There will be more networking of programs, less live music, less drama, less science, less religion and less sport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be less programming of programs that appeal to groups with special <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5642"> interests, such as children, geographically isolated people and young people. Look at what the coalition has done to Triple J. Senator Hill has no qualms about standing up in this place and saying that he is a great Triple J fan. Unfortunately, it does not stop his government from making cuts to the Triple J Unearthed project or the Internet site. Young people as well as people in isolated communities, women and people from indigenous communities will suffer under these budget cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the ABC will lose the very thing that makes it unique: its independence and its responsibility to provide innovative and comprehensive broadcasting services that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform, entertain and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community. We want a publicly funded national broadcaster that is comprehensive and free of political interference, that informs and entertains in this country and that is able to offer programs on television and radio which appeal to every section of the Australian community here and overseas. We want to be able to listen to live Australian orchestras, knowing that they are fully supported by this government. Under a coalition government, this once reality appears now to be merely a dream.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht has today proposed as a matter of public importance: </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent impacts of the Liberal Government's draconian cuts to the ABC which include a dramatic effect on the programming output of the national public broadcaster and in particular ABC Radio.</PARA>
<PARA>In supporting this proposition today, I would like to highlight that, as far as I am concerned, there is no doubt in my mind that the Australian people as a whole regard the ABC of particular importance and have great affection for it, particularly for its strength, independence and capacity to operate as a comprehensive broadcaster. The Australian people reject proposals that this government has in train which would seek to undermine the independence of the ABC, diminish its capacity to offer a comprehensive service and would, in effect, turn it from a broadcaster for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> all Australians into a broadcaster or plaything for a few, particularly the Liberal Party few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians would not have got that impression from what was said prior to the election. The Senate committee inquiry into the ABC last year, chaired by Senator Alston, highlighted this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee believes that the basic structure of the ABC is sound and that the organisation is considerably stronger and more relevant to the Australian community now than it was ten years ago. The Committee is confident that the ABC has the ability to overcome the problems which it has identified, and that the ABC is strongly placed to meet the challenges ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also found this in the majority report, which was signed by Senator Alston:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the maintenance of current funding levels in real terms, and would support favourable consideration of any application for the provision of additional funds to ensure the viability of new joint Parliamentary and ABC approved Charter activities.</PARA>
<PARA>The public may well have got the impression that the members who made up the majority of the committee&mdash;they were predominantly Liberal Party members&mdash;may well have been supporting the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you take the commitments in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better Communications </EMPHASIS>policy document of the then opposition and now government, you may too have got the impression that the Liberal Party was in favour of expanding the ABC and improving it. It was making commitments to fully fund the ABC and to make sure that it was able to do its job properly and effectively. That was clearly the impression that would be gained further by the commitments made after the election. Reporter Jim Middleton of the ABC asked a direct question to Senator Alston about maintaining funding in real terms over the term of the coming parliament. Senator Alston indicated on election night, `Absolutely.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We saw before the Senate committee, however, that those impressions may well have been flawed or not understood fully. On the night of the election, Senator Alston said that there was a lot of noise and that he was perhaps affected by the euphoria of the occasion. He said it may well have been the case that he misunderstood what was being <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5643"> asked of him. Senator Alston indicated to the committee that he believed Mr Middleton on that occasion was putting something completely novel to him. Completely novel indeed! Many Australians regard it as completely novel that the Liberal Party should present a position for such a long time and then, straight after coming into government, change that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians would be very sorry to understand the government's intention for the ABC. Despite the various protests that have been made by Liberal senators, the proposals before this parliament in effect mean that there will be cuts to the ABC of $209 million over the next four  years. We have already seen cuts of $11 million identified for 1996-97 and of $55 million for 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great outrage that has been expressed concerning changes to ABC radio and the effects on ABC services that we are currently witnessing is only the beginning. What we are seeing is the first round of cuts. We have not heard anything about the implementation of the second round of cuts to occur in 1997&hyphen;98&mdash;the $55 million cut. We have not heard the damaging impact that that will have in terms of running the ABC in that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen what this government's real intentions are. For instance, in the commitments that the government has entered into with the appointment of the new chair of the ABC and the letters sent to the Remuneration Tribunal concerning that appointment, the government has made it clear that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chair will be required to refocus the ABC, narrowing the range of its activities to concentrate more clearly on its public service role. The chair will be required to instil within the corporation the need for higher standards of professionalism and integrity to provide a great level of public confidence in the ABC's objectivity.</PARA>
<PARA>So wrote the secretary of the communications department to the Remuneration Tribunal, clearly operating on government instructions and indicating the government's policy directions that have been taken. Various other statements have been made by Senator Alston who announced in June of this year that the ABC budget was a very bloated one. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) joined the attack by indicating, in terms of the audit commission <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> findings, that there was a lack of accountability as far as the ABC was concerned. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated to Fran Kelly on 17 June that the ABC was politically correct to a fault and that there tends to be a concentration around one particular point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 16 July, the Mansfield inquiry was announced. Again, it highlighted the government's preoccupation with refocusing the ABC in such a way as to narrow the ABC's capacity to service Australians well. ABC management, in its submission to the Mansfield inquiry, has made it perfectly clear where it sees its role and its duty. I concur with the points that it has made in that submission where it said that it regards the three main functions of the ABC as: to defend and promote Australian identity and culture; to create diversity of choice; and to service a guarantee of the right of Australians to unrestricted access to information. That is quite clearly what this government has threatened. That is what is under challenge at the moment in terms of these spending cuts to the ABC. What is being challenged is the very identity of the ABC in such a manner as to seek to fundamentally change the structure of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Melbourne quite dramatic cuts are taking place. Of the 150 staff reductions in ABC radio, 24 will be from Melbourne. Of the 157 staff reductions in ABC television, 33 will be from Victoria, including 12 news and current affairs staff in Melbourne, quite contrary to what is being said on the other side in terms of the effect on current affairs and news. There are cuts in morning and late morning radio programs in Melbourne and cuts to late afternoon and Sunday morning Melbourne metropolitan radio programs. In television, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> staff in Melbourne have been reduced by two reporters and one producer. We have seen the sacking of Douglas Aiton, Elaine Canty and the resignation of Peter Couchman in Melbourne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the matter of public importance proposed by Senator Schacht. At the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5644"> outset, I declare that I have a personal interest in the ABC&mdash;I was once a member of ABC staff. I am a great supporter of public broadcasting and the principle of public broadcasting. I believe that it provides an invaluable service to our regional and remote communities and, of course, it is an alternative, commercial&hyphen;free radio and television option for people in the cities. Generally speaking, I am a very keen advocate of the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja said today, `Why would we have a review?' I am sorry she is not here to hear my answer. I firmly believe that the government has a very clear responsibility to ensure that public funds are widely and wisely dispensed, especially to public authorities with very large budgets such as the ABC. I do not think that is a controversial proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public accountability is now widely accepted and it is generally agreed on a bipartisan basis. In fact, at the micro level we have the estimates process which looks into departmental accounting and we have independent investigations on a wider, macro basis. Why is the ABC review any different? Why is the ABC an exception to the rule? Many publicly funded authorities complain that they are always undergoing public scrutiny and independent inquiries. In fact, I have heard some of them say they go through paralysis through analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the CSIRO has a similar budget to the ABC and since 1979 it has had more than six major reviews. But the ABC, which began in 1932, has had only two major, wide ranging reviews. The last was in 1979. So the ABC has had two comprehensive reviews in more than 60 years. Surely another review is not unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Alex Dix gave a five&hyphen;volume report back in 1979 and many of the recommendations that were made by that committee of review were taken up. In fact, one of the earlier speakers made the comment that it formed the basis of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. In my view, it makes good business sense to review any publicly funded structure to ensure that they are operating under an appropriate framework. Clearly, the community agrees. There have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been more than 11,500 submissions already received by the Mansfield review. I am looking forward, very much, to having a look at the one from the hot&hyphen;shot locker opposite, especially after the diatribe that we heard from him. Now, of course, having made his own contribution, he has decided to leave the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very concerned to ensure that the ABC does contain a framework whereby it continues its personal commitment to public broadcasting. In fact, just in the last sitting week I met with the chairman of the ABC, Donald McDonald, to put my concerns to him. I was personally reassured by his very clear commitment to high quality broadcasting and the assurances that he made to me that service commitments would be maintained. I must say that I am very interested in the service commitments to regional and rural Australia, in particular in northern Australia where the cyclone warnings have often saved lives and certainly the lives of stock belonging to remote pastoralists. The graziers alert and the frost warnings for our primary producers are extremely important public service commitments by the ABC which I have been assured by the chairman will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am an advocate of the ABC and I told the Friends of the ABC that when they came to see me last week. I also told them that it is often quite hard to be an advocate for the ABC because some of the staff themselves seem to be unaware of the need for cooperation to maximise efficiencies whilst trying to contain costs. For example, five Canberra based commentators went to the Liberal Party's Hobart conference as well as camera crews and goodness knows how many from ABC Hobart. I have personal experience as well that shows that management is still locked into the rule of three&hyphen;person TV crews years and years after commercial television has moved to only two. I think all of us in this House have seen up to six individual journalists attending media conferences on the same subject and nobody seems to be sharing resources. It does make it hard to be an advocate for the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, in my view the Mansfield review has provided the ABC with a very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5645"> important opportunity to refocus and review. This is an organisation with very strong foundations set in our communities and the ABC must double&hyphen;check that its framework and charter remain appropriate. I firmly believe that the result will be as important to its future as the Dix review. I feel very confident that the ABC will continue to be a dynamic and high quality broadcaster, whilst at the same time satisfying the need for prudent fund management which I know we are all committed to.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Isn't it time that we again recognise the need to bring back localism in both radio and television production? Communities in regional Australia are entitled to have their issues raised and debated, just as are our metropolitan cousins.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! I agree with that. I suspect that there are many coalition backbenchers who agree also and are equally appalled with the activities of the minister and the government with respect to the ABC cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC employs almost 250 staff in regional areas, not including casual employees, and this staff covers 34 full sized regional stations and 14 smaller stations providing essential services. Who but the ABC keeps a tab on the height of the Darling River or on sheep and cattle prices? It does keep regional Australia in touch with their local communities, businesses and the environment, as well as with their urban counterparts. It is supported out there and the services provided service a very real need. This is not a service that has just come about because the government thought it was a good idea. It is a service that is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year a McNair poll showed that 85 per cent of people polled said that the ABC should at minimum retain current funding levels. In the same survey only nine per cent said that there should be any reduction. The Friends of the ABC, the regional alliances that were subsequently formed and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rallies attracting tens of thousands of people have all provided a clear message to this government. I have spoken on numerous occasions in this place previously regarding the activities of the ACT Friends of the ABC and regional activities. Only last week I attended a very crowded ACT Friends of the ABC meeting. It is not going away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the clear will of the people in this matter and promises to the contrary that have been very clearly outlined by my colleague Senator Schacht, like many services funded by the public, this government will attack regional services. It is not even being shy about it. Members of the government, like the member for Herbert, will have to decide whether they are going to toe the government's hard, dry line or come out and defend the ABC and the services that it provides to regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to the ABC mask another agenda, but not very well. First of all, the cuts will remove the quality programming and reduce the regional services. They will also result in the sacking of some 900 people from the ABC. However, the cuts are not structured just to deliver a short&hyphen;term bottom line improvement on the budget outcomes. They are designed specifically to incrementally dismantle the ABC's ability to provide core services such as regional radio. The Mansfield inquiry will play the justly feared hand of political interference by this government. The coalition has had a long and public record of accusing the ABC of being unbalanced. In a government that was pretty well tainted with pay&hyphen;back mentality from the day it took office, sadly, perhaps it is little wonder that we have seen such a lethal blow via the budget to the essential community services that the ABC provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is little wonder, perhaps, but there is no doubt that this action is not only irresponsible but inconsiderate of the real needs of people in the rural regions and in urban areas. It is also discriminatory and motivated by a need by this government to silence balanced reporting because it knows, by virtue of the nature of its policies, that that balanced reporting will contribute to its demise.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to say that I oppose Senator Schacht's MPI. I note that, when he began his address, he stated that Senator Alston had given a commitment on election night that the ABC's level of funding would not be reduced. Of course, that was before the full extent of the Beazley black hole was known and, as a result of the government becoming aware of the extent of the huge deficit left by the previous government, the ABC, along with all other government agencies, had to take a small cut of two per cent, and that has been a cut which has been applied across the board. Nevertheless, it has to be said that, even though there has been a two per cent cut in government funding to the ABC, the ABC will continue to receive very substantial funding of just under $540 million in 1996&hyphen;97, and $500 million is projected for 1997&hyphen;98. These are very substantial sums and they do not really, as it happens, materially affect the service provided by the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht also alluded to the possibility of advertising on the ABC. I just want to say that the government is committed to maintaining public funding for the ABC and, in addition, the government will maintain a strong commitment toward the ABC in general, and remains dedicated to the concept of public broadcasting. The government recognises the vital role that the ABC plays in the community and the government intends the ABC to continue to provide high quality programs to the Australian community as well as provide a positive alternative to commercial programming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made by members of the opposition in their speeches this afternoon of the two per cent cuts but, according to Bob Batten, who is the head of ABC Radio, these cuts will very largely occur in administrative areas and will not affect ABC programming in any significant manner. Senator Stott Despoja spoke of the cuts to Radio National programming but, as I understand it, those cuts are very largely in repeat programs and only one small religious program has been eliminated. There is nothing very significant in those cuts at all. I repeat that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's objective is to see efficiency in financial management and, by giving the ABC notice of some reduction in funding, the government has given the ABC the opportunity to review its operations before these cuts come into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The managing director of the ABC, Mr Brian Johns, has acknowledged that there was a need for fundamental restructuring throughout the organisation. In fact, many of the ABC's recent decisions to alter services have been as a result of the organisation's $13.5 million deficit, not the government's $10 million funding cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja again also questioned the need for a review of the ABC. Experience suggests that national broadcasters who do not establish a role for themselves based on their strengths can only expect to wither away in the face of today's new technology and other forms of broadcasting. In setting up this inquiry under Mr Mansfield, the government seeks to have a more focused role for the ABC, and that is the purpose of the review to be conducted by Mr Mansfield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Coonan made the point that 15 years have passed since the last independent review. The Dix report and many major service changes and technology changes have taken place in that 15 years and there is no doubt that a review of the ABC's operation is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield will be focusing his review on the need for independent news and current affairs services which are accurate, comprehensive and impartial. He will be considering how high quality information and entertainment services can be maintained by the ABC. Importantly, from my point of view, coming as I do from the north&hyphen;west of Western Australia, he will be providing an evaluation of the services that are required to meet the needs of rural and remote communities as well as children and other groups who are not currently being serviced adequately by other broadcasting organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, Mr Mansfield's review will focus on the need for maintaining consistency between the cost of future ABC operations and the government's broader fiscal strategy, and there is nothing wrong with that. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5647"> government recognises that the ABC plays a unique role in Australian society as it provides news and information, community affairs information, drama, music and regional services and over the years has played a key role in creating a sense of Australian national identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current ABC services include metropolitan radio, with stations in nine cities, regional radio with 49 studios, Radio National, Classic FM, Triple J, the Parliamentary and News Network, the national television network, concert music and international services, including Radio Australia and Australia Television, which broadcasts to South&hyphen;East Asia. All of these services will be maintained, and that is very important for the Senate to know. It is very easy to believe from what has been said that the ABC is to be decimated, and that is far from the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lundy would be interested to know that, at a recent meeting in Parliament House, the chairman of the ABC, Donald McDonald, gave an assurance that radio services in regional Australia would be maintained, as would regional news services. I cannot overstress that the government recognises the importance of the ABC in regional Australia in general. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time that remains I want to add my support to this MPI. I totally oppose the draconian cuts that have been hitting the Australian Broadcasting Corporation right across the country, including my home state of Tasmania where the squeeze is really on, yet where the ratings are higher for the ABC than anywhere else in the country. It commands one-third of the audience, it has a terrific listenership and it is held in high regard from the listening audience, no matter what the political component of that audience is. Right across the board it gives an avenue for discussion of events which is simply not available on commercial radio or television in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was amazed to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicating that it would be good if another right&hyphen;wing commentator were to be added to give so-called balance to the ABC. I have heard comments from other ministers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which fairly run the goose bumps up one's back if you are concerned about political interference into this great independent national broadcaster of ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I have no particular brief for the ABC. My earliest memory was of my ear glued to the radio in 1952 listening to Marjorie Jackson win two gold medals at Helsinki. Ever since then I have had a fair love affair with the ABC, simply because it brought me news and views that I could not get anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>, despite seven years of effort, never covered the Franklin Dam event. In 1992 the ABC was not there at the launch of the Australian Greens, the newest national political party, in Sydney. It certainly refused Christine Milne, the leader of five members of the Tasmanian parliament, the leader of the Greens, the opportunity to take part in a three&hyphen;way debate on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> between leaders in the run&hyphen;up to the last election. They decided that the two men, maybe in defence of their inferior debating abilities, should not have to face Christine Milne in a three-way debate in the run-up to that election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pose this question to those who think it is a good idea to be cutting the ABC and having inquiries into it: what about an inquiry into commercial broadcasting? What about an inquiry into the advertising which dominates the commercial wavelengths, in many cases to our detriment? The government's contribution is to get rid of the advertising standards authority. The whole thing is warped and the whole thing is worrying if we are looking at community standards and the ability to get news and views without fear or favour in this  country of ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commercial stations are ultimately greatly influenced by a couple of entrepreneurs, who are extraordinarily rich and not representing the average people but with more influence than anybody else in the country to determine what we should hear and the views that we should have coming through the box into our living rooms. The government would be much better off holding an inquiry into the impact of commercial broadcasting and its shortcomings and whether or not it is biased <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5648"> and whether or not piping John Laws into Tasmania is a better thing than the ABC giving us a much more balanced view of the world. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I table for the information of honourable senators, Australia's 1996 APEC Individual Action Plan (IAP) which will be presented, along with the IAPs of all other APEC members, at the APEC Ministerial and Leaders Meetings to be held in the coming days in the Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Osaka Action Agenda agreed by APEC Leaders in 1995, all APEC members are required to prepare IAPs to show the steps they are taking to meet their trade and investment liberalisation commitments agreed at the Bogor APEC Leaders meeting in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is fully committed to the Osaka objectives consistent with the need for Australia to be actively associated, through APEC, with the move by the growing Asia&hyphen;Pacific economies to consolidate the liberalisation of the region and underpin its future prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members' IAPs are to conform to the general principles of the Osaka Action Agenda including comprehensiveness, WTO consistency, comparability, and transparency. Also, members are to address fifteen areas in their IAPs including the core liberalisation areas of tariffs, non&hyphen;tariff measures, services and investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Osaka Action Agenda provides for the IAP process to be ongoing with members submitting revised IAPs on an annual basis assisted by a process of informal consultations and review among members. The 1996 IAPs to be submitted by APEC members later this month will therefore be the first step in a long&hyphen;term progressive process leading to the Bogor objective of free and open trade and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investment in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region by 2010 for industrialised economies and 2020 for developing economies. As such, they represent the start of the difficult process of translating the rhetoric from Bogor and Osaka into real and detailed commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan that I am tabling today is the final version of Australia's 1996 IAP and will be taken through to the final stage of consultation at senior officials' and ministerial&hyphen;level at the APEC meetings in Manila over the coming weekend. honourable senators may recall that I announced in May that Australia had submitted a draft form of the IAP. All other members also submitted drafts in May and the process of consultation and review has been underway throughout the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has had wide ranging consultations with Australian industry, as well as the state and territory governments, on the development of Australia's IAP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian IAP reflects the fact that the Australian economy has been moving down a liberalising path and is well placed to conform with the guidelines for the preparation of IAPs as agreed by Leaders in Osaka. It also reflects the expectation by all economies that the IAPs will, understandably, contain more detail on the near&hyphen;term liberalisation than on the longer&hyphen;term, and that economies will be undertaking their own assessment of comparability as the IAP process evolves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On tariffs, the Australian IAP includes the existing tariff reduction programs to the year 2000 in the textiles, clothing and footwear and passenger motor vehicles sectors but does not pre&hyphen;judge the outcome of the reviews of tariff levels beyond 2000 in those sectors. The IAP also reflects the fact that Australia's general tariff has been phased down to a level of no higher than 5 per cent. It includes a commitment to review 0&hyphen;5 per cent tariffs by 2000 or earlier subject to an assessment of progress in the liberalisation commitments by others in APEC and the WTO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IAP also includes previously&hyphen;announced policy directions on micro&hyphen;economic reform in the services sectors. For example, the introduction of full and open competition from 1 July 1997 in the telecommunications sector, the winding back of maritime coastal protection by 2000, and the progressive liberalisation of access to the Australian aviation market. Under competition policy, the IAP refers to the review of exemptions to the competitive conduct rules that will commence in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other measures addressed in the IAP include investment and important trade facilitation issues such as standards and customs procedures, intellectual property rights, competition policy, deregulation. On business mobility, Australia is working with its APEC partners to develop the APEC <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5649"> Business Travel Card to allow the equivalent of visa&hyphen;free travel for eligible business persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the comparability element of IAPs, Australia will be seeking, through the IAP process, to use the liberalisation of the Australian economy to argue for enhanced market access of interest to Australian exporters in other APEC economies. The government has used all opportunities for ministerial and official&hyphen;level contact with our APEC partners to urge improvements in their IAPs. We have stressed Australian market access priorities as determined in consultation with Australian industry. We have also encouraged the Philippines, as chair of APEC in 1996, to exercise its leadership role in urging members generally to improve their IAPs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for 1996, I expect modest outcomes as this year is only the beginning of the process. But we have set the platform to pursue Australia's interests as IAPs are reviewed and modified in the coming years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a gradual improvement in the quality of IAPs during the year. I expect that the 1996 IAPs will represent a modest improvement in access for Australian exporters and will illustrate the wide range of liberalisation under way in the region. Importantly, the IAPs will signal a commitment by APEC members to continue further opening of their economies. The tabling of IAPs in final form at the time of the forthcoming APEC Ministerial and Leaders meetings will be an opportunity for a more detailed assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results for 1996 are broadly in line with realistic expectations at the beginning of what is a sustained process which will go out to 2010 and beyond. APEC has made a reasonable start and has helped to reinforce an overall trend towards liberalisation in the region, although there are sectors of export interest to Australia which remain to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will report further on the IAPs in the context of reporting on the outcome of the ministerial and Leaders Meetings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to sum up this debate, and I will be brief. I do want to go back to the two baskets of reasons, if you like, of why we should today be voting down this change in zoning. What the government is proposing to do is to rezone part of the four per cent of the reef that is now protected from `protected' to `fishing&hyphen;experimental'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first of the baskets involves process. There is a whole range of issues relating to the processes that the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) did not follow&mdash;what he should have done before he brought these changes before this place. Indeed, in one case there are processes that GBRMPA itself has not followed. The second basket of reasons includes the substantive ones, the environmental reasons of why we simply should not be tampering and should not be opening up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5651"> what little of our Great Barrier Reef is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to look first at the processes. There has not been an environmental impact assessment on this project, despite the fact that this is a Commonwealth action that will definitely have an impact on the environment. We argue that it will have a very significant impact on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the minister did not designate the proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act before he tabled these rezonings in parliament. Again, I stress this was a requirement because it will have an impact on the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the minister did not ask for advice from the Australian Heritage Commission under the Australian Heritage Commission Act, as he was required to do. Clearly this is an area on the register of the national estate and, before he tabled the rezonings, this advice should have been sought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary aim, if we look at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, is to protect the reef; it is not to talk about a variety of uses. We argue very strongly that what we are seeing here is nothing to do with the protection of the reef. Of course, within that act we have the precautionary principle. No matter which way the minister likes to define `precautionary', it has nothing do with fishing out endangered species to see the rate of fishing that this area can sustain and how many fish come back. The precautionary principle is about arguing that, if there is going to be any sort of risk, we say no. It is not precautionary to open up areas that are now protected and kill the marine life in them in the name of experimental science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. This means the area should be conserved, protected and transmitted to future generations. Surely the spirit of this act is not being met by these proposals before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before making decisions on rezoning protected areas and placing those rezonings before parliament, all of the previous measures should have been done. Even if some of these processes can be set in train now, it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> too late. We also need this information before we make this decision here today. If we disallow today, the minister can go away, follow the correct procedures, go through the processes and then bring this back before us in good time when we, too, have that information before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last process I will mention very briefly is one that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority itself is actually looking at. That is, after some previous experiments&mdash;in particular the ANCA damage experiment, which got so much bad publicity and raised so many concerns it was eventually stopped&mdash;the authority has set up within its own ranks what has been described to me by one person as an ethics committee. It is a committee that is going to look at whether or not experiments really should be done. This proposal has apparently not even been passed by that internal committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we have the substantive issues. There has been a wide range of experiments already done on the reef. There has been a variety of fishing experiments done in quite damaging ways. They do no longer, I am assured, dynamite sections of the reef. The last one that I can find documented was in 1991, but they certainly were doing that. The effect of that is that it ruptures the bladders of the fish and kills them. They then float to the surface and can be counted. Then the scientists can monitor what fish return to those areas of the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is rotenone poisoning, which I am assured is still going on in places. In those experiments large clouds of this material are put into the water and they spread. Apparently very quick fish, such as some of the shark species, can get away. The others do not. They drown. They cannot breathe through this material. They float to the surface. They can then be counted. The rate of return of a variety of species can then be measured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been trawling experiments already on the reef&mdash;ones where 39 square kilometre areas were trawled in protected areas of the reef several years ago. They were very similar experiments to those proposed now. I point out to the minister that, even though we are talking now about rezoning for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5652"> line fishing, if he reads through the methodology the scientists are proposing, in time it will open up to further trawling experiments under these very regulations we have before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other experiments which have been looking at behaviour of marine organisms have included smashing coral to see whether fish come and feed on smashed coral, and bleaching live coral to look at the impact of that. There are experiments planned&mdash;and apparently they have started around Mackay&mdash;that involve pouring oil on pristine mangrove areas. There are other experiments involving pouring nutrients and phosphates on corals. Of course, there is the one I have already mentioned&mdash;the anchor damage experiment. Rather than looking at anchor damage that had already occurred on the reef, they were actually going out and proposing that they damage pristine reefs to see what was going to happen from anchor damage in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going through these not to suggest that I oppose all forms of experimentation. We certainly do not. As a former science teacher and one who has had some training in this area, I am not for a moment suggesting that we should move away and stop all scientific experiment&mdash;in fact, I have one daughter who has just completed an honours degree in biotechnology&mdash;but we are talking about protected areas of the reef and what very little part of the reef remains protected. We have 96 per cent of the reef&mdash;not that I suggest for a moment we should be pouring oil on it or dynamiting it&mdash;that we could be using for some of these line fishing experiments and experiments that involve, for example, tagging and releasing fish to look at their movements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress here again, Minister, that despite some of the spin that has been put on this, we are not talking about a one&hyphen;year opening; we are talking about five years of various experiments on protected areas. As I said at the beginning of my speech, there is a need to bring this home to Australians&mdash;particularly those who have campaigned for so many years on forest issues. They were campaigning to protect 10 to 15 per cent of forests. Here we have only four per cent of the reef protected, and we are fighting to hang on to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that. Surely this government should talking about actually improving the percentage of the reef that is now protected and increasing that percentage to a far more realistic area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that once you set the precedent for opening up protected areas, you are getting onto very shaky ground. Where do we stop? Unfortunately, although we have quite a number of scientists who are arguing very clearly that we should not be doing this, they would be putting their careers at risk if they spoke out from within some of these organisations. I think that the whole idea of use is one that is very different from the idea of protection. Hopefully senators will vote today to protect what little remains closed off from fishermen on the Great Barrier Reef. I commend this motion to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debate on these regulations on 6 November, the opposition indicated that its support for the regulations was conditional on the fishing experiment being independently assessed by the Australian Heritage Commission and evaluated under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act; and also Senator Hill assuring the Senate that if the AHC or the EPA advise him that this experiment is to any extent environmentally unsound or inadvisable, he will accept the advice and not proceed. I can indicate to the Senate that today the minister has indicated that Dr McPhail has formally referred the experiment to the AHC and the EPA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5653"> I think it is unfortunate that it was not until concerns about the process were raised in the chamber that the experiment was formally referred to the specialist agencies, as is required under the Australian Heritage Com mission Act and the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. I say once again that I believe that the minister has got the process back to front. These regulations should not have been tabled in the Senate until the AHC and the EPA had provided their advice on the impact of the experiment on the world heritage area, and until that advice had been properly considered. The belated referral means that senators will not have the opportunity to assess the merits of the experiment in light of the AHC and the EPA advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of this advice, the opposition continues to insist on the commitment that I sought from Senator Hill on behalf of the shadow environment minister, Dr Lawrence. I say with the best spirit I am able to muster in this circumstance that Senator Hill does not have a strong record on taking the advice of his specialist agencies on developments which impact on world heritage areas. The minister's recent decision to grant consent approvals for the Port Hinchinbrook resort development is a case in point. That decision indicates Senator Hill's propensity for ignoring the AHC's concerns about the environmental impact of developments on a world heritage area if that advice is not to his liking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A commitment by Senator Hill in this chamber is the outstanding issue, in the view of the opposition, in this matter. Opening up world heritage protected areas, especially considering the minister's poor regard for the proper statutory process, is a serious matter. The opposition therefore could not support these regulations without the minister's assurance to the Senate that if the AHC or the EPA advise him that the experiment is to any extent environmentally unsound or inadvisable, he will accept that advice and not proceed. I say to Senator Hill that I do hope he is willing to give that level of assurance to the Senate. If he does, then that obviously would mean that the opposition would oppose this disallowance motion. But in the absence of that level of assurance, we would be supporting the motion that stands in Senator Lees's name.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (South Australia&mdash;</STATE>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.06 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This is really a development from the last time we debated this matter. As is now clear, I think, the opposition sought from the government a number of things. The request was in two parts. The first part of the request was that it sought that there be a designation under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act for the experiment. It similarly sought that the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission be formally required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the request was a number of specifics: it wanted explicit monitoring mechanisms to be in place; it wanted a commitment from the government to develop a proper management strategy for commercial and recreational fishing; it wanted a guarantee that the reef will be rezoned back to its current status; and it wanted an assurance from me, as Minister for the Environment, that I would report to the parliament at the end of the first year of the experiment to inform the parliament of the preliminary results of fishing on the green reefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each of the four second-tier requirements was met positively in a response that I gave before the last debate. As I read it, Senator Faulkner, in his contribution to that debate, on behalf of Dr Lawrence acknowledged that I had given assurances to each of those. So they have been met in the terms that the opposition has requested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the first two requests&mdash;a formal designation under the EP(IP) Act and a formal reference to the AHC&mdash;the statutory authority, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has carried out both those requests, as has been acknowledged by Senator Faulkner. As requested by Dr Lawrence, the shadow spokesperson, I have sent to her a copy of the letters from Dr McPhail under the EP(IP) Act and under the AHC Act, together with the somewhat voluminous attachments. I will table a set of those documents here now so it can be seen that the full requests of the opposition, as set out in the letter from Dr Lawrence dated 15 November 1996 to me, have been met. I table a copy of the letter from Dr Lawrence as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner, however, in his speech of 6 November added a further requirement to that which Dr Lawrence had put in her letter <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5654"> to me&mdash;that is, I would be required to assure the Senate that, if the AHC or the EPA advise me that this experiment is environmentally unsound or inadvisable, I will accept that advice and not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest that Senator Faulkner has got it wrong in relation to process for the second time. He first got it wrong in his determination as to what was the correct timetable for seeking a designation under the EP(IP) Act and under the AHC Act. As is stated, it is not at the time of seeking this regulation, this new zoning plan, in the Senate that these acts are triggered; it is when the authority, if it decides to, goes to the next step, which is to designate special management provisions in order to allow the experiment to proceed, that these two acts are triggered and the authority should so act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Dr McPhail, the chairman, has said that, because of the requirement of the opposition in this matter, he is not waiting to see whether the zoning plans stand the assessment of this parliament. He nevertheless has taken the second step now before the time in which he was required to do so, which, on our legal advice, would be the proper time for him to do so. That is in accordance with the request of the opposition to try to meet their requirements, notwithstanding the technical deficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second process error is that, despite the fact that it is Dr McPhail, the authority, that has referred the matters&mdash;it is a separate statutory authority, it is designated, it must address the response under the EPIP Act, and it must address the response under the AHC Act&mdash;Senator Faulkner has nevertheless, in the additional requirement that he put down in the Senate, required me to act upon their advice. I am saying that he has got it wrong. It is up to Dr McPhail as a separate statutory authority to consider the advice and, under the terms of each of those pieces of legislation, decide how to act. It is not for me to consider at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if this was a designation involving me, I would have had trouble in accepting what you say, Senator Faulkner. It would be improper for me to bind myself in advance to advice that I have not received when the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> obligation under the act, loosely expressed, is that I am obliged to take into account their advice. I am not obliged. It would be an abdication of my responsibility to the AHC and to EP(IP) to accept the stricture that the opposition is seeking to place upon me. That is something that I am sure Senator Faulkner would never have accepted. If he did, I would have condemned him for abdicating his statutory responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am obliged to do, and what Senator Faulkner was obviously obliged to do when he was minister, is to ensure that the proper statutory process is followed and, clearly, that the advice of these authorities is properly taken into account. In the end it is upon my head that the decision has to be made. I have to withstand the consequences of that. Otherwise the statute would have been differently drawn, and there would not have been a role for the minister to make an assessment and to offer advice to the designated minister, which is the usual process, to make recommendations on the basis of taking into account the advice of EP(IP), the advice of the EPA in that instance, or the advice of the AHC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as a matter of process, firstly it is irrelevant what Senator Faulkner is seeking of me because it is up to Dr McPhail's separate statutory authority to take that advice. Secondly, even if it was my charge, then what he is asking me to do is to go beyond that which is my statutory requirement, which would be quite wrong.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The zoning plans as amended would empower the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, not the minister, to designate the application of a special management provision to a fisheries experimental error.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Now is not the time to revisit the debate as to whether we should take the advice of the scientists or risk the consequences of not taking that advice. That was the debate of the other day. What we have nevertheless sought to do is meet all reasonable requests by the opposition in this matter, which we say we have done as far as we are able.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the assurances that Dr Lawrence was wanting in relation to monitoring, rezoning and ensuring that a management plan has been put in place have been complied with. The requirement that it go for assessment under the EPIP Act and the requirement that it go to the AHC for assessment has been accepted. The only requirement that we cannot meet is the requirement that Senator Faulkner added in the last debate. We cannot meet that because it is irrelevant. It is not my responsibility; it is the responsibility of Dr McPhail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it were my responsibility, I would meet all my statutory responsibilities, and I would properly take into account the advice of the AHC and the advice of any environmental assessment under the EPIP Act. Obviously, I listen to the advice of specialists, because it would be foolish to do otherwise.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wool International Amendment Bill 1996 is very time sensitive and must be passed as soon as possible. The amendments proposed in the bill arose out of the second industry round table in August where genuine consen <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5656"> sus concerning the disposal of the wool stockpile was reached. These changes to the fixed release schedule of the stockpile must be implemented before 31 December 1996.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 30 October 1996 and passed on 7 November 1996. The Wool International Amendment Bill was introduced into the Senate on 7 November 1996. I believe that the opposition supports the bill. The Democrats support the bill. I ask that it be brought on forthwith tomorrow. If it is not, the wool growers of Australia will be deprived of the opportunity to redress an issue of critical importance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the Senate unduly. When this motion was called on today I denied formality. A couple of weeks ago in the leaders meeting we asked whether there were any more non-controversial bills coming through. At that stage the answer was no. If this were urgent for some time and if it were very important, one would have thought that at that stage someone would have said, `You need to know that the Wool International bills are coming through.' I did not hear that. It seems quite interesting that we are now hearing that it is urgent and has been urgent for some time. When I asked what the reasons for urgency were the answer was that there was a 1 January start-up date. Who chose the start-up date?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to do the best that I can here. We try to look at every bill that we see. We try to deal with it properly, but to expect it to be dealt with this Thursday is not reasonable. As I can see the numbers, the bill will be considered as an urgent bill to be dealt with by the Senate. I believe it is not unreasonable to give some time to look at the bill before it is voted on. I would like to indicate that I can see the numbers are here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say, `Don't worry about the industry,' but two weeks ago it was not on the urgent bill list. It was not mentioned at the leaders meeting. If two weeks ago it was not urgent, why is it urgent now and why was somebody in the industry not advised that a start-up date of 1 January was not a reasonable thing to consider at this time of the year in view of the urgent bills that were on the list, and this one was not one of them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it was not on the government's urgent list two weeks ago, why is it urgent now? That is the point I am making. Do you think that just telling the industry and putting it on 1 January will get it through? That is what I am pointing out. Why wasn't it urgent a couple of weeks ago and why is it suddenly urgent now? Do not tell me what it is I think or do not think about the industry; tell me why the bill was not considered urgent even by the government two weeks ago.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts has become so Canberra&hyphen;ised, so institutionalised and so wrapped up in her procedure here that she has absolutely no idea or concern for the wool industry. The importance of this is that it is a matter of urgency. If only she could just get out of her procedure mode and understand this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announced this some time ago. The Wool International Amendment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5657"> Bill has been through the House of Representatives. You should have been keeping an eye not only on the industry but also on the procedures as the bill left the House of Representatives. This is not new at all. This is a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You give gratuitous advice to the industry that 1 January is inconvenient to you. It just so happens that 1 January is all but close to being too late for the industry. What it desires is government reaction, and quickly. We are delivering that as quickly as we possibly can following a round table discussion of the industry, which is in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the industry has been in crisis for the last six years. The woolgrowers have not made a profit for the last six years&mdash;around about the time you dropped the floor price scheme, Senator Sherry; around about the time John Kerin left that industry in a complete mess. The industry has never recovered. But here it has a chance. Here there is a chance to bring benefit and relief to the woolgrowers.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have as much knowledge of the wool industry as you have. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have some very close family very much involved in the industry and I am very concerned, through them, for the plight of the industry as a whole. As Senator McGauran has said, the industry has been through an extraordinarily tough time, not just in the last few months or the last few years but for the last decade or more, and it has defied some of the best brains in the country as to how to get out of that slump that has occurred. There is the potential for things to get better in the next few years; certainly there have been signs of that over the last couple of years. But the point that Senator Margetts was making was not to do with the need for action on the wool industry; it was to do with the failure of due process by the government. That was what it was about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts was saying, two weeks ago, as far as the government in the Senate was concerned, the Wool International Amendment Bill did not rate. I was there when Senator Margetts asked, `Are there other urgent pieces of legislation to get special treatment and expedition through the Senate?' She was met with a nil response. I do not know whether that was the fault of the government representatives at that meeting or whether the government at that time just was not thinking; but if we are going to see important pieces of legislation like this, and important it is, getting through expeditiously, and that is what it needs, to assist the wool industry, and it needs assistance, then it needs the government to get its act into gear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are dealing with a diverse Senate, which has 60 pieces of legislation before it between now and Christmas. When you bring forward a piece of legislation that is going to get precedence over some other very important matters, then you need to have a good case for it, it needs to be simply explained and you need to flag urgency in good time. You have failed to do that. You failed to do it even when Senator Margetts asked whether this bill by implication was urgent because it was already in the House of Representatives. It has been there for only three weeks, do not forget. It has been before the Senate for only one week. It seems to me that the government has lost the ability to properly advocate its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5658"> own priorities. That is what Senator Margetts is putting to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt this is an important piece of legislation. No doubt it could have been dealt with today. But if the government wants that to happen then it has to recognise early in the piece the importance a bill like this has and not come in and say, `We've suddenly found this is urgent. We suddenly want this to get through, even if you haven't had time to adequately assess the bill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, I will make a special effort to put other pieces of legislation to the side, because of the bumbling of the government in this place, to ensure that the bill gets the proper assessment and the go&hyphen;ahead that I feel inherently it is going to get. But Senator Margetts is correct: it is not right to confuse the substance of this bill with the lack of substance in the way in which the government has put this bill before the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any criticism of the management of government business I am quite prepared to wear solely as the manager of government business, particularly where that criticism is legitimate. As I am informed, and I am quite happy to be corrected later, however, the offices of both Senator Dee Margetts and Senator Bob Brown were informed of the introduction of the wool international bill in a letter dated 29 October from the parliamentary liaison officer, who, in these matters, is responsible to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not dispute, Senator Brown or Senator Margetts, that at the, I presume, leaders meeting you were referring to this may not have been raised.

It may have taken a day or two to get to your office. I do not even dispute that, but it was more than 18 days ago, more than two weeks ago. Again, if it took a few days to get there, I do not dispute it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just saying that that was the date of the letter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This section deals with boycotts, both primary and secondary, and changes the law in relation to them. The law as it now exists is one that properly balances the various interests in this&mdash;the interests of people who want to trade and manufacture and the interests of workers who may want to take certain procedures to obtain conditions and wages to which they are entitled.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like an answer to this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First let me respond to the Australian Democrats' defence over the ships of shame issue. I understand that the maritime unions are themselves trying to take some action to draw public attention to this even as we debate it in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, Senator Murray, representing Senator Kernot&mdash;who has been missing from the Senate throughout this debate&mdash;said that the maritime workers union and I have the right to bring any criminal conditions on board ships to the notice of the relevant authorities. That is glib, because the Democrats know that I have no ability to go aboard a ship and see what is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After this legislation goes through, the Maritime Workers Union will presumably be able to go aboard a ship at the request of the captain but not the crew. It will not be able to check out the conditions on the ship with any great effect, simply because it will be unable to take action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reiterate the situation regarding the ships of shame. We know from official investigations that ships coming into Australian ports under flags of convenience have been carrying seafarers who have not been paid for months or, in some cases, years. They cannot leave the ships because they would then lose all that back pay. They also cannot bear to stay there because they are being treated, in effect, as slave labour. They are ships on which people have been badly physically abused and on which people live in fear of the captains or the ship owners. They have intolerable conditions that are in breach of international agreements as well as a whole bevy of Australian laws to do with people being treated decently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the assistance of these people have come the maritime unions. Senator Murray flicks that off and says that the Australian Maritime <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Safety Authority will be able to look after their interests. In talking with the maritime unions, it is quite clear that that is not what happens. They may check the system and the condition of the hull of the ship, but they are not in the business of, and do not have the wherewithal to be in, communion with the seafarers on the ship, who very often fear for their lives because of the owners of the ships and who need a special person to person approach by people who understand their conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The maritime unions have been effective time and again in recovering the condition of seafarers on these ships of shame. As of the passage of this legislation, that effectiveness will be totally pulled away from them. They will be left without the ability to say to the shipowner or captain, `You cannot move until you fix up what is going wrong on this ship.' That is gone, and that is with the Democrat amendment and the government legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, for Senator Kernot and her colleagues, said, in excuse of the inexcusable support they are giving the government on this, that the ships are owned overseas. He said that that is a problem for Australia and that even international conventions may bar the policing of on-ship conditions by Australian authorities. I say to Senator Murray, Senator Kernot and other Democrats senators that that is an argument for keeping the power that the unions have to take action on behalf of the seafarers on these ships of shame. You have just highlighted the need for retaining their ability to take boycott action on these ships until things are put right aboard them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrat excuse was that the laws have been there in the past to enable the protection of people aboard these ships or that, conversely, a blind eye has been turned to boycott action by maritime unions where there has been a justifiable cause. There is a difference now, though. Previously, ship owners and captains had a very difficult job seeing how they could take action against the maritime unions who were coming to the defence of those workers. They will have no difficulty after this legislation is passed by the government and Democrats. There is a $0.75 million fine for breaching this law, which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5660"> says that they can no longer take secondary boycott action. That is enough to put a union out of action. It is enough to destroy a union. That is what they are after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to listen to Senator Murray and the Democrats talking about the need to bring the unions on the waterfront to heel to know that they have really dismissed the awesome problem of the ships of shame that, until now, have found Australia one haven of decency around the world. It will not be after this legislation gets through. I say this to Senator Murray: if all is going to be okay on these ships and if you take Senator Campbell's assurance that the government will look after these seafarers, why oppose the contention that the unions should be able to retain the power to be there as a check? They will not need to use it if the glib assurances you are giving us are taken at face value. Of course, they are not only glib but also hollow. That is the situation. The Democrats, in league with the government, are leaving the ships of shame as far as Australia is concerned. It is a matter of shame for the parties involved that this legislation will tie the unions' hands in that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it goes much further than that. The secondary boycott legislation, which effectively clips a $0.75 million fine on organisations involved in secondary boycotts, will hit community groups who never before have had the threat of such a penalty hanging over their head. I ask Senator Kernot or Senator Murray to tell us what will happen to a peace group that blockades a company that is manufacturing and selling guns because that peace group wants to push for law reform. I will tell them what will happen under their laws. They will face destruction as a group because of the awesome penalty that the gun making company will be able to threaten them with in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the Democrats whether they will get up and categorically say that an Aboriginal group that blocks the access of mining machinery to an area on which it has a land rights claim, on the basis that the company has not negotiated properly, has any protection under the environment and consumer protection caveats that they say are in this legislation. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> On the face of it, they have none. What about a church group which helps a union to block the unloading of a ship on which conditions are so appalling that some of the crew have jumped overboard and drowned? In other words, the church group blockades the ship in lieu of the union being able to do so. They would be gone under this legislation. What about a human rights group that blockades tourist companies selling tours to Tibet on the basis that they are opposed to the imprisonment of activists in Tibet or even to the forced sterilisation and abortion policies of the Chinese authorities in Tibet?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does that come under consumer or environmental protection as an excuse for not taking action? If we take a straight reading of this legislation, that group will be gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole host of situations where members of Australian organisations&mdash;environmental, social justice, human rights, peace and Aboriginal organisations&mdash;who peacefully protest for a more decent future, as they see it, and who do so by getting in the way of a commercial transaction which they think is wrong, and run foul of the secondary boycott provision in here, the secondary boycott provision which was supported by the Democrats and, in fact, only made possible by the Democrats. They face injunctive action, which a barrister of Sydney, Tim Robertson, describes as `chilling', by the corporations who simply want to flick them off. All the corporation does is put a SLAPP suit on, the American contrivance which is going to become much more common in this country after this legislation of the Democrats and coalition gets through. It means a company which is distressed about an effective community boycott on some nefarious activity in which it is involved is going to be able to slap an injunction on that group with the threat of a three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollar fine hanging over their heads. They will have to desist immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are talking about the Wilderness Society, Community Aid Abroad, Aboriginal land rights councils, peace groups, health groups&mdash;it does not matter who they are&mdash;the people responsible in those groups are going to have to withdraw because they simply <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5661"> cannot allow the annihilation of their organisation under a three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollar fine. That is what will be different after this legislation goes through compared with now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, Senator Kernot&mdash;were she ever in here, and she's not&mdash;and other Democrats senators might get up and say that the law is little different from before. I submit that it is three&hyphen;quarters of a million dollars different. That is what is different. The Democrats say, `But we have a disclaimer in here. If you're involved in environmental or consumer protection you will be okay.' The drive of this particular legislation is to protect commercial interests and operations. Contrary to what Senator Murray said earlier, a court is not going to take an expansive view of what is meant by environmental protection or consumer protection; it is going to take a narrow view. In looking at the aims of this legislation, the court is going to see that it is aimed to protect commercial interests and trade in this country. The court is going to err against the side of the community groups and in favour of the narrow view, which is going to favour, of course, the corporate entity involved in the untoward activity against which that community group is protesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a black day for community interests in Australia. It is a black 24 hours because, on top of this, last night we saw the Democrats vote to protect the government provision that anybody within the union set&hyphen;up who takes so much as work&hyphen;to&hyphen;orders action will instantly be penalised by their pay being stopped. It is not a matter of whether or not the employer wants to stop their pay; under the law passed by the Democrats last night, they must&mdash;these are the words in the provision&mdash;have their pay stopped.

Mr Chairman, this concerns the issue or action which Senator Brown says is a protest action, such as that aimed at a company, a government or a GBE, such as Forestry Tasmania. Let us say that it is a conservation group blocking bulldozers in the forest. Senator Brown says that it is illegal unless a group can prove the action's dominant purpose is substantially concerned with protection of the environment or consumers. He says that there are fines of up to $750,000&mdash;we keep hearing that said&mdash;and that the action is subject to injunction and potentially also exposed to state laws banning secondary boycotts and he says that environment and consumer defences would not apply under the state laws.</PARA></TALK.START>

We all know it is. Section 7 of the Crimes at Sea Act 1979 does not confer on Australian authorities the ability to commence <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5663"> court proceedings against an individual without the authority of the relevant flag state. That will not change. That has always been the law. Professor Don Rothwell, of Sydney University, summarised the position on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background Briefing</EMPHASIS>  on 6 October 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the vessel is passing through Australian territorial waters, there is no control that Australia can exercise in terms of enforcing Australian jurisdiction and that comes down to the concept of flag state control over which the flag state has got control over criminal matters that occur on the vessel, even though it is within Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Minister for Transport has indicated that he will be making representations on this matter to the International Maritime Organisation in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MUA and the TGF rightly outline the enormous difficulties there have been internationally in trying to get seafarers' conditions improved but nothing in the Navigation Act 1912 appears to bear directly on the matters discussed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is one thing to be impugning each other in here but when you have this business of impugning the legal advisers who are backing up argument in this place, you wonder about someone's strength of conviction or the strength of ability to hold the argument. I am simply saying that what the Greens are putting in this extremely serious debate is backed up with very considered legal advice&mdash;and from a number of legal advisers at that. From where we sit, having considered all the letters from Senator Murray and the Democrats and all the input from the government, the fact is that there is a radical change in the air as far as the ability of people in this country to protest peacefully for what they believe is right. As I said before, and Senator Murray did not aver to this, one thing that is writ very clearly in this legislation is the penalty&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $750,000 for any organisation, any body corporate, that falls foul of this law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more, what is going to hang over the head of any organisation which gets involved in secondary boycott action is a SLAPP&mdash;a strategic lawsuit against public participation&mdash;writ. Firstly, let me take on Senator Murray, who has just been talking with Senator Campbell, over the issue of conservationists getting in the way of a logging operation in the forest not being a secondary boycott. A secondary boycott is where people get together to prevent the commercial activity of a third or fourth party. In that situation, people are getting together to block the activity of a logging operator, the third party in the forest, to stop the commercial activity of a fourth party, the woodchipper, who is exporting those forests to the Northern Hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservation group is involved in a secondary boycott&mdash;Senator Murray does not know what he is talking about. He has fallen into bed with the coalition over this most fundamental part of the legislation. As Senator Murphy quite rightly interjected, Senator Murray did not go on to say that, despite all that, unions&mdash;the people gathered together because of their mutual interest in the workplace&mdash;are prohibited altogether from being involved. No matter what the case, no matter how hard they have to fight their consciences on the issues, they cannot be involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, if two unionists get involved with a secondary boycott, the union itself is gone&mdash;that is in black and white in here&mdash;unless they can prove that they did not know about, and were not involved in, the activities of their members. Let me go back a few months to the Tarkine road protests in Tasmania last year in which over 100 people were arrested because they were trying to protect a particularly beautiful part of Tasmania&mdash;the Tarkine wilderness in north&hyphen;west Tasmania. In one of those protests a dozen or 20 unionists went up&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MURPHY" NAMEID="FX5">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but it is a very clear example. They stood in the way of the bulldozers and got arrested. There is no way <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5664"> you can tell me that their unions did not know that they were going there. This legislation makes it clear that, under those circumstances, the unions from which those unionists came&mdash;those good citizens who were going out there to protect a wilderness area because they believed in it&mdash;would be the subject of legal action by the corporations whose interests were being compromised by that action. That is how insidious this legislation is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For an injunction to be served, people do not have to be boycotting. They do not have to be sitting in the way of a ship of shame trying to leave port or a uranium ship trying to leave Darwin. They simply have to be indirectly knowingly involved. They could be deciding to send along some organic produce to help out in the boycott activity. They could be running errands for the people who are involved in the boycott activity. They could be taking home the washing. Those people are involved as far as this law is concerned. It is a very wide net that is being thrown by this legislation with a very narrow escape clause for some environmental and consumer protection causes. That is except for unionists; they have no get out at all, no let out whatever. There is no doubt that this legislation is meant to destroy those unions who take any action which is inimical to the interests of corporate activity regardless of the ethics of that activity. That is what this legislation, supported by the Democrats, is effectively about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that it is a black day for community groups trying to make this country a better place to live in, trying to protect this country and make it a better place for future generations, trying to protect the overall human rights and civil conditions of this country. This hits straight at protest action which, since time began, has been an inherently central part of the activities of those people who improve the way a society works. This hits right at that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is extraordinary about it is that the Democrats, with their long tradition of support for community interest groups involved in many of the activities that I have been talking about, are absolutely crucial to the government getting through legislation which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is going to hit those communities for a sixer. I cannot believe the Democrats are doing this. I cannot believe that they are not, with other entities in this place, moving to block this provision, if they cannot bring themselves to block this legislation. For all the talk we have heard about how they are improving the legislation, the fact is that if they do not vote against it, if they do not support the Green and the Labor amendments which are coming down the line, they will be centrally responsible for the secondary boycott provisions going through this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two most common forms of protest engaged in by human rights, consumer and environmental groups are consumer boycotts and picketing. Consumer boycotts are expressly excluded from the operation of the Trade Practices Act by section 51 (2A). And pickets have been upheld again and again by the Courts as a valid and legal form of protest. The Federal Court in the 1993 J-Corp case held that peaceful picketing was not a secondary boycott. This is because the purpose of the picket was not to hinder and prevent trade, but to provide information. The English Courts have adopted a similar view, with the 1993 Court of Appeal decision in Middlebrook Mushrooms v TGWU finding that unions targeting consumers of a supermarket in protest against the industrial policies of the supermarket uphold that the principal of freedom of speech was very important, and that this was not action targeted at the management.</PARA>

The likelihood of any Australian Court ignoring the High Court and the growing line of English cases finding civil rights more important than commercial rights is simply remote in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Brown of the Tasmanian Greens is simply incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second part of Senator Brown's motion seeks to broaden the exclusion to cover industrial action. In doing so, he is seeking to ask a Coalition Government to provide added protection to union industrial action that the previous Labor Government was not prepared to provide. This is political naivete in the extreme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty with this approach is that it will encourage unions to dress up inappropriate disputes about other issues as environmental or consumer or human rights issues. The unions could claim that the right to strike itself is a human right (although this is not 100 per cent clear in international law), giving a total protection to industrial action. As such, Senator Brown's amendment is poorly drafted and would allow unions to engage in a wide range of totally inappropriate actions against which the public should be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will not render illegal any secondary boycott conduct by unions which is currently legal. The Democrats do not agree that the extreme legal restrictions on the right to take industrial action in this country are appropriate. But, we deal with the fact that neither the Labor Government nor the Coalition Government have been prepared to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5667"> change that situation. Our objective in redrafting these provisions was to ensure that primary boycotts, are, by and large, dealt with in the AIRC, and that there are protection and defences for certain categories of secondary boycotts. Those objectives have been achieved, and we believe that Senator Brown's amendment is simply unnecessary in all the circumstances.</PARA>

If the Democrats do not support this Greens amendment, quite clearly they would be saying, `We have turned our backs on human rights, peace and Aboriginal land rights as far as this legislation, with its $750,000 penalty, is concerned.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate this challenge to the Democrats, because I know it will fall on deaf ears with the coalition. This amendment provides for at least some protection from the draconian $750,000 penalty for protest under this Democrat-coalition measure. It extends protection from environmental and consumer protection to include human rights, peace and Aboriginal land rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Woodley throws off with an interjection about tobacco growing. The challenge to the Democrats is to oppose the provision altogether, but they are not doing that. They are supporting the government and its penalties against social justice, the environment, peace and Aboriginal people fostering their interests in this country. It is no laughing matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I directly ask the Democrats: do you defend your constituency or don't you? Because you are about to dump people concerned about peace. You are about to dump Aboriginal land rights protesters into the hands of corporate QCs and litigants. You are about to dump the whole gamut of people who otherwise might find some protection from this draconian law and who are protesting for human rights, a central part of the national ethic of a fair go. Is that what the Democrats stand for in this post&hyphen;election period? Senator Murray says,`We are going to trust the government to look after the interests of these groups,' hard on the heels of Senator Kernot saying, `The government has broken promise after promise that it made in the election campaign.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot, who interjects from outside the chamber, has at least made a two-word contribution to this debate. She has been missing from the whole of the debate, and I do not blame her. The position that she and the Democrats have taken on this matter is totally indefensible and reprehensible. They are selling out the very community interest groups that they have stood for until now. How could they do it? Here is an 11th hour last&hyphen;minute chance for the Democrats to redeem some credibility with the community regarding their concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment speaks for itself. It simply says, `Let us at least add community human values, peace and Aboriginal land rights to the potential escape clause from this draconian legislation.' After this debate, the Greens amendment will seek to remove the blanket prohibition on unions taking part in industrial action, for the same reasons. There is a total ban under this legislation on any union of conscience that works for human rights, peace and Aboriginal land rights. There is a total prohibition. No wonder the maritime unions have decided to go on strike against the perfidy of the situation in this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only the Democrats but also the coalition should be hanging their head in shame at the way in which they are truncating, trammelling and treading into the dust the right to free peaceful protest for the improvement of our society, for the improvement of this nation's heritage and for those people working for the assurance of a better nation in which to live in a better world in the next generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it that the Senate should support these Australian Greens amendments in defence of so many human interest groups and environmental groups in our community who otherwise stand threatened by the combined weight of the Democrats, the National Party and the Liberals taking away time honoured rights and protection to act in the interest of this nation as they see it.</PARA></SPEECH>

Oh, yes, we have turned into beasts!

<PARA>I want to make a few brief comments. These are the opposition amendments which cap damages. There is an extraordinary increase in the damages that can be found against unions and our amendment goes to what we think is a much more reasonable approach to maximum damages that can be awarded based on the size of a union, which is a more appropriate measure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOSITION AMENDMENTS:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"SHIPS OF SHAME"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am again astounded by the hypocrisy of the Opposition in moving this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me start by re-stating the current law. Under section 162 of the Industrial Relations Act introduced by the ALP in 1993, a secondary boycott by the Maritime Union in defence of seafarers on a ship in an Australian port is illegal. Following the conciliation period, the MUA and its members are subject to injunctions and damages. That is Labor's law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, the ALP is asking this Senate and a Coalition Government to provide protection for industrial action which they were not prepared to provide in 13 years of Government. What hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let's not hear any heart rending speeches from Labor about standards of international shipping. If Labor was so concerned about it, why didn't it ratify ILO Convention 147 which sets minimum conditions for international sea farers? The 1976 convention was under consideration by the previous Government for 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why was the performance of the previous Government the subject of critical reports on ships of shame issues by the Government's own members on the House of Representatives Transport Committee, headed by former Transport Minister Laurie Brereton?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your record follows you like a bad odour Senator Sherry, so don't lecture me about workers rights. There is nothing more despicable, nothing more hypocritical and nothing more damaging to public faith in the body politic than the ALP's shameless mouthing of pro-worker platitudes which were and which are the exact opposite of their policy pronouncements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the hypocrisy of the ALP and the misinformed comments of Senator Brown of the Tasmanian Greens, can be contrasted with the genuine concern of other politicians, and I wish to note the long advocacy by Senator Margetts of better shipping practices here. I share Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5677"> Margetts concern for shipping practices in Australian waters. But, I do not believe that this is the appropriate bill to deal with these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also wish to note for the record the enormous effort that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has made in the past five years to improve its port control inspections of foreign flagged ships coming into Australian ports. 60 per cent of ships are not inspected, some 2700 inspections last year, with 250 ships detained until health and safety standards are met. AMSA has recently increased funding for these activities, and the Democrats welcome that. But, there are gaps in AMSA's coverage. While I am satisfied that port inspections are adequate to deal with the physical environment on ships, AMSA's mandate on conditions of employment and human rights are much less clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past two weeks, I have been discussing the issues associated with ships of shame with the office of Transport Minister John Sharp. The Coalition's pre-election policy commits it to the highest standards of safety for ships entering Australian waters. We intend holding them to that. Minister Sharp has confirmed that the Government's response to the House "Ships of Shame" Committee report will be tabled in this session. We have been further assured that the response will be positive and comprehensive, and recognise and believe the genuine commitment of this Government to action on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats recognise this is a new Government, and that the Government has made strong statements that it will not cop sub&hyphen;standard shipping in our ports. We are prepared to give the Government this one opportunity to get its policy settings right. Before the Government can present to this parliament any proposals to open up Australian shipping to more access by foreign flagged ships, or to introduce a second register allowing for foreign nationals on Australian flagged ships, it must ensure that there is a genuine level playing field. It must ensure that Australian seafarers will not be forced to compete against sub-standard sweat shop conditions. I flag now that the Democrats will look for the Government to fulfil its obligations and undertakings in shipping reform legislation brought by the Government in its response on the "ships of shame" report and the ratification of ILO 147 is not adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coming back to the ALP's hypocrisy of seeking to provide legal protection for action that is illegal under their laws, we will oppose this amendment at this stage. As I said earlier, there are protections built into the legislation for carefully targeted actions by the MUA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to draw particular attention to the object of the Trade Practices Act in section 2 which states that the object is to enhance the welfare of Australia through the promotion of competition and fair <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trading. In relation to shipping, it is clearly not fair trading, fair competition, if a foreign participant is seeking to undercut internationally recognised conditions and standards. That is not fair trading. A Court in deciding whether to grant relief would obviously have to have regard to whether the granting of relief furthered this object and I would believe that the MUA could argue successfully that an injunction should not be granted if it would encourage unfair trading in respect of shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New section 87AA requires the Court to have regard to whether the applicant has or could have commenced conciliation proceedings in the Commission first. Section 51(2) also requires a Court to disregard any act done in relation to a contract or understanding on remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions. The combined effects of these two sections make it fairly clear that industrial issues should be dealt with primarily by the AIRC if they are genuine industrial issues. Obviously, the Court should have regard to the importance of allowing the AIRC to fulfil its statutory obligations, in particular object 3(k) which refers to assisting in giving effect to Australia's international obligations in relation to labour standards. Given shipping issues are subject to the regulation by both the ILO and the International Maritime Organisation, the importance of allowing the AIRC to do its job is doubly important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is further open to the MUA to seek authorisation under section 88 of the Trade Practices Act for carefully targeted action acting as the agent for the International Transport Federation, to defend the industrial interests of members of that Federation. Given the importance of the issues I have outlined, I believe that the ACCC would be very sympathetic to such an application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the ACCC declined an application, if the Courts were reluctant to give the Trade Practices and Industrial Relations Acts the natural meanings I have outlined and if the Government fall short on its "ships of shame" policy response, then the Democrats may revisit this issue. We do not regard it as a closed book. But, we believe that at this point of the political and legal cycle, the amendment being moved by the ALP is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 18</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOS 340, GREEN 80</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will oppose this amendment to delete the schedule. In doing so, I wish to expand a little on our general reasons for doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pre-1993 Trade Practices Act provision in section 45D were extremely harsh provisions They picked up not just secondary boycotts, but a wide range of primary boycotts as well due to the sloppy drafting of the provisions. Professor Breen Creighton of Latrobe University conducted an analysis of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5678"> the 200 applications made between 1977 and 1993, and found that about two thirds of them were in relation to primary boycotts, capable of being contrived into the provision. Section 45D became a symbol of employer power over unions. The reality was a little different. There was never a pecuniary fine ever taken under the provisions. There were never damages ever collected under the provisions. There were only 6 ex parte injunctions ever granted. The total number of injunctions granted was about 50 of those 200 cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions were threatened only once against an environment organisation. It had never been used against a consumer boycott of any sort, and had not been successful against other protest action such as picketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new 45D will be much narrower in scope than the old. In other words it is far less draconian. It will not apply to primary boycotts, with the narrow exception of movement of goods in and out of Australia. So, that means we are talking about only a third of the cases actioned under the old Labor act's provision. It will not apply to environmental or consumer boycotts. It will require the court to have regard to whether the applicant has or could have conciliated the dispute in the Commission. The explanatory memorandum will encourage a broader interpretation of the exclusions on employment related matters. And, on top of that the new Trade Practices Act has an objects clause referring to the importance of promoting competition and fair trading and consumer protection. So, it is a very different legal environment in which it would operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats went to the last election opposed to the re-instatement of the old 45D and 45E. And, we have kept to this promise. The provisions we will vote for today are much, much narrower in scope. They target expressly the cases of boycott activity which Labor, the Coalition and the Democrats have consistently regarded as undesirable&mdash;that is, boycotts where an innocent third party is involved in a dispute between two other parties. The law in this country, and the law in many other countries have always precluded such boycotts as an undesirable and unsanctioned form of industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, Labor's laws which they are seeking to re-instate still make such boycotts illegal. It is difficult to conceive of any secondary boycotts, particularly boycotts involving industrial action, which were legal under Labor, but made illegal under this bill. The scope of the provisions is very similar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference is only in relation to the compulsory conciliation period. The 1993 amendment to the I.R. Act, supported by the Democrats, included a compulsory conciliation period of up to 72 hours before an employer could seek an injunction. In many cases, this worked very well. But, in too many cases, the length of the period was a nega <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tive. Employers who had no economic resistance to delays, in building, in perishable goods in particular, in just&hyphen;in&hyphen;time and peak period manufacturing situations capitulated to union demands as they were unable to sustain the damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions we are supporting retain the linkage of both commercial and industrial issues. New section 87AA will require the Court to have regard to whether the applicant has or could have commenced proceedings in the Commission, particular conciliation. Obviously, if the Court believes that there is scope for settlement of the matters underlying the dispute, then it has an absolute discretion to refuse relief.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, by placing this in the Court's hand, the Court can balance these considerations against the likelihood of real and unsustainable economic loss, something which the Commission has not taken sufficient account of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, in supporting these amendments, we are responding to the developments in industrial practice since the 1993 amendments. For Labor to say that the 1993 amendments were working perfectly would be to ignore reality. For the Coalition to say that the pre-1993 45D and E were working perfectly and fairly would also be to ignore reality. The amended provisions we support learn from both experiences, and incorporate the best of both sets of provisions. It demonstrates the continuing responsibility of the Democrats in seeking to ensure that industrial and commercial laws are contemporary, fair, balanced and workable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 18:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OPPOSITION AMDTS 341-345</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are opposed to these amendments. Amendment 341 is basically unnecessary because of the harmonisation of State and Federal trade practices law occurring as a result of the competition policy reform agreements, as reflected by the National Competition Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment 342 is a classic ALP try-on. From the safety of the moral high ground of Opposition the ALP is attempting to do something it refused to do in 13 years of Government, cap damages under secondary boycott provisions. If the ALP deemed these provisions were unnecessary in 1993&mdash;even though they were then in the UK legislation&mdash;then why are they needed now? In 1993, there had never been damages collected under boycott provisions in 16 years of litigation. The only difference is that in 1996, there now have never been damages collected in 19 years of litigation. As I said in speaking to the last ALP amendment, we believe there are a wide range of protections built into these provisions as they stand. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5679"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment 343 seeks to restrict access to ex parte and interim injunctions. I think in practice the provision is flawed. A rogue union official could easily avoid an injunction by simply avoiding being served with the notice. Paragraph (b) restates the equitable principles already governing the granting of injunctions. These requirements are basically those already applied by the Courts, which require very strong evidence that immediate and irreparable damage will be done before breaching the basic tenet of equity that both parties deserve a hearing. These basic principles have been outlined in High Court Cases such as the 1912 case of Thomas Edison v Bullock and the 1977 case of Heatley v Tasmanian Racing and Gaming Commission.</PARA></SPEECH>

It has been quite clear through this debate that any semblance of encouragement of collective bargaining has been removed from industrial relations as a result of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. I noticed on a television show the other day that somebody indicated that in countries like Indonesia there is nothing in legislation that says that trade unions cannot exist and there is nothing in legislation that says that people can be exploited. But the reality is that, where it is very difficult for trade unions to exist and operate, workers' conditions become extremely difficult to maintain and I think that is very sad.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, there comes a time when programs should be reviewed. The creation of the super unions, the expansion of industrial relations courses at universities, the growing appointment of tertiary educated union officials all add up to a lesser need for TUTA. Over the past five years, the former Labor Government, with the concurrence of the ACTU, was gradually winding back TUTA's activities, with training becoming more and more an integral part of the work of the super unions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of comments based on what Senator Sherry said. He said that the Democrats have caused the need for this amendment. I wanted to refute that. I wanted to say that the important thing about this section is having access to arbitration. We have made sure that 170MW provides this whole new ground and whole new area of protection which was not there, so that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5683"> Victorian workers&mdash;you say we are causing them to flee and we are locking them out of a hearing&mdash;can now have access to an award if arbitration fails because they clearly fit the conditions of the provision 170MW(6A).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the heart of this concern is that Victorian public servants are in the process of seeking an interim award. Under our amendments, the interim award&hyphen;making power in 111(1D) is maintained. The provision under which the award is being sought is retained. I just want to remind Senator Sherry that, if the ALP had had its way a la Working Nation, award simplification would have been to just eight conditions, not the 20 that we have at the end of this process, plus the 170MX protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the interim award hearing begins on 25 November and covers five days. By making sure proclamation does not happen before the dates of 25 and 29 November, we are not making the process difficult for Victorian public servants. This particular amendment will allow the interim award to be made. If it is appealed&mdash;and that is a possibility; that is not in our hands&mdash;it will still be appealed under the old law. That is the point. We are not locking off access to those protections by the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one month's and one schedule's difference between what Senator Sherry and the Labor Party propose. They propose 1 February for two schedules; we are proposing 1 January for schedule 5.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand your concerns, but we think that we are honouring our commitment, which is that public servants have the right in the interim award&hyphen;making process to have access to paid rates as the starting point for the next round of negotiations. That is the point. That is not taken away from them. I understand why you want 1 February, but the two important things are that the interim award is still able to be made and if it is appealed, it is under the protections of the old law. That is what we were seeking to achieve.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that I could now make comment on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, but that is not something I intend to do this evening. Perhaps I will save that for another adjournment debate. Despite the farce in relation to the outworker provisions that have been incorporated in that bill, tonight I have some comments to make on a more pleasant note.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia has announced that it is a step closer in its campaign to stamp out the exploitation of home workers in the clothing industry through the development of a home workers code of practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All Australians should be concerned about the exploitation of home workers. Home workers are mainly women workers who are often assisted by family members, children, in an attempt to make a reasonable income. The plight of home workers will only be addressed by coordinated effort, including by the industry and consumers. The union has acknowledged that. It needs to be understood and consumers should be aware that the garments that they purchase may be made by exploited home workers who often work for more than 12 hours every day and receive as little as $2 per hour for their work. Consumers should <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5686"> ask their retailer for assurance that their garment is not being made in someone's backroom or garage for well under a minimum award wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The union is pleased with the positive attitude that has been shown by several parties during its attempt to rectify the problem. These include the Council of Textile Fashion Industries Association Ltd, many of the manufacturers in the industry and several major retailers, including the Coles Myer group of stores, Country Road, Daimaru, Just Jeans, Witchery, Table Eight, Fletcher Jones and Najee. These retailers have shown a preparedness to recognise their responsibility to stop supporting those who exploit home workers by paying them less than the minimum award standards. This positive attitude, however, contrasts with that of other retailers, including Big W, Sportsgirl, Sussan's and Best and Less. It is disappointing that not all retailers are helping the union stamp out the exploitation of home workers who supply goods to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unions representing maritime, transport, warehousing and maintenance workers have also expressed their strong support for the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union campaign to stamp out this exploitation. Unless all workers act to stamp out exploitation in the industry, employers will receive a clear message&mdash;perhaps even in the proposed legislation&mdash;that these types of work practices are acceptable, and they will seek to apply them in other industries. Consumers will want to support stores which stock garments which are not made by women working in their backroom or garage for less than proper wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia will continue to actively campaign to ensure that all home workers receive proper pay and conditions. The union commenced a consumer information campaign today at the Highpoint West shopping centre to draw consumers' attention to retailers who are working with the union and those who are not.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Responsibility for the management of fisheries in Australia is shared between the Commonwealth, States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Constitution provides that the Commonwealth is responsible for the management of fisheries outside the 3 nautical mile territorial sea with States and internal Territories being responsible for fisheries in all other waters adjacent to that State.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) which came into force in the early 1980's, allows the Commonwealth and States to enter into arrangements that change fisheries jurisdictions. In particular, the Commonwealth and States may agree that either Commonwealth or State/Territory laws apply throughout a fishery from the low water mark to the outer limit of the Australian fishing zone (AFZ). Many major Australian fisheries are now managed under a single jurisdiction as a result of OCS arrangements agreed between specific States and the Commonwealth. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5688"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth government is aware of the collapse that occurred in the North Atlantic Cod Fishery and aware of the variety of threats to fish stocks. Pressure on fish resources can come from a number of sources including commercial and recreational fishing, environmental pressures such as habitat changes, water pollution and runoff of pesticides, drought affected stream flows and natural fluctuations in fish populations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) was established in 1992 to manage Commonwealth fisheries. AFMA's objectives include ensuring that the exploitation of fisheries resources and the undertaking of any related activities are conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, and ensuring, through proper conservation and management measures, that the living resources of the AFZ are not endangered by over-exploitation. Management measures used by AFMA include restrictions on the number of boats licensed to fish, restrictions on fishing gear, seasonal and area closures and, in some cases, quotas on the amount of fish that can be caught.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing management arrangements, AFMA, through its Management Advisory Committees (MACs) and Consultative Committees (CCs), involves the fishing industry and more recently recreational fishing and nature conservation groups in the decision making process. AFMA also works with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) including the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) and the Bureau of Resource Sciences (BRS). AFMA also consults with other organisations such as the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories (DEST). Consultation also takes place between the Commonwealth and State fisheries agencies through the Ministerial Council and its Standing Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Good stock assessments are fundamental to effective fisheries management. To support the sustainable management of fisheries resources, AFMA has established and funded Fishery Assessment Groups (FAGs) which synthesise biological, ecosystem and economic information on Commonwealth fisheries to provide advice to AFMA. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fisheries Assessment Groups which include scientists from BRS and CSIRO co-ordinate, evaluate and regularly undertake assessment activity in each fishery. MACs and CCs also play a pivotal role in planning future direction of research through the development of five year Strategic Research Plans for each major fishery. The AFMA Board co-ordinates and manages the overall research strategy for Commonwealth fisheries through its Research and Environment Committee, which also acts as the Fisheries Research Advisory Board (FRAB) to the FRDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice from the FAGs, FRDC, CSIRO and other research providers is then used by AFMA to manage its fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth fisheries are managed under a combination of limited entry and other input or output controls. Such management aims to maintain catches at a sustainable level in line with the objectives of the Fisheries Management Act 1991. One possible influence on the collapse of the North Atlantic cod was the unregulated fishing of this species on the high seas. Australia is a member of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) (which was established to protect the highly migratory SBT). In addition, Australia is a signatory and strong supporter of the United Nations agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participation in international fora helps to conserve fish stocks harvested by Australians through effective international fisheries management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that AFMA's management arrangements combined with targeted research will minimise the risk of collapse such as seen with cod in the North Atlantic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) No, although high the loss of marine life varies from year to year. Prawn trawling usually results in a high proportion of the catch as bycatch, but bycatch from individual fisheries will vary depending on their location and the amount of fishing effort. Exact quantities of bycatch from Australian prawn fisheries are not known. In the prawn fisheries world bycatch levels are estimated to be somewhere between a ratio of 5:1 and 10:1 of bycatch to prawns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSIRO has advised that in the Northern Prawn Fishery, with an average annual catch of 8,000 tonnes of prawns, the bycatch is in the order of 60,000 tonnes, i.e. a bycatch ratio of 7.5 : 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the bycatch is of commercial value and retained for sale. I am advised by the CSIRO that fish in this bycatch is usually dead but other components such as crabs have a high survival rate. Discarded bycatch is returned overboard and continues to contribute to the food chain in the marine environment. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5689"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A $2 million program to encourage the voluntary use of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) including turtle excluder devices (TEDs) commenced in July 1996. The program incorporates a `gear library' of BRDs that the fishing industry may borrow to trial. The gear library includes the AusTED and a range of overseas TED designs that were trialled and refined in the Gulf of Carpentaria study. The gear library will allow these devices to be trialled under commercial fishing conditions and their performance will be documented by a research observer. The program will also include workshops held at different ports, and a range of educational materials such as videos and newsletters to carry the message. It will be available to trawler operators in the Queensland east coast otter trawl fishery, the northern prawn fishery and the Torres Strait fishery. The program is run jointly by the Queensland Department of Primary Industry (QDPI), the Australian Maritime College (AMC) and the CSIRO. It is funded by the FRDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The CSIRO has undertaken extensive research into issues and options to reduce bycatch in the prawn fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of initial research by the  CSIRO, the Australian Maritime College and the Northern Territory government has been to develop trawl net modifications which eliminate the catch of large animals such as turtles. At the same time, reductions of around 30% in fish bycatch have been achieved. Fishing industry trials using a number of the most promising devices are currently in progress, such as Nordmore grids. The CSIRO has ongoing studies to further reduce fish bycatch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The CSIRO has advised that fisheries issues tend to be expressed in terms of the sustainability of catch level, rather than in terms of effort levels (for example, boat numbers) in a fishery. The CSIRO has provided advice in relation to capacity within the Northern Prawn Fishery. This advice has contributed to a reduction of the fishing fleet in recent years from 250 to 130 boats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Orange Roughy Fishery, catches have been reduced from in excess of 40,000 tonnes per year to about 5,000 tonnes, principally on the basis of CSIRO stock assessments.</PARA>
