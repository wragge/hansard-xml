<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not new. Senator Collins, have you looked at the minute that was tabled? Have you looked at the minute? Does that refer to these other nations? Does the minute refer to these other nations, Senator Collins? You do not know, do you? You have just been given a dummy sheet to ask a question from. You are asking a dixer. The question was asked yesterday and it was answered yesterday. But since you raise the question of HECS and the government's justification for asking the parliament to agree to adopt the HECS increase, let me repeat what I said yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">University students are amongst the luckiest people in the country. We give them roughly, at a minimum, $20,000 worth of higher education&mdash;far more than we give people who go to TAFE and far more than we give people who do a trade or an apprenticeship. We give university students a lot. We ask them only to make a contribution and to make it when they start earning an income. If you do not think that puts them in the luckiest category, fine. You go out and tell the tradespeople that it is right that they should pay for their tools but university students do not have to pay until they earn an income&mdash;an income of $28,000, as you would have it. You go ahead and do that. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But from where we come from, university students are amongst the luckiest school leavers. So it is fair enough, given the private benefit they get, to ask them to make a higher contribution. It is fair enough not only to ask for a higher contribution but to shift to the recommendation made by Neville Wran, the former Labor Premier of New South Wales, when he suggested that we have a differentiated HECS. We are not asking teachers, who do not get as much in the way of private benefit, to give as much per annum as doctors. If you think that is fair, you go out and argue it. But I will be out arguing the opposite case.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CX5">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. Has the minister seen reports of the $US24 billion merger between British Telecom and MCI? What lessons does this merger hold for Telstra? Does it show that players in the telecommunications market are facing unprecedented global competition?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not taken entirely by surprise, and I am grateful to Senator Macdonald. But I would have thought everyone in this chamber would have been asking this question, because it is a very important issue that is going to confront this parliament very shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The merger of BT and MCI is of the order of $US24 billion. In other words, this is a mega&hyphen;merger amongst mega&hyphen;mergers. What it amounts to is that both of these very substantial international players recognise that it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is necessary to get together, to combine, to compete effectively in the new international environment. What is particularly significant, in terms of assessment of this merger, is a piece by Glenda Korporaal in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After 12 years of privatisation, BT has been transformed into a much stronger, more efficient company, set to become one of the dominant international telecommunications players of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A domestically&hyphen;focused, government&hyphen;owned BT could never have dreamed of pulling off the megadeal British Telecom has put its name to over the weekend. It's not just the financial ability for a merger provided by a stockmarket listing; it is the whole gamut of operational efficiencies made possible by being freed of political masters and the more entrepreneurial, competitive leading&hyphen;edge managerial culture which is allowed to develop in a corporation that reports to shareholders rather than politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far from being threatened or weakened by privatisation, the experience has allowed BT to take a hard-headed look at its cost structure and recruit the kind of internationally&hyphen;minded chief executive . . .</PARA>
<PARA>She then goes on to talk about the extent of the debate in other countries and how the privatisation of telcos is in fact sweeping the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at Chanticleer in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, we find more of the same. The Chanticleer article says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The BT takeover of MCI is a function of the collapse of barriers to entry in most of the major telecommunications markets around the world.</PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . barriers to competition . . . have crumbled to the point of no return.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus Telstra Corp&mdash;which is medium sized and medium&hyphen;tech by global standards&mdash;has reached a critical turning point. It is going to come under unprecedented assault in its home market . . . </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the consequences for Telstra of remaining 100 per cent government&hyphen;owned while competing in the Australian market with the likes of AT&amp;T from next year could be severe.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have here is a very eloquent outlining of what I think are overwhelming reasons. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5057"> Indeed, these reasons are recognised around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragedy is that on the other side we have a bunch of dinosaurs who are somehow determined to ensure that Australia remains behind the main game, remains less than fully internationally competitive. Over the other side you have probably the largest sandpit in history. You have 28 or 29 of them over there all putting their collective heads in the sand, not prepared to face up to a very serious issue other than by way of people like Mr Beazley saying very smugly, `There is nothing much left to privatise.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that, with that sort of attitude, they ought to be in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guinness Book of Records</EMPHASIS> for being either the biggest sandpit in history or, indeed, the biggest bunch of political hypocrites in history. Quite clearly, they understand the virtues of privatisation, they know this would be good for Australia, they know it would be good for consumers, they know it would be good for subscribers and ordinary Australians; but, for base&hyphen;minded political motives, they are simply not prepared to do what they have done on all government business enterprises to date. Australia is the worst for this political myopia. Quite clearly, Australian consumers will suffer; Australia's international image will suffer. I just hope they will find the time to read at least those two pieces and understand the compelling logic behind them.</PARA></ANSWER>

The TCA Chairman, Bruce Baird, is quoted as saying that this issue has reached a critical stage because several contract negotiations for reef tours with overseas wholesalers have been cancelled as a result of this uncertainty.

It was pursuant to a practice that is being adopted by governments throughout Australia and internationally, and that is that major conservation reserves, principally national parks, should be costed in a way that the burden is borne between both taxpayers at large and the users of the park.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Newman representing the Minister for Health. Will the minister outline measures being undertaken to improve the standard of general practice in Australia, and will after hours medical services be improved?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5058" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister Wooldridge, of course, has the responsibility for this area of policy but has always had a strong reputation for his support for improving the standards of medical practice, particularly in general practice. The recent budget confirmed the government's support also for Australia's highly prized tradition of family medicine centred on the general practitioner. We have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sought to increase the status of general practice as a calling, partly by retaining some existing measures and partly by introducing some innovations of our own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have retained the general practice strategy with funding being maintained at $224 million, reversing a savings decision made during the election campaign. That includes the better practice program, the rural incentives program, funding for divisions of general practice, and also the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners training program which provides 400 training places for young doctors. This government is intent on reshaping these program elements to better target quality and good outcomes. We will therefore be putting in place a comprehensive review of the general practice strategy to deliver the best opportunities for GPs, including part&hyphen;time doctors and women practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that there is considerable scope to re&hyphen;target the better practice program which provides formula&hyphen;based grants to practices assessed against a set of benchmarking criteria, taking into account concerns of the profession about how the program currently operates. The BPP gives eligible practices a revenue complement for fees for service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the options that the minister is particularly interested in is payment for after hours care. As you would be aware, the conduct of home visits and participation in after hours care are current eligibility requirements for the program. Certainly at the moment the program does not adequately reward practices which have on call or deputising services. This is something the government wants to look at in conjunction with the medical profession for, if the returns are inadequate, locum and deputising services will continue to be underused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senator may also be interested in questions of access to primary medical care in rural and remote areas of Australia. It is certainly an issue in Western Australia, Senator Panizza, as you well know, just as it is in my own state of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While there is a national oversupply of several thousand GPs, in country Australia <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5059"> there is an undersupply of several hundred. As part of the medical work force package introduced in the budget, temporary visa doctors and new graduates will be able to work in the country as rural locums through approved placements. These placements will ensure that appropriate supervisory quality assurance and backup arrangements are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's overall medical work force strategy is consistent with its commitment to quality general practice. By restricting access to Medicare only to those doctors with postgraduate training or those on a training program, the government is treating general practice with the respect it deserves. This government values general practice. It wants to see it survive and grow in a professional environment increasingly dominated by specialisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are keen to address the general oversupply situation, but we are also just as keen to do something about the poor distribution of the GPs we already have. We have announced that we will take a strategic view of the problem, offering short-term and long-term measures which over time will address the pressures of the provision of medical services.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did write to Brian Johns on 22 October. I wrote to him in terms of an inquiry, not in any shape or form seeking to impose a personal view, and certainly recognising that programming is the sole responsibility of the ABC. I did this on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the basis of about 60 letters that have been received by my department since the beginning of the year, most of those calling for the program to be taken off air completely but a number of others simply asking for it to be rescheduled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of my letter was simply to inquire and to seek advice on behalf of constituents and members of the general public who choose to write to me on the issue so that I can properly inform them about the current state of play. There is nothing exceptional about that; there is nothing unusual. Indeed, I would have thought it is a dereliction of duty not to ensure that the minister is fully informed about decisions that are of consequence and of interest to those who write in. That is simply what I did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked Mr Johns to advise me whether or not the ABC had any plans to take the program off air or to reschedule it to a later time slot. In that context, I do not think anyone would construe that as me somehow leaning on the ABC or trying to tell them what ought to happen.</PARA>

I am pleased to advise that the Attorney&hyphen;General still expects that the Commonwealth legislation will be introduced this year. Recently, there was a quite important step in progressing Australia's participation in the arrangements for the transfer of prisoners. That is, with the exception of the Northern Territory and subject to final confirmation from one jurisdiction, all other state and territory attorney&hyphen;generals have endorsed draft legislation for the transfer of prisoners at the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorney&hyphen;Generals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed legislation would allow Australians serving prison sentences overseas and foreign nationals imprisoned in Australian prisons to return to their home countries to complete their sentences. Endorsement of the draft legislation is seen as something of a major step. However, the Attorney&hyphen;General is unable to specify exactly when the first transfer would be able to occur. Before any transfers can take place, obviously, the legislation has to pass through the federal and relevant state and territory parliaments. A number of administrative steps also will need to be taken and transfer arrangements will have to be made with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the humanitarian, economic and social advantages of international prisoner transfer schemes, the Attorney advises that the Commonwealth will certainly be working to have the scheme operating as quickly as possible.

It represents the final report card on Labor's record on government debt and, therefore, I would have thought it would be of interest to the senators opposite.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the general government sector, which excludes public trading enterprises, there was a $10 billion rise in net debt to $93 billion. Since June 1990, Commonwealth general government debt has risen from $16 billion to $93 billion, principally through big deficits year after year. In contrast to the continued rise in Commonwealth debt, state and territory governments reduced their debt levels last year. In aggregate, state and territory governments have cut their debt by around $15 billion through a mix of responsible, prudent fiscal policy and privatisations. General government net debt fell in six of the eight states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of passing the first Howard budget can be seen from the consequences of Labor's fiscal legacy over the 1990s. The policies followed by the Labor government led to a rapid build&hyphen;up in government debt, continued pressure on the current account deficit and pressure on interest rates.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judgment that was made in relation to those earlier programs was that it would be sufficient to simply send out invitations to a select number and to follow up selectively and hope for the best in a sense. It is very difficult to judge. People often, as I am told&mdash;maybe this cultural idiosyncrasy is not confined to India&mdash;say they will be there and they do not turn up. Maybe they get a better offer. Maybe they sleep in. For whatever reason, it is difficult to predict the likely level of attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened in relation to Circus Oz was that they took the view that it was better to err on the side of providing too many invitations. Quite clearly, the reputation of Circus Oz preceeded it to the point where there were some disappointed punters. It was nothing like the number that were turned away from the 1990 grand final. It is quite unfair to compare it with an event of that magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, some of those disaffected were journalists. One can well understand how they had a particular interest in ensuring that the level of disaffection on their part was somehow translated into more widespread disaffection.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Are you aware of the Smith Family study into poverty, which shows that as many as 30 per cent of Australians are living in poverty? As <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5066"> part of that study, the Smith Family has established a poverty profile which shows that, for over 65 per cent of those living in poverty, high cost housing is a significant factor. How will the government fulfil its election promise that public housing tenants will not be disadvantaged by the reforms and that low income tenants will not have to pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent? In the shift from public to private, will not the poor again be the losers? What will be the cost of this promise by the government? Will your program be wrecked by opposition from state governments?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="5066" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very interesting question from Senator Woodley. It is a wonder that the official opposition has not seen fit to ask any questions about it this week. The Smith Family report is one that all Australians should be concerned about, no matter what their politics. The question of housing costs was an important element of it. I will come to that in a second.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Low educational levels is another serious problem that is correlated with poverty, as is marriage break-up. One hopes that the measures regarding pre-marriage education and parenting skills which we have put in over the short months we have been in government will go some way to helping prevent the family break&hyphen;ups that we suffer from so badly today. The measures that Senator Vanstone and Dr Kemp are putting in with regard to schools will also, hopefully, encourage young people to be better educated and reduce the illiteracy problems that so many social security customers, for example, suffer from. It disadvantages them not only in the work force but also in applying for benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now move to the question of housing. In some way, I was quite pleased that this was highlighted as much as it was. Senator Woodley has pointed out the percentage&mdash;I think it is about 62 per cent&mdash;of people who are in poverty due to high housing costs. If ever there were an argument for the need for reform of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, it was in that Smith Family report. The measures that we believe need to be taken and which the state governments are working with us on mean that we are trying <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to achieve the greater affordability of rental housing for people, be they in the public or private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of real concern that some ill&hyphen;informed people are somehow suggesting that people in the private sector will be disadvantaged. Certainly they are seriously disadvantaged right now. They need to be able to afford suitable appropriate housing more easily than they can now, where so many families are paying more than 50 per cent, and certainly over 35 per cent, of their income in rent. By comparison, people in public housing are paying up to 25 per cent and as low as 14 per cent in some parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are trying to achieve greater equality of subsidy between the two sectors so that all the quarter of a million people who are on the waiting lists for public housing, and therefore currently renting in the private sector, will be able to evaluate whether they still need to apply for public housing or whether affordability in the private sector is such that they no longer need to aspire to public housing. We believe that it should be the tenant's choice. Our measures, which we are working on with the states and the territories in the task force that has been established, are designed to achieve that equity and concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I see that Senator Woodley is concerned about this matter. The official opposition does not seem to have an interest in trying to redress the problems of poverty due to the high cost of housing. Thirteen years of Labor have produced that, whereby the public housing stock is now down to 5,000 buildings a year and yet the same amount of money is being paid by the Commonwealth. The aging stock of the public housing sector is a matter of serious concern. The private sector needs to be more affordable to those who cannot get into the public housing sector.</PARA></ANSWER>

That report indicated that the belief that the technological revolution embodied in the information superhighway of necessity entails the need for a legal revolution of the same magnitude is an unnecessary and panic response that should not be taken too seriously.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He adds that the office is not visited by Austrade staff from Australia or elsewhere in the region and it does not engage in active trade promotion, consistent with our policy of neither encouraging nor discouraging trade.

The result of that is basically that we do not believe that closing that office would have any effect in policy terms.</PARA>

<PARA>Between Pauline Hanson and this government there has been a big effort to undermine the Australian tourist industry. In the case of Pauline Hanson you can say that is a special factor, although the government must share some of the blame in not responding to her directly and unambiguously, sooner than it did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My remarks this afternoon are about the tourism industry and government steps that have been taken in the budget which impose new taxes and costs on that tourist industry and undermine the ability of smaller operators in the industry to effectively compete in what is one of Australia's most premier tourist locations, the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourist industry in Australia is one of the fastest growing industries we have in this country. Australia is rightly world famous as a tourist destination and for the magnificent scenery we offer international visitors. Tourism, as a facet of the Australian economy, is one of the biggest earners of foreign exchange of any, and is one of the reasons why services exports for Australia show a huge growth. It is one of the industry sectors that is most active in turning back the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cynics in the tourist industry say that Australia is known overseas for three things: the reef, the rock and the Opera House; and that foreign tourists come to Australia primarily to see those three attractions. I do not wish to comment on that other than to say that what that remark does underline absolutely is the importance of the Great Barrier Reef to Australian tourism. It is one of the world famous natural phenomena that bolsters Australia's income. The Great Barrier Reef is also one of the few things that you can actually see from the moon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the Great Barrier Reef, in the last budget the government increased charges for reef visits&mdash;the infamous reef tax&mdash;by 500 per cent. The interesting thing about the budget was that it was supposed to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have made savings in order that the budget could come more sharply into balance. But it is a curious piece of accounting to tax an industry which is a growth industry, thus stunting its growth so it will not grow as fast and so the government will not receive in the budget income from employed persons in the form of PAYE tax or will not receive from companies which would otherwise have grown more rapidly than the tax would allow, income to the budget from the point of view of corporate tax or company  tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have is a narrowly defined accountant's view that if it is a tax, increase it. That is what happened in this budget. But do not have regard to the earning capacity of the whole industry and the total advantage that industry is to the Australian community in employment, job creation and earning foreign exchange in growing companies, and in allowing small businesses that base themselves on tourism to prosper; and do not account for the advantage that gives to the income side of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, in the classic case, one of the most short&hyphen;sighted things a government can do&mdash;not look at the total impact, just increase a tax and stand back and not worry. There is reason to worry and the reason is best articulated by the people in this industry. Operators in the Australian tourist industry, particularly those on the Great Barrier Reef, rightly have been complaining. This tax, in many cases, has caused international contracts not to be renewed. This tax has meant that small operators who put their prices in their pricing packages months in advance now have to go and reprint and reorganise their pricing charges. In some cases that is bad for business. If they do not do it they will go under; if they do do it they will lose traffic and trade&mdash;and the impact is something the whole economy will feel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the reef tax was first imposed there was understandably an outcry by tourist operators in Australia. One would have expected a sensitive government to pay attention to this because it does mean jobs for Australians, it does mean income to the tax side of the ledger as well and it would mean that a government that paid attention to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5071"> needs of this industry was listening to what the people said. But has this government paid attention? No. Today we heard from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) representing, of all people, the minister for tourism, say, `We'll ring you, don't ring us,' to this industry. He said, `You have made representations. We will take them on board and we will get back to you if we choose.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in entering into this debate because over the time I have been in the Senate I have had a lot to do with tourist operators in North Queensland. I will tell you this, Mr Deputy President: they were the main reason we got rid of Labor representation from the north. They were sick of 13 years of the anti&hyphen;small business, anti&hyphen;tourism legislation and approach from the previous Labor government. It overwhelmed on 2 March when, to a man and woman, North Queenslanders threw out the Labor representatives. Senator Reynolds may well be lucky that she was not up for re&hyphen;election this time or she may have gone the same way as her former Labor colleagues in the north. This environment management charge was, as Senator Hill mentioned during question time, introduced by Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also the Labor Party that had some reports commissioned which recommended that this tax or charge be substantially increased and that it be imposed upon all small boat owners plying the waters in north and central Queensland. I was totally opposed to that at the time that report was brought into the Senate last year under the previous Labor government. It is something which we on this side are totally opposed to because those sorts of boats are owned by family people&mdash;little boats owned by average Australians up our way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought that matter had been put to rest but, lo and behold, on the weekend a former Labor member who hung around Townsville somewhere, who still thinks that he is the member in waiting&mdash;and he has a big think coming, as Senator Reynolds will agree; Peter Lindsay will be there for a long time&mdash;was in the press or trying to get in the press, and I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must say that nobody really rang him at all, trying to suggest that it was the intention of the new government to tax all small boat operators. This is, of course, not the intention of the new government and Senator Hill has categorically denied that as I, with whatever little authority I have, have also done. So that is not on. But it will not stop the Labor Party from trying to make a political point about the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourist operators in North Queensland have had a very tough time in the last 13 years. They have been hit with increasing taxes and increasing regulation by the previous Labor government. They were instrumental in determining that the previous government should be thrown out and the new government introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the increase in the environment management charge, we come at this from a position where the Labor government left us with a $10 billion deficit in the current budget&mdash;$10 billion!&mdash;which had to be made up from somewhere. Savings had to be made right across the board and one of those savings, regrettably, was to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, an authority which I think does a good job. It could be perhaps a little more efficient but, generally, it does a good job. This proposal to increase the environment management charge was introduced to give the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority some additional funding to make up for the savings that it was required to contribute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all understand that the integrity of the budget must be maintained. But that has not stopped me and some of my northern colleagues, the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), the member for Dawson (Ms Kelly), the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), having quite a number of meetings with the minister and his department to work through this issue in a way that is sensible to all parties. I have not noticed any Labor Party politicians there but I repeat that there are none in Queensland any more, except for Senator Reynolds. But you were not there, Senator Reynolds, and I do not know what representations you have made <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5072"> on behalf of anybody in the north.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ian Macdonald has a very selective memory on this issue. He says that the tourist industry has had a difficult time over the past 13 years but not nearly as difficult as it will have with a 500 per cent increase through this tax. Senator Macdonald kept talking about it as an environmental charge. Make no mistake about it, it is a reef tax. It is discriminatory because it only applies to visitors to the reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On four occasions the Howard government has refused to debate its massive reef tax hike. It has had that opportunity in the House of Representatives and on four occasions it has refused to debate it. Notwithstanding the fact that the north Queensland members are very loud in their criticism when they are in the north, when they come south of course they are scared to speak out within the party room because they know that they will have absolutely no influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will this reef tax do to tourism in the north? James Cook University Professor of Tourism, Phillip Pearce, has backed tourism operators in condemning a 500 per cent hike on reef visitor charges. He said yesterday that the new arrangements increasing an environmental management charge from $1 to $6 per visitor per day to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park clearly represented a tax&mdash;not a user fee, not an environmental charge but a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Pearce also said the lack of consultation with the industry was to be condemned and would damage relations between operators and reef researchers. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charge introduced in 1993, which was directed to reef research, will now supplement funding to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Macdonald talked about the need to retain budget integrity. Fine, Senator Macdonald. Find something in the south to tax instead. I have some figures here that show precisely what kind of subsidy is going to different museums and community cultural education facilities in the south.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Senator Macdonald could increase by 500 per cent the entry fee to the Canberra National Gallery. If it is good enough for visitors to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, why not to the Canberra National Gallery? After all, the Canberra National Gallery gets a $19 million&mdash;100 per cent&mdash;subsidy here in the south but that is not a privileged position that we get in the north.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the Canberra War Memorial which gets $16 million or more in subsidy from the government&mdash;again a 100 per cent subsidy? The Sydney Maritime Museum gets a 94 per cent subsidy. The Canberra National Science and Technology Centre gets about a 90 per cent subsidy. The Canberra National Museum gets a 99 per cent subsidy. What does the Townsville Great Barrier Reef Aquarium get if Warren Entsch does not succeed in selling it? No government subsidy whatsoever and, in addition, this hike in a reef tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do the northern members say about this particular tax? Warren Entsch, without consulting the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) suggests that we sell the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium. John Lyons, who is the chairman of the aquarium's advisory board, says that selling the Great Barrier Reef Aquarium would be like shooting the guide dog. He said that the government should meet any shortfall&mdash;</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(3.24 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this issue because I think there are a number of myths that have been perpetrated this afternoon about the issue of the reef tax. The first thing that I want to allude to is the fact that when the then Leader of the Opposition launched the tourist policy, it was launched in Cairns on the promise that there would be no additional taxes in the tourist industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tourist operators in the north took that very much to heart. I have had the pleasure of travelling to Cairns and meeting with tourist operators, who have expressed to me their bitter disappointment that the government reneged on that issue, in particular by upping the reef tax, as it now has become known, to the tune of 500 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think one should look at what exactly the reef tax is. When this charge was introduced by the former Labor government, it was an environmental management charge of $1. That charge of $1 was to do nothing else than to assist research on our most important wonder&mdash;the reef. Of the $1, 75c went to the Cooperative Research Centre For Ecologically Sustainable Development of the Great Barrier Reef. In other words, the money was put into research and development associated with the reef. The other 25c of the original dollar, of the environmental management charge, went to GBRMPA, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, as a management collection charge to assist in the collection of the $1 at the various points from the operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was never under any circumstances a direct tax because the operators, when it was originally mooted by the former Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, were quite adamant that they did not want to be taxed; they did not want a tax but they would go along with the concept of an environmental management charge, which would go very much to research on the reef. That is the way it has been interpreted by the local operators up there and that is what they believed it would be. So when the government came along and upped it by 500 per cent and used it to no other purpose other than to fund GBRMPA and to relieve the funding of GBRMPA, it then became a tax on them, and it was a tax that they could not bear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax has been compared to the charges to enter national parks but of course there is no relationship at all between the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and other land based national parks. So the charge cannot be in any way equated with the charges on the mainland for other great national parks that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real problem facing the tourist operators up there is the fact that they have had to advertise their prices and fix their prices out to April 1998. That is a substantial period ahead and, if those prices are not fixed, then they lose their credibility in the international tourist market. That is the problem that is confronting the tourist operators because they are the ones who have to pay the tax. It is not a tax that is directly collected from the individual who visits the reef on a day-to-day basis; it is something that is built into the price. To change their price structures now would, in effect, destroy their credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This becomes the concern of these small operators, these small business people. I was led to believe, when I met with people from the Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau, who have some 700 members, that the substantial majority of their members are involved in one way or another in the tourist industry, two&hyphen;thirds of them are small businesses with five or fewer than five staff, and 80 per cent of their membership have 20 staff or less. So what we are facing here is a crisis for small business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the same issue, there is an irony here in relation to the charges for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5074"> Great Barrier Reef Marine Park inasmuch as it seems to me that, if you think of the proposed sale of Telstra and why that should be required to fund the environment, the environment is being picked out as the area which should be self&hyphen;funded, should have individual ways of being funded which are not out of the general revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it both ironic and dangerous that the environment is picked out as being that one area which is user-pays and at the same time has its funding that would normally come out of general revenue pulled out. This is not the first time we have seen this happen. We saw it in the lead in petrol debate in 1993 where the ALP did something similar. It suggested that funding could go to the environment, but at the same time it pulled money out of the environment portfolio and simply swapped it with another general revenue raising measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to think this measure will not be the general picture&mdash;that every time we want to raise a bit of extra money and put it into general revenue, we are going to find some way of looking like we are raising money for the environment while all we are doing is ripping money out of the environment and expecting the environment to pay for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony here is that perhaps the pressures on GBRMPA&mdash;the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;have made it act a bit like the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia. Why are there parallels between these two organisations? We have heard just this week that there are proposals from some forces within GBRMPA to have a trial on some of their reefs to see what happens when you fish out pristine reefs or just fish enough for them to be damaged&mdash;to see to what point you can fish them until they are damaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parallel here is that it is very similar to what happens in the Department of Conservation and Land Management. The small royalties that the Department of Conservation and Land Management gets from the use of clear-felling of native forests actually go towards their running expenses. It becomes a perpetual motion machine. You have to keep ripping out native forests in order for the Department <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Conservation and Land Management&mdash;the department which oversees the ripping out of those native forests&mdash;to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hate to think we have a situation where the destruction of the reef becomes the rationale for the continuation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I would hate to think we will start looking at royalties for fishing and recreation. That decision in the long run&mdash;just like the decisions that I believe CALM are making in Western Australia&mdash;will be to the detriment of tourism and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that instance, it is really not necessary to conduct 11 experiments in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, because these experiments are being conducted all around the Pacific to the detriment of everybody. In fact, because the reefs fertilise each other, we are also putting at risk the reef systems right around the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are concerned about short-sighted decisions relating to tourism, we must also add this other Great Barrier Reef short-sighted decision. If we as a parliament let it go by&mdash;so that we oversee an `experiment' which does not need to occur: that is, to see what happens when you fish out a reef or damage a reef, its environs and its fishing&mdash;we are doing worse than our proposal to make the Great Barrier Reef pay for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are problems with that, and there are a number of issues involved in requiring the environment to be self-funded. If you ask people&mdash;as EPAC did within the last 12 months or so&mdash;what they think their taxes should be spent on, amongst those issues which they strongly support are the maintenance and good quality of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a dangerous track we are running down&mdash;this idea that the environment should pay for itself via special levies and that a body like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has to find other sources of funding. If that were to occur, there could be a conflict of interest&mdash;just like with foresters at the Department of Conservation and Land Management&mdash;so that harvesting the reef would become the source of revenue. We have two issues here and they ought to both <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5075"> be addressed; otherwise we will kill the goose that laid the golden egg.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 182.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion because this matter is urgent. The motion before the Senate seeks to allay the anxiety of 1,500 East Timorese asylum seekers who are in Australia and who want to maintain their protection, their security, their safety and their peace of mind in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My motion calls on the government to create a humanitarian visa for the 1,500 East Timorese asylum seekers in this country. It aims to repeat the special protection given by the government to the many Chinese students in this country at the time of Tiananmen Square, when a special provision was made under the then Labor government for those Chinese students who were in fear for their safety, their wellbeing and their lives if they were at that time forced back to China so that they could have permanent residency in Australia. If those circumstances warranted that, surely the circumstances confronting the people of East Timor who have fled to the safety of this country deserve no less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very urgent matter. A couple of months ago, many of these people received a letter from the department of immigration which indicated that they were about to be  deported on the basis that they were Portuguese. These are people who have never been to Portugal. Most of them do not speak Portuguese. They have no affinity except what they have read in the history books about the previous Portuguese colonial administration in their country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are also people who, as citizens of East Timor, have very often stood up to the military occupation of their country. For that, they can live in fear of their lives. For that, they have been forced to leave our nearest neighbour, the country of East Timor. The plight of these people now in Australia with this threat of deportation hanging over their heads is indeed a harrowing and pitiable situation to hear about. At the outset, this government ought to maintain the stand it took in opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The urgency for this matter would not be there had the Minister for Foreign Affairs kept to his statement of 11 October last year, when he said that the claim that the East Timorese asylum seekers are Portuguese is simply absurd and hypocritical. If it was absurd and hypocritical in October last year for Mr Downer, surely it is absurd and hypocritical that they are threatened with deportation as Portuguese citizens in November this year. If there were consistency in the government's policy on this matter and in their commitment to these 1,500 special citizens of Australia, as I would class them, then they would not be living in fear for their safety. They would not be living in anxiety. They would not be living with the axe over their heads with no choice but to go to Portugal, where they do not speak the language and where many of them do not share the culture or religion, or to go back to Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the case of one particular person amongst their number who came here in 1984. I am again pointing out the urgency of the matter for this person. During the occupation of East Timor, he witnessed his brother, aged 11, being killed outside his house. His father was killed. He fled, after being arrested and imprisoned for five months for passing on some notes and pictures to visiting journalists in 1994. Since then, Indonesian soldiers have entered his house and beaten his mother to death. Since then, one of his sisters has been raped. Since then, and just this year, two of his sisters have managed to escape to this country. All three of those people, after having escaped that hell under Indonesian  occupation, are suddenly faced with Australia&mdash;this country, this land <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the free, the land of democracy&mdash;deporting them to Portugal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not support the suspension of standing orders to bring forward this motion. We believe the issues contained in parts of the motion moved by Senator Brown are important. But he has two different views mixed in this resolution. One, in great detail, is about the issue of qualification for refugees to come to Australia. There are several paragraphs in great detail, but at the end the motion refers to the Nobel Peace Prize winners, about which the Senate has already declared its position and on which it has voted. The motion then calls on the government to create a humanitarian visa class for East Timorese asylum seekers. We believe there is a mixture of issues that, quite frankly, should be dealt with in a much wider debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, these sorts of issues should be dealt with, if necessary, by a standing committee of the Senate looking at the issues contained in this motion. Senator Brown has raised a very significant suggestion: the creation of a humanitarian visa class for East Timorese asylum seekers who applied before October 1996. There are probably 30 countries around the world that you could make an equally just case for giving a particular humanitarian class of refugee status to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only today I met a group of people from Sri Lanka, the Tamils, asking for the direct issue of humanitarian problems to be dealt with. Again, people from that part of Sri Lanka which the Tamils inhabit want to get applications for visas to come to Australia. You could make just as needy a case for those people as you can for East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues raised by Senator Brown are profound. I am not denying that at all. But I think the Senate would not be able to do the issues justice in a short debate brought on under this motion. If Senator Brown wants to refer a number of these issues to the appropriate committee&mdash;either the Senate standing references committee covering foreign affairs or the joint committee on migration regulations&mdash;I think that would be a much better <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5080"> place for this matter to be dealt with; rather than having a hurried debate here on a mixture of issues that, in many cases, are far too broad to be dealt with under a general notice of motion. We oppose the suspension of standing orders for those reasons.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators would have noticed that I denied formality on this motion. The reason for denying formality was that I wanted to hear the arguments from not only Senator Brown but both the government and the opposition. It seemed fairly obvious from the whips meeting that neither the government nor the opposition had any intention of supporting the motion. It seems to be the current case that declaring a motion formal and voting against it is a way of stopping even hearing the arguments on a debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an urgent motion because human lives are at stake. There are very few examples where it is relatively easy to check the bona fides of people who are seeking refugee status for various reasons. Australia has been tiptoeing. As Senator Brown mentioned, the interesting thing is how the tables turn so quickly when someone has gone from being in opposition to being in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought and hoped that there might still be some conscience within members of the ALP and at least to have some understanding of how Australia is looking on the international arena in relation to these issues. This was one of the reasons why countries would not in a pink fit support Australia for a position on the Security Council: it continues to be so hypocritical on an issue so close to Australia for which we should have access to the information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is urgent because the people's lives are dependent on this action. Their lives may well be at risk. There is no valid reason in any ethical or moral sense why they should not be classified as refugees. The only thing I can think of, which is why it is so urgent for us to talk about it, is that Australia does not want to risk our market to Indonesia. I would think countries would be respected if they did not shillyshally around on these kinds of things which are in Australia's aegis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are not internal matters. These are people who have a valid reason for seeking refugee status. We in Australia have the ability to make up our own minds. It is not interfering with anybody else's internal matters. Pushing the matter on to Portugal is not the right thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is urgent that this Senate indicates to the government that it is time they took their responsibilities seriously. This is the only way that this can be done quickly. What kind of quick resolution could we get from, as Senator Schacht has suggested, a standing committee in the Senate&mdash;which one?&mdash;because how many are not flat tack at the moment; when would we get an answer; and what would that mean to the lives of those people in the meantime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly in the long run we do have to deal with this issue honestly and fully in the Senate. If there is a Senate standing committee that is prepared to look at it, perhaps Senator Schacht might be able to recommend it to us. That will not necessarily help those people whose lives are currently in jeopardy at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see some better response from the ALP. I would certainly like to have seen a better response from the government in this very urgent situation that we see now. These people had to leave for their own lives and for the fact that their lives will be in danger if they return. They deserve to be given basic humanitarian consideration. That is why it is urgent. That is why it will be very disappointing if the Senate does not support, first, the call to have the issue debated and, second, the motion that is before us today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that we have a range of important matters to deal with in this chamber, when it comes to basic humanitarian issues we should put aside some time to deal with particular, urgent questions. I do not want to get into the substance of the debate. The motion before us is for the suspension of standing orders. If that is carried, we can then get into the substance of the debate. It might be that, at any particular stage of that debate, a senator might feel that it should be adjourned for the purpose of having discussions between interested groups, both inside and outside the parliament, on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that a case has been made out for the suspension of standing orders. Under standing orders, I limit myself to comments on the particular question of urgency. I will be voting for the suspension.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be opposing Senator Brown's motion to suspend standing orders to enable debate on notice of motion 183, and it will be opposing it for a number of reasons. Senator Schacht has already mentioned a couple of those reasons. In some ways, Senator Harradine has also given a couple of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the way in which the Greens senators have raised this matter is a contrivance. I think that Senator Margetts would almost agree with that. Standing order 66 is a provision to ensure that motions can be dealt with and determined without amendment or debate. If Senator Brown were genuine and honest about that, he would have dealt with this matter without debate and without amendment. But he was either not genuine or not honest in seeking to declare the motion formal because he contrived with his colleague to ensure that there was debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Secondly, the matters contained within notice of motion 183 are complex and, as Senator Brown's motion says, they are mat ters before the Federal Court. Senator Brown wanted to call the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, inconsistent because, when in opposition our position was that we would allow the Federal Court to deal with these matters. The reality is that these matters are still before the Federal Court, and Senator Brown should know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I think Senator Harradine alluded to, under the asylum seeker category there is something like 120 nationalities represented. As Senator Schacht said, these are matters that should not be dealt with without notice and in an urgency debate in the Senate. They are complex and important matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps Senator Margetts and Senator Brown see themselves as the keepers of all conscience of all parliamentarians across Australia. Certainly, Senator Margetts would have Australians believe that no&hyphen;one who is not a member of the Greens (WA) or the Greens Australia, or whatever they like to call themselves these days, has a conscience or cares for anything. I think she actually believes that, and perhaps Senator Brown does as well. The people can judge whether that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can make a judgment on Senator Brown and his conscience when they ask whether he is to be believed as genuine and honest when he seeks to use the contrivance of asking the Senate to agree to declare a motion formal when he knows in his own heart that is not what he is seeking at all. His was an act of dishonesty. It is an act of someone who is not genuine. Under those circumstances, the coalition will be opposing the motion to suspend.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will put in place the necessary framework to give effect to the Government's decision to sell Commonwealth Funds Management Limited (CFM) and its subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CFM is a wholly Commonwealth owned public company that provides investment services in the public and private sectors. Its major clients are the Boards of Trustees of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (the CSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation (the PSS) Scheme. However, it acts as a wholesale funds manager for a number of other public and private sector funds and is involved in retail funds management for individual investors via its superannuation and general investment retail products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CFM's functions are not part of government's core activities and for this reason and to ensure the longer term future of CFM and the best returns on the funds it has under management the Government has decided to sell the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CFM was created in 1991 by the transformation of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT). SFIT had been established in 1976 as a statutory authority with trustee responsibility for the management and investment of the CSS Fund which contained the contributions of CSS members and the income earned from the investment of those contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the new PSS Scheme was established in 1990, full responsibility for that scheme and the investment of PSS Fund moneys was given to the joint employer/employee PSS Board. At the same time, the CSS Board was established, with responsibilities for the invalidity retirement process and setting the interest rate to be allocated to contributions. In 1991, the CSS Board was given responsibility for management of the CSS Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of SFIT's trustee function and responsibility for the investment of the CSS Fund to the CSS Board, was accompanied by SFIT's transformation to CFM with the role of general funds manager. To assist its establishment as a funds manager, CFM was provided with legislative monopolies over the management of the CSS and PSS Funds until 30 June 1995. Since then, the CSS and PSS Boards have been free to determine their own investment management arrangements. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5083"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period of its monopoly, CFM worked with the CSS and PSS Boards to develop investment management arrangements to apply to the CSS and PSS Funds after 30 June 1995. The new arrangements involve CFM's subsidiary, Total Risk Management Pty Ltd (TRM), in providing advice to the Boards about the overall investment strategies for the funds. The strategies involve management of substantial "passive" cores of the funds. This is being undertaken by CFM. The balance of the CSS and PSS Funds has been progressively allocated by the CSS and PSS Boards to a number of specialist "active" funds managers who have been selected on the advice of TRM.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although CFM has developed additional business and attracted funds from other clients, the substantial CSS and PSS funds under management still represented some 75 per cent of the total funds under CFM's direct management at 30 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ending of the monopolies over the CSS and PSS Funds has renewed pressures on CFM to improve its competitiveness in attracting additional clients and additional funds under management. This has come at a time when competition in the funds management industry itself has been increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the volume of funds in the market is growing, so too is the number of fund managers. In addition to traditional funds managers, there is competition from small "boutique" managers offering specialised services and from overseas managers who are establishing operations in Australia. Existing life insurance companies and banks are also seeing funds management as a source of new business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the growing numbers of competitors provide opportunities for CFM. Many of those competitors are facing similar pressures and it is expected that some would be interested in joining forces via a purchase of CFM. It is expected that CFM's expertise and experience will be of benefit to potential purchasers and in turn that CFM would benefit from the wider opportunities available for further development of its business</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision to sell CFM is consistent with the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit (NCOA) which considered that government business activities whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest case to do so. Against the background of a growing number and variety of funds managers, and the investment strategies of the CSS and PSS Boards, there is clearly no public interest case to retain CFM in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reaching its decision, the Government consulted with the Board of CFM which has fully supported <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this initiative. The sale process is also being undertaken in close consultation with CFM and CFM's major clients, particularly the CSS and PSS Boards of trustees. The sale of CFM should provide it with the opportunity to further improve its commercial performance and this should benefit its clients, including the Boards of the various superannuation schemes and their members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CFM Sale Bill provides the necessary framework to give effect to the decision to sell CFM.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a flexible disposal strategy. It allows for the sale of the shares in CFM and the separate sale of the shares in CFM subsidiaries on the same or different days. It enables the establishment, under Ministerial direction, of subsidiaries of CFM and the transfer of subsidiaries to Commonwealth ownership to allow their separate sale</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of the bill provides for the transfer of CFM subsidiaries to the Commonwealth. In particular, it enables the transfer of CFM's existing subsidiary, TRM, to Commonwealth ownership to facilitate sale of that company separately from the sale of CFM, if sale in that form eventuates from the tender process now under way. That approach was recommended in the scoping study prepared by the business advisers appointed by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Part of the bill also includes provision for the transfer of CFM staff, by Ministerial declaration, to a CFM subsidiary which has been transferred under this bill. This is because at present all the staff employed in CFM's operations, including those of the subsidiary TRM, are employed by CFM. The bill provides for continuity of employment terms and conditions and accrued entitlements for CFM staff who are transferred to TRM or any other CFM subsidiary that may be created. Provision is also made for the application of certain parts of the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Act, and certain other legislation to transferred CFM subsidiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the bill provides for the declaration of the sale day for CFM and any transferred bodies by the Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the bill provides in Part 3 for the preservation or other recognition of entitlements of CFM staff. It preserves accrued long service leave and superannuation entitlements and ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act continues to apply in relation to injury or loss incurred before sale day The bill provides for certain other rights, such as mobility rights under the Public Service Act 1922, to cease when CFM or a transferred body is sold. In these respects the bill reflects the past practice of Government in protecting accrued rights of employees in asset sale situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides in Part 3 for the cancellation of CFM's franking credits, as the Government's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5084"> clear advice has been that there would be no benefit to the sale process in having those credits pass to any purchaser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the bill further provides for the transfer, by Ministerial declaration, of specified assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of CFM or a transferred body to specified transferees on specified days. The ability to transfer these matters in this way will allow for the sale or transfer of matters that do not constitute CFM subsidiaries and for which it would not be appropriate to establish a subsidiary. This includes the transfer of assets and liabilities to transferred bodies to enable them to be sold as separate commercial entities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Commonwealth Funds Management Limited Act 1990 to remove the constraints on the sale of CFM included in section 47 of that act and provides for the removal of similar constraints from CFM's memorandum and articles of association. The bill applies relevant provisions of that act to CFM subsidiaries that are transferred to Commonwealth ownership while they are in Commonwealth ownership and provides that they will cease to apply to CFM and the transferred bodies when they are sold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes consequential amendments to a number of other Commonwealth acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will provide a framework for the sale of CFM in the most flexible and expeditious way in response to commercial interest that is expressed in the sale process. It will also protect the interests of CFM employees and enable the effective disposition of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including for the benefit of CFM's clients.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the order of the Senate of 29 November 1994, relating to the consideration of legislation, not apply to the following bills:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Funds Management Sale Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion seeks to exempt from the order of the Senate relating to the consideration of legislation the CFM Sale Bill 1996. The early completion of the sale of CFM is essential in the interests of CFM staff, contributors to the superannuation schemes whose funds it invests as well as the government's revenue. CFM's role has been changing since its legislated monopoly over the funds of the main Commonwealth schemes ended on 30 June last year. Since then CFM has had a declining share of those funds as the trustees, in the interests of the contributors, have been progressively allocating amounts of the funds to specialist active funds managers. This has reduced CFM's revenues as reflected in its last annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">CFM has gained a number of other clients for its wholesale funds management business and is also involved in retail funds management for individual clients. Nevertheless, uncertainty over the future of the business is having an impact on the amount of funds under management and therefore on CFM's continuing profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sale process announced in May is proceeding and the government expects that the successful purchaser will be selected before the end of this year. Passage of the legislation is essential for the completion of the sale. It would be most unsatisfactory for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5085"> the contributors to the super funds invested through CFM and for CFM staff to have the potential purchaser selected but unable to assume control pending legislation. It is also in the interests of CFM staff to have the uncertainty over the future ownership of the business resolved as soon as possible. These are the succinct reasons for the urgency of this bill. I ask the Senate to support this motion exempting this bill from the order of the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all know that there are a lot of issues on the government's program. We know that time for dealing with these issues is running out. I am concerned that in the leaders' meeting a couple of weeks ago we asked whether there were any other bills coming through and we were given no indication that there were any bills coming through and now we find out there are. I wonder how this bill has suddenly become urgent. Is it going to be immediately put in as a non&hyphen;controversial bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last few weeks we have seen so&hyphen;called urgent and non&hyphen;controversial bills come through at the same time. We have found them to be anything but non&hyphen;controversial. I cannot see where you would fit this bill into the normal program. If it is about privatisation it certainly would not be non&hyphen;controversial. However, that is not the issue. The issue is whether the bill is urgent and how it suddenly became urgent in the last week or so. At the leaders' meetings in the last couple of weeks there were no other bills that were knocking at the door needing to come through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that the ALP has made a decision that, for various public relations reasons, we might be seen to be putting through more bills on Thursday lunchtime. That is up to the ALP to decide. If we are looking at the wording of the motion, the legislation has to be urgent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to CFM, the urgency is that the government wants to sell it. They probably want to sell a lot of things, but that does not necessarily mean that it is absolutely essential for the Senate to deal with it now. If it is urgent and essential, to shove it through on a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Thursday lunchtime would be totally inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst a lot of pressure is being put on the Greens (WA) to deal with the bills which are on the program and which are to be passed by the end of the year, at the same time the government is putting through more bills which it did not propose to put through. Suddenly they are urgent and have to come through the Senate. If you are in a situation like the Greens, you suddenly have to find people to work on them. Quite frankly, in recent times, bills that were put through as non&hyphen;controversial certainly were not non&hyphen;controversial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants us to handle the big program that we have in the next 4&half; weeks, it is certainly not very sensible to be shoving through bills like this which, in the leaders' meetings a couple of weeks ago, did not surface. If it is urgent now why was it not urgent two weeks ago? I think the reasons for its urgency are manufactured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not for sale yet. It might never be for sale. It is pre-empting the decision of the Senate to say it is for sale. I certainly have not had a chance to find out from various people whether or not this bill is as urgent as the government says. At the very least, I think it would be reasonable to have a little more time to talk to people to find out whether the government's reasons for making this bill urgent, which we only got this morning, are compelling. That is why I am not supporting the motion today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it would be reasonable at the very least to look at it at another time. We certainly do not have the staff to be able to deal with all these issues. We cannot, firstly, look in detail at every bill to find out whether it is urgent, and, secondly, when each one comes in, try to deal with it and shove it through in a Thursday lunchtime, which is the intention here. The arguments for urgency would only stand up if the bills were urgent a couple of weeks ago. They did not seem to even be on the agenda then. Why is this suddenly urgent now?</PARA></SPEECH>

The staff, who I presume the union would represent, are very keen for this legislation to be dealt with as quickly as possible. If it is not dealt with in this manner, it goes out past Christmas. There is uncertainty for those staff. They are the people whom the union repre <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> sents. If it is possible for you to get in contact with the union and anyone else you have to, I plead with you to do so prior to Thursday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not deal with the social security legislation. Again, this is a matter which we will be seeking to exempt from the provisions of the cut&hyphen;off to provide certainty to social security recipients. The notes I have been given&mdash;I will not go through them&mdash;say it is basically tidying up to overcome some errors in the legislation. The effect of that is to provide certainty to social security recipients who have not been getting the payments they are entitled to under the social security legislation we are looking at and who need to be given certainty about those payments. They are either going to be paid by way of ex gratia payments or special advances. Failure to deal with this legislation will put those people in a place of uncertainty, particularly in relation to payments which they would depend on for their livelihoods.</PARA>

You actually do have to work quite hard. Being a senator is not a nine to five job. You actually have to put in some time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party in opposition have shown cooperation in these matters. All you are saying is that you do not have time to look at it&mdash;that you have all this work to do. All I am saying is that, when you have five or six months, as you have had with the CFM Sale Bill, I am sure the staff at CFM would ask the question: how many months do you need to give these matters consideration? It is not a complicated matter. The minister has been to see you. In relation to both of these matters we are seeking your cooperation on, you have not raised a single matter of controversy or debate. In all of the briefings and discussions, which have been a number in relation to the social security legislation and at least one or two on the CFM Sale Bill, not a single matter of controversy has been raised.

As I said in my closing remarks as we adjourned this debate in committee, I doubt whether those opposite will be satisfied with the answers they receive. But I have had further advice and I am happy to put a few matters on the record. I hope that does help Senator Jacinta Collins, who I know has a deep interest in this area of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The requirement that the AIRC have regard to the need to apply the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, without discrimination based on sex, reflects the fact that its functions under part 6&mdash;dispute prevention and settlement&mdash;largely relate to the making of awards. The phrase `equal pay for work of equal value' is the principle developed by the AIRC to deal with the equal pay matters in the award area. As recently as November 1995, the AIRC has confirmed that this principle still applies. The principle applies and will continue to apply to all pay matters in the award stream, including to bonuses and allowances, which Senator Jacinta Collins will recall were something I responded to on Senator Mackay's queries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be inappropriate for the AIRC to deal with alleged discrimination in the over&hyphen;award area in the context of its award making functions. The specific inclusion of the principle in the legislation in the context of the AIRC's award making functions strengthens current arrangements. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, where equal pay matters in awards are not legislated but left to the AIRC's wage fixing principles, the phrase `equal remuneration for work of equal value' has not generally been used in the context of the award stream but it was introduced through the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 in the context of separate minimum entitlements provisions. These provisions allow the AIRC to make orders on application to ensure equal remuneration for work of equal value for men and women workers, without discrimination based on sex, where there is no adequate alternative remedy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5089">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The phrase `equal remuneration' reflects the words used in the ILO equal remuneration convention on which the provisions are based. The use of the word `remuneration' indicates that the provisions have the potential to deal with a broader range of matters than have normally been addressed in the award stream&mdash;in particular, over&hyphen;award pay. Remuneration is defined in the ILO convention as `including the ordinary, basic or minimum wage or salary and any additional emoluments whatsoever payable directly or indirectly, whether in cash or in kind, by the employer to the worker and arising out of the worker's employment'. That is something I expect Senator Jacinta Collins would have known already. Through a combination of provisions, including those set out in proposed section 88B and the minimum entitlements and equal remuneration provisions, legislation will be comprehensive in its coverage of equal pay. The AIRC will be able to deal with the full range of equal pay issues in both the award and over&hyphen;award areas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate the parliamentary secretary's offer to take this on notice but my understanding&mdash;and someone might correct me on procedure&mdash;is that if we want to move along with this bill, we need to deal with the amendments on this issue now.

There is not one single area where it can be pointed out that this small change would be any detraction, but it would make a significant improvement and perhaps would reinforce the honour which the government and the Democrats seem to place on this agreement&mdash;particularly the Democrats&mdash;in terms of protecting the interests of Australia's women workers.

I do not know whether Senator Campbell is aware or not but while superannuation is an allowable matter at present, there is a letter as part of this agreed document that superannuation will be removed at some future date as an allowable matter. So that agreement which exists with the Democrats will remove the ability, we believe, of the commission to deal with this matter in respect of pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of superannuation and the inequities that exist therein are quite dramatic when you compare the superannuation payments made on behalf of women and men. There is no doubt about that. It is disappointing that the Democrats have not thought about this particular problem, together with the problem that Senator Collins highlighted about the High Court ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We just cannot understand Senator Murray and Senator Campbell. If you say that these issues are included and should be included and there is no doubt, the simplest way to remove any doubt is to agree to our amendment 6 to omit `pay' and substitute the word `remuneration'. That would clear up any doubt.</PARA></SPEECH>

Peter Reith to have superannuation matters dealt with comprehensively under that legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the opinion that Senator Sherry has to wear many things on superannuation and I am sure I will pick it up <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5091"> a little later. With regard to these amendments, I wish to comment on a number of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 1 seeks to require an objective of relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions. It is our contention this is already picked up in 88A(a) in a similar form and also objective 6(1.1) in section 3.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 2 goes well beyond the requirements of the current labour act in requiring the AIRC to provide decent living standards through awards. This appears like a back&hyphen;door way to pre&hyphen;empt the AIRC's decision on the living wage claim and seems a little inappropriate to us in this bill at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 3 we regard as very loose wording, referring to the ability to bargain collectively. As discussed earlier, we believe that this bill provides ample opportunity for collective bargaining. I am not sure who this provision is intended to pick up and, given that uncertainty, we feel it is inappropriate to insert that provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 4 seeks to attach a note. I am sure that the commission is well aware of its decision on the training wage and will take it into account. But given that that decision might be improved or modified over time, it seems inappropriate to us to lock that award into stone in the act by a note.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 5 seeks to insert a note referring to the supported wage decision. Again the commission, I am sure, will take account of this decision. But I would not want to rule out further development of the supported wage system in further decisions by confining it by way of such a note.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 6 we have discussed at length and that is the attempt to substitute pay for remuneration. I want to make a few points if I may. Some would conclude that the Labor senators' intention in entering this debate is either hot air or the desire to deal themselves into the debate. I do not take that view. I think the view is held sincerely and I acknowledge the approach you have taken. But I remind the Senate first that this is an addition to the act. The current directions to the commission on the exercise of its award <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> powers in section 90AA do not include any such object of this part. So we are adding an express requirement on the commission to have regard for this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to further point out that 88B(3)(e) picks up the general prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex as a factor which the commission must have regard to. At present, the only place that scores a mention in the present act is the 150A award modernisation process. So it is my view that the Democrats and the government have improved the current Labor act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that these provisions are talking about award conditions and given the clear meaning that equal pay for work of equal value has held in the commission and its principles since 1969, it is appropriate that it be recognised up front here as still important. And it is important because in the last 10 years of Labor government women made no progress towards equal pay unless that progress was through the AIRC and non&hyphen;political mechanisms.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot even, as a party, do as well as the Liberals on women in parliament. There are only nine out of 28 of you sitting here. You have not got a particularly good record when it comes to advancing the cause of women even in your own representation amongst all these Labor senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1986 the differential between women's and men's earnings was exactly the same as it is now&mdash;in 1986, I say to Labor senators. And all these Labor senators carry on about the rights of women. In its industrial legislation your government failed to deliver any progress after the departure of the much esteemed Senator Susan Ryan. Not just that, but under your model of enterprise bargaining, the gap was widening. Women were recording lower rises on average than men and more pressure was being put on workers with family responsibilities, most of whom were women, due to longer hours and more stressful work. If you read the report from DIR tabled last month and the report from ACCIRT in Sydney or from Gillian Whitehouse in Queensland, you will see that your record is not a good one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the great Sex Discrimination Act which Senator Susan Ryan and Senator Janine <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5092"> Haines steered through this place. But since then, in our view there has been very little progress. Australia, by world standards, through the equal pay for equal work principle in the AIRC, has achieved better female to male wage relativities than countries with more deregulated wage systems. But that was in the 1980s&mdash;and early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since 1986, the progress has basically stopped. And that progress was in your hands, so do not lecture us about equal pay.</PARA>

Obviously, the functions it is exercising must touch on the principle: where the commission is dealing with work and payment for work, it must have regard to equal pay for work of equal value. It does so now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where, however, it is dealing with payments other than payments for work, it must have regard to (e), which is the need to eliminate discrimination on the basis of, amongst other things, sex and family responsibilities. The commission is also required to have regard to the objects of the act under section 90, which include expressly assisting workers to balance their family responsibilities and assisting in giving effect to their international obligations, which include the ILO conventions on equal remuneration and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really believe that, regardless of the sincerity of your views, you are barking up the wrong tree in this one.

<PARA>What we have done in our amendment 3 is add `insert workplace harassment' after `discrimination', and I do not think that is an unreasonable thing to do. It is important that we provide some recognition and some legal remedy in relation to harassment in the workplace. Whilst we see that there are efforts to deal with workplace harassment&mdash;whether it is sexual harassment or harassment of any other kind within the workplace&mdash;there is the necessity, we believe, to be able to get a proper redress under law so that people are not treated unfairly in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to the Senate the inclusion of `workplace harassment'. I would like to see this supported because a number of groups in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5094"> the community&mdash;women's groups, people with non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds and, as I say, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;are looking to make improvements in these areas. I really think we need to move in that direction. Anti&hyphen;discrimination commissions are looking  carefully at issues of workplace harassment but it is not actually covered by the acts as they exist. Because of that, it is difficult for the various bodies to deal with these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like there to be at least recognition that we should have some legal mention of workplace harassment. If we are trying to work towards workplaces that work and that are fair, it is not fair that people could legally, in any sense, continue to harass people in the workplace. Therefore, I would like support for the Greens' amendment to at least include that as something that is not part of what we should see as a good workplace environment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is frequently the case with Senator Margetts, I think her intentions are excellent in moving an amendment to include `workplace harassment' in section 88B, but I do have difficulty in determining how this provision adds to the bill as a whole. All awards will contain an anti-discrimination clause. The bill is full of provisions which deal with express grounds of harassment, such as prohibiting harassments on the ground of membership or non-membership of a union, which are outlawed. Unfair termination is covered. Conditions which are harsh or unjust are expressly covered, and there are processes through HREOC for dealing more appropriately with most harassment cases. I think this amendment&mdash;particularly looking at the definition proposed earlier&mdash;is just too broad and does not add much to the act; therefore, we will oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murray for his contribution, but he has probably given the best explanation of why our amendment is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> necessary. He gave the limits, if you like, to what is covered under the current discrimination clauses, but that does not actually cover harassment. You would have to actually prove that there was a discriminatory decision made, and harassment is not necessarily related to provable discriminatory incidents; harassment is something quite different. Currently, that does not include sexual harassment. Therefore, the fact that somebody has discriminated on the basis of someone's sex is quite different from sexual harassment in the workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess there are certainly people who would be able to give clear evidence of what the difference is between discrimination based on sex and sexual harassment and harassment of other kinds. It is quite different. That is why I read out the definition of why they are different and that is why I still see that what exists does not cover sexual harassment and harassment of other kinds in the workplace. This amendment still deserves the support of the Senate because harassment is not covered in the current bill and it is not covered in the current amendments.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Paragraph 3(e), after "sexual preference", insert "transgender identity,".</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment, which is also on the revised sheet 217, relates to amendment 18 of the government and the Democrats. Paragraph (e) reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the need to prevent and eliminate discrimination because of, or for reasons including, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.</PARA>
<PARA>However, there are still groups in the community who, if you like, fall through the gaps in relation to those categories. In particular, I want to mention our amendment which seeks to include `transgender identity'. Often when you bring up the issue of transgender identity, you get people sniggering and finding reasons for jokes. There are all sorts of interesting responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I want to outline the reason why we have moved this amendment. The main premise for the inclusion of transgender identity in the anti-discrimination provisions contained in the workplace relations bill relies on the element ary legal and human rights premise that all Australian citizens should be afforded equal rights to all Australian law. To continue to deny transgenders equal rights and protection from discrimination on the grounds that anti-discrimination laws are far too costly on business is a nonsense. Besides the fact that the transgender population in Australia is estimated to be no more than about 5,000, financial cost should never be a trade-off for an individual's human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health funded the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transgender lifestyles and HIV/AIDS risk: National transgender HIV/AIDS needs assessment project (Australia)</EMPHASIS>. This report found that the educational levels of transgenders are considerably higher than the national population. Yet in nearly every type of occupation from before to after the gender crossing there is a reduction of between 25 per cent and 50 per cent in work experiences. The exceptions to this trend are in sex work and in pornography, which are often the only options left to many transgenders when they cross the gender line. There is no doubt that the reason for this trend is discrimination. Indeed, every day of their lives, transgenders have to confront an inordinate level of discrimination. The sheer amount of discrimination they consistently face is telling with an estimated 47 per cent suicide rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, no Commonwealth government has afforded transgenders protection from discrimination in either industrial relations law or in anti-discrimination law. There is a legal basis that could be used. In New South Wales the same arguments were recently used and worked for the inclusion of transgender identity in the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1997. The ACLGR believes that the inclusion of transgender identity in the New South Wales Anti&hyphen;Discrimination Act also translated into an automatic inclusion into the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1991, because the Industrial Relations Act refers to the prohibitive conduct conducted in the Anti-Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to see if the parliamentary secretary is able to refute this. There may well be legal precedent. It is now 1996. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5096"> There is no excuse now not to start dealing with these issues which are so blatant in our society. If we separate out a group from society and say, `This group because of their sexual identity is not able to access basic human rights,' then we are to be blamed. On that basis I commend to the chamber this amendment 4 from our new amendments. I hope that people will see in their basic human commonsense that we cannot continue to separate out one group from society and say, `That group is not able to access basic human rights,' which any other group in our society should be able to access.</PARA></SPEECH>

Here we have 5,000 such people in our society and that extraordinary suicide rate approaching 50 per cent. Why is that? It is not because of something in themselves; it is because of something in our society. It is because they are rejected&mdash;not accepted&mdash;and are not given a fair go in our society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to both Senator Margetts and Senator <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Brown and the issues raised are important ones. However, the government will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Margetts for three reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, as Senator Margetts and Senator Brown would know, this issue is currently before a Senate committee. Indeed, the desirability of federal legislation in relation to transgender identity is before that committee. I am sure that Senator Brown and Senator Margetts would understand as much as any other Senator or any person in the broader community that these are matters that deserve detailed consideration. I am sure that those senators who support the aim of this amendment will ensure that it gets that sort of consideration through the committee process and through further deliberation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, as Senator Brown and Senator Margetts would know, there is a private members bill before the Senate dealing with this matter. That is not to say that it precludes, on any legal ground, the matter being dealt with here. Lastly, it is questionable whether the Commonwealth has power to legislate in respect of transgender identity discrimination. The scope for the use of the external affairs power is limited because at this stage there is no international instrument ratified by Australia that refers to the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not treat the matter lightly. We believe that the Senate committee's work is important and that the human rights of the people referred to are important. But so is the detailed consideration, and I do not believe that this is the right place or the right time to deal with this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment seeks to add the new ground of discrimination on the basis of transgender identity. Discrimination on that basis is currently the subject of a private members bill proposed by former Senator Spindler. It has been the subject of considerable debate and media commentary already. The bill is currently before a Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have strongly believed for a long time that discrimination on the basis of transgender identity should be outlawed. However, we believe that it is appropriate that this issue be fully debated by the Senate as part of former Senator Spindler's bill. We will pursue appropriate amendments, if needed, arising out of consideration of that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that the proper place to introduce such a ground is in the more important Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. While we have enormous sympathy with this amendment, for the good arguments and good reasons already expressed by both the government and the opposition, regrettably we have come to the conclusion that it would be premature to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we could probably call this amendment the Sid Spindler amendment. The fact that there is a private members bill dealing with this matter before the Senate is no reason the issues cannot be dealt with in other bills. That has never been the case in the past. This matter is relevant to the bill and this is the right place in the bill to be debating it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument about Commonwealth powers was spurious. A number of federal powers, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> including the corporations power, have been used to put this bill together. It has not worried the government in the past that their legislative actions have not accorded with ILO conventions. It is interesting that Senator Campbell is concerned with ILO conventions now but does not necessarily think that ILO conventions should be followed in all aspects of the bill. Obviously, there will be various legal opinions on whether this bill in total, when it passes, accords with ILO conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is necessary that we deal with this issue at some stage. I am absolutely certain that the structure of this bill and the way it is being put through will mean that at some time in the future we will be required to revisit workplace relations. There will be things that simply do not work or which are so embarrassing that we will have to come back here in pretty short time. So I will store up all the kind comments about people giving due consideration to this matter after the committee's deliberations. I give notice that I will be seeking to divide on this issue because, for at least 5,000 people in our community, it is a vital one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I promise that the next time we have an industrial relations bill&mdash;to fix up the errors in this one&mdash;I will move the amendment again. At that stage, we might have the chance to look at the issues and consider the report of the committee and, hopefully, support what is an important issue of basic human rights for a sector of our community.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment proposes the omission of section 89A and the substitution of new section 89A. Subsection 89A(2) adds two new allowable award matters&mdash;superannuation, at paragraph 89A(2)(s), and protection of outworkers, at paragraph 89A(2)(t). Three existing allowable award matters are amended. Proposed paragraph 89A(2)(a) is amended to include skill based career paths and proposed paragraph 89A(2)(b) is amended to include specific reference to rest breaks, notice periods and variations to working hours. Proposed paragraph 89A(2)(g) is amended to include cultural leave, which covers such leave as ceremonial leave for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Expansion of the allowable award matters to include superannuation and protection for outworkers strengthens the award safety net. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5100"> Other amendments clarify existing allowable award matters by including variations to working hours, rest breaks, skill based career paths and cultural leave. The allowable award matters are wide ranging and will permit all key entitlements to be included in awards, thereby providing a basis for comprehensive safety net protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each award need not include provisions dealing with every allowable matter. Not all matters will be relevant to all circumstances. The point is, however, that there is an extensive range of key entitlements which may be the subject of an industrial dispute and be dealt with by the commission exercising its arbitral powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Opponents of the government's legislation have engaged in a scare campaign wrongly asserting that a number of the matters will not be allowable award matters. While I do not wish to get into a protracted debate about whether or not particular matters come within the scope of allowable award matters&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because we have had quite extensive debate on that already. The government has included accident make up pay within proposed new paragraph 89A(2)(j) which covers allowances. Secondly, paid maternity leave, proposed new paragraphs 89A(2)(c) and 89A(2)(h), which provide for rates of pay and maternity leave respectively, would permit award provisions dealing with paid maternity leave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some existing award matters are not covered, for the most part, these are matters that would be more appropriately addressed through agreements. It is also important to note that, in exceptional circumstances, non&hyphen;allowable matters can be arbitrated. If in particular circumstances the exclusion of a non&hyphen;allowable award matter from the scope of arbitration would result in a harsh or unjust outcome, arbitration will be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As indicated in the proposed amendment circulated earlier, the government and the Australian Democrats propose that subsection 89A(3) be amended to omit the words `or vary'. This is a technical amendment to better reflect what has been the government's stated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intention in this area; that is, that the timing and process for the conversion of paid rates to minimum rates awards should be a matter for the commission. It is the government's expectation that, over time, paid rates awards will become minimum rates awards, with actual wages and conditions being a matter for enterprise agreements. Under the general award system established under section 89A, there would be no new paid rates awards. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will apply the same rules to all existing awards, be they minimum or paid rates, in their background. This includes the application of award simplification to all awards in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to regular part-time employment, new provisions are added to free up access to part-time employment and enhance protection for part-time employees. New subsection 89A(4)(a) makes it clear that awards may specify a minimum number of consecutive hours that a regular part-time employee may be required to work or include provisions facilitating a regular pattern in the hours worked by such employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned earlier, the amendments include a definition of the term `regular part-time employee'. This is an employee who has reasonably predictable hours of work and receives on a pro rata basis equivalent pay and conditions to those specified in an award or awards for full-time employees who do the same kind of work. These amendments reinforce our desired emphasis on the regularity and predictability of working hours for part-time employees and reinforces the distinction between casual and part-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 26 and 30 also deal with regular part-time employment. Proposed subsection 143(1)(c) and items 43 and 45 require the commission, as part of the award simplification process, to include, where appropriate, award provisions enabling regular part-time employment. They are the incidental and necessary provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsection 89A(5) is amended to provide that awards may include provisions which are incidental to the allowable award matters and necessary rather than essential, as previously <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5101"> proposed, for the effective operation of the award. A matter that is included in an award under this provision must be both incidental to and allowable and necessary for the effective operation of the award. This would allow the inclusion in awards of provisions that are necessary for the effective operation of an allowable award matter but would ensure that the scope of allowable award matters is not expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to exceptional matters orders, subsection 89A(1) limits the AIRC's arbitral and award making powers to the specified allowable award matters. However, the government and Democrats recognise that there may be some exceptional non-allowable matters in relation to which, in the absence of the parties being able to reach agreement, it may be appropriate for the commission to exercise its arbitral powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New subsection 89A(6) provides for limited access to arbitration in relation to exceptional non-allowable award matters in relation to which the parties are unable to reach agreement. Before resorting to arbitration, the commission must be satisfied that, firstly, a party to the dispute has  made a genuine attempt to reach agreement on the exceptional matter and that there is no reasonable prospect of agreement being reached by conciliation; that is at paragraphs (a) and (b). Secondly, it must be satisfied that it is appropriate to settle the matter by arbitration; that is, the matter would not be better dealt with, for example, through agreements at the workplace or enterprise level and/or the matter is not otherwise dealt with by legislation; that is at paragraph (c). Finally, the issues involved must be exceptional and there would be a harsh or unjust outcome if the matter were not settled by arbitration; that is found at paragraphs (d) and (e).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Matters relating to the orders which may be made in connection with exceptional matters are set out in amendment 23, which proposes new subsection 120A. These provisions are designed to act as a safeguard against harsh and unjust outcomes, which might result if an exceptional matter could not be resolved by arbitration. At the same time, they make clear that their application will be confined to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exceptional cases. This is consistent with the legislation's shift in focus to determining matters by agreement at the workplace or enterprise level, with awards providing a safety net of minimum conditions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor opposes this provision particularly strongly. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 introduces a provision which, as has been outlined, confines the scope of industrial issues and, therefore, the commission's award making power. There were originally 18 allowable matters. There are now 20, and that will go back to 19 at some point in the future when the superannuation provisions are removed. It also requires the commission to make only minimum rates awards and prohibits the commission from regulating the number of part-time and casual employees and the maximum hours worked by part-time employees. In the amendments that we will get to a little later, we delete these restrictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to allowable matters, this provision will preclude the commission from making awards about important conditions of employment, such as breaks between shifts, spans of hours and manning hours, termination change and redundancy, protective clothing, study leave, training and occupational health and safety. They are some examples. All of these matters will have to be determined by agreement between the employer and the employee. We assert very strongly that this concept of allowable matters should not exist at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to minimum rate awards, this provision will preclude the commission from making paid rate awards. These awards are very important in industries where collective bargaining is not socially desirable&mdash;examples include nursing, teaching and public service&mdash;or has the potential to be harmful, such as in the airline and oil industries. This provision will preclude the commission from limiting the number of part-time or casual employees in the work force. This creates the potential for the increased casualisation of the work force. As to hours of part-time employees, this will preclude the commission from guaranteeing hours of work in respect of part- <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5102">timers in a number of significant areas. This will cause greater uncertainty in working hours from day to day and week to week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a great deal of rhetoric from the government about the need for certainty in the work force. At the same time, we have heard in their rhetoric a great deal about the need for flexibility. The reality in this part-time-casual area is that the employer determines the hours of work&mdash;that is the bottom line&mdash;and will have much greater `freedom' to determine the hours of work without the matter going before the commission. The concept that casual or part&hyphen;time employees can sit down and pick and choose their hours of work is an absolute myth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It very rarely happens in my experience and I can say that I have had contact with literally thousands of casual and part&hyphen;time employees in my years in the industrial area. The employer has a requirement for labour; they roster labour at times when it is most efficient for their work operation. That is what they do. If the employee is not prepared to fit into those rostered hours as demanded by the employer, the employee does not work. I really do get very concerned about the perpetual myths that are peddled by the government in this area and that apparently have been accepted by the Australian Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst on the Australian Democrats, and in concluding my remarks on this section of the bill prior to some of my colleagues making comments, I would like to draw the Committee's attention to a speech made by Senator Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats. It was to the Australian Education Union. We will see whether the Australian Education Union is so keen on the Australian Democrats after the passage of this bill. The speech does contain some interesting references to this issue of section 89 and allowable matters. I do not know whether Senator Murray has read this speech. On page 6 of the speech it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second area we are concerned about is the proposal to pare back awards. While the Democrats support the cooperative modernisation of awards, the stripping of awards by legislation as proposed <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by Peter Reith would be unacceptable to many Australian workers and businesses who rely on the award system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Commission precluded from settling industrial issues which cannot be incorporated into an award, lengthy industrial disputation might prove the only way unions are left with of finding a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many small business employers also rely on the award to tell them what they should pay or do as a good employer, and the stripping back of the award system will make personnel management issues that much harder for them.</PARA>
<PARA>A little later, Senator Kernot reminded the Australian Education Union:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, Mr Howard said workers `will be given the choice to remain with the current award system', and that `no worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her Award conditions taken away.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, Mr Reith's bill proposes stripping awards back to just 18 conditions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>now 20, to go back to 19 at some future date&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in a year and a half. Workers will lose access to dozens of current award entitlements, particularly workers on paid rates awards such as teachers, nurses and police.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet Mr Reith's bill dramatically reduces the power of the AIRC to arbitrate to resolve industrial disputes, reduced from a general power to just 22 specified areas of jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Kernot, that was on 15 June 1996. My, my, hasn't the world changed for the Australian Democrats. Senator Kernot went off to the Australian Education Union, anxious to roam the country grandstanding about concern for workers, like a number of her colleagues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the comments made by Senator Sherry with respect to this amendment, one which we are very strongly opposed to. I would say that this is, if not the matter of gravest concern, certainly up there with one or two other matters that I believe are the most serious aspects of this legislation which will take the position of award workers back many, many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, having heard the quotes from Senator Kernot just read out by Senator Sherry and having participated in some part of the inquiry, which Senator Murray was involved in right throughout, I really cannot understand why the Democrats have caved in on this issue. Of all the issues for the Democrats to cave in on, this has to be the one on which they have really let down the low&hyphen;paid and the industrially weak workers of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a couple of comments and then I want to put a couple of questions to the parliamentary secretary and Senator Murray. As Senator Sherry pointed out, the one thing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you need in an award system is certainty&mdash;and that is what we have in the award system today under the federal jurisdiction. Also, under the federal award system for a number of years now there has been a system in place whereby the party to an award, operating under the jurisdiction of the commission, would review their award. Those parties would come to a determination, either by agreement or through the arbitral process, as to how their awards should be modernised and simplified&mdash;one of the major developments in award regulation in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That process has been well under way and has been very successful. Let me give just one illustration. Two of the major protagonists in industrial relations in this country, the National Farmers Federation and the AWU, are now in a position where they have established a committee and they are negotiating the reform of the pastoral industry award, one of the first awards of this commission. If they can do it around the negotiating table then anyone can do it. That demonstrates that the system, as it currently is, is working with the assistance of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what we have here is the government jumping in in the middle of the game, changing the score line and putting the workers 50 or 100 points behind in the match because this legislation, by the stroke of a pen&mdash;notwithstanding the so&hyphen;called safeguards&mdash;will remove substantial award provisions from many awards. It appears that the government thinks that these clauses are not all that important, that they are mere rhetoric or mere verbiage, outdated or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have taken it upon themselves&mdash;and it is clear now that the Democrats agree with them&mdash;to say that the people who should decide what should be in awards and what should not be in awards in this country are not the employees, the employers or the Industrial Relations Commission; they are the government and the Democrats. Yet, at the same time, we hear all this rhetoric about allowing employers and employees to have a greater opportunity to negotiate, to be more involved in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear this rhetoric about choice; but these employees and employers have not been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5104"> given any choice. The people who have made the agreement are the government and the Democrats. They have made an agreement to say what you can have in your award and what you cannot have. No amount of fobbing off with references to where there is a power for the commission to rule on issues that are incidental to the 18 or 20 allowable matters can deny that fact. There is a proposed power for the commission to rule in exceptional circumstances where something is deemed to be harsh and unjust after the employers and employees, the unions and the organisations have exhausted themselves negotiating. The commission can then apparently step in and sort it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, you might comment on the fact that given your party was opposed to this provision&mdash;and I believe quite rightly opposed, as we are, because this gets down to a denial of natural justice to the very workers and employers who are supposed to have a say in this system, and it is a restriction on the right of the commission to oversee the simplification of awards in this country&mdash;you have now reached an agreement in secret and you have decided to add two provisions. Why did you pick those two provisions and no others?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On what basis did you conclude that it was in the interests of the workers of this country to choose the issues that you added in, neglecting all the others? What hypocrisy; what a patronising attitude. Senator Murray, you might comment on why it was that you agreed to put those two in, leaving all the others out. We will come back to point out to you many provisions in awards which you may not think are all that important, but the participants in the industry do&mdash;and Senator Sherry has referred to some of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to the government and ask them to look at their own policy document, Better pay for better work, the policy document upon which this legislation is based and what you say you have a mandate for. In the executive summary, on the first page, you say, `The award system will be simplified under the supervision of the AIRC.' There is no mention anywhere in this document that specific <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provisions in awards will be removed by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere in that document did you ever say before the election that you would legislate to do this. You said it would be a process of simplification under the supervision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Now what we have is the government, in collusion with the Democrats, doing the simplification on their terms, then allowing a little bit of light for the parties to go away and argue for clauses to be put back into awards, creating a great deal of uncertainty and concern out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not have to believe me. Go and talk to employers out there in industries who will acknowledge they do not know whether some provisions will fit into the 18 allowable matters or not. It would have been far more appropriate to have left the system as it was, to have left the awards in place, to have left the clauses in those awards, which, in many cases, have been determined by arbitration or by consent, and to have allowed the processes of the commission, through conciliation and arbitration, to have simplified and modernised those awards. And that was happening. I quote further from your policy where, on page 1 of the introduction, you state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more flexible industrial relations system will increase productivity, achieve faster real growth in wages and profits and, most importantly, create more real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no flexibility in this section of the act at all. You are just removing, in a blanket manner, clauses of awards and then saying to the participants, `You have to go out and get them back in.' That is not flexibility; that is highway robbery. But you also go on further to state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For employees who would choose to have their wages and conditions determined by an award, the award system will be made much more flexible. We will encourage less complex awards.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not encouragement. You are not saying to the parties, `We want you to continue a process of modernising.' You are saying, `This is what you can have, and you can't have the rest in an award unless you can fit yourself in under the special circumstances provision. But you may be able to have it in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5105"> an agreement if you can convince the employer to reach an agreement with you, notwithstanding that you have had it as a legal entitlement for years and years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I ask the parliamentary secretary to tell us how this provision in the bill is consistent with the policy and the guarantees you gave that the simplification process would be supervised by the commission and that you never said that you would simplify 90 per cent or 100 per cent through legislation. I will leave my remarks at that point. I have some further remarks to make as we get further into this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

But the concept of trying to get awards simplified and reduced to a set of core pay and conditions standards is not a matter that is particularly controversial between our two parties. It was very much what former Prime Minister Paul Keating had in mind when he made his address to, I think, the company directors association after the 1993 election, and it was at the heart of the principles of the Brereton bill back in 1993&hyphen;94.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a lot of people do want is more regularity of hours, and I think there is an agreement between our two great parties on that matter: that people would like regularity of hours.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that Labor Party senators should say that they are so averse to this casualisation of the work force&mdash;and surely we should be averse to it if we think those people who are working on a casual basis would prefer to work as permanent part time, part time or full time. People should be aware that under the previous government, particularly between the years 1984 and 1992, the ABS labour force survey released in August 1994, I understand, showed that something like 23.7 per cent of all employees when that survey was taken&mdash;and it may indeed have increased since then&mdash;were employed on a casual basis in their main job. So it is an enormous part of the work force. We all agree, I am sure, that many of that 23.7 per cent of the work force as at August 1994 may well have chosen not to be casual and to have more regularity of hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the private sector, the increase in the number of people working casual in their main job between those years, 1984 to 1992, the halcyon years of Labor under Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, was actually 72 per cent&mdash;a massive increase under Labor.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to ask the parliamentary secretary to define `reasonably predictable' in relation to part-time workers. Can the parliamentary secretary tell us in detail what `reasonably predictable' means? Is the criteria for deciding reasonableness from the perspective of the employer or the employee? Couldn't many employers argue that it is unreasonable for them to be expected to predict their staffing requirements more than a week in advance? How much notice can part&hyphen;timers expect to receive of their shifts? How much notice can part-timers expect to receive if an employer intends to drop their hours from 20 per week to four per week? Can Senator Campbell explain to us exactly how `reasonably predictable hours' differentiates part-timers from casuals? Why would employers employ someone full time and permanently when they can have this sort of flexibility? The Democrats might be well meaning in their inclusion of `pro rata benefits' in the definition of part-time work. How much do pro rata benefits mean to someone who is employed for six hours per week?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clauses 89A(4)(a) and 89A(4)(b) allow for whole industries to become casualised or to use only part-time workers. We heard evidence before the economics committee of the difficulties and disadvantages that part-time and casual workers face right across Australia. Senator Campbell, can you tell us, given that section 89A(4)(a) prevents the Industrial Relations Commission from determining the number of casual or part-time workers in a workplace, what will prevent industries such as the banking industry and the hospitality industry&mdash;which already have high proportions of casual and part-time workers&mdash;dispensing with full-time permanent employees altogether? What will happen to employees in those industries who wish to work full time? Will they have to change jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Brisbane we heard evidence from a Mrs McShane, the manager of a suburban bank branch, of high staff turnover due to inadequate income because of too few hours of work. She said it was the major reason staff <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> left her bank. Doesn't this contravene the intention of the bill at schedule 1, section 3A, as amended by the coalition&hyphen;Democrat deal, of creating a flexible and fair labour market? What is fair about not getting enough work to live on? What is fair about hours being changed once an employee has accepted a job? That certainly will happen under this section. Won't employers favour the increased flexibility of having a largely casualised or flexible part-time work force? Won't this outweigh any consideration of providing a stable work environment for employees or a living wage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell, do you claim that this legislation will prevent increased casualisation and substitute in its place increased part-time work? Is that the reason for reducing protections for part-time workers? Senator Chapman asked Professor McCallum this question during the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in a number of awards . . . the existing minimum hours requirement has resulted in casualisation of the work&hyphen;force rather than permanent part-time employment? Would you accept that the aim of this legislation in removing those hours restriction is to stop that casualisation developing and allow for permanent part-time employment with the relevant pro rata benefits therefore being available that are not often available under the casual aspect?</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't it true, Senator Campbell, that awards could provide for casuals to have pro rata entitlements under the current legislation? It is more a matter of reducing protections for part-timers than increasing protections for casuals, isn't it? Doesn't this legislation force workers to face the insecurity of casual work, with none of the financial rewards traditionally associated with that insecurity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission is allowed to regulate the minimum number of consecutive hours an employee may be asked to work but is not allowed to regulate the maximum or minimum number of total hours&mdash;that is, shifts per week&mdash;an employee may be asked to work. The coalition&hyphen;Democrat deal addresses one concern&mdash;that of maximum number of hours worked in one shift. That is an improvement. Employers cannot force workers to work 16&hyphen;hour shifts. I acknowledge that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the evidence of Mr Joe De Bruyn. He is not in parliament yet, but he has colleagues here.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that even major retailers, such as David Jones, were exploiting their part-timers by working them up to 37&half; hours per week, but not 38, just to avoid giving them a rostered day off.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the evidence of the union's secretary. Doesn't the failure of 89A(4)(b) to allow the commission to set maximum and minimum hours leave the way open for just this sort of exploitation? Senator Campbell, I challenge you to prove that will not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cannot employers give part&hyphen;time workers half a day per week through the year and then expect employees to work six days per week at Christmas or some other busy period, or the reverse? Can you show me and the chamber the clause in the legislation which prevents an employer employing a part&hyphen;time worker for four days per week, then reducing the employee's hours to half a day per week?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Under your previous act which you are defending here&mdash;the tried and failed one&mdash;the massive casualisation of the Australian workplace occurred.

We had quite an exciting time thereafter when the matter was debated. I just remind him that the minor parties did produce joint amendments on the Native Title Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

Joint amendments have been considered under the land fund bill, and I refer you to the 53 amendments moved jointly with the ALP government to the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1995. Joint amendments are not an unusual parliamentary device, Senator Forshaw. I am sure that it has just slipped your memory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, you referred to consultation. Let me go through the range of consultation just in case you have slipped in the debate. There were 1,431 submissions both read and referred to by us, and hopefully by you. There were 18 days of public hearings. We have had numerous private consultations with employees and employer organisations. We have had numerous items of correspondence from them. We have also consulted as long or maybe longer with the ACTU concerning this bill as we have with the government. We have consulted at length with Professor Ron McCallum. We have consulted at length with the author of the New South Wales bill. So please do not give the audience to which you are talking the wrong impression that we have not considered this matter at great length. I appreciate that you do not agree with us, but we have done a very detailed and considered job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been persuaded by many of these experts, many of whom happen to sit on your side of the political fence, that the amended section 89A will pick up the full range of award matters, while the transitional arrangements provide a more effective means to simplify and modernise awards than section 150A of the current Labor act.

One is the issue of privacy, and I note that the department has paid attention to the need for privacy in the area of data matching and has, according to this report, taken note of what the Privacy Commissioner says. The idea of this program is to see what payments are made and whether any payments have been made other than in accordance with the act. It is good to see that, as a result of that, the number of cases found is very small. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5112"> Indeed, as far as criminal prosecutions go, only two cases have been successfully prosecuted during the period with which this report deals.</PARA>

<PARA>The importance of the rural adjustment scheme would be well known to some senators. The rural adjustment scheme is very important in the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment, particularly in my state of Queensland. The problem that we have with ongoing drought is very severe. Some people may not be aware, but there are areas of Queensland that are still substantially in drought. Even in areas where people have come out of drought, the effects of drought last a lot longer than the drought itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, it might be the case that an area has undergone such a substantial period of drought that when the rains do come there is no ordinary grass coverage. The consequence of that is that noxious weeds come up very quickly. With no grass to choke them out, the properties become weed infested. In other words, they suffer environmental damage from drought. In other cases, prolonged periods of drought might mean that when you have feed on the ground, the feed does not have a lot of nutrition in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But by far the greatest problem that confronts primary producers is that of dealing with the debt caused by drought, and dealing with the process of building up a herd or building up a flock. When you have drought, especially when it extends across the whole state, it is very difficult to find good agistment for animals. Often you have to destock in order to preserve what you have in your pasture and in order to ensure that the stock you do have has a chance of getting through the drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many primary producers have been involved in destocking&mdash;not by choice but out of necessity&mdash;in order to make sure that their properties, and whatever animals they have, get through the drought. It may be some substantial period of time before it is possible for a property to get back to a normal level of production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, say you were a wool grower and you have been substantially affected by drought, you might not have as many sheep as you would normally have. So, although the drought ends and you get some feed, you are confronted by two things. First of all, your wool is not as fine because the sheep are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eating better and so the wool tends to go out to a thicker micron. The other problem is that you still do not have enough sheep to meet all the operating costs. You might have only half the number of sheep you ordinarily run so you are getting only half the amount of wool. You might also find that the wool is uneven in quality so the value of the wool is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, when confronted with the end of the drought in some areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales, was faced with a problem: do we just cut off the drought assistance altogether or do we say that we will extend the drought assistance to help those people affected? This is where the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council has played a role. But much of the work is that of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, in dealing with the problem and recognising that there are ongoing effects of drought that are not relieved by the first fall of rain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We feel very pleased that the minister has been able to unveil a scheme which, over the next three years, will add some $180 million of assistance to primary producers who have been affected by drought. This is a sign of the real commitment that the coalition government has to people in rural and regional Australia. I hasten to say that this is $180 million of commitment which was not in the budget left by the previous government; it was not in the forward estimates. This is money we have put up because of our desperate concern to ensure that people on the land not only survive the drought but also get a bit of a breathing space in order to improve their financial position and to build up the capacity of their properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is important because those people employ workers&mdash;if they are in the wool industry they employ shearers&mdash;and the money they spend in rural and remote towns goes to ensure that shopkeepers, publicans, barmaids, waiters and a range of other people all have jobs in town. We are very pleased with this measure. It is a sign of the commitment we have made.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with everything that Senator O'Chee has said about the rural adjustment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5114"> scheme and I commend the report of the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council to the Senate. I was involved in the inquiry into the rural adjustment scheme, RAS, that was held about two years ago. Its terms of reference were framed by Senator Boswell, and I commend him for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a bit disappointed in the report of that inquiry inasmuch as it picked up a lot of what RAS does and endorsed it but it was quite clear from the inquiry that RAS does not go far enough. Both the previous and present government need to extend RAS. There are many issues it does not address and one of those is the issue of bank debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that this issue is of as particular interest to Senator O'Chee as it is to me. We are simply not addressing the problem of debt in rural areas. Until we get some way of breaking the cycle of rural debt, drought or no drought&mdash;indeed, despite any other issue rural people are facing&mdash;they will never be able to get above their problems. That will be so unless that debt is addressed in a much more creative way than it is presently being addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, let me congratulate the government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, on the announcement yesterday of further funding for drought relief, particularly in my state of Queensland. I am pleased that the minister has been able to secure that funding. I congratulate him. Where credit is due I try to give it. I am quite sure that he had to fight pretty hard to get that funding. Let us put on the record the Australian Democrats' support for the minister in securing that funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of issues related to drought that are being raised, particularly by people like Noel Kennedy, one of the Queensland representatives on the Wool Council. As Senator O'Chee pointed out, the downgrading of flocks in western Queensland has been very significant. In the Winton area, where Noel Kennedy has his property, I understand that the flock has declined from around three million sheep to around one million. Although they have had rain in the Winton&hyphen;Hughenden area, the problem is what to do to restock those areas if you simply do not have the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> funds or have such a massive debt over your head that it is impossible to borrow any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend Noel Kennedy for a scheme that he has started to put together. He is trying to say to governments that there really needs to be an investment by state and federal governments in sheep areas so that we can put back into these areas the number of sheep that are needed so that the investment in these areas can bear fruit in the future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to discuss the National Board of Employment, Education and Training's annual report for 1995&hyphen;96. As many senators would be aware, this government has moved to, in fact, abolish the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, so I imagine this would be one of the last reports&mdash;if not the last report&mdash;we would see from this particular body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the abolition of NBEET is of particular concern as the function of the national board is to develop advice on a range of employment, education and training areas, ranging from vocational education through to schools, and language and literacy policies. It has a number of boards that tie into its functions, including the Australian Research Council, the Higher Education Council, language and literacy boards, Schools Council, the Australian International Education Foundation&mdash;all providing fundamental cross&hyphen;sectoral advice to this government as they have to previous governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, the abolition of the board has been looked into by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Overwhelmingly, groups who were present, including the chair of NBEET, members from the National Union of Students, the National Tertiary Education Union, provided <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5115"> evidence and advice that NBEET should stay. They pointed out that NBEET provided relevant, independent as well as much needed advice to governments of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of NBEET also comes at a time when education in this country is being shaken up by the coalition government. This is not just in higher education, but across the board. We have heard in this place, recently, that language and literacy programs are all under review. In fact, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has announced that there will be a major review&mdash;a major independent assessment&mdash;of higher education in this country. So I ask: would it not be more appropriate to defer such abolition or restructuring of a body like NBEET until&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion, not including the assessment of the views of the service providers as a KPI in the assessment of Medicare is an unacceptable omission. It appears to me that the exclusion of the assessment of the views of the service providers can only be interpreted as strongly suggesting an unwillingness on the part of the department to consider any view that may differ from its own predetermined policy. Assessment of the views of service providers should be regarded as a standard modern management practice. Routine assessment of the providers' opinions concerning the program could help to reveal both strengths and weaknesses. In reply to a question I put on notice about including the views of the providers as a KPI of the Medicare <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> program, the department made the following reply:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department does not believe that the views of providers is an appropriate performance indicator as clearly there would be many cases where the interests and satisfaction of providers would not coincide with the objectives of the programme.</PARA>
<PARA>I have written to Dr Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Family Services, expressing my concern that the performance indicators of Medicare did not include as a KPI an assessment of the views of the medical profession as service providers. I have requested that Dr Wooldridge give consideration to issuing a ministerial directive that provider assessment be made a key performance indicator of the Medicare program in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter which concerned me was that, during the estimates hearings, a senior departmental official suggested that each additional GP in practice costs Medicare $176,000 per year in rebates paid out due to the fact that doctors encourage patients who are not really sick to see them. He said that doctors were encouraging patients to return for more visits than were really necessary. Furthermore, I was concerned that a little later in the proceedings another health department official stated that general practitioners encourage patients with colds to come and see them, clearly implying that GPs are routinely overservicing by encouraging visits from patients with the most minor of complaints. As I said, the clear implication of this remark was that GPs are overservicing to generate extra income by getting patients with trivial illnesses to come and see them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These remarks struck me as being extremely cynical and an unacceptable reflection on the professional integrity of medical general practitioners. In my experience of 20 years as a general practitioner, I have found GPs to be a group of hardworking, dedicated, professional people. As I said, I was profoundly disturbed by the cynical attitudes towards GPs exhibited by the senior officials of the Department of Health and Family Services at the estimates hearings. This is a very serious matter that should concern the Senate. Health services are very important to members of the community. The public expects there to be a harmonious and cooperative partnership <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5118"> between the bureaucrats administering the health system and the service providers who, in this case, are the general practitioners of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an enormous level of dissatisfaction among GPs in this country. This was revealed in a 1995 Australian National University epidemiology unit survey of GPs across Australia. There were 2,165 GPs in the survey who, on average, had been in practice for 15 years, 95 per cent of whom were vocationally registered. I had this report tabled in the estimates hearings. Senators will no doubt be concerned to learn that the report showed that 76.3 per cent of GPs were disillusioned and that 83.7 per cent cited poor remuneration as a factor in this. A figure of 34.4 per cent of GPs said that they would leave general practice immediately if they could, and 94.6 per cent felt that their contribution to Australian medicine was not valued by the government. From my impressions at the Senate estimates hearings, one would have no alternative but to conclude that the doctors were quite correct in their perception that their contribution to Australian medicine appears to be undervalued, at least by the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to put on record in the Senate my view that the department cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand call upon GPs to practise better medicine and then on the other criticise them when they comply with that request. In the interests of thoroughness, GPs cannot spend more time with patients, resulting in having longer consultations, ordering more tests, writing more prescriptions and making more selective referrals. only to have the most senior officials of the department cynically criticise them for overservicing. I request that the ANU survey be tabled and incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Preliminary Report on the Future Role and Operation of Australian General Practice</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A questionnaire on the future role and operation of Australian general practice was circulated with the August 4th 1995 edition of the Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Doctor. 2187 completed questionnaires were returned by the end of October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The circulation list for the Australian Doctor which contained the questionnaire included 16,900 `general practitioners in private practice'. A follow&hyphen;up telephone survey showed this list to be outdated, inaccurate and somewhat duplicated, with 30 per cent of the doctors listed not responding on the given telephone number, no longer in practice or away for an extended period. The estimated response rate is therefore approximately 18.5 per cent. However, the profile of responding GPs on a range of socio&hyphen;demographic and practice characteristics was not significantly different from non&hyphen;respondents interviewed in the telephone survey. The profile of respondents to this survey was also remarkably consistent with that of a similar survey conducted in 1991, results of which are incorporated in `W(h)ither Australian General Practice' (NCEPH discussion paper No. 1, 1991), and with the profile of Australian GPs obtained from HIC data. The profile of respondents to the 1991 and the 1995 surveys indicates that respondents are broadly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5119"> representative of the general practice community in Australia. Representativeness aside, the results of the survey reflect the opinions of a considerable proportion of Australian GPs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of the survey are currently being explored in a number of themes, and we anticipate publishing a number of reports. This preliminary report is being widely distributed both to those who participated in the survey and requested copies of the results, and to various stakeholder organisations. There is no copyright to the information.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1I4">Senator McKIERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very good year, Senator McGauran. It was certainly good for Australia that I came here, I know that. The Employers Federation of Western Australia are still clapping their hands. They made a very wise choice in selecting me to come here&mdash;for the grand sum of &pound;10 for me, &pound;10 for my wife, and one son who did not have to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I have a vested interest in the debate that was taking place in the other place yesterday&mdash;firstly, as a migrant to this country who took out citizenship and, secondly, as a person who chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Migration inquiring into the Citizenship Act. Its report, which was presented to the parliament in September 1994, was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australians all: enhancing Australian citizenship</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further to that, I played a small part in collecting signatures on petitions right around Australia to get the then government to change the oath that Australian residents had to take when they became citizens. Until Australia Day 1994, new citizens had to swear an oath of loyalty to the Queen, her heirs and successors. The then government changed that to a new pledge, which came into effect for the first time on Australia Day in 1994, which read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward [under God],</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and whose laws I will uphold and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs&mdash;as it used to be&mdash;produced this pamphlet which is given to every new citizen at citizenship ceremonies held throughout the country, not only on Australia Day but on other days of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very surprised to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard,</EMPHASIS> when I went to check some of the words attributed to Ms Hanson in the article, that my local member of parliament, the member for Moore, Mr Paul Filing, proposed to second this motion to strengthen the oath. Mr Filing was a member of the coalition parties in opposition who opposed the new citizenship pledge and citizenship oath that came into being in January 1994. Mr Filing now, as an Independent member of parliament, obviously has seen some light and wants to move to strengthen things. He did refer to the fact that during the election campaign the coalition said that they would be addressing the matter of citizenship if they were re&hyphen;elected to office.</PARA>
<PARA>I recall that, during a major outlook conference in Adelaide in February last year of the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research, the then shadow minister for immigration, when questioned on what the coalition in government would do with the Citizenship Act, prevaricated on whether they might indeed seek to return to a pledge of loyalty to the Queen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that happens, or is going to be proposed in the new citizenship council, which was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5126"> announced by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, I think in the budget speech, at a cost over three years of $700,000, they will get bitter resistance from this side of the chamber and, I suggest, from the community as a whole, apart from a few individuals around the place. We will not revert back, and the Australian population will not allow the government to revert back, to the colonial days. I have great hopes that the current minister will not want to do that. When I referred to the shadow minister before, it was not the current minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article on Ms Hanson in the newspaper is indeed interesting. What motivated me to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, among many other things I have had to read during the day, was the very last line of the article which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal backbencher Trish Worth said Ms Hanson was ignorant.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fairly strong language which, after reading Ms Hanson's comments, I wholeheartedly endorse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Ms Hanson, in what she said in the other place yesterday, is certainly ignorant of what becoming an Australian citizen means. I am really surprised at Mr Filing. I have sat on the stage at the ceremonies in the city of Wanneroo back home and have felt the feelings of individuals as they took the pledge or swore an oath to become citizens of Australia. We know what the feeling is and what a commitment those people are making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ms Hanson has not been doing her job as a member of parliament in one sense, in that she has not, to my knowledge, attended a citizenship ceremony. If she has, she would not have made the comments that she made in the House of Representatives yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I saw Ms Hanson today on the monitor and she was reading a speech. It is not allowed here and I am not doing it tonight. I very rarely do. So maybe she was just reading somebody else's words. She might have attended citizenship ceremonies but, for whatever reason, was reading something that somebody else had prepared for her. I think it is very unfortunate that something that is as precious as what we are talking about&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian citizenship for migrants&mdash;can be treated in such a manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is suggested in the revised citizenship pledge proposed by Ms Hanson and Mr Filing does not detract from the pledge; it probably would strengthen it. But it should be strengthened out there in the community. Let us talk to the migrants. What Ms Hanson really should be addressing, if she wants to change things, is her own commitment to this place. When she was sworn in here&mdash;or indeed when I was sworn in here as a senator&mdash;we had to say the following, `We swear we will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, so help me God'&mdash;a colonial thing that we as members of parliament have to swear to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why attack new citizens in the manner that Ms Hanson has sought to attack them? Why is she allowing herself to be used in the manner in which it appears she is allowing herself to be used? I hope that the Independent member for Moore, my local member, will wake up to what is happening around here and will, in the very near future, divorce himself from her actions, because she is bringing Australia into disrepute not only in the region in which we live but with her own constituents and residents.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TITLE>Housing for People with Disabilities</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="5126" TIME="7.37 p.m." SPEAKER="Allison, Sen Lyn" NAMEID="1M6" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME>
<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.37 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to draw the attention of my fellow senators to the chronic shortage of housing for people with disabilities. People with disabilities are amongst the most disadvantaged group in this country. Not only do they suffer from the kind of discrimination and isolation which comes largely from a public ignorance and misunderstanding of their disabilities, but they also suffer the effects of acute reticence on the part of state and federal governments to take on the issues which affect them so seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my goals during this, my first term in this place, is to have a positive impact on the lives of people with disabilities and their carers. I meet very regularly with people who have disabilities and with their families, their carers and those who work with them. It has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5127"> become very clear to me that housing is the one area in which the needs of people with disabilities are very seriously deficient. It is no exaggeration to say that today there is a chronic shortage of safe, suitable and affordable housing for people who have disabilities, be they physical, intellectual or psychiatric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A study of housing needs of people with disabilities conducted in 1991 by Sach and Associates identified the high demand for housing and the insufficient supply as a major issue. Conservative estimates cited in the report were that there were 51,000 people with a disability who had housing needs, 37,500 of whom lived in the community but required rehousing. Keys Young estimated that in 1993 in New South Wales alone between 10,000 and 20,000 people with a psychiatric disability were likely to need public housing compared with the 2,500 applications that had been received in the previous three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1993 reported that the national trend to deinstitutionalise people with psychiatric disabilities had not been adequately resourced, with very serious consequences for some of the people concerned. It said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People affected by mental illness face a critical shortage of appropriate and affordable housing. The absence of suitable supported accommodation is the single biggest obstacle to recovery and effective rehabilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large proportion of people with mental illness live at home with their families, who urgently need more respite care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Homeless shelters, refuges and boarding houses are now functioning, de facto, as a major component of the `accommodation provided by our society for thousands of Australians affected by mental illness'. This is completely unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>It is true to say that the deinstitutionalisation of the past two decades has very substantially added to the unmet need for housing of people with disabilities. It is also true to say that deinstitutionalisation properly managed and implemented gives people with disabilities control over their own lives and their own destinies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Unfortunately for these people the process has not been accompanied by adequate sup port out there in the community. Turning people out of institutions without support or proper accommodation is not deinstitutionalisation, as I think it was intended to be; I would call it neglect. In 1994, one year after the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission study, the so&hyphen;called Burdekin inquiry, I was a joint author of a study which examined the progress which had been made in Victoria in addressing the findings of that report. I found that the reality was that in terms of housing there had been very little improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1992&hyphen;93 federal budget, as I understand it, did seek to address the housing shortfall with what was called the community housing program. Its stated goal was to add 25,000 dwellings by the year 2000. I would be very interested to know how many dwellings had actually been added to the stock of public housing in our community that is suited to people with disabilities. I think it would be reasonable to say that that program has not yet met its target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators will know, the federal government is currently attempting to renegotiate its housing agreement with the states and, in so doing, it is stepping back from its responsibilities for public housing, such as the one I have just mentioned. As if that were not enough, the government also plans to reduce the amount of rent assistance available to single people with disabilities who share accommodation. This is one of the most disturbing and socially regressive measures that have come out of the budget this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How is it that any government can choose to make it even harder for people with disabilities to access private rental housing in an environment where there is already such a huge unmet need? Clearly, the situation will only get worse if this government abolishes tied funding for housing programs for those with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this area is far too important to leave to the private sector. Not only do those with disabilities often need housing which is specifically modified to meet their needs but they need housing which is in towns and cities with facilities close to hand and employment also easily accessible. To adequately <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5128"> meet the housing needs of disabled people requires commitment and planning on the part of the federal government to ensure that their needs are made a national priority. The federal government, in my view, should be setting a precedent for commitment for all governments; it certainly should not be withdrawing its support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very pleased to notice this week that Premier Richard Court in Western Australia announced that his government intends to allocate an additional $7 million to public housing for people with disabilities. I hope this goes some way to addressing the unmet needs of people with disabilities in Western Australia. But it is my sincere hope that the Senate will not forget the thousands of others throughout Australia who will simply remain on public housing waiting lists. The coalition government's intention to step back from providing grants for public housing and to provide welfare instead in the form of rent assistance will not lead to more public housing in Australia&mdash;and it is my view that it will certainly not meet the needs of disabled people in our country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not to underplay the previous speakers and the weight of their issues, I ask the Senate to indulge me as I wish to speak on an issue that really did stop the nation today and that was the running of the 1996 Melbourne Cup.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The winner, as the Senate is well aware&mdash;and it was won in good fashion&mdash;was Saintly. That made it a very special cup in the history of the Melbourne Cup because it was the trainer's, Bart Cummings, 10th win in the Melbourne Cup; a feat that really is now unlikely to be surpassed, particularly now that the Melbourne Cup has gone international.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bart Cummings joins the true racing legends embedded in Australian history. He is even up there with the name of Phar Lap. For all we know, Bart Cummings may well be encased in a glass case too alongside Phar Lap. It certainly would be worthy of the two great champions of the turf.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those who watched the cup could not help but notice how emotional Bart was after his win. It was not hard to understand why. He bred, trained and won the Melbourne Cup with the horse. But I venture to say that it was also due to the knowledge that only he would have and the fact that, after a roller&hyphen;coaster ride, Bart was back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During those very hard years it was the talent and determination of Bart Cummings that got him through. I take the liberty to say that because Bart Cummings was my old boss. So I got a very special kick out of seeing Bart Cummings train the Melbourne Cup winner today. I spent many a good time and many good years around the Flemington racecourse. Bart Cummings is a genius with a horse. I saw that too many times to think it was just luck or even a well&hyphen;learnt craft. It was something better than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I learnt a great deal in my time with the Cummings' stable, and not just about horses. The racing game is made up of all levels of life and society from the toffs through to the battlers. So many of the experiences that I had then have held me in good stead in politics. I suggest to those in the chamber that many more politicians should take their sabbaticals in the stables because they will find that racing is much like politics. It has the intrigue of politics, the risks, the highs and lows, the need for confidentiality like politics, the determination needed in politics, a mateship and a care like politics calls upon us, and it also exposes you to just how tough life can be for so many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of all, if you took your winter break in the stables instead of flying off to Europe, you would learn that to rise before 5 a.m. is in fact to rise at the best time of the day. I am sure Bart Cummings does not remember my last day before I left his services when he said to me that any time I wanted my job back just give him a call. Given the fortunes and vagaries of politics, I may yet take him up on that. Congratulations Bart Cummings.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the government, I thank all senators for their adjournment speeches tonight. We have had a group of people talking about wide ranging matters&mdash;whether it be about difficulties with housing for people with disabilities, some remarks made by Senator McKiernan about a new person who has come to Australia, and some comments about the Melbourne Cup by Senator McGauran and also by Senator Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On behalf of the government, I will take on board the suggestions that you have made, Senator Harradine, because I think you are obviously a very saintly person anyway, having backed the horse twice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that when Senator McGauran was giving his speech about getting up early in the morning, I thought about an expression that my father said to me when I first left school. He said, `Always remember: up in the morning, quick off the mark; better do it in the daylight than muck around in the dark.' I thank all senators very much, since we are in the dark now.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimates of revenue are only prepared for the forward estimates period, which ends in 1999-2000. It is thus not possible to provide estimates of expected real growth in petroleum resource rent tax collections for the next 5 and 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue from the petroleum resource rent tax is projected to decline by about 4 per cent in real terms over the 2 year period to 1997-98 and by around 38 per cent over the 4 year period to 1999-2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The projected declines in collections are largely attributable to projected falls in oil and gas production in Bass Strait. However, forecasts of individual revenue items, such as this, some years into the future are subject to considerable uncertainty. In particular, changes in the $US oil price and the $A/$US exchange rate can have a major impact on profits of oil producers, affecting collections from this source, along with changes in volumes of production.</PARA>
