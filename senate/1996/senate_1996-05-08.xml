<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SYDNEY 2000 GAMES (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to protect the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games licensing revenue from being undermined by unauthorised use of the games indicia and images by corporate competitors of the official games sponsors. The bill will achieve this by regulating the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hosting of the Olympic Games in the year 2000 is an event of great significance to Australia. It provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements. Preparations for the games have proceeded in a very professional manner. This has been under the guidance of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and with a high level of cooperation between the New South Wales State Government and the commonwealth government. The organisation of the games is an inspiring venture and the public interest in every aspect of the build&hyphen;up is intense. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will ensure that the cooperation which has marked the first two years of preparation for the games continues. We will continue to cooperate with SOCOG and other agencies and organisations involved in organising the games. This cooperation is to ensure that Australia's competitors in the games are given every opportunity to succeed and that the games will be an outstanding success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task of organising the games is very large and complex. It is also very expensive. As the host nation for the year 2000 Games, Australia will be expending considerable sums of money in the lead up to the year 2000 for the construction of facilities and infrastructure, organisation and marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of staging the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games is estimated to be around $2 billion. It will be shared between the organising committees, SOCOG, and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (SPOC), the Government of NSW and the commonwealth government. The commonwealth government's overall budgetary contribution to the games will exceed $400 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sources of revenue to meet the costs of the Sydney Games include the sale of television rights, ticket sales and the licensing of the right to use the games indicia and images. After television rights, licensing, or sponsorship rights, are the most important source of revenue to meet the costs of organising and staging the games. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the revenue budget of the games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors will depend to a large extent on the degree of exclusivity afforded to the licensed indicia and images. Official sponsors recognise the commercial value of associating themselves with events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games and are willing to pay considerable sums of money to use the words and symbols associated with the Olympics. In this regard, I note that SOCOG has announced that Telstra and IBM are to jointly contribute more than $100 million. They are the first members of Team Millennium, the corporate sponsorship program for the Sydney 2000 Games. The agreement was negotiated in anticipation of the strengthening of the legislative protection of intellectual property rights associated with the Sydney Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Ambush marketing", however, has the capacity to seriously erode the official sponsorship revenue if not stopped or minimised. Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event, such as the Sydney Games, without paying for marketing rights. Typically it is the competitors of official sponsors of major sporting events that engage in these activities. Australian and overseas experience of recent Olympic Games has highlighted the threat that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="470"> uncontrolled ambush marketing activities can pose to the value of exclusive licensing rights on Olympic Games symbols and indicia. Because ambush marketing can be very effective in creating a perception that the "free&hyphen;rider" is in fact an official sponsor, it can dissuade official sponsors from continuing their association with the Olympics. It can also substantially reduce the amount sponsors are prepared to pay for the rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preservation of sponsorship revenue is fundamental to achieving a sound financial outcome for the games thereby ensuring the least call on the public purse. The government of NSW has underwritten and bears full responsibility for any deficit between the games income and expenditure. The protection of official sponsorships against ambush marketing is therefore critical.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of the Host City Contract for the Sydney 2000 Olympics present obligations to the signatories for these matters. The host City (New South Wales Government), the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), and SOCOG are obliged to ensure that there are no other marketing programs in the host country which will have an impact on the games marketing program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures introduced to the Chamber today are the result of a series of initiatives from the coalition parties. In 1994 the Liberal and National Parties initiated an inquiry into the effects of ambush marketing on sponsorship revenue for the games. This followed early indications of serious problems for the organisers, the sponsors, and therefore ultimately the tax payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1995 we announced we would support legislation to provide property rights in the words and expressions and names of bodies associated with the 2000 Games and the Paralympics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1995 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs unanimously supported this position. The AOC, SOCOG and the previous New South Wales Government had called for this legislation from the time of awarding of the games to Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous government introduced the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Bill 1995 into the Senate on 29 November 1995. It did not introduce it in time to make it law before the proroguing of Parliament. This has created the very real risk of part of SOCOG's marketing revenue being siphoned off, with the cost being borne indirectly by Australian sport and the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill I am now introducing is essentially the same as the bill introduced into the Senate last year with the exception of three minor amendments. The amendments clarify the legislation and provide additional protection in accordance with the organising committees' wishes. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives additional protection to that provided by the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987 which protects Olympic symbols such as the five rings and the designs of the Olympic flame and torch. That Act was amended in 1994 to extend the protection available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislation will protect the use of a wide range of words and expressions against ambush marketing during the lead up to and including the Sydney Games. It will pick up most of the recommendations made in March 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its report entitled Cashing in on the Sydney Olympics: Protecting the Sydney Olympic Games from Ambush Marketing. The bill will have a limited period of application and will cease to have effect after 31 December 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I would now briefly outline significant features of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to provide protection to indicia encompassing words and expressions associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Words and phrases such as "Olympic", "Olympiad", "Paralympic", "Paralympiad", "Sydney 2000", "Sydney Games", "Millennium Games", "Team Millennium" and "Summer Games" will be protected against unlicensed commercial use under this legislation. Particular word combinations will also be protected under this legislation. These include, for example, any combinations of the words "Olympics", "Olympian", "Paralympics" and "Paralympian" with words, numbers or phrases such as "Sydney", "2000", "Two Thousand", "Games", "Medals", "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze", "Green and Gold" and "Sponsor".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to protecting particular words, numbers and expressions, the bill also seeks to provide protection to certain images that in the circumstances of their presentation suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games. These images may be either visual or aural representations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rights in the above protected indicia and images vest with SOCOG and SPOC. These two bodies have the power to use and to license others to use the indicia and images identified in the legislation for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To constitute use for commercial purposes, the Sydney Games indicia or images must be applied to a person's goods or services for advertising or promotional purposes, or for enhancing the demand for the goods or services, and in a manner which would suggest that the person is or has been a sponsor of, or is or has been providing other support for, the Sydney 2000 Olympic or Paralympic Games or both. That is, a person who sells or promotes their goods or services by using any of the protected indicia or images in a way that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="471"> would be reasonably understood as suggesting that the person is claiming sponsorship of, or to be providing other support for the games, would be using them for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to enable the public to be aware of the identity of those licensed to use the Sydney Games indicia and images, a register will be established and maintained by SOCOG. It will be made accessible to members of the public at its office in Sydney. The register will also be accessible throughout Australia at state Offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. An entry in the register will include details such as the name and principal place of business of the licensed user, the Sydney Games indicia and images that the licensed user may use and the circumstances in which the indicia and images may be used. A person whose name is entered on the register is to be taken to be a licensed user of the Sydney Games indicia or images specified in that entry. A document certified by the Chief Executive Officer of SOCOG, is evidence that the particulars set out in the document are entered in the Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, however, is not about placing an absolute fetter on any use of the protected Sydney Games indicia and images. The government recognises that the preservation of sponsorship revenue is essential to achieving a good budget outcome for the games. But the fundamental rights of the community to freedom of expression must be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. It must therefore be emphasised that restrictions on the usage of the Sydney Games indicia and images will apply only to unlicensed commercial use of the protected indicia and images.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, it is made clear in the bill that the legislation is not intended to affect the working of many aspects of everyday business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recognised that some individuals and corporations already use the indicia prescribed in the legislation in conjunction with their goods and services. There are for example goods and services which either have the trade marks "Olympic" or include the word "Olympic", such as "Olympic tyres" and "Olympic Airways". This legislation is not about stopping traders who have been using these indicia and images for years from continuing that use. The established rights of owners of registered trade marks or designs containing those indicia and images remain unaffected, so long as the trade marks or designs are not used in a way so as to imply a connection to the games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the Sydney Games indicia or images solely for the purposes of providing information, or for the purposes of criticism or review, is not of itself prohibited. Examples of such provision of information include the reporting of news and presentation of current affairs, the factual description of goods or services provided by a business <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (such as stating that accommodation is available at a hotel that is located near the Olympic site), or the factual statements by an athlete to promote their own achievements. Examples of criticism and review are those which are likely to appear in newspapers, magazines or similar periodicals, in a radio or television broadcast, or in a cinematographic film.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the reasonable needs of sporting bodies in relation to fundraising for and promotion of their preparation of athletes and teams for the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games should be allowed to continue. Those reasonable needs could involve use of the Sydney Games indicia or images for the purposes of providing factual information. As I have just explained, the bill is not intended to affect this type of use. In the interests of clarity and certainty, the government believes it would be desirable for sporting bodies to negotiate Memoranda of Understanding with SOCOG to cover their proposed use of the Sydney Games indicia and images. The Australian Sports Commission has negotiated such an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While strategies are being devised to ensure that new business opportunities will flow to all industries, including small and medium enterprises, the tourism industry in particular has the greatest contribution to make in securing and dispersing spinoff benefits from the games. It has therefore been a major concern that the legislation does not inhibit the capacity of tourism marketing bodies and individual firms, to undertake advertising and promotional activities which complement the role of SOCOG and the Olympic bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of the information clause, which I have just mentioned, accommodates tourism marketing. That is, tourism marketing involving the provision of information that is both generic tourism promotion by official marketing bodies and factual statements about products and services by individual firms, should not require SOCOG's approval. Those tourism businesses wishing to become directly associated with the games will need to apply to SOCOG. The impact of the legislation on tourism marketing will be monitored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides various remedies to SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to enforce their rights in relation to the Sydney Games indicia and images. Thus, where an unlicensed user uses Sydney Games indicia or images in contravention of the bill, SOCOG, SPOC or a relevant licensed user, may bring an action against the unlicensed user. The remedies available under the bill include injunctions, damages and corrective advertising. However, in addition to those remedies, the courts have the discretion to provide remedies under any law (whether a law of the commonwealth, a state or a territory) that confers any rights or powers on <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="472"> SOCOG, SPOC or a licensed user. Most notable in this regard are the remedies provided under the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes appropriate Customs measures to limit the possibility of the importation of goods which seek to ambush the games marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The on&hyphen;going cost to the government of administering this legislation will be minimal. The Australian Customs Service will be able to carry out the measures of this legislation relating to the monitoring of imported goods at the barrier within their existing resources. It is likely that the increased security of the Olympic 2000 indicia and images will enhance SOCOG's and SPOC's capacity to ensure the financial viability of the 2000 Games through its marketing program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the bill introduces significant protection for the Sydney Games indicia and images. The protection provided by this bill will both complement and enhance the protective measures already in place under Australia's current intellectual property laws to ensure, to the extent possible, that a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Sports Drug Agency was established in response to the recommendations of the then Senate Standing Committee on Environment Recreation and the Arts. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge the considerable efforts of several of my colleagues on that committee in successfully advocating the need for such an agency, which has always had strong bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition Sport and Recreation Policy, "Encouraging Players. . . Developing Champions" demonstrates the continuing support of this side of parliament to the eradication of drugs in sport, and the work of the Australian Sports Drug Agency .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to say that since the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, this country has positioned itself as a leader in the international fight against doping, a fact recognised throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its establishment, the Australian Sports Drug Agency has conducted more than 15,000 drug tests and has implemented comprehensive education programs throughout schools and sports in this country. It has also developed guidelines for drug education for use by the international sports community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These programs have been remarkably successful. During the past year, for example, more than 3,000 drug tests have been undertaken by ASDA and more than 99% of tests were `drug free'. The Australian Sports Drug Agency has also been successful in working with professional sports leagues to conduct testing programs on a fee for service basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these drug tests are analysed by the internationally accredited Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory in Sydney. This laboratory will analyse about 2000 drug tests during the two to three weeks of the Sydney Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the Australian Sports Drug Agency has played an increasingly successful role in working internationally so that our athletes can compete on a more level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drug testing programs have been implemented cooperatively in the international sports of Athletics, Cycling, Rowing, Weightlifting, Swimming and Gymnastics. During the past 12 months the number of out&hyphen;of&hyphen;competition drug tests conducted by international sports has increased by almost 50%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its relatively brief history the Australian Sports Drug Agency has carried out the drug testing programs for the World Swimming Championships, the South East Asian Games, the World Weightlifting Championships and a host of other major international sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also entered into anti&hyphen;doping agreements with other countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, New Zealand and Norway. This multi-lateral agreement will lead to the establishment of an international benchmark for testing programs utilising an internationally recognised system of accreditation and certification. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="473"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was also the first non&hyphen;European country to accede to the Council of Europe Anti&hyphen;Doping Convention, which aims to harmonise anti&hyphen;doping programs between countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most significantly, following a request from the Chinese Anti&hyphen;Doping authorities, the Australian Sports Drug Agency is assisting China to establish its own sports drug agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These substantial international achievements are only possible because of our strong and successful national anti&hyphen;doping programs. The Australian Sports Drug Agency, in concert with the Australian Sports Commission and all state and territory departments responsible for sport and recreation, has coordinated the development of a National Drugs in Sport Framework. The Framework was endorsed by all commonwealth, state and territory ministers for sport in November 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was common recognition across all states and Territories that achieving the objectives of this anti&hyphen;doping initiative will lead to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Athletes around Australia being exposed to consistent drug testing programs:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Opportunities for all elite athletes to receive sport drug education;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> An emphasis on promoting the ethos that the use of drugs to enhance sports performance is cheating;  and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Improvements in the expertise of government and sport to develop effective drugs in sport policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government fully endorses those objectives and commits itself to strengthening Australia's strong anti&hyphen;doping programs through the coordinated action of all governments in the drug in sport area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The framework recognises the principle of natural justice and the need to respect the rights of individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective anti&hyphen;doping programs which deter athletes and their associates from cheating need to recognise that everyone must be treated in a fair and just way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the framework recognises the rights of young athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of this framework involved all key players in the sport industry in both the government and non&hyphen;government sector. It was pleasing to see the Confederation of Australian Sport, which represents more than 100 National Sporting Organisations, acknowledge the success of this important anti&hyphen;doping initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This national initiative will be critical in achieving this government's goal of a drug free Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's strong and committed anti&hyphen;doping stance was considered a significant factor in winning the right to host the 2000 Olympic Games. However, the Australian sports community remains concerned about the lack of an international level playing field in respect to doping. The success of Sydney in winning the right to host the 2000 Games provides us with a unique opportunity to further the international fight against doping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of its leadership status and with the spotlight on Sydney 2000, the government is well placed to demonstrate the effectiveness of its domestic anti&hyphen;doping programs and in so doing advocate to the international sports community the need for a similar stringent and effective effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will not only be critical to the sporting and financial success of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, but will reduce the harm to Australian athletes by ensuring that they are able to compete on equal terms. It also has the potential to re&hyphen;establish the credibility of international sport and provide a launching pad for a drug&hyphen;free sporting ethos into the 21st Century. The bill will help achieve this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports a comprehensive package of measures aimed at pursuing a drug free 2000 Olympic Games. These measures include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A drug testing program that targets international athletes competing and training in Australia</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The maintenance of an internationally accredited drug testing laboratory in Australia and continuing research to ensure new doping practices can be detected</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Measures to reduce both the prescribing and illicit supply of performance enhancing drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of measures will be implemented by key organisations from the sport, health, education and law enforcement agencies in the government and non&hyphen;government sector. The Australian Olympic Committee and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) will play a critical role. It is encouraging to see SOCOG has already established its drug testing expert committee with a very strong ASDA involvement. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="474"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Drug Free Sydney 2000 will require cooperation from international sport. The government is committed to working with the International Olympic Committee, the Australian Olympic Committee, and the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games to achieve towards this important goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill and our anti&hyphen;doping policies are about sportsmen and sportswomen and their right to compete in drug&hyphen;free sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason the Australian Sports Drug Agency has made a great effort to understand the concerns of our athletes and to ask them if they think Australia's anti&hyphen;doping initiatives are achieving success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency's 1994 survey of elite athletes in Australia showed that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> They believe ASDA's drug testing program is likely to deter elite athletes from using prohibited drugs in sport;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is a high degree of accord with all aspects of the ASDA testing program, including the existence of ASDA testing and the conduct of ASDA personnel;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 73% of elite athletes rated ASDA as being successful in balancing an individual's right to privacy with the need to maximise the deterrent effect of the drug testing program;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The way ASDA works in the sporting community has received wide endorsement with the majority of elite athletes believing ASDA consults successfully with sport;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The wide range of sources of information on drugs in sport utilised by elite athletes reflects a generally better&hyphen;informed and aware sporting environment; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> 86% of elite athletes believe that a national organisation, independent of sport (eg ASDA) should be responsible for drug testing;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall conclusion from the survey is that Australia's approach to the drugs in sport issue has been successful. In the core areas of drug testing, education and policy work, the indicators that have been collected for three years all suggest a positive impact has been made and sustained by ASDA in the sporting environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These views are supported by the results of the 1993 Mugford Report entitled The Value of Sport, Ethics and the Control of Performance Enhancing Drugs: A Study in the Australian Sports Community. It noted that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Athletes perceive the use of drugs for performance enhancement primarily as cheating;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ASDA is succeeding in creating a climate where athletes are committed to the rules rather than simply obeying them because of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the fear of detection (ie conformity rather than compliance);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This climate makes use of performance enhancing drugs much harder for athletes to justify; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">*<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sports people identified sport as having a definite value to society, and clearly drug testing and educational programs undertaken by ASDA protect that value.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AMENDMENT (CONTROLLED OPERATIONS) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 19 April 1995 the High Court handed down its decision in the matter of Ridgeway v The Queen. By a majority of 6-1 the court decided that where law enforcement officials use a controlled operation during an investigation into narcotics trafficking and, as a result, commit an element of an offence with which a defendant is charged, a court should normally refuse to admit the evidence of that element against the defendant. Some members of the court (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, at page 58 of the report in 129 ALR) indicated that if law enforcement officers are to engage in unlawful conduct in the course of investigations, a legislative scheme authorising this conduct would need be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill that is now before the Senate responds to that judgment. Senators will recall that a bill to achieve the same purpose was introduced by the previous government; that bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued. The bill now before the Senate is based upon that previous bill but includes a number of significant improvements:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the bill has been amended to ensure that controlled operations are used only for the purpose of investigating major unlawful activity. The important, but sensitive, power to conduct such covert operations will not be used for the investigation of minor criminal conspiracies;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the accountability mechanisms will be significantly strengthened by incorporating the recommendations made last year by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its report on the 1995 bill; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a gap in the bill will be closed by protecting officers who are engaged in properly authorised controlled operations from the possibility of committing offences involving the importation, exportation or possession of narcotics contrary to the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990. This was a possibility that was overlooked in the bill that was introduced into the parliament last year, by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from these points, the general purpose and thrust of the bill remain the same.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that there is a legislative base for controlled operations by law enforcement agencies and that the officers participating in such operations are protected from criminal responsibility for conduct undertaken in the course of their duty. The bill will also provide an avenue for the admission of evidence obtained from controlled <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="476"> operations prior to its commencement, provided the operation was conducted in conformity with established procedures. Most importantly, the bill will provide a framework of accountability and control which will ensure that the Attorney-General (as the responsible minister), the parliament and the community have the opportunity to scrutinise the usage of this power by law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people, both in the chamber and in the community, might ask: why should we sanction the police participating in criminal activity? I stress that parliament has already conferred upon law enforcement the power to do certain things which, if done in the absence of that legislative authority, would be a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entry onto private property without the consent of the occupier is an offence of trespass; however, police may seek a warrant which will authorise such entry upon property. The detention of a person may amount to false imprisonment unless the detention is pursuant to a lawful arrest or other similar power. The bill presently before the Senate is in a similar vein to this type of legislation which is in the best traditions of our system of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drug crime is peculiarly difficult to combat. Rarely are there complainants about this conduct. The importation of large quantities of drugs is a clandestine criminal activity involving complicity, or participants who will remain silent for fear of retribution. Organised crime does not tolerate complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the struggle against this trade involves very difficult choices for us as legislators and for the community. We are all committed to the preservation of fundamental values such as equality, privacy, freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and so on. Equally however there is the right of the individual to protection by the state. There is a powerful public interest in opposing the spread of illegal drug trafficking, and the official corruption that it can spawn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Good law enforcement is a citizen's entitlement. It must be borne in mind that loss of confidence in law enforcement will lead governments to measures destructive of civil liberties. This is not such a bill. The choice before us is between a society prepared to accept balanced legislation to counter criminals, and a society poisoned by the conditions created by those criminals and their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill lays down a full and open system of accountability. The bill requires that the responsible minister, at present the Attorney-General, is kept informed of all applications for a certificate conferring authority to conduct a controlled operation. He is also to be informed of the outcome of a controlled operation at the conclusion of the operation. In turn, he is required to table a report in parliament providing details of the applications made <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under the provisions of the bill and the outcome of the operations authorised under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedure will not lead to `entrapment' of people. The bill will expressly provide that entrapment is not permissible. A controlled operation may be conducted only in circumstances where the targets of the operation are likely to import (or export) narcotics whether or not the operation takes place. The bill will ensure that it will not be permissible for officers to procure the commission of offences which otherwise would not have taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequence of a certificate being found to be invalid because the decision to issue was not properly made will be that evidence might be held to be inadmissible. That will be a matter for the court. However, it is not intended that the effect of this will be that a police officer who acted in good faith in reliance on the certificate would then be prosecuted. The situation would be different if a police officer dishonestly procured the issue of a certificate. The law as regards accepting or rejecting evidence obtained by improper methods will be maintained. However, controlled operations may lead to the detection of criminals whose activities might otherwise never be discovered, let alone prosecuted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should emphasise that controlled operations are an internationally accepted investigatory technique.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 14 February 1993 the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances came into force in Australia. That Convention was implemented by legislation that commenced operation that same day. Article 11(1) of the Convention provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 11&mdash;Controlled delivery 1. If permitted by the basic principles of their respective domestic legal systems, the parties shall take the necessary measures, within their possibilities, to allow for the appropriate use of controlled delivery at the international level, on the basis of agreements or arrangements mutually consented to, with a view to identifying persons involved in offences established in accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, and to taking legal action against them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This article indicates the recognition by the international community of the need to employ specialised investigative techniques, like the controlled operation, to deal with organised and sophisticated traffickers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct (commonly known as the Fitzgerald report) also discussed the use of new techniques in combating organised crime. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that an effective <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="477"> response to organised crime is dependent upon recognition of four factors:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the social changes which crime causes and the fact that it diminishes the quality of life;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the fact that crime escalates if it is not controlled;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognition that there are vulnerabilities in the social order which expose it to exploitation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the steps that are needed to control crime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the latter point (the steps that are needed to control crime) Commissioner Fitzgerald stated that consideration should be given to a wide range of measures which would equip law enforcement agencies with new powers including permitting `the infiltration of criminal groups'. Commissioner Fitzgerald concluded that orthodox policing is quite unable to enforce the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will ensure that commonwealth law enforcement agencies have available to them the controlled operation as a tool in the investigation of the trade in narcotics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to discuss briefly the key features of the bill. The central issue in the Ridgeway decision was the admissibility of evidence. The High Court held that because of the involvement of law enforcement agents in the importation of heroin, the evidence obtained thereby was fatally tainted and should be excluded from the trial of the principal conspirator. Honourable Senators may notice that the bill before them says nothing about the admissibility of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How then, it might be asked, does the bill respond to the decision of the High Court?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis for the decision by the majority of the High Court was that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude evidence on certain public policy grounds. The public policy ground in question, which then triggers the discretion to exclude evidence, arises where illegal police conduct is an essential ingredient of the charged offence. In such a case there will be `an extremely formidable case for exclusion' of the evidence by the trial judge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court accepted that the legislature could sanction the use of controlled operations and that such a legislative regime could exempt the officers from the requirements of the criminal law. The court went on to say that `in the absence of such a legislative regime, the courts have no choice but to set their face firmly against grave criminality on the part of anyone, regardless of whether he or she be government officer or ordinary citizen.' The enactment of the bill now before the Senate will ensure that the actions of law enforcement officials engaged in a controlled operation will not incur criminal responsibility and, as a result, the trigger for the exclusion of evidence will not arise. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the bill, whilst protecting the law enforcement officers from criminal responsibility, will still preserve the essential criminality or unlawfulness of the importation (or exportation) of the prohibited narcotics. This will ensure that the importation or exportation itself is not made lawful, thereby exonerating the targets of the operation who planned the conspiracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to describe the effect of the bill upon prosecutions that are current at the time the bill commences operation. There are a number of investigations that are affected by the decision in Ridgeway. They all involve very significant participation in trafficking in narcotics, for example:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conspiracy to import 7 kg of cocaine (one individual);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being knowingly concerned in the importation of 3.8 kg of cocaine (two individuals);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being knowingly concerned in the importation of, and possession of, 2 kg of heroin (two individuals).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised by the Australian Federal Police that controlled operations were employed in each of these matters. These operations were strictly regulated and rigorously controlled covert operations. In each case they were conducted in purported accordance with the terms of a Ministerial Agreement relating to such operations and the detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines on the conduct of controlled operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Agreement was entered into on 3 June 1987 between the then Special Minister of State (having responsibility for the Australian Federal Police) Senator the Honourable Michael Tate, and the then minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (having responsibility for the Australian Customs Service) Senator the Honourable John Button. The agreement provided that a written request was to be made to the Australian Customs Service:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"where certain persons, goods, ships or aircraft, suspected or known to be carrying or having an involvement in drugs, are required by the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority to be exempted from detailed customs scrutiny and control and in cases where there is to be substitution of imported goods".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once that agreement was obtained the operation was conducted in accordance with detailed requirements of Australian Federal Police guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These guidelines run to fifty paragraphs and closely regulate the considerations that should be adverted to when deciding whether a controlled operation should be conducted; the level at which operations must be approved; the procedures for a controlled delivery involving the substitution of the narcotic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="478"> substance; further procedures for those operations where substitution is not feasible or possible; the requirements for analysis of the narcotic substance; and the making of payments to couriers and informants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These operations were conducted pursuant to these guidelines. The operations were closely monitored. Each of the accused alleged to have been detected as a result of these controlled operations are entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. But without the passage of this legislation those trials will have to be abandoned. I believe the community would not see that to be a just outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion I believe that the community expects that law enforcement agencies will make every effort to catch the "Mr Bigs" of organised crime, not just apprehend couriers and the dealers on our street corners. Indeed the community has a right to expect, to demand, that law enforcement agencies will act to protect them, and their children who are particularly vulnerable. This bill will satisfy that demand by providing a firm legislative basis for the use of controlled operations as a device in combating drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other aspects of the legislation are described in the Explanatory Memorandum relating to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite a high standard of living and generally adequate nutrition, significant illness and death still occur from diseases such as pertussis and measles, which can be prevented by immunisation. If enough children are immunised, outbreaks of these illnesses will be prevented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in the United Kingdom, the recent measles-rubella campaign has interrupted measles transmission in school children, and may have stopped the circulation of the virus throughout the population. In March and April 1995, only 4 cases of measles were confirmed: 3 had recently arrived from overseas. The fourth case involved an unvaccinated boy of 15 months. In Australia, with approximately one third of the population of the United Kingdom, there were 229 notifications of measles reported during the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Low immunisation coverage rates continue to be of concern in Australia. Continuing epidemics of vaccine preventable diseases indicate that current immunisation rates are not sufficient to prevent the transmission of these diseases. There have been 136 cases of measles reported for the year to date (30 March 1996); 1284 cases were reported during 1995; 4,895 cases in 1994; and 4536 cases in 1993. Between 1983 and 1993 there were 41 deaths caused by measles. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States and Territories have been unable to adequately monitor immunisation coverage using consistent methodology or with a reasonable degree of precision. No state or territory is able to provide immunisation coverage estimates which can identify groups at risk of disease through incomplete immunisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1994-95 Budget an additional $24 million was allocated to implement a number of initiatives to increase immunisation coverage rates and curb the continuing outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This included funding to trial the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (the register) for children up to six years of age for a period of 18 months. The register is administered by the Health Insurance Commission and commenced operation on 1 January 1996. Under this government funding for the register will be continued beyond this 18 month period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that for the first time the register will provide a comprehensive effective management tool for monitoring immunisation coverage and improving service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Practitioners and immunisation providers have responded with enthusiasm to the new program and already a significant amount of information has been recorded on the register. Indications are that the register will grow to provide a comprehensive and valuable measure of immunisation coverage in Australia. Preliminary figures indicate that approximately 450,000 immunisation episodes have been recorded to date (1 April 1996).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will enable the Health Insurance Commission to release information from the register to prescribed bodies for purposes relating to the immunisation or health of children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth, state and territory health authorities and other prescribed bodies will be provided with de-identified information about immunisation coverage rates at national, state and local levels. This information will identify areas of high risk because of large numbers of unimmunised children and therefore enable immunisation programs, including education programs, to be effectively targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the consent of the parent or guardian, recognised immunisation providers will be able to establish the immunisation history of a child before administering vaccines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parents or guardians will be able to obtain a statement (by post) of the immunisations administered to their child from 1 January 1996 regardless of where in Australia the child was immunised. This information will, over time, assist parents or guardians in providing evidence of their child's immunisation history for enrolment in child care facilities or school. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="479"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information from the register forms the basis of an optional recall/reminder scheme which will inform parents or guardians when their child's next vaccination is due or past due. Where a parent or guardian of a child opts out of the recall/reminder scheme, identifying information will not be released, however the inclusion of these children in de-identified reports will assist in the accurate determination of immunisation coverage rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern has been expressed about the compulsory nature of enrolment on the register. However, immunisation is such an important health issue, and the health of the community is best served by comprehensive information. An individual's choice to opt out off the recall/reminder scheme will not compromise the safety of others in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disclosure of Information</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill prohibits the use of information by a person to whom it is divulged for a purpose other than that for which it was requested. Information from the register will not be linked with other commonwealth databases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State and territory bodies will be required to give written confirmation to comply with the secrecy provision of the act before the information is released.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of the register will provide information which is not currently available about immunisation coverage. It will enable the commonwealth, states and Territories to better manage immunisation programs. The objective is to increase coverage rates to an extent that disease transmission is interrupted. Experience in other countries has demonstrated that this in an achievable goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the register is fundamental to achieving this objective.</PARA>

<PARA>In any government tendering process involving several bidders it is absolutely essential that the details of each bid remain confidential, firstly, to ensure that the government on behalf of the community obtains the best possible financial result and, secondly, so that each bidder is secure in the knowledge that he or she will not be unfairly undercut by a competitor having knowledge of the bid's details. Both aspects have wider ramifications. Reducing the funds which should flow into public revenue will disadvantage each and every citizen by reducing services or increasing taxes or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These matters are important. The select committee needs to be established urgently to investigate the detrimental effect that has been caused&mdash;as I will outline in a moment&mdash;to Australia's international reputation in dealing with business proposals and in the general area of the relationship between business and government. Potentially, the consequences of a shoddy tendering process are even more detrimental. If businesses cannot rely on the integrity of the tendering process, they will not compete. They will not do business with any Australian government. As a result, the government and, therefore, the community, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be held to ransom by businesses adding a premium for dealing with a government of bad reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a reputation does not remain confined to one Australian state government. Clearly, it will affect all Australian governments and the nation as a whole, and is likely to affect the sort of hard bargain we can and should drive on behalf of this nation across a whole gamut of business activities. Areas affected are investment, the sale of assets, joint ventures, contracting for services and so on. It is therefore a national issue; and it is urgent that the Senate deal with my motion now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference of the Senate select committee that is to be established relate to the legislation at Commonwealth level designed to achieve ethical business practices by corporations and governments alike. The issue of Commonwealth legislation also extends to the question of whether it is adequate in an area which has such far&hyphen;reaching effects on the nation's economic and social wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The confidentiality of the tendering process is a well&hyphen;established and important principle. Indeed, Premier Kennett acknowledged this when he said to the Victorian parliament on 19 May 1993:</PARA>

<PARA>I will now proceed with the details of the bids that were provided to the state government Treasury officials. As I was saying, one of the bids would yield the government $305 million and the other, $170 million. The higher bid was by Pacific and the lower by Crown. Yet when Crown was declared the winner on 6 September 1993, after an extension of time to 30 August for so&hyphen;called financial finetuning of the bids, Pacific's bid had come down slightly and Crown's tender had moved up to beat the Pacific consortium by a few million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, on 21 March 1996, two former employees of the casino control authority claimed that security procedures were not in force during the final stages of the casino bidding process. The staff who worked at the authority in 1992 said that visits by representatives of the Crown consortium, including Mr Ron Walker, Mr Lloyd Williams and members of the Sheraton&hyphen;Leighton group&mdash;that is, Pacific&mdash;went unrecorded in the contact summary sheets, a system that formed part of the protocols to ensure the integrity of the bidding process. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 21 March stated that staff members had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contact summary system broke down during the critical months leading up to September 1992 decision on the casino licence holder.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kennett has refused to make the contact summary sheets public. These allegations and the possibility that vital information about the financial bid had leaked to the tenderers and the question as to whether the record and reputation of the tenderers had been sufficiently taken into account are questions which must be answered urgently before the alleged faulty way in which the Australian govern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ment does business further besmirches Australia's international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats and, indeed, many others have repeatedly challenged Mr Kennett to initiate a Victorian independent judicial inquiry to remove the rumour and innuendo which now surround the casino tendering process. Far from continuing these rumours, a Senate select committee inquiry would put an end to them by bringing forth information that the community should be aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that it is a state matter and hence should not be dealt with by a Senate committee is spurious. There have been numerous Senate and joint inquiries dealing with matters which are all at least in part within state responsibilities, including the Senate inquiry into the education of gifted and talented children and the more recent Metway Bank and whistleblower inquiries which, in fact, were initiated by the coalition parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear that this matter needs to be looked at. We would have preferred Premier Kennett to have run his own investigation. When I say his own, I mean an independent judicial inquiry to get to the bottom of these allegations which hang like a cloud over Victoria. Since he has refused to do so, it is important that the Senate accept the responsibility to hold government accountable in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Only this morning Sir Laurence Street called for national rules and national regulations for casinos in this country. Sir Laurence Street was the person who undertook the inquiry into the casino in Sydney. His views, I think, are widely respected in terms of the approach that he took towards the investigations concerning allegations involving the casino in Sydney. The behaviour of the New South Wales government in regard to the Sydney casino quite sharply contrasts with the behaviour of the Victorian government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Laurence Street's call this morning places in sharp focus the very great need for this inquiry to proceed. In regard to Victoria, it is said that the Crown Casino is the biggest game in town. Of course, the Victorian public may now believe the description best applies <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="483"> to the conduct of the government in that state. Damning allegations have repeatedly been made about the legitimacy of the process employed in Victoria to award the operating licence to Crown Casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These allegations have been persistent and widespread. They have come from bureaucrats and they have come from other bidders who were involved in the tender process. The Victorian government has dismissed these claims and has alleged that they are merely a matter of `sour grapes from losers' and `anonymous, vexatious and unsubstantiated slurs from disgruntled operatives'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing could be further from the truth. ITT Sheraton is claiming that they were disadvantaged in a bid for one of the major casinos in this country. ITT Sheraton is an international firm of high repute which was disadvantaged because, somehow or other, bidding information was transferred to other bidders in the process. That is, in essence, the allegation that is being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media has consistently attempted to examine the issues raised, but has been seriously hamstrung by the onerous secrecy provisions of the Casino Control Act which was put in place in 1991. They have also been hampered by the ongoing refusal of the Victorian Premier to subject himself and his administration to open and balanced public scrutiny of any of these matters concerning his government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no coincidence that the ABC and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper in Melbourne&mdash;the two media outlets responsible for raising the questions of interference in the bidding process&mdash;have been subject to persistent and sustained attack by the Victorian Premier. The Premier has steadfastly rejected calls for a Victorian inquiry into the bidding process and, quite clearly, a royal commission would seem to be the best way to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are substantive matters; they are not vexatious matters. They are substantive matters which go to the question of Australia's international reputation in terms of business confidence. These matters have a profound effect on the capacity of firms to undertake tender processes and to have a reasonable expectation that they will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> treated fairly without being close to government. The essence of this matter is whether or not you can get a fair go in terms of your business dealings in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public has never been given the opportunity to assess the alternatives in regard to the Las Vegas style casino and gambling theme park in Melbourne which has been established on the banks of the Yarra. The Premier of Victoria complains about the prospect of a Senate inquiry that would involve the opportunity for witnesses to take the protection of in camera evidence. What could be more ridiculous than this claim coming from a premier who has undertaken a process which has been highlighted by its behind closed doors nature?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole process in Victoria has been based on secrecy and behind closed doors manoeuvring. This is in contrast with the casino act which provided the opportunity for the various bids to be put on public display so that the public could make some assessment of what was happening to their city and what was happening in terms of the processes that were being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legal questions arising about the tendering process were handicapped by the secrecy surrounding that whole bidding process. Was it really a competitive tendering process? Why was the design and operation so substantially altered after the announcement of the successful bid? Why was there an increase from 260 rooms to 1,000 rooms in the hotel? Why was there an increase in the building from 22 floors to 34 floors&mdash;a substantial altering in the concept from the original and announced public position of the government in Victoria to have a smaller rather than a massive complex? Why was that done after the arrangements were made, in complete contravention of the normal planning processes that one would expect to have been undertaken? Why shouldn't alternative bidders have been advised that that was the case before the tenders were closed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="484"> Why was the number of gaming tables substantially increased at a cost to Crown which was far lower in comparison to other casino arrangements in New South Wales and Queensland? Were secret arrangements en tered into to ensure that Hudson Conway had a special advantage and were rewarded in return for various concessions entered into, particularly for the Liberal Party? Why did the Premier so publicly expose his support for those changes prior to their consideration by an independent casino control authority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistently, the Premier has attempted to convince the public that the bidding process was above reproach. But the allegations have continued, fuelled by the incestuous alliance between the principals of Crown Casino, Jeff Kennett and the Liberal Party. These allegations of cronyism create unanswered questions about the undermining of community confidence in the proper conduct of government and business in Victoria, which ultimately has an effect on the consideration of Australia's reputation at large. They are seriously undermining business confidence both inside and outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is imperative that these allegations are addressed, not to indulge in petty political point&hyphen;scoring, but to protect investment and jobs for all Australians: not to appease bad losers, but to defend our democratic institutions and protect the freedom of the media and the public's interest and the public's right to know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the despotic dismissiveness of the Victorian Premier and his contempt for even minimum standards of accountability, the responsibility to put the record straight has fallen to the federal parliament. A properly constituted statutory and public examination of these issues has been supported by all reasonable members in this chamber, of course, transcending party lines. The Senate inquiry will provide an opportunity to clear the air in Victoria and will also provide a critical review of casino licensing processes nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian Premier has characteristically condemned such an inquiry as a `McCarthyist witch&hyphen;hunt'. Those of us who are familiar with Victorian politics would find that behaviour by the Premier familiar treatment of anybody that raises issues of public concern. He has said that this is an inquiry based on rumour and innuendo and challenged me&mdash;in the public position that I have put on such <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> matters&mdash;to produce one factor to justify such an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say categorically that the current and indisputable facts are that disturbing and collaborating allegations have emanated from a range of sources that challenge the credibility of the Victorian government's probity to the very core of the cabinet inner circle, that is, ministers Stockdale, Storey, Birrell, McNamara and Maclellan. These allegations have not been resolved and their fallout continues to destroy business confidence and community confidence. They foul the casino industry with the stench of collusion and corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as I am concerned, there are a number of broader issues that require a much thorough and balanced public examination. Why did the Premier believe a cabinet subcommittee was necessary to watch over the casino control authority and the tendering process when the authority had two expert internal committees to evaluate the planning and the financial issues plus a board and a chairman with the skills and expertise to make the necessary judgment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, contrary to the normal public service practice, were the deliberations of the subcommittee not minuted, thus bypassing the scrutiny through the freedom of information act? Why did the Victorian government act so differently from the governments in Queensland and New South Wales in the process of granting casino licences?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite apparent, in the case of Showboat, where in 1994 the builder of the Sydney casino, Leightons Consortium, was forced to hand over its shareholding to a trustee after its principals were found to be not of good repute. They were later convicted of making false statements during building tenders to obtain a financial advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sir Laurence Street, who I referred to earlier, made it very clear that the proper process was to ensure that you do not have to wait for criminal inquiries to be proceeded with. The very fact that those matters are under investigation means that the casino authority has an independent responsibility to ensure that due probity is followed. Of course, once again, the practice in Victoria could not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="485"> be further from what actually occurred in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is public knowledge that Ron Walker, as I read in the press, has a personal worth of the substantial figure of $125 million. According to public records, he has raised over $45 million for the Liberal Party in recent years and is reported to have personally guaranteed the $10 million overdraft from the National Australia Bank to fund the campaign commitments of the Liberal Party's federal office. From memory, on the night that John Howard claimed victory, Ron Walker was one of only two people he thanked from the organisation. Ron Walker has a central role in these allegations. We saw just yesterday with the `tower of power' in Melbourne, through Hudson Conway's distribution of favours to the Liberal Party hierarchy in Victoria, that Ron Walker has a central role to play in the way in which these operations were run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are serious questions about the way in which the TAB was removed from the consortium in Melbourne. Very important questions arise where Mr Williams was a board member as well as a director of Hudson Conway. I should have thought that, at the very least, he had a substantial conflict of interest that should have been explained publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been receiving correspondence on such matters from citizens in Victoria. They have been raising very serious matters about the TAB shares, which had an initial part in the bid of some 30 per cent. If time had allowed, the TAB would have been in a position where, I would have thought if it had been part of the Crown consortia that was successful in gaining this tender, its value would have been quite substantially greater than it was when it was sold off by the Victorian government. The Victorian taxpayers were the direct losers as a result of the removal of the TAB from that consortia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the timing of the TAB's withdrawal from the tendering consortia should have been subject to public investigation. It is important to highlight that the TAB was involved with this bid, with Mr Williams being a critical player in both Hudson Conway, the beneficiary of taking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> over the TAB shares, and a member of the TAB board. It seems to me, at the very least, that there was a very substantial conflict of interest in that regard. This is a matter that has not received serious consideration in Victoria. There is also the issue of the removal of Federal Hotels from the bidding process. They were removed from the consortia. Very substantial issues have arisen which will require very thorough investigation by a select committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some pretty basic issues have been raised about the probity arrangements undertaken by the Casino Control Authority. Why is it that there has been no proper investigation in Victoria into the quite demonstrable two&hyphen;way contact between senior members of the Victorian government and the authority which escalated during the period when the Crown bid was redrafted? Why were the probity checks at the authority, which you would expect would be required in any proper process, not followed? Why was documentation of all external contacts&mdash;the substance of which raises very serious questions about whether or not it was a clean process in regard to the granting of this licence&mdash;not kept?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that there is a very uniquely Victorian view operating at the moment on what is arms length when it comes to the Kennett government's administration of casino licences. You have to contrast that quite sharply with, for instance, the treatment of John Darcy Duggan. Do senators recall John Darcy Duggan, a member of that board? The standard of probity demanded from the casino was particularly high when it came to Chief Justice Darcy Duggan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was sacked as a member of the gaming commission and control authority because he took a free 20&hyphen;minute flight in the United States, which was provided by a Nevada poker machine manufacturing company of dubious record. It is intriguing that he was removed from the gaming authority but not the parole board. I wonder whether these allegations would have surfaced or whether these events alluded to would have occurred if there was a man of his integrity about. There is a real issue about the way in which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="486"> the control authority was altered in such a way as to provide the opportunity for these events to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Casino Control Authority requires holders of operator licences to be of substantial character in terms of honesty and integrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think these matters ought to be considered in the light of the fact that Crown Casino principal and Hudson Conway Director, Ron Walker, has a reputation as a hardnosed business opportunist concerned with profit rather than public interest. He has shown himself to be unconcerned by protocols of process and conflict of interest provisions in his role as federal treasurer of the Liberal Party&mdash;I say that particularly in relation to the arrangements entered into by the National Australia Bank to finance the Liberal Party election campaign&mdash;and as a member of the Committee for Melbourne. We are seeing this in the way in which he has run the major events company in Melbourne and the way in which the granting of the grand prix was kept secret for so many months before the tender arrangements were announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly the question arises as to whether or not there was insider trading. This inquiry will look at the adequacy of the Commonwealth's corporations and security law in relation to this matter. Lloyd Williams, a fellow principal of Crown and Director of Hudson Conway, has barely managed to avoid prosecution as a property developer and has provided self-confessed benefits to a union official in breach of the Crimes Act. His recorded business dealings demonstrate absolute contempt for proper process. The validity of the damaging allegations concerning Hudson Conway are still to be determined by the legal system. These allegations include&mdash;</PARA>

There is also the issue of the attempted theft by <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deception by Gleem Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Hudson Conway, against the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. There is the question of whether or not the Victorian Premier himself derived a benefit from Hudson Conway through the major renovations to his private residence during 1994-95.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Senate inquiry will provide witnesses with immunity from prosecution under the various stringent and oppressive provisions of the Victorian Casino and Gaming Act. It will enable those individuals with the knowledge of and concerns about the bidding process to publicly substantiate their claims. It will attack the climate of fear, jingoistic vilification and intimidation within Victoria which has been imposed by the Kennett government. It will uphold the right of the media to undertake legitimate investigations of government actions, which one would expect from any independent media operating within the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This latter role of the media has been crucial to uncovering the many allegations surrounding Crown Casino. In October 1994, the SBC Dominguez Barry report was released. SBC Dominguez Barry were the financial advisers to the Casino Control Authority. They prepared two reports, one in June 1993 and one in September 1993. The reports disclosed that the key feature of the bids was that the initial bids were received by Crown Casino, Jupiters and ITT Sheraton in June 1993. Jupiters placed a low bid and dropped out. Crown Casino's bid was substantially less than ITT Sheraton's initial bid. In August 1994, according to the SBC Dominguez Barry report, ITT Sheraton marginally lowered their bid. Crown Casino increased their bid substantially to match the ITT Sheraton bid so that it could be said there was no significant or substantial difference between the two bids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim Gallagher, who has been the spokesperson for ITT Sheraton, has always maintained that during the bidding process Crown Casino obtained an unfair advantage. ITT Sheraton was led to believe that they would be successful&mdash;</PARA>

Not all of those are ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure an inquiry such as this would be able to ask them whether or not they can assist in that respect. The inquiry will also allow for the examination of the adequacies of the Commonwealth legislation in relation to casino licensing, particularly the effectiveness of the Corporations Law and the need for uniform legislation on casino licensing. It will also allow for an assessment of the adequacies of the Financial Transactions Act in regard to transactions in casinos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An inquiry will also provide an opportunity for an assessment of whether the granting of casino licences has affected Australia's international reputation. It will also provide, very importantly, the opportunity for an assessment of whether a full judicial inquiry, a royal commission or another inquiry is needed into the Crown Casino with particular reference to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the tendering process and whether Australia's interests have been protected, particularly in regard to the record and reputation of tenderers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a climate of fear and intimidation in Melbourne directed at those who have criticised the Victorian government. Why shouldn't there be, given the oppressive prohibitions of the Casino Control Act and of course given the long record of this government in Victoria in terms of the way in which it has dismissed critics and removed the normal protections of a democratic society that people are able to put forward views and have protection by the law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen in Victoria is that judges have been sacked. We have seen the head of the Children's Court removed. We have seen the removal of the DPP. We have seen the removal of the Commissioner of Equal Opportunity. We have seen numerous changes to the Victorian constitution which close off the normal provisions of legal appeal. We have seen that in regard to school closures, for instance. Appeals to the Supreme Court of Victoria are being blocked. We have seen legal prohibitions placed on public servants, school teachers and others from publicly drawing attention to inadequacies in government policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would be absolutely intolerable in any normal society, but in Victoria there is a simple rule: the government is above the law. We have seen with KNF Advertising that when they are caught out they change the law. The Victorian government are in contempt of the Victorian people and the normal democratic processes. As far as I am concerned, the Australian parliament has a very real and legitimate interest in the very serious allegations that have been raised concerning the Crown Casino. It has a duty to allow citizens to put their views, to assess their claims and to clear the air on the ever-lengthening shadow of allegations surrounding Crown Casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="488"> I believe that if people have nothing to hide they will come forward. They will tell the truth. They will put on the public record their views and they will allow their claims to be assessed. In that way we can determine whet her or not what occurred in Victoria was above board and was clean. We can then tell the world that the processes in Australia are in fact proper. We can say that you can get a fair go when you go for a contract. The alternative is to allow these rumours and these allegations and facts to continue to go unassessed. That is totally inappropriate if we are trying to get to the bottom of these matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For those who read the back page first, I agree entirely. But even then I would prefer them to revert to the old style of having the teams on the back page and not a separate supplement. I am sure they can do even better. The politics of it are quite interesting because they then said that Brumby ought to realise that he had been distracted by peripheral issues, and in brackets you could read `distracted by the likes of Senator Carr'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very clear indeed what the motivation of the Labor Party is for this, Senator Spindler. I am just sorry that you have not been exposed to it earlier than now. What possible earthly justification there was for bringing up the politics of envy in such a blatant way, by referring to Ron Walker as reputedly having a worth of about $125 million, is absolutely irrelevant to any sort of inquiry of this nature. The reason that it was dredged up is that Senator Carr cannot help himself. What he has done&mdash;and I am sure Senator Ray is absolutely furious at this&mdash;is expose the real agenda of the Labor Party. You see, the fact is that, right from the outset, the senior people who have been elected to lead your side of politics have had enormous reservations about this whole exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just tell you what Mr Beazley has said on the subject. He said, `I do think there is a case for an inquiry. There is a case for an inquiry run in the state of Victoria.' In other words, quite clearly Kim Beazley has not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been in favour of the Senate conducting this sort of witch&hyphen;hunt, fishing trip, publicity stunt, whatever you like to call it. When asked about ambiguity in his remarks in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, your favourite newspaper&mdash;I presume it is the only rag you read&mdash;on 18 April, he said that he was in holding pattern. In other words, he still was not in favour of an inquiry. As recently as last Friday, he simply said at a doorstop, `Of course, the desirable course of action would be for Mr Kennett to do what state and federal governments have done over the last few years when matters of serious doubt of this nature occurred: put on judicial inquiries and royal commissions themselves.' Now what did Senator Ray have to say on the subject? On election night he said, `I have not really given it full and final thought yet.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you have and I will come to why in a minute. He said, `I have made no public comment on it at all, because my view is that the Senate should essentially stick to federal issues. The Kennett government refuses to take up those options. We will keep an open mind on it.' Why therefore do we find the likes of Senator Ray being involved in such an inquiry? It is simply because those opposite have been persuaded that this does represent an opportunity to get into people like Ron Walker. This is a `get Walker' exercise. This is an opportunity, as Senator Carr has made crystal clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think that, if you had been in this place for a couple of years, you would know that there are times when you do not actually reveal everything that you might have in mind. You might want to achieve a political objective, but you do not telegraph your punches. Yet what we found was Senator Carr making it clear that he thought a very big issue in all of this was some allegation about Ron Walker having obtained favourable financing from the National Bank in relation to the funding of the Liberal Party. Why did he mention it? In the context of speaking in support of a motion to establish an inquiry into the Victorian casino, why on earth did this clown mention Ron Walker and the Liberal Party? It was simply because he could <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="490"> not help himself, because what he is doing is putting it on the public record that that is your real agenda. And indeed it is.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that one of the terms of reference is whether the granting of any licence to any casino within Australia has affected Australia's overseas reputation. That is the sort of cloak of respectability that some have tried to put on this to mask the obvious fact that it has nothing to do with the feds at all. This is simply an inquiry into a state issue. Indeed, by calling it&mdash;as you do&mdash;the Victorian casino inquiry select committee, you have made it crystal clear that this is about the politics of Victoria.

He spent most of his time making high&hyphen;level representations to various government ministers to ensure that Indonesian interests got that licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether Mr Beazley has been to Christmas Island to have any discussions, but again that is a proper matter for investigation by this committee. After all, Indonesian interests did some very generous and helpful things to very senior people who have now scurried out of the parliament. But it is clearly a matter that must affect Australia's international reputation. So this committee is obligation bound to investigate the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="491"> circumstances in which the Christmas Island licence was granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am indebted to you for casting it in such wide terms. That is probably why Senator Robert Ray accepted the inevitability of this committee having to sit until December 1996, because it certainly would not be able to fill out the time by just concentrating on Victoria. As we know, there is virtually nothing on the public record that would warrant this sort of inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of setting up a Senate select committee and committing taxpayers' funds to such an exercise has to be on prima facie evidence&mdash;not on the likes of Senator Carr who spend most of their time talking to themselves in phone boxes and pouring out their violent vitriol against anyone they might regard is not subscribing to their view of the world. I must say that even those numbers are diminishing. One has to look only at the fact that Senator Carr could not even make it onto the frontbench.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Didn't they? You have been obsessed with this for years. I suppose that you have been the great architect, the mastermind, behind those four FOI applications to the AAT. What do you do? You go along and say, `There's public interest in this.' In other words, `We've stirred it; we've been out there parading our prejudices; we've been raising so-called allegations. Therefore, there is public concern and, therefore, we ought to be able to obtain possession of the documents on the basis of public interest.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the AAT said on no less than four separate occasions, there is simply no justification for that material being made available. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The documents do not disclose any material which would in any way throw light on the litany of allegations referred to by the applicant. In the Tribunal's opinion, release of the material will not reveal any inappropriate behaviour or wrongdoing by the Authority. The matters that allegedly led to the conclusion that there are issues of such great public concern or disquiet are simply allegations not based on facts proved to the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>There are heaps of authority for that proposition from the highest courts in the land&mdash;that the mere fact that you want to get out there and make scurrilous allegations is no basis for saying that there is a genuine public interest in an issue. The courts, I have no doubt, will continue to uphold that very vital distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have tried time and again to dredge up documents that you think might help your case, and they simply have not got you anywhere. The fact is&mdash;and, again, this is on the public record&mdash;that there was a consultative bidding process in which the authority negotiated with the individual bidders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not have to be too smart around the traps to know that IT&amp;T were boasting that they had very deep pockets, they could outspend any of the locals, they were heavy hitters from overseas, and that they had every bit of $200 million. Now, there is absolutely no requirement on any bidder to disclose what their hand is any more than you are required to play open poker; you do not have to put your cards on the table. You can get out there and tell people, as people often do, `Look, you know, we couldn't possibly afford to go beyond 150; the shareholders wouldn't think it was a great idea.' In other words, you could do your best to disguise the fact that you are prepared to bid high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened on this occasion was that Crown Casino were clearly confident that the design of their bid was light years ahead of IT&amp;T's. IT&amp;T's bid or proposal has been described as&mdash;I forget what the term is&mdash;something like `a block design'. But the Crown bid was clearly, from the outset, a much more lavish proposal involving a high&hyphen;rise hotel, large entertainment precinct and open riverside plaza. Again, the terms of the inquiry by the casino authority were that, if the bids were comparable, you would win on the merits&mdash;and that is how it ought to be. So all that Crown had to do in revising their bid, as they were required to do, was get themselves into the ballpark. Then, as far as they were concerned, they would win it on the merits&mdash;and so it proved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">IT&amp;T had had no experience in casinos up to that point in time. They may well have been on a fast learning curve. No doubt, as with most disgruntled bidders, they now want to make suggestions that the process was not all that it might have been. But there is absolutely nothing on the public record to justify those concerns. That is why Senator Carr is sort of scrabbling around to suggest that, because someone ups their bid at the last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="493"> minute, they must have had inside information; that that somehow must have involved Ron Walker, it must have involved Jeff Kennett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not a skerrick of evidence to suggest that.

Neither the Victorian Casino Authority nor the government have denied that information was passed on to senior departmental officials as part of the licensing process. That was a necessary requirement to resolve questions of government policy on issues such as siting and possible taxation structures. It was important for them to be aware of the revenue implications. But they were not entitled to know which bid was which, nor were they told.

You will find that people&mdash;those people who Rob Holls has managed to make contact with and presumably persuaded to come along and give evidence to the inquiry&mdash;will say that things were perfectly in line with the requirements; in other words, that they saw documents, they saw letters with numbers on them which, presumably, they will say, they believed to have been passed on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, all that they will say is what was allowed for by the processes. Let there be no misunderstanding of what this inquiry is all about. Some members of the Labor Party have very serious misgivings about this. The current weak Leader of the Opposition has been vacillating and equivocating from the outset. Senator Robert Ray, I believe, does have a sense of proprietary about these issues and understands the demarcation between federal and state. But both Mr Beazley and Senator Ray have been finally dragged on board because of the political ineptitude of someone whom they ultimately would not even allow to be on the inquiry itself. They now think that perhaps there might be a window of opportunity in which to discredit Mr Howard through Ron Walker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very sad day for Australian politics because those opposite are saying that successful business people should not be involved in politics, should not even belong to political parties, and should not be prepared to serve in appointed positions. They are essentially saying that political parties ought to cut themselves off from the mainstream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party gets help from the trade union movement in spades. Talk about an unrepresentative outfit! If you take out the number of trade union officials, if you take out the former party secretaries, and if you take out teachers&mdash;and I suspect Senator Carr probably fits into all three categories&mdash;you are left with virtually no&hyphen;one with experience of the real world. You do not have any compunction about expecting the trade union movement to hand over hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Labor Party at election time, yet you are prepared to vilify any individual whom you regard as wealthy. You hate the thought of people having earned money in the real world; I presume you would prefer that they were on the public purse&mdash;on the drip feed. You are prepared to go to any lengths to discredit serving politicians by getting at people who are out there in the community. This will be exposed for what it is.</PARA>

They regard you as a total political liability. They know that there is no way in which you could be controlled. You would be in there, letting it all pour out. You would not be worrying about the facts. You would not be worrying about the evidence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend Senator Ray for his strength from his side of the perspective in standing up to that sort of intimidatory political approach. I hope that, when it is established, this committee will take all those terms of reference very seriously and will recognise that it has an obligation to not only pursue other casino inquiries, but not to stray into extraneous issues. If it does, I can assure those opposite that we will bringing the house down. Those extraneous matters are totally irrelevant and utterly unrelated. The fact that Senator Carr has let the cat out of the bag today in no uncertain terms will be no justification at all for the committee exceeding its brief.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that Senator Alston, if he thinks this inquiry is going to be a major embarrassment to us, would want to foreclose and not have the inquiry not got through until December. From listening to his rather pathetic defence on this particular matter, I can only reflect on his transition from the law to politics as the law's gain and the Senate's loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one point that Senator Alston makes and that is this: there must be some federal connotation before there is a Senate inquiry. Of course, that is absolutely true. Casinos have a great potential to attract organised crime and to be used for money <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="495"> laundering. Therefore the regulatory approach must be beyond reproach, especially as the Melbourne casino is the biggest casino in Australia. The development of such a facility has implications for our international reputation as a place to do business. The plethora of unanswered questions surrounding the Melbourne casino has the potential to do us international damage and therefore should be of concern to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Premier of Victoria has labelled the proposal to have a select committee as a witch&hyphen;hunt, as a kangaroo court, and as McCarthyist. We have had a lot of Senate inquiries over the years on a lot of esoteric subjects, all of which Premier Kennett has greeted with a mute response. We have heard Mr Kennett say, `No way will any Victorian minister or public servant give evidence before a Senate committee.' It was just a couple of years ago where an unctuous and pompous Premier Kennett demanded in the press that ex&hyphen;Premier Kirner and ex&hyphen;Treasurer Sheehan front before a Senate committee. He boasted on that occasion that his Treasurer, Mr Stockdale, had appeared before a Senate committee. He went on to say, `If there is a properly constituted committee, then members of the Victorian parliament should be prepared to attend.' Oh, what a difference a year or two makes! Now, having a Senate inquiry that impinges on some Victorian matters is the end of the world. A year or two ago it was to be greeted with absolute delight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, all this is avoidable. All the pitfalls that Senator Alston has pointed to, all his objections, are totally avoidable. This Senate committee can be rejected today or the inquiry can be aborted at any time through one simple act, and that simple act is for the Premier of Victoria to call an independent judicial inquiry or a royal commission into the circumstances which this inquiry before the Senate is about. That is the action we would prefer. Senator Alston has been able to get away, or hopes to get away, today with misquoting the leader of the Labor Party, Mr Beazley. That has been his central point from the opening of this debate right up till today. It is my contention that it would be preferable to have a Victorian initiated inquiry rather than a Senate inquiry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the philosophy of the Victorian government never to have an inquiry. There was no inquiry into the fracas between Bernard Bongiorno and Mrs Wade, the Attorney-General; no inquiry into KNF; no inquiry into Needham Advertising; no inquiry into police shootings. That is the philosophy of the Kennett government. It may be a good, pragmatic approach because, if you do not hold an inquiry, you cannot get any nasty results. But it is not one we in the federal parliament can endorse when our international reputation is at stake. Clearly, Mr Kennett has not even read the terms of inquiry because the actual inquiry is as to whether an inquiry is necessary. Read the terms of reference, those on the other side and Mr Kennett, because we do not seek to substitute ourselves for a royal commission or an independent judicial inquiry. We are simply investigating whether one is required and whether one is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great joke of all is the Premier of Victoria getting up and saying, `Look at the provisions. There can be in camera hearings.' Doesn't he realise that, 15 or 20 select committees you have moved to establish in the last five years have all had provision for in camera hearings? Doesn't he realise that? Doesn't he acknowledge that section 158 of his own casino act makes it a criminal offence for people to divulge material? Talk about a joke: objecting to in camera evidence! There has been a lot of speculation, so far, as to who would give evidence. There has been no decision made whatsoever on calling anyone. That is up to the committee to do. The Premier of Victoria and Senator Alston say, `There's nothing to investigate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the facts; let us have a look at the process. On 1 November 1991, the former Labor state government requested registration of expressions of interest for the licence to operate a casino in Melbourne. The Victorian Casino Control Authority received 23 expressions of interest. Twelve were invited to lodge supplementary submissions. On 27 November 1992, Crown, ITT Sheraton and Jupiters were short&hyphen;listed to bid for the casino. These bids were lodged on 30 April 1993. On 15 June, the Victorian Casino Control Authority decided that Crown and ITT Sheraton would be the final two bidders <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="496"> for the casino licence, and the government conducted an evaluative run&hyphen;off. That is a common practice in awarding tenders of this nature. I take no objection at all to that process. Final bids, following the preparation by the authority of a supplementary brief, were lodged on 30 August 1993. On 5 September 1993, the Victorian Casino Control Authority informed the government that Crown was a preferred applicant for the Melbourne casino licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At some stage, between 30 April and 30 August, Crown increased its offer to the tune of approximately $92 million. The core question is : how did it know to increase its bid by $92 million to match the other one? How did it know the exact figure? Apparently, they did not even have the cheek to go $3 million or $4 million over. They were so mean, they matched it absolutely. Did they know that ITT Sheraton had reduced their bid somewhat? Of course, we have the assurances from the Premier that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Casino Control Authority is doing an excellent job, independently and is not briefing members of the parliament or relevant ministers on anything other than the issues that have already been made public.</PARA>
<PARA>And the Treasurer, Mr Stockdale, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of the proposals made by the tenderers, nor would it be appropriate for me to be aware of them.</PARA>
<PARA>Two categorical statements: one from the Premier; one from the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Treasurer did not tell us that he had received a minute from Mr David Shand on this matter. The minute was directed to the attention of the Treasurer. It was headed `Casino Revenue' and began:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This note responds to your request for information on the current projections of casino revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Treasurer requested this information, having put on the public record they would have no knowledge of any of these issues. The minute noted at point four that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The attached sheet sets out the preliminary summary of cashflows from the three casino bidders, which contain a total of eight different options. (This information should of course be treated in the strictest confidence.) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>This is information the Treasurer was not supposed to have, which he publicly denied ever having. Why did he request this information? If this was going to be a clean process&mdash;a hands&hyphen;off process&mdash;why did he in fact ask for it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue, of course, is Mr Stockdale does not deny receiving this minute. He says he cannot recall. Mr Kennett says on his behalf, two days later, that he did not get it. But Mr Stockdale has never denied receiving this; he just cannot recall. Well, many things go over a minister's desk that are `hard to recall', but surely as Treasurer you would recall whether you saw a sensitive document on the potential revenues of a casino when you are trying to construct a budget. That is one thing you would recall. You might not recall some other esoteric subject but you would recall that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also interesting that the document released under freedom of information is a three&hyphen;page document. The first two pages are released. It is claimed that the third page is commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence. I have no doubt it is, but why not release that third page with that part blacked out? At least we would know whether the minute was ever signed off, or sighted, by Mr Stockdale. Of course, it is not produced under the excuse and veil of commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, which is understandable, but they could have blacked out that section. So we have not been given the opportunity so far to know whether Mr Stockdale signed off that minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 March 1996, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> alleged that information contained in the bids lodged with the VCCA was provided to members of cabinet. On 21 March, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> revealed that, according to staff of the VCCA, security procedures were not enforced. In response, Mr Stockdale stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not recall ever receiving an envelope direct from the casino authority. I might have done, but I don't recall that.</PARA>
<PARA>A second case of lapsed memory&mdash;he does not recall getting these envelopes from the casino authority. Then, on 29 March, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  revealed that four staff members of the VCCA <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="497"> would be willing to give evidence before a proper inquiry to the effect that six cabinet members, including the premier, were regularly sent confidential information from the authority during the bidding process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is where the problem starts&mdash;public denial from the premier, public denial from the Treasurer and then information provided that they did get that information. Therefore, it is worthy of suspicion that they may have got that information for the wrong reasons, having denied they ever had it, and may have put it to the wrong purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: did any of those with the information relating to the content of the bids supply that information to Crown Casino? Remember, the second bid by Crown Casino accurately jumps up by $92 million. How did they know what to jump up by? It can only be answered in terms of the very intimate relationship between the directors of Crown Casino, and especially the directors of Hudson Conway, and the Victorian Liberal establishment. There is a network of connections which raises the suspicion they may have been tipped off. If they were tipped off&mdash;I say `if' because we do not know&mdash;this is direct and utter corruption that would rot the core of any state government in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Crown Casino knew information that ITT&hyphen;Sheraton could never know, through its directors. Crown Casino knew the grand prix was coming to Melbourne. The other consortium in the bid was never told that. Crown Casino, through Hudson Conway and Ron Walker, knew that the new exhibition centre was going to be at Southbank. This is the one that is double the size of the MCG. All of this brings business to their area. They knew about this. The other poor mob, not being on the committee for Melbourne, or not being on the major projects committee, had no knowledge of this. That information could well have been used by Crown Casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 27 January 1994, Crown sent details of a proposal to expand the size of the permanent casino to the department of planning, including a proposal to increase the size of the hotel from 360 to 1,000 rooms. The proposal also increased the amount of gaming <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tables, the amount of machines and all these things. In other words, they have won the bid and, lo and behold, down the track, they apply to change the circumstances of what they are entitled to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the reaction? The casino authority initially says, `Oops, I'm not sure we can do that.' Suddenly, the Victorian government gets involved. They welcome the idea&mdash;an extra few storeys, a lot more gaming tables at a discounted rate that was not competitive with what exists in New South Wales and Queensland. `Let's get into this like a rat up a drainpipe.' In they go. They have a consultative process and suddenly, lo and behold, the new licence grants them more gaming tables, more hotel rooms, more picture theatres, more restaurants and everything else. How much has the cosy relationship between Lloyd Williams, Ron Walker and Jeff Kennett contributed to this particular style of government? These are questions that need to be answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other activities were mentioned by Senator Carr and objected to by Senator Alston. He cannot see the link. Yes, Mr Ron Walker did go personal guarantor for the federal Liberal Party for an overdraft of $10.6 million. There is nothing wrong with that, nothing at all&mdash;unless he was being, in other areas, paid back, unless he was being given assistance elsewhere. Then you have problems of probity. Then you have problems of Victoria Inc. coming to bear on these matters. I do not care that he raised $45 million for the Liberal Party in the last decade. I am damned if I know what he did with it. I am not concerned that he has gone personal guarantor for the federal Liberal Party. I am concerned, however, that, as he is on the major projects committee in Melbourne and a director of Hudson Conway, a key shareholder in Crown Casino, he may have been tipped off or his colleagues may have been tipped off by that cosy circle of people as to what the other bid was, and been able to take a massive advantage in a project that has now become a licence to print money, a project that is massively profitable and has already made paper profits at least for all those owners involved in that casino.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="498">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue apart from the tendering process goes to the question of whether Hudson Conway and their partners are good and proper people. Before I come to that, let us go back to one other aspect about the tendering process. The question arises that you have a consortium consisting of Hudson Conway and others. The TAB was part of that consortium. Why did it pull out? It has never been explained to us why the TAB pulled out of the consortium, all of which would have been publicly owned and would have returned some of the profits to the people of Victoria. Why did they pull out? Did Mr Lloyd Williams, a director of Hudson Conway and Vice&hyphen;Chairman of the TAB, have any influence on that? I understand he was not at the meeting that determined the TAB's pull&hyphen;out. But I have never heard a proper explanation from him as to whether he talked to his colleagues on the TAB board, including the then chairman, Mr Peter Scanlon, who has had to step aside, about these particular issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another curious thing is the role played by Federal Hotels in this. Federal Hotels were involved because they are the only ones in the consortia to have hotel management skills, and they pulled out. They also had a fairly good track record in terms of probity in running casinos in Tasmania. Yet they also disappeared and Consolidated Press came in. These are difficult questions that need to be answered in all this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I move to the second major emphasis of my speech, and that is as to whether Hudson Conway is a reputable company within the meaning of the casino act to be involved in this particular casino. One of the first very curious things about it is that it has been alleged that on 20 May 1993 the state government instructed the Gas and Fuel Corporation to renege on its contract with Gleem&mdash;Gleem is a subsidiary of Hudson Conway&mdash;for the construction of its new office building up in the old Commonwealth site of Spring Street. The rescission of this contract has given rise to civil action by Gleem against the SECV. But it basically freed up the capital resources of Hudson Conway to increase its bid for the casino licence. So here you have one arm of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government directing Hudson Conway, or Gleem, not to proceed with a building&mdash;and they were also able to get compensation for that&mdash;which released capital so they could bid into the casino thing&mdash;very curious indeed. I want to know if this was the intent of that instruction by the Victorian government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also some concerns in terms of the repute of this company. According to section 9 of the Casino Control Act Victoria 1991, the VCCA must not grant an application for a casino licence unless it is satisfied that each applicant and associate of an applicant is of good repute, having regard to character, honesty and integrity. In 1972 Mr Lloyd Williams built two blocks of flats in Paisley Street, South Yarra without a building licence or planning permit and was required by the Supreme Court to pull down one of those blocks. In 1981 at the Winneke royal commission into the BLF Lloyd Williams gave evidence that he had provided benefits to Mr Norman Gallagher from Lloyd William's company Dominion Properties Ltd, which was in breach of section 175 of the Crimes Act. I am wondering to what extent did the Victorian Casino Control Authority take into record what was basically a criminal act then. I am also wondering whether the licensees provided a full and proper range of information to the casino authority about those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But more importantly, on 25 September 1995 the state government lodged a document in the Victorian Supreme Court alleging that Gleem Pty Ltd&mdash;that is, a wholly owned subsidiary, I understand, of Hudson Conway&mdash;obtained a financial advantage by deception in contravention of sections 321M and 82 of the Crimes Act and also that they gave false documents attempting to defraud or deceive the SECV in contravention of section 178 of the Crimes Act. The shareholders of Gleem Pty Ltd were, at all relevant times, Mr Ron Walker and Mr Lloyd Williams. Does the Victorian Casino Control Authority continue to be satisfied that Lloyd Williams and Ron Walker are persons of good repute within the meaning of the act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the information lodged with the Supreme Court by the state government it is also <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="499"> alleged that a Hudson Conway officer made an unwarranted demand with menaces in contravention of section 87 of the Crimes Act. This officer worked as the project officer `general manager construction' for Crown Casino. The Victorian police and the Victorian Casino and Gaming Authority are investigating the potential criminal offences arising from the lodging of these documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third very curious thing about this is the interaction of two small companies, that is, Coulson and Spaces Pty Ltd. Coulson Constructions Pty Ltd is a small company that specialises in commercial fitouts. How is it that this company, which performed work at both the temporary and permanent Crown Casino sites, also carried out domestic fitouts and renovation works for the partner of Graham Holdsworth, the manager of design of the Crown Casino&mdash;and we would like to know: was the value of this benefit part of his salary and, if so, was it fully disclosed to the board?&mdash;the home of the Premier of Victoria in Surrey Hills, Mr Ron Walker's home at Toorak, who is a director of Crown Casino and Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party, and Mr Andrew Peacock's home in Richmond?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real question here is not that these companies should be doing work for these people, although it is rather remarkable that such a small company should have a coincidence of clients unless those clients talk to each other&mdash;which again is explainable and fair. The real question is that, if they are doing work at the behest of Crown Casino, at the behest of Hudson Conway, for these individuals, are they doing it at full tote odds? That is the critical question. The $300,000 renovations done out at the premier's home, if he paid $300,000 in full for them, I would ask no question about that. But did he get a discount&mdash;it is a wonderful word, `discount'&mdash;on the work? And did the directors and did the former Leader of the Opposition get a discount?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a bit about discounts in recent days. Mr Alistair Drysdale, special adviser to the premier and then a few days later special adviser on gaming matters, got a big discount on his house at the `Domain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Kremlin' up in St Kilda Road. Mr Reith got a big discount&mdash;nothing to do with the casino; I make no connection there at all. Hudson Conway are good at giving discounts. With their use of Coulson's in all these jobs, who got discounts?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad my colleague from Victoria has reminded me. For these very discounts at the Taj Mahal on McLachlan's Beach, Mr Norm Gallagher went to jail, and quite properly so. So these are where the serious connections come in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the question of Spaces Pty Ltd, another very small firm that has performed work for the government of Victoria on the redesign of the premier's offices at 1 Treasury Place, including that magnificent table and tablecloth and all the rest of it in the Heath Room. They also did the Liberal Party headquarters at Menzies Avenue, Canberra&mdash;of course at the recommendation of Mr Ron Walker. They also did the home of the Premier of Victoria in Surrey Hills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are so many interconnections here&mdash;between Crown Casino, Hudson Conway, Gleem, Coulson's, Spaces and the bagman for the Liberal Party&mdash;that they cannot just be dismissed as absolute coincidences. Senator Alston said, `We don't want to inquire into Liberal Party fundraising,' but the question is: why was a $100,000 donation from Hudson Conway deleted from the Liberal Party's returns one day before the accounts were published?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also want to know whether Mr Ron Walker gave a guarantee for $10.8 million to the federal Liberal Party. Was he ever paid off by favours from the Liberal Party? These are the sorts of questions that cannot be dismissed by easy, slimy, barrister's tricks from Senator Alston. Something stinks in Victoria. An inquiry, properly constituted and properly gone about, will at least answer those questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the life of me, I cannot understand why Premier Kennett resists an inquiry, why he will not set one up. If, as his thesis is, there is nothing wrong, he is in for a big political <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="500"> victory. He is going to crush <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>, he is going to humiliate the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, he is going to knock over Terry McCrann. He is in for the biggest win in history if there is no evidence to be produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why not have an inquiry, himself? Why not have a royal commission? If you do not like royal commissions&mdash;and I don't because of their habit of taking hearsay evidence and because of their cost&mdash;appoint a QC and have an independent, judicial inquiry. For heaven's sake, do not leave it to the Senate to have to investigate this. But if no&hyphen;one else will do it, we must look at these issues to take some responsibility for the protection of our international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will crystallise the issues. First, were the tendering processes perverted and how did Hudson Conway and Crown know to come in and up their bid by $92 million? The only potential for corruption at the political level was if the politicians told them. They deny ever having the information yet there is a lot of contrary evidence on the record that they got such information. The second underlying issue is whether Hudson Conway is a fit and proper company to do business in a casino. I must say there have been very substantial doubts raised on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a cautionary note, any Senate committee set up of this nature should, as much as possible, require rules of evidence and should be conscious that the members of the committee are politicians and therefore subject to biases&mdash;and we all are, even though it is denied over the years in inquiries. Therefore, a lot of effort has to be made by whoever chairs this committee so that it does not become McCarthyist and a witch&hyphen;hunt. If that is done, Australia will be better off. I urge the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey Kennett, to set up an independent inquiry as soon as possible into these matters and relieve us of the burden of doing so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me deal, first, with a couple of the matters that were raised seriously by a man for whom I have a great deal of respect, Senator Robert Ray. While I have respect for Senator Ray, I must say that he was totally in error&mdash;and he knows it&mdash;in what he was saying today. He said, for example, that there is a Commonwealth role because in casinos there is a capacity for money laundering. He alleged it goes on and I certainly would not deny that. Is that a good reason for the federal government to be involved in horse racing? Horse racing is the classic money laundering event. I can remember that the former New South Wales Labor minister for corrective services, before he spent several years in the cooler, always managed to have money because of his `wins on the races'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, former minister Senator Ray is saying there is a justification for the federal government to be involved in casinos because of money laundering. That sort of specious nonsense demonstrates Senator Ray's lack of real commitment. He knows that is nonsense. He has been forced into this debate. It was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="501"> evident from his previous comments that he had no heart for this inquiry. A quotation showing that the great bulk of members of the Labor Party&mdash;those decent elements of it&mdash;have no heart for this matter comes from Michelle Grattan of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> this week. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then there was a question mark over Labor support for it. Victorian ALP Senator Kim Carr pushed the proposal remorselessly, strongly backing a move by Democrat Senator Sid Spindler. But some in the Opposition were less enthusiastic; they were willing to rattle the sabre for the state election, but would have been happy enough to drop the idea later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They worried about one level of government investigating another; they wondered whether it was worth the ALP Opposition devoting its limited resources to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume that means intellectual resources; they certainly are limited. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the pro&hyphen;inquiry lobby prevailed. After today's vote, the Senate committee will be on a fishing trip.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that. Michelle Grattan is exactly right. It is a fishing trip that was, in effect, admitted by Senator Ray in his contribution. Senator Ray asked a lot of questions. He said, `There is a question about this; there is a question about something else.' In conspiracy theories there are questions about everything. The fact is that this government will not participate in what is a fishing trip.</PARA>

What I want to deal with in discussing this question of hypocrisy is that these inquiries must not, as Senator Ray said in his warning, be used improperly.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Australians know a stunt when they see one.</PARA>
<PARA>This is taken from an article by Mr Greg Craven, who is a reader in law at Melbourne University and a former Victorian crown counsel. He clearly states the reality of this situation. In fact, I think there is so much <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="502"> good stuff in this article that I would like to read a bit of it into the record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the mother of all stunts is rattling down the road from Canberra. Stand by for the amazing Kim Carr and his all&hyphen;performing Senate inquiry into the Crown casino.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This planned inquiry has all the ingredients of a travelling medicine show. As Victorian politicians cannot be forced to give evidence it is about as much a genuine probe into the casino tendering process as the IRA is a children's charity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far, the allegations about the casino would not justify an investigation by Inspector Gadget and a retired sniffer dog, let alone Kim Carr, Sid Spindler and a troop of other senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All we have left is one disgruntled bidder, a gaggle of disapproving Left&hyphen;wing clerics and a couple of embittered Casino and Gaming Authority employees so sure of their case that they are not prepared to be identified.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What it is about is an attempt by the Left of the ALP and the Democrats to do as much political damage to the Kennett Government as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, Senator Carr and the Democrats will put the Senate committee together so they have a majority. Just as naturally, the electorate will treat the committee's findings with the sort of respect usually reserved for dead fish.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They will be cross&hyphen;examined and publicly belittled.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to stress that: `They will be cross-examined and publicly belittled.' He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Carr and Spindler know that even if they cannot find what they are digging for, they will have a lot of fun throwing the dirt around.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carr has thrown plenty of dirt around today, unsubstantiated and under the protection of parliamentary privilege. All I can say is that I commend Greg Craven for that excellent article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the motion recommending the appointment of a select committee. First of all, there is no basis for the inquiry in the sense that it relates to any federal matters. As to whether Australia's overseas reputation has been affected, the inquiry into the New South Wales police force affects Australia's reputation overseas. Does that merit a federal inquiry of any kind? That is one of the most nonsensical grabbles. It is even worse than the way the former federal government used the external affairs power to grab as many powers as it could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned with one element of Senator Spindler's motion. If the opposition are genuine in proceeding with this inquiry, and if they are not only paying lip-service to Senator Carr's alleged support for propriety, I draw their attention to paragraph 10 of the motion, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the committee have power to appoint subcommittees consisting of three or more of its members, and to refer to any such subcommittee any of the matters which the committee is empowered to consider, and that the quorum of a subcommittee be a majority of the senators appointed to the subcommittee.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that the government has a minority on that committee. There is nothing in that paragraph to prevent this committee, if formed, from appointing a subcommittee with no government members on it&mdash;despite the recommendation of the Senate Procedure Committee that it should be obligatory for a government member to be a member of any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="503"> such subcommittee. Recognising the political nature and the dishonesty of this whole process, I suggest to those people foolish enough to support this motion that they at least fix up that element because it would be grossly improper for such a subcommittee to be set up.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gather from that interjection that they have no intention of doing so, despite the clear recommendation of the Procedure Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us have a look at the allegations that Senator Carr has made. He asked whether there was `insider trading'. He said that these various things involve `criminal actions'. These are the comments that Senator Carr has made under the protection of parliamentary privilege. Isn't it curious that during the soccer inquiry he made a very strong point of saying there should not be any allegations of that sort? The reason he gave was that it could damage the capacity of the authorities to proceed against such people. I will quote directly from Senator Carr's minority report on the soccer inquiry. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was continual mention made by witnesses during the course of the Committee's inquiry of possible commission of serious crimes . . . including non&hyphen;payment of tax on significant international transfer fees; alleged bribes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>All the stuff that Senator Carr is now alleging. The minority report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clerk of the Senate gave advice that evidence before a Parliamentary committee could not be used in judicial proceedings and therefore, a committee's inquiry could make it difficult for law enforcement authorities to conduct successful investigations into the same matters. Defence counsel would obviously use the fact that a matter had been uncovered by a committee to obstruct prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA>This is from Senator Carr, the man who is now generating this inquiry. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was conceivable that a guilty party could intentionally raise a matter before a committee to evade subsequent conviction. Therefore, there was a distinct possibility that the Committee's pursuit of its inquiry would impede inquiries into the same matters by law enforcement authorities, and subsequent judicial proceedings. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Isn't it incredible that Senator Carr has made these allegations, under parliamentary privilege, of illegality and of criminal activity, yet he says that allegations of that kind coming before a committee could well prejudice legal action being taken? I recognise that in this instance Senator Spindler may well be the `innocent abroad' that I mentioned earlier rather than the co&hyphen;conspirator. However, if he has not focused his mind on that issue, maybe it is about time he started doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other matters which I think are worth mentioning regarding Senator Carr's hypocritical position on this matter. In terms of complaints about the soccer inquiry, he said that the inquiry was `entirely an issue of civil liberties and the proper use of a Senate committee.' In his minority report he also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sensationalised claims make good media stories, but unfounded allegations and malicious rumours have made persons prominent in soccer the object of public vilification for which there is no effective redress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should not confuse the "public interest" with the partisan political advantage of individual politicians.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the quaintest quotes of all time&mdash;Senator Carr saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should not confuse the "public interest" with the partisan political advantage of individual politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what this inquiry is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude with a couple of other quotes on this matter. The message that this inquiry is totally improper was reinforced in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> article by Greg Craven, and I was intrigued to note that both Senator Carr and Senator Ray quoted from Terry McCrann in a very favourable way as if he entirely supported their position. It is extraordinary that both of them managed to omit this key sentence from Terry McCrann's article, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a federal inquiry into what is unquestionably an internal state matter is intrinsically inadequate. And in a strict sense, arguably improper.</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't it remarkable that neither of them read that sentence from McCrann's comments? It shows the sort of dishonesty that is central to this recommendation. This is a dishonest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="504"> proposal. It is a disgrace that it has been put up here, particularly in terms of Senator Carr's claims that these committees provide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an opportunity for damaging allegations to be made under the protection of parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>I will make one final quote from Senator Carr's remarks. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations arising from the Committee's investigations of alleged instances of conflict of interest leave individuals' reputations sullied, even where no findings have been made against them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the likely outcome of this inquiry will be. Allegations will be made and publicity will be given to them. And when this committee reports that no further action should be taken&mdash;as I expect it will&mdash;those reputations will remain sullied because of the allegations made against those people. At Senator Carr's initiative, those allegations will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The burden that will be imposed on this committee to behave itself in this kind of political climate is overwhelming. I, frankly, do not believe that the opposition and the Democrats, who have the majority on this committee, have the integrity to ensure that propriety will reign if this committee proceeds.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Ray said quite properly, this is the second best option. The appropriate option is for the Victorian government to set up its own inquiry. If nothing is to be feared from this inquiry, it will simply result in a huge political boost for the Victorian Premier and, of course, derision and ignominy for the critics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt in my mind that, if I were a Victorian state government minister, I would not have to be subpoenaed to appear before this Senate inquiry. I would have a letter written already offering my attendance at the inquiry so I could make my case, and I will tell you why. In respect of what is already on the public record, the deal over the Crown Casino in Victoria stinks on ice. It is as simple as that. If it is not corrected, it will continue to stink on ice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested to hear Senator Baume quote at length from the article referring to Tim Costello as a left wing cleric. He did not bother to mention that this non-rating, left wing cleric just happens to be the brother of the Australian Treasurer (Mr Costello). I mention that because of what Tim Costello said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, and that deserves to be repeated here. He was spot on when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thanks, particularly to the Premier of this State, we have placed gaming and Crown Casino right at the centre of the culture, and right at the centre of State Government taxes, so that a State Government that starts to sponsor gaming has become a State Government in my view that is now being sponsored by gaming particularly sponsored by Crown Casino. It's caught and corrupted so you have almost government in this state now by Crown, for Crown and of Crown instead of by the people for the people and of the people. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="505"> </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Spindler, I know that you are amused. What precisely is the `vision' of a casino? The `vision' of a casino is that there is a sucker born every minute, and the job of a casino is to relieve the mugs of as much of their disposable income as it possibly can. Some vision!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a wowser. I am not saying that people should not have the opportunity to gamble. I come from the Northern Territory where we bet on two flies crawling up a wall. I loath and detest gambling personally. It is a game for mugs. I learnt very early in my youth when SP bookies were the go that it was the bookies who drove around in the big, flash cars not the punters. I learnt that lesson very early in my life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people want to gamble, fine. Fancy an over&hyphen;the&hyphen;top, absurd, ridiculous statement by the Premier of Victoria that this, the biggest casino, the biggest repository for mugs in the country to be relieved of their incomes, had a `vision'. Some vision for Victoria!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that what is on the public record already indicates that the deal stunk. If I were a Victorian minister, I would not be able to wait for the opportunity to get into this Senate committee. Because, as Senator Ray said, quite correctly, if nothing is evidenced in this committee that indicates there was any impropriety in respect of the casino, the only thing that will happen is that Jeff Kennett's reputation will come out of this enhanced and his critics precisely the reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The reason that I came into this chamber to speak in this debate at all is because of the casual and gross defamation of the former member for the Northern Territory by Senator Richard Alston. Again, look at the hypocrisy of the words just uttered by Senator Baume. He talked about the coward's castle of parliamentary privilege. I agree with Senator Baume on that sentiment. I am here, having spoken to Warren Snowdon about that outra geous defamation of him based, as I am now about to demonstrate, on total ignorance of the facts of the issuing of the casino licence at Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite Senator Alston to take that painful walk 20 feet to those doors and say precisely outside those brass doors just over there what he said in here an hour ago about Warren Snowdon. Unfortunately for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon is no longer the member for the Northern Territory. I deeply regret to say that, not so much on Warren's account but on the Territory's account. It is sad that he is no longer the member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I mention that is that one of the things about him not being the member is that he has not yet settled into another occupation, and Richard Alston's house and half of Richard Alston's bank balance he would find very handy at the moment. His opportunity of getting them in a defamation action against Richard Alston would be a laid down misere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would invite Senator Richard Alston, in terms of that gross defamation in here this morning, to step outside parliament and say outside that door what he said in here. I would be very glad for my colleague if he did that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston said that Warren Snowdon lobbied ministers to ensure that Indonesian interests got the casino licence at Christmas Island. What a nonsensical, apart from false, statement by Senator Richard Alston. Why would Warren Snowdon bother lobbying himself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As it happens&mdash;and Senator Alston is utterly ignorant of this, obviously&mdash;it was Warren Snowdon who was the government representative who signed the casino licence on the recommendation of the departments who conducted an absolutely arm's length, transparent assessment process. It was Warren Snowdon&mdash;clearly, Richard Alston is not even aware of it&mdash;that actually signed the licence on behalf of the government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="506">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would Warren Snowdon bother lobbying himself? It is a piece of nonsense. Senator Alston does not even know the slightest information about how that casino licence was granted. I would be delighted if it was canvassed in this committee. If government senators wished to canvass it, I would be very pleased indeed if they did, because I know that Warren Snowdon does not have anything to fear. Richard Alston, I have to say, would be in a very difficult position if he said outside this chamber what he said in here this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A simple telephone call, Senator Troeth, by Senator Richard Alston to your government's now department would have given him the information that the department carried out an absolutely, arm's length, transparent and scrupulous assessment of that casino licence before it was granted. It had nothing whatever to do with Warren Snowdon, who did not lobby any minister of that government. Why would he have to, seeing he was the signatory on the licence? Clearly, Senator Alston is not even aware of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would suggest to Senator Alston that he make that telephone call to the department now. When his now Territory's department advises him of the process that was used, a retraction would be entirely appropriate in here. I have no doubt if it is not made, Warren Snowdon, who is now a private citizen, will seek, under the rules of this Senate, to ensure that such a correction is made to the parliamentary record. It was a cowardly and casual defamation by Senator Alston in here this morning, based not only on no facts but on no information that Senator Alston even bothered to obtain from the relevant government department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most telling and correct statement made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program in respect of casinos, and in particular their relationship with governments, was two words uttered by Sir Laurence Street. In fact, what Sir Laurence Street said on that program was the usual careful and considered language that he habitually uses. I noted today, along with Senator Carr, his call today for the matter of casinos and their regulation to be a national issue and not a state issue. There is no other <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business&mdash;and I would like to get a denial from anyone in the government with a straight face to this&mdash;that a government engages in that is anything like a casino.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Casinos stand out on their own. If you want a very good example of just how sensitive an issue casino licensing and practice is, I suggest you go to the United States. Have a talk in particular to the Nevada gaming authorities about just how scrupulous you have to be about the awarding of casino licences and their current practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had some experience in this regard, many years ago as a member of the Northern Territory parliament, with the outrageous events involved in the ousting of Federal Pacific Hotels, an Australian operator, from the casino in Darwin and the introduction of overseas operators into that casino, Pratts and Aspinalls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the time in the Northern Territory parliament on the compulsory acquisition legislation, which the then conservative Chief Minister introduced into the Northern Territory's parliament, with great respect to my colleague Senator Carr&mdash;I blush for having said this so many years ago&mdash;not even the Victorian Left on its worst day would have introduced such legislation. And it is a fact, they wouldn't have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard of compulsory acquisition legislation for public purposes like high schools, hospitals and things. But the Northern Territory government on that occasion introduced a compulsory acquisition bill to compulsorily acquire $50 million worth of casino property from a private operator, not to use it for a public purpose but to hand it over to two other private operators of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of appalling dealings between casino operators and governments in this country goes back a very long way. I support Sir Laurence Street's call today for a national interest in the respective casinos. They are like no other business. The very nature of the casino business cries out for what Sir Laurence Street said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. Sir Laurence Street was asked, `How clean must a casino operator be?' He replied, `Squeaky clean.' It is precisely correct that, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="507"> because of the opportunities that exist in the casino business and their relationships with governments, these operations should be squeaky clean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude by repeating the sentiments of Senator Ray. We on this side of the House would far prefer the Victorian Premier to set up an inquiry of his own than us do it. Jeff Kennett should welcome the inquiry. I would personally like to issue an invitation to Jeff Kennett to willingly appear before the committee. Knowing Jeff Kennett to be the assertive, abrasive, up&hyphen;front character he is, why would he not want to be in there boots and all, making us look like fools and making himself look like a hero, if he has nothing to fear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that this myriad of connections&mdash;and they are already on the public record; they were outlined by  Senator Ray&mdash;demand some explanation which so far has not been given. The Victorian government and everyone attached to it will have an opportunity, if the Senate inquiry is set up, to correct the record and make themselves look like heroes and the Senate inquiry look foolish. That opportunity may be before them if Jeff Kennett does not do what is still open to him to do&mdash;that is, set up an inquiry himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is already on the public record, in respect of the deal that was done in Victoria, stinks on ice. It demands a public explanation. Members of the public are not mugs. Those opposite made references to majority reports. We can also have minority reports in Senate committees. Members of the public will be able to judge the evidence that is given before that Senate committee and make up their own minds about whether or not the establishment of the committee was justified. I think the case for setting it up is overwhelming.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real reason for setting up this committee of inquiry is, as Senator Alston pointed out, a grubby political exercise. I would go further and say that it is is a political stunt by Senator Carr to divert attention from the present woes of the ALP in Victoria. Senator Carr knows very well that every day in that democratic organ, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, there is a list of state ALP members, if not federal ALP members, that various factions of your party wish to remove.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your Victorian state leader, Mr Brumby, tried to make the casino an issue during the election and he failed. It is not an issue that is of importance to Victorian voters. If it was, why did they vote overwhelmingly for the coalition to be returned to the government benches? Your own party has commented on the low profile of the casino as an issue for Victorians. It is reported that Senator Conroy pointed this out to Mr Brumby and castigated him for attempting to make it an election issue. Why are you doing it? You simply want to remove the media focus on the ALP. Even those democratic organs, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>newspaper and ABC radio, have taken up the woes <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="508"> of your party, and not the casino, as something that occupies the minds of Victorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr attempted to put a statesmanlike constitutional facade on this by continually quoting Sir Laurence Street, just as Senator Bob Collins did, but again he resorted to personal vilification. Senator Collins talked about senators going outside the chamber and making their remarks there. You should be called to account for that. You called in every mention of any controversy that the Kennett government has been involved in over the last four years and attempted to make them an issue. Ninety per cent of them had nothing whatever to do with the casino inquiry. I would like to see Senator Carr go outside and make the remarks he made about certain people there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has also resulted in the political persecution of a successful company. How many Labor senators have ever run a business? How many of them have ever put risk capital into a business, in the way that the casino proprietors have done? It is no wonder Labor senators cannot understand the business expertise of those who choose to run small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do those opposite understand that the casino employs thousands of Victorians, particularly young Victorians, who thereby get a start in the tourism and hospitality business? It is also a way of rebuilding Victorian business after the rust&hyphen;bucket years of Labor administration. At least Victorian business is now getting up and running again. The casino has been voted a success by the thousands of Victorians who choose to patronise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to what Senator Collins said about Reverend Tim Costello's remarks, the choice that is made by Victorians and others who choose to patronise the casino is a moral choice that is made by any individual. They are not compelled by any government to visit the casino and contribute to its earnings. Every individual makes a choice about whether or not they are going to go to the casino. That is up to them. It has nothing to do with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hudson Conway won this contract through a tendering process that was laid down by the previous Labor administration, so let us see <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Labor senators who are on this inquiry carefully take people through that tendering process. It will be seen to be a transparent process that was adhered to. You have nothing to run on in this inquiry, and you know it. This is a grubby, political exercise designed for political ends, and it should be opposed by the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to speak in this debate at all, but some of the contributions to this debate have caused me to exercise my right to speak and to draw some particular matters of serious importance to the attention of this chamber. I first of all say that I am not a wowser. I do not have an anti-casino mentality. On three separate occasions I have spent $10 on gambling in the casino at Wrest Point during ALP national conferences. Although I am not a high roller, I have gambled in a casino three times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not a non-gambler in that sense. Therefore, I do not have anything against casinos. But I do believe that, where governments set up casinos and issue licences, who obtains that licence should be subject to the greatest and most detailed scrutiny. There should be attaching to the issuance of licences no sense whatever that the operation of a casino will be done in any way other than with the maximum probity and in the most legal and efficient way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have in Victoria, though, is a smell, which has been detailed by a number of senators in this debate in considerable detail, that hangs over the licence for the casino in Victoria. There has been a failure of political will or a refusal to act, which is probably more the direct description, in Victoria to in fact investigate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Australian Democrats have moved a motion in this chamber&mdash;I am happy to support it and the opposition will support it&mdash;in order to see that this smell can be removed by opening the doors and windows of what happened in Victoria and letting the cold wind of an inquiry blow through to let the facts out, let the judgments be made on those facts and let the issue be settled. If there are substantial issues of wrongdoing here&mdash;there are certainly substantial questions but whether <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="509"> they are issues subject to the inquiry is another thing&mdash;let those be brought out and let them be properly and fully dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of rampant contradictions and a number of rampant loss of memories by key players and key companies in the case of this casino. My real reason for rising in this debate is as a Western Australian senator who has seen allegations made about public conduct, has witnessed at close quarters a major royal commission in his state, the royal commission into WA Inc., and has seen those proceedings go forward and be concluded and the reputations of individuals be affected by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had in this debate today was, I believe, a desperate but nonetheless malicious attempt by speakers from the government side&mdash;in particular, the key contributor to whom I refer is now back in the chamber: Senator Alston&mdash;to oppose the idea of this inquiry. They then went on with what might be termed broadly as an effort to threaten the opposition or stare them down about pursuing this inquiry by talking about what else might be done within the terms of reference that Senator Alston alleged would affect people on the Labor side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins has dealt with the allegations about the Northern Territory. In the case of Western Australia, allegations were also made about the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley. I want to deal with those. They are despicable allegations by Senator Alston. They have no factual basis. They are a desperate attempt by him to try to intimidate the opposition to not proceed in a matter of public honesty. They will not work. But, since they have been put on the record by Senator Alston, I contacted Mr Beazley's office and I can tell the Senate that the allegations made by Senator Alston in the debate today are fundamentally and absolutely untrue, that Mr Beazley has never been involved in the issues to which Senator Alston referred. I believe the words that Senator Alston uttered were meant maliciously and were meant to damage the reputation of Mr Beazley. They were done under parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, with Senator Collins, suggest to Senator Alston that the only honest and fair thing now <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> open to him is to withdraw those allegations. If he declines to withdraw those allegations, he should take that 20-metre walk out of this chamber and repeat them outside of the area of public privilege and let the law then take its course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having put on the record Mr Beazley's position, I do not want to dwell on that any longer. It is absolutely clear that these are malicious allegations meant to damage Mr Beazley. It is also absolutely clear that they are a red herring meant to deflect public attention from the nature of what has happened in Victoria and the need for this inquiry. If we were to wheel this debate around about Western Australia, Mr Beazley, et cetera, the need for this inquiry would be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that the allegations made are fundamentally and absolutely untrue. In the case of Western Australia there has been a royal commission; a royal commission which embraced the granting of the licence for the Burswood Island Casino and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the licence. Mr Beazley's name was in no sense canvassed in that royal commission in relation to that matter&mdash;nor would it be and nor should it have been because he had nothing to do with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government to trot this thing out now is, I think, a despicable performance, a reflection on their ethics, and something that the Prime Minister should do something about if the individuals concerned here in this chamber are not prepared to do the honourable thing themselves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to as much of the debate as I can. There certainly have been very serious allegations raised in this chamber&mdash;and, indeed, elsewhere&mdash;about the tendering process for the Victorian Crown Casino. I am, of course, aware of the reports that have been published in the media, Terry McCrann's report in particular. Those sorts of reports raise questions about the propriety of particular individuals and, indeed, the whole process itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am perfectly well aware that Senator Spindler has attempted to broaden the terms of reference for the inquiry from those which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="510"> he originally sought to have put down. I acknowledge that, and it goes some of the way towards dealing with a few of the problems, for example, the legal problems that may well be involved. I believe that the Senate and I have a responsibility to ensure that, in establishing an inquiry with these terms of reference, we are acting with propriety, that we are acting legally and, furthermore, that we are acting effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the first point, I feel that we would be acting legally. I should not think that there would be a successful challenge to this particular committee on legal and constitutional grounds. However, to discover whether we are acting efficiently and effectively&mdash;and thus with that type of propriety&mdash;I would like to canvass the matter.

The power has long been regarded as essential for a legislature. The power is, in the last resort, dependent upon the power to punish contempts, in so far as the penal power is the means by which the Houses may enforce the attendance of witnesses, the answering of questions and the production of documents.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The power to conduct inquiries is usually not exercised by the Houses themselves, but is delegated to committees by giving witnesses and the production of documents. A major concomitant of that delegation is that proceedings in parliamentary committees are proceedings in Parliament, and the immunity from impeachment or question in the course attaches to words uttered in committee proceedings by members and witnesses and to the production of documents to committees, as declared by the 1987 Act.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The power may be confined to inquiries into subjects in respect of which the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to legislate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Although the question has not been adjudicated, there is probably an implicit limitation on the power of the Houses to summon witnesses, in relation to members of the other House or of a house of a state or territory legislature. Standing order 178 provides that if the attendance of a member or officer of the House of Representatives is required by the Senate or a Senate committee a message shall be sent to the House requesting that the House give leave for the member or the officer to attend. This standing order reflects a rule of courtesy and comity between the Houses, and as such it ought properly to be observed in relation to houses of state and territory parliaments. It may be that these limitations on the power to summon witnesses in relation to other houses have the force of law, and may extend to officers of state and territory governments. The Select Committee on the Australian Loan Council, in its interim report in March 1993, accepted advice by the Clerk of the Senate that it could not summon witnesses members of the House of Representatives and of the houses of state parliaments. The committee recommended that the Senate ask the various houses to require their members to attend and give evidence before the committee (the advice also indicated that the houses have the power so to compel their members, but that question also has not been adjudicated). The Senate passed a resolution and requests were sent to the various houses accordingly. The various houses declined to compel their members to attend. (5/10/93, J.566; 7/10/93, J.608; 20/10/93, J.657; 21/10/93, J.683; see also Chapter 17, Witnesses) For an instruction by the Senate to a committee to invite the Prime Minister and other ministers to give evidence, see 9/3/95, J.3063&hyphen;4.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It must be noted, however, that article 4, section 4 of the US Constitution, whereby the United States guarantees to every state a republican form of government, gives the Congress a general power of supervision <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="511"> of state governments which the Australian Parliament does not possess.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To quote from Odgers, under the heading `Power to conduct inquiries' on page 51 of electronic Odgers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Each House of the Parliament has the power to require the attendance of persons and production of documents and to take evidence under oath. This power supports one of the major functions of the Houses: that of inquiring into matters of concern as a necessary preliminary to debating those matters and legislating in respect of them. The power has long been regarded as essential for a legislature. The power is, in the last resort, dependent upon the power to punish contempts, in so far as that penal power is the means by which the Houses may enforce attendance of witnesses, the answering of questions and the production of documents.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Odgers then goes into matters relating to the production of documents, which I will come back to later. Odgers also says:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The power may be confined to inquiries into subjects in respect of which the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clearly, the legal basis for the establishment of any committee must be that the Commonwealth parliament does have the power to legislate in respect of these matters. Quite clearly, that is one of the reasons Senator Spindler has mentioned the corporations power in these terms of reference; he has referred to international credibility, and so on.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we can say that it is in our particular legislative responsibility. The corporations power provides us with the ability to enact legislation in respect of these matters, although as yet we have not done so. We can talk about taxation and international money matters, and so on. I do not believe that there is any legislative problem, and I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> refer to the whistleblowers select committee as an example. If the unresolved whistleblowers select committee can get away with being legal, I should think almost anything can. On that ground there appears to be little problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On another ground, however, as to whether the committee will be able to deal with matters effectively, I wonder whether we are doing the right thing in establishing such a committee. Already the Victorian government has suggested that it will not cooperate with the committee. If that is the case, then the committee will simply hear evidence from other people and you will not get to the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Cook said, `By this committee we want to get at the facts.' How can you get at the facts if Victorian public servants, let alone ministers of the Crown, fail to give evidence to the committee? I do not think you are going to get the facts under those circumstances. Yes, the committee does have the power to demand the production of documents and to require evidence to be given under oath; but if these documents are refused, as they are likely to be refused, then what next? Yes, we do appear to have the power to then subpoena witnesses and to require their attendance. But page 52 of the electronic Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Although the question has not been adjudicated, there is probably an implicit limitation on the power of the Houses to summon witnesses, in relation to members of the other House or of a house of a state or territory legislature.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">That deals with the people the committee may wish to require to attend to give evidence&mdash;people in another legislature, like the House of Assembly in Victoria. But, as to summoning witnesses who are employees of the Victorian state government, I think there would be a very messy situation indeed. There would be a rather large question mark over the effectiveness of the committee if we were not able to ensure that those documents were provided to the committee and the public servants were required to attend. I think you would get into a very difficult situation there. I do feel that we should think again carefully about this.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate has been very useful in highlighting certain alleged problems relating to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="512"> the tendering process. There has been comment made during the debate as to whether we are competent to deal with these matters, which include allegations of impropriety, if not criminal activities, and whether the committee is then able to conduct the inquiry with the proper application of the principles of natural justice. I would be a bit worried about that, frankly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly the best result in this regard is an inquiry by a royal commissioner or some sort of judicial inquiry. I know Senator Spindler will come back and say, `There is Buckley's hope of that occurring in Victoria.' I agree that this is a problem, and it is not essentially only Victoria's problem but everybody's problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As members of parliament, as members of the Senate, we have a duty to ensure that what we do in establishing our committees&mdash;the way we establish them, the terms of reference we give them and the conduct of the inquiries&mdash;is entirely appropriate to our functions. Frankly, yes, this is a problem in Victoria principally and that is mainly what it is all about. We will be skating on thin ice if we proceed with this inquiry, because of the factors I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I am very concerned about the effects of the casino culture, not only in Victoria but elsewhere. Each member of the Senate would have heard heart-rending stories of families who have been economically destroyed and thrust into poverty, penury, because of the casino cultures that are developing in each of the states of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe that is one of the things that the community affairs committee of the Senate should be looking at. It impacts very largely on Commonwealth funds and taxpayers' money, which have to then bail out people who are in such poverty. We have a standing committee on community affairs which could well do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the point I have already made. I should think any challenge to the legality of this committee would fail on the precedents we have thus far. However, I consider that, in the event such a committee were not to be provided with the documents, such a committee would not be able to ensure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the attendance of key witnesses and that the exercise would be one, at best, of futility and, at worst, politicisation of a situation that should not be politicised but judged on the merits of the matter that is brought before it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I will vote against the establishment of the committee. I do hope that the establishment of this committee will not cast a reflection on the work of the Senate in its other committees. Each of us is very committed to the committee system in the Senate. It has been a good system over the years. It has enabled members of the public to come before the various committees to put their point of view in respect of matters that are specifically related to our powers under the Constitution. By and large, the work of the various committees has been superior, quoted repeatedly and quite influential in the development of legislation in respect of matters that are specifically for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I do say to Senator Spindler and the other speakers that I think a public service is being done in the raising of the issues. But when it comes to the question of whether or not this committee is appropriate, having regard to the functions of the Senate under the Constitution, I consider it not to pass that test.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am sure senators will be pleased to hear that in my closing remarks I do not propose to traverse yet again all the arguments that have been advanced by previous speakers. But there are a number of points that I need to address, not least in answer to the remarks which have just been made by Senator Harradine, whose experience and values I treat with great respect. Before I do that, however, I would tell the chamber that I have been asked by Senator Chamarette&mdash;who has been seeking the call, but unsuccessfully&mdash;to state that she would have spoken in support of the motion and will vote in support of the motion to establish a select committee as described in my motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the points need to be answered. First of all, there is Senator Alston's confidence that the inquiry will find there has been absolutely nothing untoward in the licensing process. If Senator Alston really believes that, then the coalition parties should support the motion because, as has been said <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="513"> by other speakers, that would certainly be a feather in the cap of not only Mr Kennett but also the coalition in this parliament. I am rather surprised that the coalition parties are not prepared to do that and also that Senator Alston has not prevailed on Mr Kennett to have an independent judicial inquiry in Victoria. That clearly would have been, by far, the best way to deal with this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only when this was refused&mdash;and I am going back a few weeks now&mdash;that I initiated the call for a Senate inquiry, because the matter that we are dealing with here is a matter that is certainly national in its implication. It deals with Australia's reputation and how we do business. That does not stop at the border of one particular state; it is also covered, as has been clearly outlined, by a number of acts of parliament at Commonwealth level. I believe that we must at all times be conscious of the national implications. I am glad to see that Senator Harradine has agreed with this particular proposition: that it is, in fact, a matter that is legal for us to pursue on the basis that it does cover matters of national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that, on that particular point, we should treat with a degree of caution the statements made by Mr Craven in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> today, remembering that Mr Craven was at one stage an adviser to the Kennett government. I believe that we cannot discount the fact that he may have a particular bias in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In saying that I do not wish to traverse the arguments, I do not wish, however, to be taken to agree with all the points that were made by the speakers. I certainly am not gunning, as one would say, for any particular individual in this matter. What I am concerned about is the relationship between government and business, and how our governments&mdash;and in this particular case, the Victorian government&mdash;do business. As I said, that does reflect on Australia as a whole and our capacity to function as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine has raised an interesting point and is hesitating to support this motion. But the question is: when the problem has arisen due to the actions of one particular government, and that government does not see fit to pursue it in an independent judicial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> inquiry, should we abdicate our responsibility in the Senate to hold governments accountable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My answer to that is a clear no. I believe the Senate has the responsibility to hold governments accountable. It is something that the Australian Democrats have seen as their task from the day they entered this chamber. It is something that we will pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matters that Senator Harradine has raised are clearly of national importance. Because they have arisen in a particular state does not affect the fact that they are of national importance and therefore are a proper responsibility of this chamber. Senator Harradine seems to have placed a lot of emphasis on the aspect that the inquiry will not be able to compel all material witnesses to appear and will not be able to obtain all the documents that it may wish because the Victorian government so far, through Mr Kennett, has indicated that it is unlikely to cooperate. I do not believe that we should prejudge that particular issue. Mr Kennett may well consider that it is to his benefit to appear before the inquiry and to give evidence to tell his side of the story, as it were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should also not forget that there is a precedent in recent times for a federal minister to appear before a state inquiry. That federal minister, Dr Lawrence, could obviously have raised the same objection and have refused to appear. She chose to appear and tell her story. I believe that Mr Kennett may well decide that it is in his interests to do so as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in this inquiry we would not, of course, rely on Mr Kennett's evidence alone. There are witnesses, who are no longer public servants, who can be called. There is a former Treasury official, who is now no longer a Treasury official, and who was quite a key person in the process that appears to have taken place. That person could be subpoenaed. We have people who were employees of the Casino Control Authority and who are no longer employees. Quite clearly those people could be reached by subpoena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="514"> The question of whether current employees and members of the casino authority can be brought before the committee is also, I be lieve, to be answered basically in the affirmative because Mr Kennett has been at great pains to state that the casino authority is an independent authority. He claims the authority is not under the control of the Victorian government. It is therefore not part of the government and is not subject to the premier's directions. If it is found to be an independent authority, then quite clearly the members and employees of the authority can be asked to appear before the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it would be better if we had a judicial inquiry; if we had a royal commission. But the terms of reference call for this committee to establish whether there is need, on all the available evidence that is before the committee, to establish such an inquiry. I believe that we are going as far as we possibly can in clearing up a matter that has been like a cloud resting over Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter that Senator Harradine raised about the social effects of gambling could, to a limited extent, possibly be dealt with under 1(a) of the terms of reference. To the extent that that proves inadequate in the view of the committee, and if the committee wishes to raise matters on that, I am sure it could come back to the Senate and ask for an extension of the terms of reference. It is certainly something that I would welcome and something that we should be considering. The damage that is being done to the Victorian community by the acceleration of the gambling culture is clearly extensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the debate this morning has shown conclusively that there is sufficient weight to the allegations&mdash;and that is what they are&mdash;about the casino process to raise very serious questions about how the Victorian state government has dealt with its relationships with business in the casino licensing process. I believe it is quite clear that it is within the powers of the Senate to establish a committee to inquire into this matter. I also believe that it is the responsibility of the Senate to hold governments accountable and to clear up this matter for the benefit of the proper functioning of all our governments in Australia. I commend the motion to the Senate.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(12.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, I would like to address an issue which is very much in our own backyard, with respect to the Senate's sitting hours. Firstly, I would like to take senators back to the Governor&hyphen;General's speech, where the Governor&hyphen;General indicated that the government would work to give Australian women greater equality of opportunity to succeed and genuine choice in their lifestyle, their aspirations and how they share family responsibilities. Another admirable sentiment expressed was that the needs of Australian families will be placed at the centre of the national policy agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But one of the first items introduced by the new government is a change to sitting hours. I am sure senators will recall that the sitting hours of the Senate and, for that matter, the House of Representatives, have been a matter of considerable concern and have been explored by procedure committees with respect to those concerns. The concerns expressed by a substantial number of members and senators related to sitting times and the effect of those hours on family life, health and, importantly, the encouragement of women into federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these concerns, amendments to sitting hours were adopted, with the Senate rising at 8.00 p.m. Yet, in one of its first acts, the government seeks to extend these hours, in stark contradiction to the noble sentiments enunciated by the Governor&hyphen;General and by members of its own government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us reflect on some of the concerns that were expressed about sitting hours. I, unlike Senator Bourne, do want to take us back to comments made by senators in previous discussions on these issues. Senator Herron has often expressed concerns in the chamber about the stress that is placed on the health and well&hyphen;being of senators and the effects on family life. Senator Herron, when discussing the sitting hours recommended by the Procedure Committee in February 1994, before I entered this place, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">If I made one contribution to the Procedure Committee report it was setting the time limit at 8.00 p.m.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

At the appropriate time, we can debate these matters. But what Senator Jacinta Collins is seeking to do is to pre&hyphen;empt the debate. It is unfair to other senators who may wish to have an interest in the debate at that time, and also it is not conducive to the good operation of the chamber. Quite clearly, the matter is out of order. We are quite happy to listen to Senator Jacinta Collins speak on other matters that are of importance to her.

The brief comments I have made about sitting hours are one small component of a much broader contribution with respect to how this place meets the needs of members with family responsibilities.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very hard to balance the rearing of small children with the long hours and frequent travel associated with a career in politics.</PARA>
<PARA>When considering ways to encourage increased participation of women, Senator Troeth ruminated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should we change the system and make it more appealing to women, such as lessening the sitting hours, providing more travel allowance, and providing creches and tutors for the children of parliamentarians</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I will not comment further on the sitting hours except to highlight the inconsistency with respect to the government's overall commitment that was given in the Governor-General's address to family life and to the participation of women within our parliamentary process. As many of you know, I am well qualified to speak about this issue both with respect to encouraging women into parliament and with respect to raising a family. I believe the government has got off to an early and inauspicious start with regard to its commitments. I am at a loss to explain the rationale behind its decision to seek to extend sitting hours, particularly with respect to repeated complaints. It cannot be blamed on the supposed `black hole' which has been used to rationalise most of the other coalition changes in moving towards their real agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do, however, commend the coalition for the increase in its number of women in parliament. I would also like to comment about those in the Liberal Party who claim that they are leading the shift towards greater representation of female parliamentarians. I refer those opposite to an article by Tim Colbatch of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, who wrote concerning the gender balance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women have made up 36 per cent of all new members of parliament, setting the scene for a very <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="517"> different gender balance in the future, but a survey of changes since 1993 shows that the Liberal Party does not deserve all the credit some people have given it for leading the shift. Since 1993, women have made up 50 per cent of the new Independents and minor party MPs, 41 per cent of the new Labor members, but just 31 per cent of the new Liberals and 20 per cent of the new National Party MPs.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite this, it is my hope that the improved representation of women in parliament will produce a more family friendly environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this theme I would like to discuss the matter of child-care. Senators may recall that a survey of the child-care needs of occupants of Parliament House was conducted in February 1995. Whilst this survey was generalist and directed more at corporate enterprises than parliament, it did highlight some pertinent concerns with respect to the occupants of Parliament House: the hours and days available with respect to child-care and the problems associated with transport to and from available child-care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The March 2 election saw a significant increase in the number of women represented in parliament. I would have assumed that, given the government's commitment to family and to increasing the opportunities for women, it would increase family practices in this place but this does not yet seem to have occurred. There are more women now within this place and</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that will change the government's attitude to family friendly practices. Unfortunately, that does not seem to have been indicated yet with respect to sitting hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system of child-care for members of parliament is certainly lacking. An example of this was my own experience upon entering parliament last year when we were in government. I was pleased to hear at that time that on occasions care was sometimes organised for members' children. I had assumed that these `on occasions' informal type care arrangements would ensure that child-care would be provided for an event as auspicious as the opening of parliament. However, I was proven wrong. I accept that the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms does not want to become a de facto child care agency and neither do I. The Sergeant-at-Arm's office does not want to act as a de facto recreational centre either, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> but I am comforted that there is a gym for members of parliament. I have also heard recently that space is now being sought for a physiotherapist. Is it not time that members' family responsibilities were considered a priority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are extremely limited options available for suitable child-care arrangements. I was told when I entered this place that there was a child-care centre in Forrest which provides priority for people who work within the Parliamentary Triangle. The big problem with this centre is that it is a long day care centre which does not cater for the needs of those people who travel to parliament from their electorates. For a member of parliament to use this service it would essentially involve having two full-time child-care places booked, one in the centre in Canberra for sitting weeks and committee work and one somewhere around your home or somewhere around the office of your electorate. This would mean effectively having to pay for up to 100 weeks of child-care per year, a realistic option for very few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, I have been unable to find a child-care centre in Canberra that offers extended child care&mdash;no extended hours care for children. This leads to an interesting dilemma, given the new extended sitting hours proposed by our new `family friendly' government. The government has asserted that it wants to encourage women to participate more fully in the decision making processes of government. Now is their opportunity to address the ongoing issue of child care for members of parliament, their staff and the staff of those who work around or in Parliament House in a way which will revolve around the actual working hours that occur in this place. I am sure that Senator Harradine's office will be watching this issue with great interest, as in that office there is the latest attempt to combine work with family life. How many more offices in this place will need to accommodate young babies before suitable child-care arrangements will be provided?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to speak about an issue <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="518"> that has been debated in this parliament for a long time, albeit in a different geographical context and that is the issue of Danpork, a very large piggery company. I am sure people on the government side will remember one of the senators on that side who pursued that issue for a long time. I want to pursue it in an entirely different context&mdash;don't get too worried, Senator Bolkus&mdash;and that is in the context of the prospect of Danpork establishing a piggery near Warwick, in Queensland. I want to raise a number of issues, particularly in relation to environmental concerns that I have and also in relation to the problems this will create for small pork producers in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental issues are very significant and very extensive. They concern the siting of this piggery on the banks of the Condamine River which, as many senators will know, is part of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. I am concerned about the siting of the piggery so close to the Murray&hyphen;Darling system and the potential&mdash;but it is almost more than potential; it is almost certain&mdash;that the effluent from the piggery and various other things involved in the production of the pork will impact very significantly on the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. It is not only a piggery, but also an abattoir. And to enable it to happen, the Warwick Shire has rezoned the area for a noxious and offensive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to read from some information I have, just to give you an idea of the environmental concerns which have been raised in quite a few places. The special facility, in the rezoning description, is for a noxious and offensive industry. I am told that the piggery will have a five&hyphen;kilometre river frontage, but it will be approximately only one kilometre from the actual water, near an ephemeral stream with links to the underground water. The irrigation area of 250 hectares is in a designated flood plain and already contains areas of crusted sodic solids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> A proposed Department of Primary Industries map places this land in the catchment of a dam, with the irrigation area likely to be flooded from time to time. One of those times is right now, I might add, because of the very extensive rain that we have had in Queens land in this area in the past few days. The Pratten township is 3.5 kilometres downstream and relies on bores for its water supply. I believe there is evidence to show that the water quality of these bores will be affected adversely by this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The information supplied to me also suggests that water requirements for piggeries are non&hyphen;sustainable in the long term and, at 27,000 litres per day per 100 sows, are a huge impact on our water resources. I might add that this is a 10,000 sow piggery, so you can see the amount of water required. There is currently an embargo on further allocation from surface water supplies within the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin which must be extended to groundwater supplies in the near future. In fact, that has happened. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Toowoomba Chronicle</EMPHASIS> of 28 March, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Natural Resources has moved to protect groundwater supplies on the Darling Downs by restricting new allocations.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there will be a cap on groundwater allocations in that part of the Upper Condamine Catchment, taking in Warwick and Clifton Shires, and the Cambooya Shire within the Kings Creek sub&hyphen;catchment.</PARA>
<PARA>So you can see that there are a lot of concerns in terms of the environment, both from the point of view of water supply and, certainly, because of the possibility of pollution of ground and underground water supplies. Add to this the concern that I have that, again, we add to the pressure on the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin because of this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are concerns with the ability of the soil&mdash;in the area which is to be irrigated by the effluent&mdash;to assimilate large volumes of piggery effluent, which is saline, on a long&hyphen;term sustainable basis. Currently, there are salinity outbreaks in both the Clifton and Wheatvale&hyphen;Pratten areas. These are just some of the environmental concerns that I have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would point out that in an answer to a question by Senator O'Chee, Senator Hill underlined the importance for the coalition of the whole Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin and the concern they have to ensure that money is made available to try and rehabilitate this area. In his answer, Senator Hill said:  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="519"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is experiencing land degradation and biodiversity loss that significantly threatens our environment and the productivity capacity of agricultural land.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that it is estimated that over 50 per cent of Australia's productive land is now in need of some form of repair. The direct annual cost of soil and water degradation alone is in excess of $1.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I share that concern. But I want to add to that concern the question: is it sensible to project that we need to expend vast sums of money in rehabilitation when we have the possibility of extending the pollution of that system? It simply does not make sense to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the strong arguments for establishing this piggery is the projection that there will be 500 jobs created. The pig growers in the South Burnett and Monto areas, in particular, have raised with me their concerns about piggeries, such as this and others which are contemplated, which may, in fact, destroy small piggeries. Small piggeries will not be able to compete. Is it sensible to create 500 jobs in one area and, at the same time, by their estimation, destroy hundreds of family farms? The equation simply does not make sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I want to place my concerns before the Senate that these issues which I have raised by way of letter with Senator Hill will be taken into account. Not only will we be able to repair the environment which has certainly been damaged over many years, we will be able also to act sensibly so that further industries, such as that contemplated by Danpork, do not further add to the problem.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I thank my colleagues who have come here to ensure that there is free speech in this parliament. The problem is that, when the Labor Party get free speech, they misuse it. That is why I have had to rise today: to rectify a slight against a person in our community who is without reproach. Last week, the Senate chamber was used as the place to allege that Mr Geoff Knight, who is a resident of the state seat of Clarence, was in fact not a resident of the electorate in question and that he was a criminal. The allegation was made that Mr Knight was not correctly enrolled at Glenreagh in the state electorate of Clarence and that, moreover, that constituted a criminal offence, the penalty for which was a $10,000 fine or three years in gaol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators, that allegation is wholly wrong. Even if Mr Knight could be accused of such an offence, the maximum penalty that would apply would be a $1,000 fine or six months in gaol. In other words, it is not a felony. It is not a criminal offence. But that did not seem to matter to the honourable senator who took Mr Knight's integrity and dragged it through a quagmire of abuse. The greatest rub is this, honourable senators: in fact, Mr Knight is correctly enrolled in the electorate of Clarence, because he has had a property there at Glenreagh for the last three years. He is lawfully entitled to be enrolled as an elector in that state electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that fact did not matter, because a senator on the other side misused the right of free speech to defame somebody for political intent. It is my duty in this place to uphold the good name of Mr Knight. One might ask, `Why was it that the Senate was used for such a shabby tactic?' The reason the Senate was used&mdash;and, may I say, misused&mdash;in this fashion was that the Labor Party would desperately love to win that state seat, but they know that they have no chance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I tried to make this clear to a number of your members yesterday but I will spell it out a bit more clearly today. You have, if you want to read them, the policy statements with which we went to the election. I am told that your side are very offended when I remind you that you lost that election. I have made it clear in answers in this place that that was the last major policy debate and it was decided then that we were the winners. The next major policy debate will be the budget. In the context of that let me tell you that I think you can guarantee one thing: any redesign of labour market programs in the budget will be to reduce the complexity that your government foisted on that area to such an extent that counter staff have trouble identifying the specific criteria between one program and another.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commence by thanking Senator Abetz for that question. The labour force area is very com <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="522"> plex. In the expectation that members opposite would want to know something about what the unemployment situation was, I had some material prepared but, sadly, members opposite did not choose to ask that question. I therefore thank Senator Abetz for putting that question to me because it is important that people understand Labor's legacy in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor came to office, at the very depth of the 1982&hyphen;83 downturn, there were 694,000 people out of work. When Labor were booted out of office, there were 766,000 people out of work, 10 per cent more than when they arrived. Under Labor, Australia had the highest level of unemployment since the Depression. At its peak in September 1993, 947,000 persons were unemployed. The unemployment rate was literally stuck at about 11 per cent, or close to it. As a rate that lasted over a year, it is the highest since the Depression. That is only the tip of the iceberg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I should understand why senators opposite have not chosen to ask a question about this and why I should not have expected a question on it. It is because the picture is so grim. Under Labor, the number of unemployed increased dramatically. On top of the number of those unemployed are those who want to work longer hours but who are forced to work part time, and the number of people who are so discouraged by looking for work and not being able to get it that they simply no longer bother to look for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most recent figures show that there are over half a million people who, if they could work longer hours, would, and about 150,000 persons who are so discouraged that they have stopped looking for work. When you add all that up, you come to about 1&half; million people who either want to work and cannot get work or would be doing more if they had the opportunity. When you add all of that together, it shows that 15 per cent of Australia's workers, or would&hyphen;be workers, have been prevented either from working or from working as long as they would like, because of Labor's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me shift briefly to the long-term unemployed. Working Nation was supposed to be the answer to the problems of the long-term <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployed but Labor was only ever interested in manipulating the statistics. That means putting long-term unemployed people on labour market programs for a sufficient period of time so that, when they go back into the ranks of the unemployed, they are considered to be short-term unemployed. The figures clearly bear that out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past nine months, the decline in long&hyphen;term unemployed of 18,500 has been more than compensated for by the increase of 29,000 in the short-term unemployed. Youth unemployment was 26.3 per cent when Labor got into government; 27.4 per cent when they left&mdash;not a very good record. That is not something that members opposite can have any pride in whatsoever. The bottom line is this: the mess that Labor created will not be fixed quickly. We will put in place policies to create real jobs. The people who have fallen out of the work force will want to come back and the people who want to work longer hours will be able to. That means that the future, for the moment, is a very difficult scenario. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

What we saw, right through Labor's period in office&mdash;given the cycles of economic moves&mdash;was an average rate of inflation in this country almost twice as high as it was in our major trading partners.

You cannot keep moving the goalposts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to know a bit about what consumers say in the UK, you should take notice of what Mr Colin Meek, a senior researcher with the UK Consumers' Association who was in Australia recently, had to say. He was critical of the UK experience. He was complimentary of the safeguards that we intended for Australian consumers. In other words, even someone from a consumer group&mdash;and of course they always want more, and they always quite rightly are watchdogs <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the consumers, and they are participants in the advocacy process, and sometimes they go a bit over the top&mdash;a bloke in your camp, coming out here, critical of the UK, nonetheless said that the safeguards we propose to put in place are absolutely first class. What is the relevance of the UK experience when you have consumer organisations actually crediting us with having the best consumer regime in the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with Senator Kernot's point for a moment. Senator Kernot was suggesting that somehow it was regulation and not privatisation. I will quote Sir Bryan Carsberg, a former Director-General of Communications in the UK&mdash;in other words, the first person to run Oftel. Sir Bryan Carsberg has been out here on a number of occasions&mdash;I think most recently for the 1995 Monash University Syme distinguished visitor lecture. Sir Bryan Carsberg said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecommunications are far better than they were before privatisation; in terms of value for money, things are incomparably better for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>Why do you keep running this ideological campaign? I gave you figures yesterday which demonstrated beyond doubt that there have been enormous consumer benefits in the UK in terms of lower prices and better quality of service. This is in a country which, until about four years ago, had a cosy duopoly as a result of Mercury choosing only very selectively, as you should know, not to offer competition and competitive services across the board but to simply target the CBD&mdash;the high value business customers, in other words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They did not have real competition. We are going to have it in this country very shortly. Optus is saying they will reduce local call charges by up to 40 per cent. That is likely to come about in the next couple of months. The UK now has fully&hyphen;fledged competition, and it has in excess of 130 service providers. In other words, there are people who will come in for arbitrage, who will force down on a re-selling basis the real price that is charged to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are on the verge of very significant competition in this country, unlike the UK at a comparable stage. In fact, BT had less than 10 per cent of the market after 10 years. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="527"> Optus is probably closer to 20 per cent already.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point of order from the Labor Party does rather highlight the fact that they do not have much of an understanding about the importance of the minister for the status of women and about the role of policy making to achieve more women in the federal parliament. We have seen the results of that failure of understanding and commitment by the opposition by the fact that they have now ended up with only two per cent of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their members in the House of Representatives as women. That is, of course, nowhere near&mdash;and will not go anywhere near&mdash;their quota system, which is to achieve 35 per cent of women by the year 2002.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By comparison, the government very seriously went about an exercise of trying to encourage women of merit by giving them assistance to get into parliament and by not demeaning them by way of quotas. We have already shown the results. Thirteen per cent of our members in the House of Representatives are women and we will go on to greater things because we are building on a sound foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember Senator Mackay at the Labor conference in Hobart. She proclaimed it a great day when they produced this quota policy. Well, you must feel it is sackcloth and ashes now, Senator, with the result. As I said, Labor have got a long way to go to meet their quota commitment. In fact, unless many of the present male Labor members of the House stand down and allow women to take their place, it will be well nigh impossible for Labor to meet their quota aim. If they are to keep one of their sacred and most publicised promises to Australian women, they have to start now, and that means selecting a woman for Blaxland. If they do not do that, they will be sending a message to the women of Australia that their commitment to increase women's representation is not worth a row of beans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Reynolds said recently that there is a principle at stake here, that there would be a fantastic symbol. Mrs Kirner and Senator Reynolds said that. Senator Reynolds also said that, if a woman is not chosen for Blaxland, it will send a negative message; it will be embarrassing and it will be very disillusioning and very disappointing.</PARA>

One of those problems was the size of Labor's provisional tax uplift factor, which Senator Chapman has referred to.

If their variation under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="531"> states actual income, Senator Cook, they may face penalties. The present government made a commitment to reduce Labor's uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent, a rate more in line with nominal growth in the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to advise Senator Chapman and the Senate that the government will be introducing legislation tomorrow that will be delivering on that commitment to small business. The uplift factor will be set at six per cent for the 1996-97 income year. That will keep small business profits where they generate real benefit and it will assist all other provisional taxpayers as well. By reducing the uplift factor, we will return hard-earned business funds to where they should be&mdash;that is, working for small business rather than sitting in the Taxation Office. That will benefit more than one million provisional taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to the future and the prosperity of small business. As Senator Chapman said in his question, the coalition sees small business as the very backbone of the economy and the prosperity of small business means more jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is committed to getting government off the back of small business. Our package of policies, including tax, industrial relations and deregulation, will be key elements in achieving this. The delivery of the reduction in the uplift factor comes on top of Monday's announcement by the Prime Minister of the membership of the small business deregulation task force, which will have six months to report on revenue neutral measures which can reduce the burden of paperwork and compliance costs on small business by 50 per cent during our first term in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's recession broke the back of many small businesses. Their overregulation, employment disincentives and unreasonable tax burdens have effectively stalled small business recovery. Our changes to the provisional tax uplift factor, along with the announcement of the composition of the small business deregulation task force, are significant steps along the way towards getting small business going again.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> question without notice asked by Senator Wheelwright today, relating to inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say it was an extraordinary performance by Senator Short during question time today. This was an opportunity for a minister to answer a question which was put in fairly plain terms. Before the minister even stood up it was pretty clear that he had no clothes to wear at all. I would have thought that it is an admission of defeat and an admission of a very weak and a very embattled minister who has to stick around for taking note after he is supposed to have answered questions in question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Question time provides an ample opportunity for any minister to answer questions. To stick around in the chamber to try and justify what was obviously a hopelessly inadequate answer deprives not only the opposition but also his own backbench of the opportunity to debate matters in this period of taking note. I believe that is an admission of defeat in itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the answer to my question was perfectly clear. By any number that any reasonable economist, or anyone who can spell `economics', could choose we can see that inflation is falling. It has been falling since the March quarter of last year. It has been falling on more than a quarterly basis. If we look at the consumer price index ABS release, every detail of the index shows that inflation has been falling. It is in a firm underlying downward trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every subgroup of the index is falling. If we look at food, clothing, housing, household equipment and operation, transportation, tobacco and alcohol we see that all of those subgroups are falling. In fact, there are only two categories out of the whole group which are showing any uptick at all&mdash;and they are very minor&mdash;and that is in the areas of health and personal care and recreation and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The numbers are unambiguous. As I tried to point out to the minister&mdash;which he studiously ignored&mdash;he should read this release. I suggest that he has probably never bothered to read this release. There are actually pictures in it. Every subgroup is pictured. One <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="534"> can see by looking at it, without even reading the table, that the trend with inflation is downwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One would have thought that the minister might have made some mention of the treasury underlying rate, which peaked in the March quarter. However, if we look at the quarterly figure we see that it, too, has been falling. It has been falling since September 1995. We had 1.2 per cent in September, 0.7 per cent in December 1995 and 0.4 per cent in March 1996. As I said, anything with any credibility in economics demonstrates that inflation is on a downward track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Short was in opposition he never bothered to read any of these releases. It was certainly never reflected in any of the speeches he made to the Senate that he had ever read any of them. All he could do was keep coming on with the same old mantra of `inflation is high', `inflation is high', `inflation is high'. Clearly inflation is not high. Anyone reporting the releases put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Treasury, or anyone else, could clearly see that inflation is falling and will continue to fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big question for this government is this: what is it going to do to maintain that downward trend? This is the great failure. The fact that Senator Short cannot read the CPI release is one thing, and probably a bad admission to make, but the worst thing for the government is that it has no policy at all in its armoury for bringing that rate of inflation down in the way that it is falling at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government had an accord which had spectacular success in terms of containing the rate of inflation. It was a wages policy which worked and which was the envy of the rest of the world. There is absolutely nothing in their armoury to do anything about the single major cause of inflation now. They have been warned by the Governor of the Reserve Bank: he has pointed out the fact that a wages policy is crucial to the future of inflation, and yet absolutely no response is coming from the government side. That is the matter which I believe is serious and that is the matter which I believe this Senate should take note of.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With any motor vehicle there are certain things that are good about that motor vehicle and there are certain things that are not so good.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their case on the economy has been defeated, not by our argument but by the decision of our fellow Australians on 2 March. Senator Wheelwright himself is a casualty of that decision, because the people of his home state of New South Wales said, `We no longer want you to serve us as a senator as of 30 June 1996.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the Australian economy is in a terrible state. Senator Wheelwright thinks that, if he shouts loud enough and if he puts on enough hysterical theatrical performances, he can somehow overcome the huge deficiencies in the economy created by his former leader from the same faction, Mr Keating, and by Mr Beazley. Of course, as Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley deliberately hid from the Australian people that huge legacy of $8 billion. Sure, that is a terrible task for us to fix, but do not blame us when we have to fix the economy because of your 13 years of mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Wheelwright does want a future after 30 June 1996, might I suggest&mdash;through you, Madam Deputy President, of course&mdash;that he ought to lift his game and his performances and really do the Senate a favour by abiding by the sorts of standards that we do expect in this chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to Senator Short's contribution to question time with respect to inflation and the other matters he was asked to answer today&mdash;and, indeed, questions he has been asked during the last week. On the issue of inflation, Senator Short is either waffling on in answers or is giving the wrong answers or the wrong information. On this issue of inflation, Senator Wheelwright is clearly right. The press knows that inflation is trending downwards in this country. Not just the press, but even your own party knows that inflation is trending down, as do the public. I quote the head of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Fraser, who, in a speech about five or six weeks ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Things have been under control lately, with underlying inflation of 2&frac14; per cent on average over the past four years. In the year to December quarter, the increase was 3.2 per cent, a little above the target of 2 to 3 per cent. Underlying inflation is the best measure for policy makers to track, but broader measures tell a similar story. The price deflator for private consumption expenditure, for example, shows an average increase of less than 2 per cent over the past four years and a rise of 2.8 per cent over the course of 1995.</PARA>

He then rose on a point of order and deliberately used the same words. Senator Sherry is now saying, if I understand him correctly, that because he was not making a substantive speech he could not make a comment which is unparliamentary. If that is the case, any honourable senator can rise in this place, make a point of order, however spurious, say anything, however unparliamentary, and get away with it. Madam Deputy President, not only does Senator Sherry show a contempt for the standing orders; he also shows a contempt for your ruling in deliberately using words which, less than five minutes ago, you had instructed were unparliamentary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want this debate to divert into a series of points of orders, where honourable senators interfere with the flow of debate by resorting to the standing orders. What would then suffer is an analysis of what happened and what are the merits of issues for discussion. This debate is now revolving around whether or not Senator Short misled the Senate, intentionally or unintentionally, inadvertently or otherwise, when he made the claim as he did during question time that inflation is getting worse. The underlying rate of inflation was the issue on which he has most recently spoken. He pulled out, as I recall, the ABS schedule and quoted from that. One waited to see how he would use the figures which he quoted against the record, but he did not do that so his case is unmade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="540"> Let me show you why Senator Short has intentionally or otherwise misled the Senate. In the 1995 September quarter, on Treasury figures, the underlying rate of inflation in Australia was 1.2 per cent. Honourable sena tors will remember that time last year, because at about that time John Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition and now the Prime Minister, accused Labor of five minutes of economic sunshine. This was a time in which commentators recognised a very good set of economic indicators for this nation. That was September 1995. The next quarter's figures are December 1995. What happened then? Remember that the September 1995 quarter was 1.2 per cent. What was the December 1995 quarter? It was 0.7 per cent. In the next quarter, the March 1996 quarter, it was 0.4 per cent. What we have is a descending row of figures&mdash;1.2, 0.7 and 0.4. That was why Senator Wheelwright quite rightly jumped to the lectern and said, `Why don't you set out the real position?' The figures are reeling down; they are not reeling up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Short may not have yet adjusted to being in government. One should give him a bit of latitude in order to do so. He still thinks of himself as being in opposition. He still thinks of attacking the former government in order to score points for himself. If Senator Short wants to continue doing this, he ought to remember that inflation is one measure and the level of economic growth is the other. What the previous government succeeded in doing was breaking the inflation stick and getting a lowering level of inflation in this country, and doing it with high levels of economic growth and record levels of job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is getting that trifecta in place that is the important issue in terms of economic management. If you compare our performance internationally, it is a performance that none of the G7 can lay a stick on. It is a performance in which, in terms of economic growth and with low inflation and high job creation, we led the world. Certainly we were at the top of the OECD table in terms of those indicators. That is an uncomfortable and unpalatable thing for the now government to recognise, but if you are dealing with the economy you have to deal with these facts. You should recognise it and build your case from there. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS> </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza obviously cannot count. There are six of us in the chamber, not five. The issue before the Senate today as a matter of public importance relates to the wages policy that the Labor <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government had for 13 years, known as the accord in a number of versions&mdash;to which I will be making some reference in my contribution to this debate&mdash;and the absolute failure of the new government to have any form of wages policy whatsoever and the implications of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously this issue is central to the issue of economic growth. Whilst on that, Senator O'Chee made a point that I have to pick up on in his recent contribution on Senator Short's answers to questions. I do not want to digress over Senator Short's answers; we will have enough problems with him after his contribution to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee was comparing us to Asian countries. One of them he mentioned was Brunei. I would have to inform Senator O'Chee that they discovered oil in Brunei since he was a boy. That is the reason why, per capita, Brunei is much wealthier than Australia&mdash;if indeed it is; I will have to look at the per capita figures for Brunei. But if there is a reason, it is oil. It is a pretty specious comparison to say that Australia has comparatively slipped back because Brunei has discovered oil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to quote with respect to the continual comparisons those opposite make to economies that are not relevant in many respects to the Australian economy. They continue to compare us to Asia. The correct comparison, the more valid comparison, is to OECD economies. In fact, this matter was referred to by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, in his recent speech, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the standards of other developed countries we have not done badly. The economy has expanded by more than a third over the past decade and a proper interpretation of the data as well as casual observations suggest the vast majority of Australians are better off today than ever before. To be distracted by concerns that other countries, including some of our Asian neighbours, have caught up, or surpassed us is to confuse the issues at stake. We should be pleased that other countries have come to share our standard of living and welcome the opportunities that this creates.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I hope the opposition refrain from continuing to make specious comments, referring only to Asian countries and ignoring the OECD. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="542"> our 13 years of government up until early March we had an accord in place. We will assert that there is no doubt that following the election, if we had still been in office with an accord in place&mdash;accord mark 8&mdash;there would have been a cut in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is that so important? Along with the declining inflation rate&mdash;and Senator Short refuses to admit that inflation is coming down and refuses to acknowledge the legacy of the Labor government: declining inflation&mdash;underlying inflation is 3.3 per cent, expected to fall below three per cent this year. Wages growth is back to 4.2 per cent for the year, consistent with the accord target when we left government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition love to ignore the figures for economic growth. Over the last 13 years we have enjoyed economic growth&mdash;on average higher than in OECD comparable economies&mdash;of just over three per cent. That is at a time when we have had severe drought, particularly in the last two years, and at a time of low commodity prices, particularly in the mineral sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Stop your prattling. If those opposite want to contribute to the economic debate they should do it by more than just interjection. We have not heard one contribution from Senator Kemp or Senator Panizza in debate. All we have heard is interjection. You are leaving it all to poor Senator Short. I say `poor' because he has an unbearable workload and the only person to have come to his rescue is Senator Abetz, who made 300 speeches last year and, for his efforts, got demoted to the far end of the government benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go back to this issue of growth in GDP. Australia's average from 1976 to 1985 as a total was only just on three per cent; per head it was 1&frac34;per cent. From 1986 to 1995 again it was just on three per cent and per head it was 1&frac34;per cent. What was it in OECD countries over that period? From 1976 to 1985 it was a total of three per cent; per head it was two per cent. It was better than in Australia between 1976 and 1985, but they were mainly the Fraser years. Senator Kemp <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> loves to forget the Fraser years. You should hear some of the comments he makes about the Fraser years and the missed opportunities. Between 1986 and 1995 the figures were 2&half; per cent, with 1&half; per cent per head. So we consistently did better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to 2 March, these figures would have led to significant reductions in interest rates. That would have been welcomed by home buyers, business and the unemployed. A reduction in real interest rates would have meant a significant stimulus to the economy. There is evidence to suggest there would have been a cut in interest rates if the accord had been continued. Syntec, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 April said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is us&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is right in saying now that under a Labor government, falls in official interest rates would be occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Corporate Brief</EMPHASIS>  of 1 April says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cyclical picture in this brief suggests that if Labor had regained office in a setting of wage restraint embraced with the unions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is what the accord was all about&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's rates would have fallen soon after the election. Such is the tension between the coalition and the unions, however, that that is not a prospect.</PARA>
<PARA>Syntec, on 12 April, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A government without the need to keep the labour market suppressed enough to deny the unions their wages push would be looking for an interest rate cut about now. A Labor government with any sort of post&hyphen;election accord would have legitimately been looking for a cut in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Since then we have had lower inflation figures, lower wage figures and improved balance of payment figures. What did the accord achieve? It is useful to note this. In 1996 wages growth was consistent with the accord target of 4.2 per cent. We expected that there was every reason for this to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inflation figures went from 5.1 per cent down to 3.7 per cent&mdash;contrary to what Senator Short continues to assert; he will never convince anyone with the assertion that inflation is going up&mdash;within reach of the Reserve Bank's acceptable band of two to three per cent. That means economic growth <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="543"> of three per cent at the bottom of the economic trough. The accord mark 7 showed average economic growth of greater than four per cent&mdash;the fastest in the OECD, among comparable economies. So it was a very solid achievement during the period of the accord mark 7. There was wages growth of 4.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industrial disputes are a very critical issue when it comes to wages policy. The number of industrial disputes was two&hyphen;thirds lower than when the Liberal Party was last in office. They love to talk about the effect of strikes in the economy but it is a Labor government that has seen a significant decline in industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, accord mark 7, through that period, saw the creation of 714,000 jobs. I recall in the lead&hyphen;up to the 1993 election, and following it, the scoffing of the opposition at our target of 500,000 jobs. They used to regularly berate us here in 1993 and early 1994 because we were not going to reach the target of 500,000 jobs. We reached the target; we got to 714,000 jobs&mdash;those opposite had dropped off that claim after about 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accord mark 8 was a commitment from the trade union movement that the accord be based on and consistent with maintaining an underlying rate of inflation of two to three per cent on average over the cycle. Wages policy would be consistent with this. It certainly was so until 2 March when the new government tore up the accord.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it incredible that Senator Sherry has raised this matter of public importance, because the Labor Party and its accord&mdash;or rather the eight accords that it had&mdash;failed the Australian people miserably.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is silly stuff, since it is perfectly obvious the excessive rate of wage increase that is alarming the Reserve Bank took place under the Accord. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="544"> </PARA>
<PARA>That is the real fact of the matter. Indeed, the failure of the accord is patently evident just by looking at the facts. In the last two terms under Labor, unemployment rose under the accords from 6.2 per cent to 11.2 per cent, before crawling back down to 8.5 per cent, with three&hyphen;quarters of a million Australians still unemployed, which is a totally unacceptably high figure, even by Labor's standards. There has been no reduction in the unemployment rate since May last year. The number of unemployed stands at 765,000 and youth unemployment at a staggering, disastrous 26 per cent. Does that sound like an argument to keep the accord?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accord has failed not only in terms of job creation. At the height of the accord in 1989&hyphen;90, home interest rates hit 17 per cent. The overdraft rate under this great successful accord was 21 per cent. Even today, as a result of this accord, Australia is suffering some of the highest bank prime interest rates in the world. Over 13 years, the accord gave Australia record current account deficits. The 13 years of the Accord gave us the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world and took net foreign debt from a very respectable figure of $23 billion to a staggering $185 billion when Labor left office. The 13 years of the accord gave Australia an average compound growth rate in the consumer price index&mdash;in headline inflation&mdash;of 7.2 per cent, almost double the 3.8 per cent of the main industrial countries, the G7.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 13 years of the accord led to the creation of an $8 billion budget deficit. After more than four years of economic recovery, we face, as a nation, a Commonwealth budget deficit of $8,000 million. Sustained fiscal laxity has caused Commonwealth debt alone to blow out to almost $100 billion, an increase of something like four times over the last five or so years. The 13 years of the accord saw Australia with an $8 billion deficit after five years of economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accord also, of course, stalled much needed economic reform. There were all those areas crying out for reform and improvement: the waterfront, transport and communications, and industrial relations. They were absolutely crying out for reform. Seemingly everyone in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia knew that they needed reform except the then Labor government. For 13 years, the previous government had put those in the too hard basket. Why did they put them in the too hard basket? It was because the ACTU said no. They said, `We cannot reform cabotage. We cannot reform the waterfront. We cannot reform the stevedoring industry. We cannot deliver real industrial relations reform.' <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 March, the Australian people said, `Yes, we can make these reforms.' They said they were not satisfied with their living standards and they were willing to have reforms that would give them better living standards. After 13 years under Labor and the accord, Australia's labour productivity is 20 per cent lower than the OECD average. What hope do we have for a brighter future, with such a dismal productivity performance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that Labor just cannot seem to understand is that as a nation we have to be increasingly internationally competitive. There is no point in just becoming more competitive than we were ourselves. We have to become more competitive than our international competitors, otherwise we will continue to see, as we have seen under Labor, a continual slide in our relative living standards. Indeed, under the 13 years of Labor rule, Australia slipped from 10th to 22nd in the world in average living standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The supposed purpose of the accord was to keep inflation down by controlling wages growth. But it should never be forgotten that Labor got inflation down by putting interest rates up to massive levels. As I said, home interest rates rose to 18 per cent and business interest rates got above 20 per cent. What businesses can operate with interest rates at that sort of level? No wonder we had the worst recession, deliberately induced by the then government, in 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inflation certainly came down, but what an enormous price Australians paid for it. When inflation came down, how did Labor keep it down? It kept it down by running the economy so slow that unemployment has been kept stuck in a rut of 8.5 per cent, having touched almost one million people unemployed and with almost 800,000 people still remaining out of work. It kept inflation low <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="545"> by having interest rates amongst the highest in the industrialised world. It kept inflation down by keeping real wages down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Real wages actually fell by over one per cent in the 13 years under Labor and the accord. The accord resulted in low productivity growth, which gave Australians no choice but to suffer high interest rates and virtually no real wages growth. It was the failure of the accord, very importantly, that was the reason why the people of Australia gave the Howard government such an overwhelming mandate. On 2 March, it was the voice of the Australian people that said that the political wing of the ACTU, the Australian Labor Party, had let Australia down so badly and banished it to the opposition benches because the Australian people wanted to start rebuilding this great nation of ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Senator Sherry's matter of public importance today is a nonsense. It is yet another indication that the Labor Party is blindingly out of touch with reality and out of touch with the Australian people. No wonder it is now out of government and the Australian people have given the Howard government the opportunity, the great chance and the request to rebuild the great nation that Australia once was.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the proposal before us today, that is, the failure of the government to have a wages policy and the impact this will have on Australia's future economic growth. I want to briefly question a few of the assumptions and implications of this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first assumption is that economic growth should be the prime goal of government. There is an assumption that growth is always good and the more growth the better. There is an assumption that overall growth results in distributional benefits, or that a concentration of profits and benefits result in general improvement through a trickle&hyphen;down process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even in development economics, in which I was involved for several years, the issue of trickle down has long been considered a failed concept. Simply making the larger corporations in our society richer does not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mean a better distribution within our society. Under the last government this was often true. During booms perhaps unemployment has been reduced, but that does not necessarily mean that real wages and conditions have risen. In fact, as soon as we start getting shortages in particular skill areas there is pressure from the business community to import skilled workers so they do not have to pay more wages. It seems that the employment market works only in one direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the contrary, I do not believe that increased social security benefits mean that an increasing number of the working poor are really better off. You can only fiddle with the figures. We want to see a society that has the ability to use its human and natural resources in an effective way so that we do not misuse or waste them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an important assumption that the current government has no wages policy. I think they do, although it is not clearly stated. They have a policy to see that the wages of working people are pushed lower in real terms and perhaps even in nominal terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To start with, what is the impact of sacking or retiring an estimated 30,000 members of the Australian Public Service? The government is also going to change the industrial relations system to allow employers to more easily sack people and to put increased pressure on workers to accept whatever an employer offers, thus weakening the ability of workers to bargain collectively or take collective action in their common interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people argue against that, all they have to look at is the proposal from Senator Newman to dob in somebody who has been offered a job, no matter how bad the terms and conditions, so that that person can be taken off unemployment benefits. That is not choice; that is disempowerment. When the government was in opposition, they always said that people should always have a choice. You are now taking away the choice, which means you are disempowering workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="546"> This is all done in the name of international competitiveness. That did not start with the current government. Where has the downward pressure on wages come from? It is part of the new globalism. We are all working to wards export at all costs. That is the race to the bottom&mdash;wages and conditions, environmental standards, taxes and so on. In the end, we are all going faster and faster to stay on the same spot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, Labor should have been using their position to modify the impacts of globalism. But they never admitted that it was a problem. They never admitted that that was their role. So you ended up with a whole lot of people very confused about why they were not well off or why there was this growing working poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On real standards of living, are we not running faster and faster simply to stay in the same spot or to go backwards? There is a difference between growth and development. The definition of development generally means a change for the better. A lot of the time we are heading for more volume of trade, but often that does not necessarily accord with a change for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to consider the future costs and real costs of many of the decisions we are making. The perceived need to be competitive means employers often cannot afford a situation where workers can protect themselves. The great cry from the coalition is labour market reform which often means disempowering workers and making them work more for less money. Enterprise agreements and individual contracts are just two measures to accelerate this process. Where do workers work? The majority of them work in small business. Where do most of the customers of small business come from? They come from the local economy&mdash;they are workers&mdash;and yet the government claims to support small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">International competitiveness and opening up to competition through deregulation means that we have to do things like deregulate trading hours so that big grocery chains can kill corner stores. It also means changing loadings for unsociable hours so big chains can employ youth workers at a pittance through the night and ensure that small businesses nearby die. Mums and dads simply cannot compete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should think about this situation. The situation we are faced with is that speciality <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shops close, nobody keeps stocks of anything anymore and service is a thing of the past. Where is the mention of standard of living or quality of life in all of this? These terms have dropped from the political vocabulary&mdash;displaced by the monolith of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people would prefer to work sociable hours and have their teenage children working sociable hours so that families&mdash;another favourite coalition icon&mdash;can actually spend time together. Many people would prefer a situation where people work less time and more people have jobs. They may not generate growth, but it may produce substantially better quality of life and more sharing of the benefits we have in this country. Many people would prefer a situation where resources in the economy flow within the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am trying to say is that we have a situation which perhaps developed long before this new government came into power. We have held values in our society such as that equity and the environment are not important. We have been told to aim for growth&mdash;growth at any cost. We have also been told that growth must be good, exports must be good and trade must be good. As a country, we have never sat down to work out what we are doing and whether the direction we are following is resulting in benefits to people. Are we running the risk of disempowering whole groups of people in the process? Are we not running the risk of alienating greater numbers in our community? Why do suddenly large numbers of blue collar workers in Australia wonder whether they are being represented at the political level?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just about industrial relations. They do not understand the implications of the new globalisation measures. They do not understand what we have signed up to under the Uruguay Round of GATT. They do not understand how the rules have changed. They do not understand why, in their shops, they cannot buy Australian made goods. Many women in the footwear, clothing and textile industry do not understand why their wages are actually going down and why outsourcing is taking place in an otherwise rich country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="547">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people in value adding industries are being forgotten in this process. Many people in regional areas are wondering why competition policy means outsourcing many areas of employment so that they do not have jobs any more. They do not understand those things. They do not understand why goods are being brought by road to regional areas. They do not understand why an environmental cost does not get added into the costs of products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Growth is an issue that should be looked at in perspective. Development means a change for the better. Part of what we have to look at in our society is whether we are changing for the better and whether we have a policy which ensures that people get a fair go. Do we have a policy which means we are not developing a working poor? Do we have a policy which means we are not able to provide basic things in Australian society? Do we have a policy which actually puts in the real costs of the economic decisions that we are making in our society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we do need reasonable standards for wages in Australia. I believe that it is wrong to take away the ability of people to participate in decision making within the workplace. I believe that disempowering workers is the wrong way to go if we want to be a smart or clever country. All in all we need a wages policy. We need to be sure that we are giving people a fair go. We need to be sure that the direction we going is actually leading to an improved quality of life in all aspects. I have not seen any indication that this is going to happen. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this matter of public importance debate about the failure of the government to have a wages policy. When the now opposition was in government we always had a wages policy, which was commonly known as the accord. We think it is essential that the government have a role to play in wages policy in this country. That point has been taken up by a number of commentators, including the Governor of the Reserve Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government was in opposition they also thought that wages policy was important in terms of how you structured your economic policy. Every time there was a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national wage increase they opposed it, yet they try to tell us that they support higher wages. Any time employment figures came out they certainly felt that a wages policy was very important. They were always chastising the government and trying to pick holes in the wages policy we had. We have never claimed that our wages policy was the best, but we have a right to ask what yours is. Right now you do not have one. I would like to remind the government of the successes of our wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to some comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser. An article in a Reserve Bank journal headed `Sustaining growth and living standards' outlines part of an address that the Governor gave in Sydney on 28 March this year&mdash;this was after you lot won government. In part he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How then should we view the outlook for wages in the post-Accord environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I speak, as you know, as a consistent supporter of the Accord process&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crane, you should listen to this&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe it has helped to moderate wage increases over the past decade. This, in turn, has contributed to job creation, lower inflation and a higher profit share. It has helped monetary policy to maintain growth in activity and employment while delivering lower inflation, and it has also helped to reduce the incidence of industrial strife.</PARA>
<PARA>A little table is also included. A couple of points worth noting from it are that from 1976 to 1985 the profit share as a percentage of non-farm GDP was around 13.4 per cent. Between 1986 and 1995, it was 15.6 per cent. The Reserve Bank governor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has an important role here to see that this framework operates as effectively and fairly as possible . . . The Reserve Bank too has a role. The particular `reality' we bring is a firm commitment to hold inflation to an average of between 2 and 3 per cent over the course of the business cycle. Wage and price setters should heed this . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The very purpose of this debate is to ask the government to identify what it is going to do in terms of a wages policy and how it is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="548"> going to maintain the level of wages growth that has done all of those important things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the government again of some of the very successful outcomes of the accord process. When the then Prime Minister outlined in the parliament just prior to the 1993 election the intended outcomes of accord mark 7, the then shadow spokesperson for industrial relations&mdash;I think he was in that position; I do not remember whether or not he, Lazarus with a triple bypass, was the leader of the party now in government&mdash;scoffed at our promise to deliver 500,000 jobs. Indeed, he said that it was `an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people'. The reality for those opposite is that we actually delivered 714,000 jobs.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="McKIERNAN" NAMEID="1I4">
<TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is, as Senator McKiernan points out, 50 per cent more than what we promised. We have not seen any promises from you, although I know what we have seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important factor in taking account of the 714,000 jobs is that the participation rate was an all-time record. The number of people in work in this country was an all-time record. Now of course unemployment is too high and was too high. We had a proposal in terms of accord mark 8 which gave a commitment to two principal things: first, wages growth and, second, employment creation. The trade union movement of this country, on behalf of the workers it represents, undertook to ensure that wages growth did not affect employment growth and that wages growth would be pegged to employment growth. I think those are very commendable outcomes and very commendable steps in anyone's view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other very important factor I should mention that we achieved in terms of the accord process we had in place was the lowest disputation ever. We should note what the Reserve Bank says in terms of working days lost per thousand employees. Between 1976 and 1985, it was 482. Between 1986 and 1995, it was 176. If they are not achievements that are in the interests of this country, I really do not know what are. The government, which condemns and continues to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> condemn the processes that we had in place, owes it to the people, to working Australians, to tell them exactly what it is going to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We achieved things like bringing inflation down, which is a very important point. Average inflation over the time you were last in government was 9.8 per cent. When we came into government it was going up, at 11.4 per cent. When you came into government this time, it was going down and is trending down, as we consistently tried to point out today to Senator Short, who seems to have some difficulty understanding the reality of how inflation works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to have a quick look at what we gather from the very short eight weeks you have been in government is a semblance of a wages policy. You have proposed to get rid of about 30,000 Public Service jobs. I am quite sure that will make a marvellous contribution towards the economy. You have also guttered and removed some of the most successful employment programs that we put in place under Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone tried to answer a question about one of those, NETTFORCE, but failed to do so. In terms of young people and traineeships for people who have been out of work for long periods, NETTFORCE has been remarkably successful&mdash;so successful that the latest figures show traineeship vacancies trebled in the last nine months to 28,931. It is also worth noting that the number of traineeship vacancies notified to the CES for 1994 were 12,500. For 1995, it was 23,500. For the three months to the end of March this year, 15,000 were already notified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="549"> Yet without any reason, without any assessment of the success or otherwise of a program such as NETTFORCE, you axed it. That starts to paint a picture of what we can expect will be the wages policy from you in government. You will ultimately live to tell a very sorry tale about your wages policy, its contribution to the economy of this country and the type of industrial relations that you are going to try to force down the necks of workers in this country. That will only lead to significant disputation. That will lead to higher inflation, which will ultimately affect one of the very important things that the people of this coun try want to have security and surety about: interest rates. They all pay them on their mortgages. That is what is very important. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Sherry has submitted for discussion this matter of public importance on the government's wages policy. It has given me and other government senators the opportunity to discuss the contribution and relevance of the accord under the last government. Before the election, the Labor Party and Mr Kelty in particular were guilty of a scare campaign that did not work. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  on 20 February, Mr Kelty is quoted as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they want to fight, if they want war, well, they'll have the full symphony&mdash;with all the pieces, all the clashes and all the music.</PARA>
<PARA>This was from a man who sat on the Reserve Bank board. It cost Labor support dearly among reasonable voters everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Kelty is playing a different tune now. But it was this type of irresponsible comment that the Labor Party and the ACTU were guilty of in trying to frighten the Australian people into believing that an end of the wage accord would mean wages chaos under a Howard government. Here we are, two months into a Howard government, and the sky has not fallen in. In fact, it has become much bluer. The government wants a cooperative approach. What is more, the government will get it. This is quite different from before 2 March when the ACTU ruled the roost&mdash;the `mates rates' existed for 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resounding defeat of the Labor Party on 2 March has even opened the eyes of the leader of the Labor Party, Mr Beazley. He was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 20 March, under the headline `Beazley cuts close links with the ACTU', to have said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union movement has to make its own way.</PARA>
<PARA>At least your leader has realised what a failure, no less an embarrassment, the accord has become. It is very interesting to note in the same article that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither of the former ACTU Presidents . . . Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson will pick up the industrial relations portfolio . . . Both have made it clear they do not want the job.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that no-one wants the job when one of the major failings of the Keating government was the accord.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 2 March, one of the many reasons Australia did not want the Labor Party running the country was because your wages policy was not a wages policy at all. It was a mates' policy with real wages falling consistently over 13 years. And who were the victims of the accord? They were small business, families and the unemployed. Employers did not want to hire people because the Labor government had infringed upon their rights, through their unfair dismissal laws, and they could be severely disadvantaged if a new employee was not appropriate. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fear became so deep rooted within employers that they were frightened to hire anyone new simply because of the impractical legislation that went splendidly along with an impractical Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With increased emphasis on productivity the unions are in danger of being left behind. Ever since the introduction of enterprise bargaining the unions have been frantically trying to get whatever rises by any means. I will give an example of the inappropriateness of these means. Look at the enterprise agreements in abattoirs. Most comprise of money up-front just to start talking about increases in productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry, in debating a motion to take note of an answer earlier today, championed the great deregulation by the Labor government. But what is really discussed is how much of the `them and us' mentality underlay Mr Keating's championing of free markets. The people who felt the chill winds of low tariffs, deregulation and foreign entry into the domestic markets were the banks, the manufacturers and the farmers. At no point did Mr <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="550"> Keating offer a similar challenge to the unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competition in the global market is made more difficult by union laws, which enshrine low productivity. The failure to even touch the rat hole, known as the Australian waterfront, is among the worst second&hyphen;best options that the previous Labor government embarked on. It is heartening to hear that, in a speech to the Metal Trades Industry Association's national personnel and industrial relations group conference last Thursday, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Macfarlane, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The movement from a centralised system of wage determination to a decentralised one based on individual productivity bargaining is clearly a good one. It should help to provide flexibility, and to unlock productivity gains that were formerly not accessible.</PARA>
<PARA>This is certainly good news for Australia in that the deputy governor is supporting a move away from the accord monopolised economy that plagued our nation for 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is constructive to focus our efforts on productivity for the benefit of employees, employers and the nation. The only thing that is left for the opposition is to threaten the Senate with obstructionist tactics to ensure constructive legislation is not passed to counter the failure in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party should carefully think about the context of this MPI. Would it not be better to support changes that will remove any evidence of your failings, to support policy that will reform industrial relations to bring it up to speed with the present, to support something that will give small business the opportunity to get back on its feet, to support the employment of those who could not get jobs under the stranglehold that the accord and unfair dismissal laws had over Australia and, in doing so, strengthen the financial security of small business and families for the future?

Syntec is worth quoting, as coalition senators have found out and quoted ad infinitum. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 25 April, a little while ago, Syntec said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition is right in saying now that under a Labor Government falls in official interest rates would be occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>This present government is robbing the people of Australia of those falls in interest rates. On 1 April Syntec said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cyclical picture in this brief suggests that if Labor had regained office in a setting of wage restraint embraced with the unions, Australia's rates would have fallen soon after the election. Such is the tension between the coalition and the unions however that that is not a prospect.</PARA>
<PARA>We are seeing that tension very clearly and very starkly outside this building today. I regret that we are probably going to see it much more often. On 12 April Syntec&mdash;this conservative and, some say, right-wing organisation that coalition colleagues were quite happy to quote ad infinitum&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Government without the need to keep the labour market suppressed enough to deny the unions their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="551"> wages push would be looking for an interest rate cut about now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Labor Government with any sort of post-election Accord would have been legitimately looking for a cut in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only would we have been looking for it, we would have delivered on it by this time because that is what Labor did when we were in office. The government has had an enormous responsibility thrust upon them to manage and to look after this country. They have promised that they will look after families. Part of looking after families is giving people jobs, not what is going on at the moment in the slash, burn and raze method of destroying jobs and using the public sector as the model that can be followed in other areas. Give people employment, do not put them out of work. Relieve the uncertainty that pervades wide sections of the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> yesterday was about a nine per cent unemployment rate for this city, for this territory, which was protected from most of the very severe unemployment rates that we had some time ago. Even it is showing enormous concern at the moment. Today the Chief Minister for the territory where the Commonwealth parliament sits waited for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a member of the same political party, to ask him to modify the approach that the government&mdash;a government of just nine weeks&mdash;is taking and to tell him how the government is attacking Canberra, how it is Canberra bashing, which is the favourite sport of many others from outside this place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, join this debate and I am pleased to have the opportunity to do so. I am also delighted that we have this matter of public importance before us:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government to have a wages policy and the impact this will have on Australia's future economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>It is rather interesting that this should come forward. In fact, I view it in such a way that I call it manna from heaven or even Christmas in May. There is no doubt that the former government had a wages policy, but it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was the wrong policy. Almost every measure you place against it indicates that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to highlight a couple of points. We heard an almost identical contribution from Labor Party people in Western Australia when changes to industrial policy were made there. It was almost identical; you could pull out the state <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Yet what do we see in Western Australia? The wages increases over recent times have been double the national average. What did we see in the last figures that were brought out as far as new jobs were concerned? Twelve thousand of the 14,000 new jobs in Australia were in WA. Almost all of them came out of the workplace agreement system and the increase in wages came out of the workplace agreement system. When we look at these things in time, we will be judged with regard to our wages policy, and I believe you will find that the position we have adopted is the correct position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our wages policy will be geared to productivity. The parties will determine&mdash;without interference and without coercion, but with choice, underpinned by a safety net determined by the Industrial Relations Commission with the introduction of workplace agreements&mdash;a simplified award system keeping the certified agreements which already exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to outline those particular points. But somebody else has described this in a much better way than I possibly could. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitration tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a model under which arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise: `only as a safety net'. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers. Over time, the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses.</PARA>
<PARA>Who said that? None other than the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in April 1993. Paul Keating knew then what had to be done, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="552"> but he could not deliver it. Why couldn't he deliver it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to look at what happened at that particular time. Paul Keating directed former Minister Brereton to mount his trusty steed&mdash;spurs glistening, six&hyphen;shooters loaded, hat fluttering in the breeze&mdash;and sent him off down to the ACTU conference. Remember all that? Minister Brereton was booed and hissed out of that particular conference. He was met when he got there by Martin, Jenny and Bill. What happened? As I said, he was booed and hissed out of the conference, his horse was shot, his six-shooters were taken away from him, and he was sent back to Paul with his tail between his legs. That was what happened in 1993, and that was one of the major contributing factors to the demise of this ex-government opposite. The people who had supported the Labor Party in the past abandoned them in droves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular aspect and what came out of it was the introduction of Brereton's IR reform act&mdash;and it would be the worst legacy of your legislation record while you were in government. Let us look at some of these particular aspects. The appalling unfair dismissal provisions: we will fix them. Our unfair dismissal arrangements will be `a fair go to all'. We will reintroduce back into the Trade Practices Act sections 45D and 45E. We will return protection for innocent third parties&mdash;and didn't we need that just before Christmas when waterfronts were closed down, coalmines were closed down and various actions were taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You introduced enterprise flexibility agreements instead of workplace agreements. You could not allow the parties, even where there were no union members in the workplace, to make their own agreement without union interference. We will fix that. Employees will have the choice of whether they wish to belong to a union or not. They will be able to choose which union they can join. They will even be able to make a choice to form their own union. I emphasise again: we will be keeping certified agreements. Our wages policy is based on choice and freedom in the workplace. It will deliver higher productivity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and, hence, higher wages and higher profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accord failed by almost every measure, so let us try a few of them. During the period of the accord, we had the highest sustained interest rates on record in this country; we had the worst recession in 60 years; you could not deliver on the waterfront. In fact, we have gone backwards in recent times on the waterfront. As has already been stated, there was a productivity loss of 20 per cent. There are other measures we can look at. Real wages fell by over one per cent. One can go on highlighting particular aspects of that Industrial Relations Reform Act which did so much damage to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard speakers over here talk about relativities, comparing the conditions of 20 years ago with those of today. The only effective measure you can put in place, as far as those opposite are concerned, is the measure of how we are comparing with our international competitors. When we look at particular aspects with our international competitors, while we have improved marginally in some areas, we have fallen further behind the position we were in when the Labor government came into power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to quote some aspects out of the monthly economic and social indicators. These would make very good reading and be very instructive for those on the other side of the chamber. Looking down the figures, we find that we still have 8.9 per cent unemployment in this country. We see the figures from 1991 through to 1995-96 ranging from 11 per cent to virtually nine per cent. If we go over the page, we find that during that same period of time the long-term unemployed figures have ranged from 282,500 to 224,500. That is the disgrace which has occurred with the application of the policies of the previous government&mdash;and I have outlined how we intend to address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we go on, we see the figures for youth unemployment. We look at bankruptcies and see that, between 1991-92 and 1995-96, bankruptcies ranged from 3,305 per annum to 4,137. The figures go on and on. Then we come to the current account deficit and the impact that has had. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I want to express my gratitude for the running sheet. That ought to make the committee consideration of this bill a lot simpler than it has been to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is proposed by the Greens (WA) , and I believe it is supported by the Australian Democrats. We believe this insert is a way of leaving the phrase `dispose of safely' in the bill. We have already expressed grave concern about it being removed. We think that it is important that in at least one place in the bill, and the place we believe to be most appropriate, there should be the principle that the bill should have something to do with the safe disposal of hazardous waste and that people should not simply be able to move hazardous waste around from place to place, whether in an environmentally sound manner or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not acceptable for the community to do industry's dirty work for it&mdash;often at a cost to standard of living, health, livelihood and survival, and at the cost of infant mortality. For that reason, the responsibility is being placed exactly where it belongs&mdash;with industry. One of the key solutions to the hazardous waste crisis we have facing the world at present is to make industry responsible for its own waste. An overriding principle of this bill should, therefore, be industry responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has never been acceptable that industry should cut its costs and increase its profits by using the natural environment, and the people that live within it, as cheap dumping grounds. Yet without legislating to make industry unquestionably responsible for the ethical disposal of its own wastes, this will continue to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is much to be gained in making industry responsible. As industry finds it is required to deal with its wastes, it will produce less of them. It will recycle more, it will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> save resources and, eventually, increase its profits and those of the community in the form of both direct revenue and quality of life. Safer chemicals will be used, products will be reformulated, production processes will be modified, operations and maintenance will be improved and closed&hyphen;loop recycling and re&hyphen;use will become more prevalent. Waste is expensive. Ensuring that it is fed back into the system will increase efficiency many fold and solve several problems at once.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we believe this clause would be an addition to the bill. It would also address the concern that at no other point in this bill will the term `dispose of safely' occur. Following some amendments which we opposed but which were agreed to earlier in this debate, the removal of the term `dispose of safely' occurred.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is not inconsistent with that, my other concern is that, each time we depart from the convention in an effort to add another consideration which might be part of an environmental agenda, we increase the potential for inconsistencies and other consequences that flow from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is that we have approached this bill from a different conceptual basis from that of Senator Chamarette in that we have sought to enact domestic law to implement the convention's requirements, whereas Senator Chamarette is seeking to go further and state general principles of environmental responsibility and other matters. We think that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="555"> it is unwise to do so in this piece of legislation because, as I said, inconsistencies only lead to uncertainty in interpretation which can be counterproductive to the objective that we are seeking.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding, it could be argued that the principles implicit in the bill&mdash;that each applicant for a permit to import or export must demonstrate the need for the proposed movement and must demonstrate the environmental soundness of it&mdash;are sufficient.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding the fine words of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) about seeking to comply with the convention, the proposition from the government is to substitute the word `safely' with the word `efficiently'. Of course, even somebody with little experience would be able to see that `efficiently' is a word which brings with it a different set of parameters and a different set of decision making opportunities than the word `safely'. If you really mean to comply with the spirit and the purpose of the convention, I see no reason why things should be changed in this way. Surely, it should be safety that we are concerned about with hazardous waste rather than efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The word `efficiently' can be refined and redefined in a number of ways&mdash;according to time, according to economics, according to the convenience of the perpetrators and according to any number of other judgments that can be made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are very determined to see that the spirit of the convention is complied with, without the inclusion of such changes which are innocent looking at first glance but insidious in their effect.

Again, my concern, if we are to introduce our new requirement of `environmentally sound management' and if we then leave the provision of safety, is that we run the risk of some ambiguity and, therefore, problems down the track in interpretation. I would rather commend to the Senate the mix of requirements that we have suggested within the bill that we have put.

But at the moment I am arguing that the substitution by the government should not be tolerated. I take the minister's direction to article 4 of the convention. I read it carefully. I have read it before. I do not accept that just by reading that in conjunction with what is proposed to be done caters for and dismisses the argument that some producers of waste might come up with that they have a more efficient way of disposing by sending something overseas. I know that there are vested interests who would like to continue to do <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that. I can predict that that argument would continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised by a coalition which might be identified with the desire to encourage Australian business and enterprises and which would seek to be identified with the facilitation of Australian industry proposing to allow the continuation of old-fashioned techniques and old-fashioned tactics. I would have thought that the minister, if the minister really does have an interest in encouraging the sunrise industries that are burgeoning around environmental engineering, is not encouraging Australian developers into this industry and trying, as I think Senator Chamarette said a couple of minutes ago, to incorporate within their processes the capacity to deal with waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scene in Australia abounds with examples, minister. I would not want to bore you with too many of them, but I wonder if you noticed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 26 June 1994. I am sure it would have fascinated you to have read an article by Tanya Hudson, who told us of a tiny firm pioneering toxic waste disposal systems. We had a report of a Melbourne company with a turnover of, at the time, only $300,000 offering international chemical companies a world first solution to getting rid of hazardous toxic waste. A Cheltenham based engineering consultancy, Hypernot, had developed a treatment system which transformed spent caustic waste from petroleum products into a baking soda solution. It was a world first. That has continued to blossom and has demonstrated the capacity for profitable and, I dare say, economically efficient methods of dealing with waste in Australia on-site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those sorts of industries are only encouraged if we follow through with the sorts of environmental management which a strict application would enforce. Until 20 years ago spent caustic waste was loaded onto tankers and dumped at sea, precisely as is done today in Tasmania with jarosite, which is dumped at the mouth of the Derwent, simply because the previous government was too scared to enforce the London dumping conventions to which they were a signatory on our behalf. This timidity of our governments has stifled <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="557"> the development of those industries which could employ people, could generate income for Australia and could maintain a much safer and more agreeable environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am at a loss to understand why political parties which purport to support the development of industry do not grasp these opportunities with both hands and support such industries. Here we have example after example. I started with 1984, but I could have gone back decades before that. Here we have an opportunity&mdash;but what is the government doing? It is seeking to establish little loopholes so that those who are lazy and are not interested in Australia's development can avoid their responsibilities. I plead with you, Minister, don't do it. Recognise how well Australia could do if you don't put in these sneaky little loopholes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is one of these in honour of St Jude amendment packages. Perhaps the government should take it up in relation to Telstra, as St Jude is the patron saint of lost causes. But here I go with penalties. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments 10 to 21 address the issue of prison penalties. Imprisonment is mentioned in several different paragraphs&mdash;12 of them to be precise&mdash;in the bill. Phrases used include: `imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years', `merits criminal punishment', and `imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, basically, the criminal sanctions in this bill relate to two years or five years imprisonment. As people will know well, I have an opposition to prison penalties being used as a measure of first resort than last resort, which is what they should be. The reason why I believe that imprisonment is not appropriate and that fines are more appropriate is that they have a different scale of operation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="561"> and enable a conviction without overusing imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People should be aware that prisons destroy lives and they are needed in very extreme cases where the community requires physical protection or the person involved is a physical danger. In such cases prison is worth contemplating. But it has been overused in a coercive, threatening or deterrent way in our community and is not the best possible penalty to impose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendments all revolve around the principle that penalties should be relevant to the offence under consideration. The threat of imprisonment does not form an effective response to hazardous waste offences and is simply not effective in protecting the community from the dangers of hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case of corporations and individuals committing offences related to hazardous waste is a clear example of non&hyphen;violence as an effective strategy for change. If we simply responded to hazardous waste offences by tossing the people responsible in gaol, whilst not addressing the inherent system that allows the offences to occur, we would achieve nothing. If we simply give a corporation or an individual a fine as retribution we end up in the patently undesirable position of those bodies, in effect, paying for permission to pollute and maim with toxic wastes. The end result is that companies simply budget for fines and continue on their merry way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand that people have some concerns that we are taking prison penalties out of the bill and replacing them with fines. I hope I have explained that the underlying reason for this amendment is that prison should be a penalty of last resort. The coalition government in Western Australia purports to see the wisdom of this principle. As I mentioned earlier, the rationale is that imprisonment is not an effective form of punishment or deterrent, for the vast number of well documented reasons I have mentioned, and only has a place in the justice system in that it can be used to protect the community from individuals who pose direct physical danger to the community or to themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You may argue that hazardous waste is one of the most direct physical dangers to a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community. I would argue that if you only imprison one individual from a corporation without actually touching the operation of that corporation, and by so doing hope to threaten or frighten a corporation into not being prepared to sacrifice their managing directors for the good cause of their profits and practice, it would not be me who would be accused of being naive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle is obvious. I want to retain penalties for those offences but transfer them to the more appropriate penalty of fines. A conviction and the penalty of a fine will cause damage to individuals' reputations and careers. There is no doubt about that. They may not cause as much damage as a term of imprisonment would. If that conviction is there and it is accompanied with the amendment No. 22 components that I have referred to I believe that is a far more effective way of dealing with offences under the Hazardous Waste Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The penalty is the revocation of permits and the related disqualification upon conviction of the offence. What happens is that if an individual is convicted of an offence under sections 39, 40, 40A, 40B or 41A then the minister must in writing revoke the permit given to the holder of the Basel permit or special permit. The revocation takes effect on the day on which the written notice is given to the person. A written notice must include a statement of the reasons for the revocation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a person's permit is revoked, under subsection 1 the minister must not consider an application to grant the person a permit until the expiration of a period, not exceeding five years, to be determined by the minister. This applies where a natural person's permit is revoked under subsection 1 or a natural person is convicted of an offence under sections 39 to 41A. This also applies to the body corporate. The minister must not consider an application to grant the body corporate a permit until the expiration of a period, not exceeding five years, as determined by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have replaced the five&hyphen;year imprisonment hollow threat that may never get carried out with a five&hyphen;year penalty that is appropriate to the crime. It is a crime for a corporation or an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="562"> individual who has a degree of responsibility in the corporation to impose a hazardous waste threat on the community. It is appropriate that the penalty that they receive fits the crime. Nothing will prevent damage to the environment less than penalties which are seen as token penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effective alternative to the old model of imprisonment and fines is to recognise that penalties must embody three principles&mdash;they must be immediate, they must be appropriate and they must be seen to be fair. That is why, in line with these principles, our model proposes the immediate revocation of Basel or special permits for offences under particular sections of the bill from the day of ascertainment of the convictions. This revocation must be accompanied by written notice stating the reasons. Basel or special permits will then not be re&hyphen;issued to that person or the company of which that person is or becomes an executive officer for a time determined by the minister, but not exceeding five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that I have already had advance notice that my colleagues are not going to be persuaded by my arguments, I want to put on the public record that we cannot continue to maintain in our legislation offences that are meaningless, offences that are ineffective and penalties that do not address the problems that they purport to address. I believe serious consideration should be given to amendments 10 to 22 and I seek the support of the chamber for them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>I think an omission of public consultation in something of this importance is inexcusable. We need public consultation with regard to siting, particularly of waste disposal sites. I can give a Western Australian example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mount Walton site is an example of a lack of public consultation or willingness to hear the concerns of local people before making moves to have low level radioactive waste not only sited there but carried there from all over the state. There is a particular concern about the site not only because of the dangers at the particular site, which I believe was chosen because of its dryness and aridity&mdash;it has just had record rainfall&mdash;but also because of transportation to the site. For example, low level radioactive waste will be carried from Pinjarra right up to Perth, then out to Kalgoorlie and then out to Mount Walton. This is one illustration of where public consultation should be allowed not just at the site but also at the area where the radioactive waste is being produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The possibility of having Australia's national radioactive waste dump being sited at Mount Walton has caused great distress to the local community and council. The recognition within this bill of the basic need for public consultation both here and overseas with respect to this generally would, I believe, be of considerable public interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats strongly support this amendment to the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill. I bring to this discussion the strong argument that was put forward to the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts when it was conducting its inquiry into waste disposal. As I think more about this bill and what it does and does not have in it, I wonder whether the government read the report of that committee. I was a member of the committee. I was fascinated by some of the information that came to the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a fortunate committee in that it was provided with a great deal of background information from the inquiry into intractable wastes. The previous compilation of information by that committee involved Professor Ben Selinger. I am sure that&mdash;even though I cannot say the title&mdash;people know the committee I am referring to. The inquiry which followed Professor Selinger's inquiry was provided with a great deal of information from that previous inquiry. We were also privileged to travel to other disposal facilities and sites of research into disposal facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We learned that those materials which had previously been described as hazardous wastes had now become resources. Probably one of the best examples was at Wollongong, where Emeritus Professor Warner, who has an international reputation as an engineer and as a developer of technologies, especially in the steel industry, had found it very difficult to stop working for some time after his retirement because his developments had attracted such international attention as to keep him thoroughly occupied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of his developments involved the reuse of furnace dust at the BHP sites. This furnace dust had been a particularly difficult problem to deal with. The hazardous waste had accumulated to such an extent that it had become an economic or efficiency problem for the corporations involved. It could not be disposed of easily. Professor Warner was able to incorporate that raw material or hazardous waste&mdash;depending on your point of view&mdash;with another waste or raw material, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="564"> sewage which had become a problem for the city of Wollongong and which was difficult to dispose of. By combining two items which previously had been defined as waste, he was able to redefine them as a resource and produce an economic benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That little story is meant to illustrate the futility of following a path of building a facility to dispose of what we define as hazardous waste because, at that very time of the committee's inquiry, we were seeing the death of the proposal to build a high temperature incinerator somewhere in Australia to dispose of hazardous waste. If that facility had been built, we would have become lazy in our imaginations and people such as Professor Warner would not have been encouraged to think of alternative possible uses. Luckily, that high temperature incinerator was not built and many items which had been described as hazardous waste found themselves being redefined as useful resources. I speak of not only the PCBs, which supposedly were an intractable problem, but also such things as the example I gave: the furnace dust at Wollongong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The capacity of ventures such as the CSIRO's plasma arc development, the possibility of the very small ball mill disposal technologies and many others which are mentioned in that report are not reflected in the assumptions that underlie this part of this bill. The assumption here is that we will have hazardous waste which has to be disposed of. I agree with Senator Chamarette that, if there is any disposal facility to be constructed, there needs to be full community consultation because, if it is proper consultation, we could well provide the opportunity for alternatives to the disposal being assumed. We could well hear of other technologies; we could well give the time to people who have the capacity to recognise the waste as a resource. That is surely the most appropriate way to treat waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Warner, in the report I referred to, was able to bring a suggestion to the committee that there is no such thing as waste, that it is merely material for which we have yet to find a useful purpose. I think that if we adopt that practice we will be able to find that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> useful purpose through consultation. It is the consultation which is extremely important because those who assume that we have waste to deal with are usually ignorant of the thoughts that are in other people's minds. To get those other thoughts exposed in the widest possible way is to have community consultation. It is through the widest possible consideration of alternatives that we eventually arrive at uses which could provide economic benefit for the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the reasons I have for supporting this inclusion of community consultation, I really ask the government and the opposition to carefully consider what advantages could come to Australia through reconsidering whether we actually need to just dispose of hazardous waste. There is a myriad of examples&mdash;and I recommend to all senators the report of the environment, recreation and the arts committee on waste disposal to see what an impressive list of economic and beneficial uses have been found for those materials which were previously described as waste. I think we need only to look at our own households to recognise that we are doing useful things with things which were previously considered to be inconvenient waste. When we build a facility, we cut off that option. When we build a facility, we build something which costs us money to construct, maintain and supervise. Yet, if we consult before we build that, we run the opportunity of finding alternative uses for those wastes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The word `extension' can mean two things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just rise to my defence because I think there has been some implication that I was standing in danger of misleading the Senate.

Notwithstanding the advice from the Attorney-General's Department, I have received conflicting advice from various lawyers and barristers around the country in relation to the interpretation of this act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I would just explain to Senator Hill&mdash;because I am not intending to pursue it down any other avenue&mdash;that in his second reading speech he made an internally contradictory statement which I believed deserved explanation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 has been extended by providing standing for Australian organisations and associations which have matters which relate to the act as part of their object or purpose. This will provide further legislative clarity to the standing rules for the purposes of the ADJR Act and is an extension of the standing rules already recognised in recent cases under other similar legislation. The standing provisions in the bill relate only to persons or organisations living or incorporated in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>To say that `the standing rules are extended' and that `standing is extended' are two different matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite prepared to accede that the way in which this bill was printed extends the standing rules of the ADJR. What I wanted to seek was the reassurance that we are not being given, by this extension of standing rules, a substitute definition which actually <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="567"> limits the standing available under the ADJR. The standing available under the ADJR does not exclude people or organisations who live or are incorporated outside Australia; but these extended standing rules appear to limit the standing by the wording of this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing clearer. The clause in the amendment that I have had circulated contains the heading mentioned in the Attorney&hyphen;General's advice, namely, `extended standing of individuals and organisations to seek judicial review'. It also contains the statement, `to avoid doubt this section is intended to extend but not limit the meaning of the expression "person aggrieved by the decision"'. That refers to the standing of somebody under the AD(JR) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the advice I have received has been correct. I hope that will put to rest the concerns of the community. If it does not, then I am afraid that the whole matter will need to be revisited because there is certainty about what was needed. This has been the subject of some negotiation. It may be easier to simply amend section 58A(2) to say that an individual is also taken to be a person aggrieved, and to amend section 3 to include the words, `An organisation or association, whether incorporated or not, is also taken to be a person aggrieved by the decision'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, this bill is another example of the bipartisan approach of this government to improving the health of all Australians. This particular bill has had an increasingly tortuous history since it was first introduced into parliament by the former government early in 1995. It was initially part of an omnibus bill, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, which was subsequently divided into more manageable parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill incorporates and reintroduces the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1995 which was passed by both sides of the House of Representatives on 28 September 1995, but which was still awaiting consideration by the Senate when the parliament rose at the conclusion of the 1995 sittings. As a result, over 600 applications for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> listing of particular products for supply in Australia have been delayed. This has incurred considerable financial distress to the applicants waiting to have their products listed prior to marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These applications comprise relatively simple and low risk products such as vitamins, minerals, herbal, homoeopathic and sun screen products. The government believes that, given the long gestation of this bill, it is in the public interest to relieve this financial distress as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government welcomes manageable legislation and particularly welcomes the innovations contained in this bill. We note that last year the then government&mdash;and now opposition&mdash;which first moved this bill also actively promoted the measures contained in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has now been reintroduced for a third time in this place in a form which will facilitate its passage by accommodating the needs of the Senate as well as the conventions of the House.</PARA>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill on behalf of the opposition. The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which this bill seeks to amend, allows for a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="569"> national system of uniform controls for therapeutic goods: that is, goods that are represented in any way to be or likely to be used for therapeutic use. Therapeutic use is defined as `diagnosis curing or alleviating disease, ailment, injury or defect'. The original act was established with a view to controlling all therapeutic goods used in or from Australia. Parameters were set out to establish a national standard for managers encompassing quality, safety, labelling and advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill is designed to update and finetune the Therapeutics Goods Act. The purpose of the bill is essentially twofold. Firstly, the bill will provide logical, workable guidelines for short-term approvals of unevaluated drugs. This is for when they are required in place of existing registered drugs which are either unavailable or in very short supply. Measures are taken within the bill to guarantee that this provision is used only in extreme cases and only when absolutely necessary. Safeguards will assure that this system is not deliberately abused, and well considered limits will assure that the system is not over used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the bill provides a revised system which allows for listing of standard over&hyphen;the&hyphen;counter drugs, such as herbal remedies and vitamin preparations for minor medical conditions or personal treatments, a system that has come to be known as listing. There are other provisions in the bill which I will not go into in detail and the government may wish to take us through them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill provides a clear distinction between `food' and `therapeutic goods'. It also establishes a new Therapeutic Goods Administration trust account. Some minor discussion is taking place about whether that will bring this bill within the scope of a money bill, but I understand that that view has been rejected by the government. The bill also converts the existing penalties in the act into penalty units. Further, it provides accountability for sponsors of unlawfully supplied goods&mdash;for example, those that are not registered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to mention briefly some of the specific provisions of the bill. I shall start with item 2 of the bill. The original TGA excluded food from the operation of the act&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is, the definition of `food' was not set out within it. This item will amend the act to make it absolutely clear what `food' is. You might have thought that this was unnecessary, but there have been a number of disputes and court cases arising from this uncertainty in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 10 of the bill inserts a new section 19A into the act. This provides the secretary of the department of health, the national manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration or the director of the drug safety and evaluation section of that administration with the authority to grant temporary approval in writing for the supply and, if needed, importation of certain specific therapeutic goods in extraordinary circumstances. I have outlined these circumstances before. They include when extreme shortages, or a total absence, or a discontinued line of certain registered drugs occurs and when no equivalent registered drug is already available. This will occur only when an application for registration for the drug or good in question has already been lodged in the full and proper form. The secretary reserves the right to impose conditions on the approval, including the placement of time restraints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 11 of this bill inserts new subsections 20(1) and 20(2) into the act. This will make it an offence for the deliberate and reckless export, import, manufacture or supply for human use of drugs or goods&mdash;as defined within the act&mdash;without the authority of the act and where approval has not been granted by the secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Item 36 of the bill inserts a new section 30A into the original act. This ensures a system is in place for the recovery of therapeutic goods that are not registered, listed or authorised under sections 19 or 19A of the act. The onus for that recovery rests with the sponsor. I suppose some people would find it quite extraordinary that, to date, there has been no capacity to recover goods that have not been registered in compliance with this act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Items 49 and 50 of the bill replace a number of old sections and put in place new sections 45A, 46, 46A, 46B and 47. These in large part relate to the enforcement and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="570"> compliance of the act, and I do not intend to go into these in any further detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Needless to say, this bill does not amend the act in any major way, but it does involve a slight restructuring and renumbering. The bill was put forward by the previous Labor government and, as such, we see these measures as being necessary and part of the good legislative program that we were unfortunately unable to bring to this chamber because of this year's untimely events.</PARA>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(6.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin by thanking the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor  Party for giving me the opportunity to represent the people of Victoria. This is an enormous responsibility which I will endeavour to fulfil. It is certainly daunting following in the footsteps of Gareth Evans. Gareth, as you know, has gone to that other place. I believe, however, that it is important to note some of his achievements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Gareth held a number of portfolios with distinction, but it is his success as a foreign minister that stands out. Never has Australia's standing been so high on the international stage. His dedication to finding a resolution to the Cambodian issue has been acknowledged worldwide. His attempts to reform the United Nations have had wide support, and his commitment to the passage of the Mabo legislation in this chamber is one of his personal triumphs. Gareth has not retired from politics, so I simply wish him well in his new position. I am sure that when Labor regains government, it will be in no small part due to his efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Representing the Labor Party has been a lifelong ambition. It is the party which is committed to working Australians. Australia is faced with a critical choice in 1996: it can turn inwards and seek to insulate and isolate itself from what is happening in our region and around the world or it can choose to meet the challenges of the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 1950s and 1960s, Australia made the wrong choice. The cost of these decisions is still being felt decades later. In that period, Australia slid from No. 2 to No. 15 on the international comparison of living standards. By the mid&hyphen;1980s we had slipped further to No. 23. It is interesting to observe that, during the 35 years, Labor was in government for a combined total of only five of those years. On the basis of that, it is difficult to take seriously any attempts to portray the Whitlam and Hawke governments as responsible for the malaise of that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="571"> The growing internationalisation of our economy presents opportunities and challen ges. We must grasp these opportunities if we are to sustain our living standards and our children's futures. We must continue to push our economy on an export orientated growth path. The last 13 years have seen a transformation of our economy. Many would suggest that this has been too much too quickly. I say, Australia cannot afford to wait; survival is not compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government must build on these changes if Australia is to forge ahead. It must not give in to sectional interests that want to protect their economic position at the expense of all Australians. This process will require endurance. It may even require, as Sir Humphrey Appleby would say, some courageous political decisions. I believe the Hawke&hyphen;Keating governments made some courageous political decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was recently lucky enough to visit the European Parliament and was briefed on the latest developments in the European Union. What struck me most was the maturity with which both major parties in Germany approached the political process, the respect for rival political institutions and the role they play in this democratic process. There was no narrow, vindictive, small&hyphen;mindedness of spirit in their politics and no desire to crush opposing structures. There was plenty of cut and thrust and political byplay, but the national interest was the No. 1 priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my firm belief that, if Australia is to progress economically and socially, we must maintain a bipartisan approach to issues like APEC. This is the issue which will determine the living standards of our children. We must engage our Asian neighbours and continue to integrate our economy in the region. We must take the lead on the proposed social clause, which deals with issues such as prison labour, child labour, safety standards and freedom of association. APEC means jobs for our future, but the standard of these is in our hands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier, I said that this process would involve challenges. The role of the Labor Party is to ensure economic security for all Australians. The Hawke and Keating governments had a proud record in this field, which I describe as the social wage. This record includes: pensions increased and maintained <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings; year 12 retention rates increasing from 33 per cent to 80 per cent;  the family allowance supplement; affordable health care for all Australians; an award system that protected low paid workers with regular safety net increases; a progressive taxation system; training opportunities through Working Nation; superannuation for all Australians; and many other reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always been committed to providing equality of opportunity. I reject the notion of equality of outcome. To me, this is the critical divide between a social democrat and a socialist. The Labor Party's next challenge is to confront the changing structure of Australia's work force. Technological change is forcing the pace as more people work part time and from home. A new type of poverty is beginning to emerge and its impact will need to be assessed carefully. We are seeing a growing gap between the information rich and the information poor. This has many implications for public policy. How do we ensure that every Australian child has the education including the standard of literacy they need to be  able to use the new information technologies? How do we ensure that all Australians have access to the information carriers that will revolutionise the way we learn, work and enjoy ourselves? More practically, what can we do to make sure Australians have the skills and backup they need to be leaders in developing and providing these new technologies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot give up on economic reform or restructuring our economy. Jobs depend on it&mdash;Australian jobs. And without jobs, there is no effective social reform, no future we can look to with any confidence. There is no doubt that the restructuring we on this side of politics have undertaken in government has been essential and constructive. But it is also true that, at times, Australians have asked themselves, `What is it all about? Where are we heading?' At times they have wondered whether our community is losing something in a rush to be lean, efficient and competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family lives in the north of England and long ago learned what blind adherence to rational economics meant&mdash;a blindness made <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="572"> all the more brutal through being untempered by any thought of helping the people hurt by reform or change. Margaret Thatcher drew a line across the middle of England and if you lived above it, `you can make your own arrangements'. Meanwhile, mines closed, shipyards closed, factories shut their gates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not just see the consequences in the north now. I was in London just before Christmas. When people refer to the 5 o'clock rush hour, they are not talking about the traffic. They are talking about the homeless rushing to put their blankets and cardboard down into the doorways of the newly closed shops. Thank God we have a more compassionate society here, and it is to Labor's great credit that the profound economic changes it has wrought have always been accompanied with a determination to ensure that those affected have been supported and helped to find other work or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What more needs to be done? We must never lose sight of the fact that economic restructuring is something we do for the national good. That means that there is a national obligation to support people displaced in this process. We must all be conscious too that change needs to be better explained and debated. It may be that we must look again at the nature of change and in each case ask, `What are we really trying to achieve?' Is an iota of efficiency here reward enough for the loss of employees' family time? Does a free market there mean the production of socially undesirable goods, or the encouragement of goods produced by socially undesirable means like sweated labour, child labour or unsafe work practices?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do we want to encourage industries that need a work force trained simply to follow orders, not to think for themselves? Is cheaper and faster really an alternative to better? Everything a government does is about nurturing and protecting a healthy society. It is not about efficiency. It is not about growth. Those things are only tools, and not the only ones, to make Australia a better place in which to live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always believed that Labor is about civilising capitalism, that economic policy is not an end in itself. Over the next decade I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expect governments will increasingly be called to account on that score. Their actions will increasingly be judged by the civilising influence they bring to our society. We, as politicians, will be increasingly asked to explain what we do in those terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no hiding the fact that there is a growing unease in our community about the direction our society is taking. We all feel that, particularly now, in the wake of the dreadful tragedy at Port Arthur. There is a need now, if not for moral leadership, then for our citizens to have more say, to have more influence, in public matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians increasingly will demand more say in the way their children are educated, in what is shown on television, in how they work, in how their institutions or governments perform and respond to them. I say to the coalition government: the Australian people gave you their trust on 2 March. You must manage these inevitable changes for the benefit of all, not for the few.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly proud that I have worked for the Transport Workers Union for the last four years. The TWU is a proud union which, despite its difficulties, has survived and prospered in recent times. Its success has been due to the dedication of its officials and delegates right across Victoria. No union today can survive and grow unless it retains the active support of its members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many friends at the union who I would like to thank for their support, but I am sure that if I tried to list them all I would inevitably leave someone out. I will, however, single out the secretary, Bill Noonan, who has led the union through enormously difficult times with skill, dedication and patience&mdash;and that was only when dealing with me! I would not be here today without Bill's support and friendship. I look forward to being presented with my 25&hyphen;year honorary membership certificate of the TWU in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier the need for Australia to improve its skills base. The TWU has been involved in this area. The TWU and its employers in the private transport industry are partners in developing and implementing a comprehensive training agenda for our industry. This is being implemented by the Industry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="573"> Training Advisory Board. This is an organisation managed by representatives from both the trade union movement and the employers. The entire project has been supported by the industry and the federal government. Its task is to design and deliver relevant training to employees in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The transport industry has had little experience in delivering structured training. However, nationally consistent standards have been introduced and the industry is now able to develop training programs that are relevant and accepted. This training can deliver outcomes for employers, such as promoting fuel efficiency, competency with technological change and innovation and reducing workplace accidents&mdash;to name just a few. For drivers, it represents the recognition of skills and the building of more rewarding and fulfilling career opportunities. This is a win&hyphen;win situation for the industry. The challenge for the coalition is how it responds to these initiatives now that it is in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was born in England and my family moved to Australia when I was 10. I was lucky and grew up here in Canberra. I joined the ACT Labor Party in 1983. My interests have always revolved around economic and social justice. Through my work with the union I have developed a keen interest in transport and superannuation issues. I hope to continue to pursue these through the Senate committee structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I moved to Victoria in 1987 and have lived in the west of Melbourne for almost all of that period. I was honoured to be elected to the Footscray Council in 1993, albeit for a short period before the Kennett government abolished local councils. We hope that elections will be held some time in the next 12 months. My short time in that office was an exciting period when I learnt much about the needs of a diverse community like the Footscray area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to thank a number of people, first of all Robert Ray, my long&hyphen;time friend and now my colleague; second, all of my family in England, who I wish were able to be here today; and, finally, my mum and dad, who have stood by me always.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most people would have no trouble with the intention of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill. That was quite clear when the former government introduced this legislation in its last term of office. One of the most important things about it is its capacity to assist people interested in having available for listing and marketing in this country various medications. It provides the process to make that system more rapid so that the drugs can be more quickly available to the community. That is a benefit, particularly in terms of the costs of having sufficient time to test scientifically, to do the research to make sure that those drugs conform to safety, efficacy and quality standards, and to protect what the TGA has been at pains to establish over the last number of years&mdash;a reputation for excellence. It has done that, and that is something we must be at pains to protect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, there is room for improvement in most systems most of the time. The speed at which medications have been able to get on the register has been in some cases slow. Indeed, the significant recommendations of the Baume report into the TGA those years ago were clearly about making the examination and approval of medications much more timely. The people who were involved in this improvement need to be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="574"> It is also particularly important to place on record the importance of the TGA, its scientific excellence and the reputation it has established which is of benefit to the Australian community and very important for our export development and the increased oppor tunity we have for taking or making available that excellence to overseas countries. The Australia `R' or the Australia `L' on medications is something that is much sought after by countries in our region, particularly those in the Asian Pacific region. So the processes that we are talking about here and the impact of the amendments are particularly important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the reason I want to speak on this bill is to put on record some comments about the proposed amendments, particularly the amendment by Senator Harradine, going as it does to matters of great importance and raising significant questions about the whole process that I have just talked about.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, it must be said that even after 13 years in this place you still have the capacity to completely trick me with the procedures. I understood from what Senator Woods said that we were going to proceed to 7.20 p.m., and I appreciate that. So I knew there would be a small interruption, but now some people are indicating to me that it may not be appropriate for me to talk about an amendment before that amendment has been moved. I am quite sure that senators are free to talk about whatever they like, but if this is absolutely, completely contra dig could I please be advised of it? I do not believe it is, is it, Senator Harradine? No, it is not. Thank you very much for that timely intervention over the chamber that might have discommoded me. No, it does not discommode me at all, Senator. I intend to say it and I will. But you should not provoke <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> me, Senator Harradine, because you might get me a little cross.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I was going to say, Senator Harradine, is that this matter&mdash;that is, an amendment that you propose to put in the committee stage of this bill dealing with specific concerns about the importation of abortifacients into this country&mdash;has long been known to be of serious consideration and concern to you. I very much respect those views, Senator, and I respect the views of people who hold quite different views from me. I would also like to think that others in the community respected my right to hold a slightly different view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is more important than the questions I want to ask you&mdash;and I will certainly be asking you them during the committee stage&mdash;goes to the exact way you have shaped your amendment, which I think raises matters of some concern. They are the ones I want to put on the record here tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, I have just referred to the excellence established by the TGA over a number of years. One of the ways it has been able to do this is by its scientific arm's length approach to assessment. But I am not at all sure, Senator Harradine, that one of your amendments does not threaten to jeopardise that, at least to some extent. It singles out a class of medications for certain purposes. Therefore, it is at least in danger of suggesting that this category of medications is different and requires a different approach. That at least is a minimum approach. It may not be of major significance but I think it has some importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I want to comment at the committee stage&mdash;but I want to raise the point here&mdash;on part of your amendment which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"1A. Subsection 3(1):</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insert:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">`"restricted goods"</EMPHASIS>  means drugs within regulation 2 of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations (including progesterone antagonists and vaccines against human chorionic gonadotrophin) intended for use in women as abortifacients.</PARA>
<PARA>My concern is: at what stage does the intention of use need to be clear, particularly as you require under this amendment the minister to make a decision in writing about whether or not such a medication can be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="575"> approved. It is very problematic because some of the medications under this classification currently get into this country under the special access scheme for other than use as abortifacients. It is going to be a very interesting problem to be requiring the people making application to be able to persuade the minister and for the minister to be assured and certain that it is intended for use as an abortifacient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What if the medication is to be used for the treatment of Cushing's tumour, adrenal cancer, brain tumour or breast cancer? At what stage in the process under your amendment, Senator, do those very curly issues become clear? That is the first point of concern I have about your amendment. I am very aware of the numbers in this chamber and I am very aware of what the outcome of this amendment will be. I am not here to argue hotly against it but I am interested in the opportunity presented to me to raise serious concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns do not go to the philosophical or moral debate. They go to my concern about arm's length scientific rigour being maintained by the TGA. They go to a certain confusion I have about the wording of this amendment `intended for use . . . as abortifacients', particularly when some of those medications are already brought into this country under the special access scheme for other than use as abortifacients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of people who have a major concern about this proposed amendment because of the singling out of medications to be used as abortifacients. People feel there will be some problem about the ongoing question of women's health, their access to treatment and, in particular, their access to termination of pregnancy if that is what they are advised or what they choose. I am interested in and will be listening closely to how you see that your proposal will not in any way jeopardise those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very large number of people have written to me, not only the Public Health Association and the Family Planning Association of Australia, but also the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association&mdash;a group which is singularly different from the first <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> two, particularly in terms of its constituency and so on. There is a concern about singling these drugs out. I have an extra concern about how and when you would be clarifying the intent to use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to have these concerns on the record, particularly because I appreciate Senator Harradine's commitment and concern in this area. I would like to be absolutely sure that any amendment that is moved and any change in process that will result from the passage of such an amendment will not jeopardise the objectivity and scientific rigour of the TGA. I suspect it will not, or at least a case will be able to be made for that, but at least in part a case can be made for the other way. These drugs are singled out and I would like to know how you see that process working, because it could put that in jeopardy. I reiterate a great concern I have about the words `intended for use' and exactly when that intention will be discovered, and by whom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have a concern that your amendment proposes that such approval for these medications to come into this country must be given in writing by the minister. Again, I think this will create another layer of concern. I certainly have some points to make about this. I am concerned about the potential to hold the minister to ransom. Senator Harradine, you are one person who, I think, would understand exactly how the gun lobby has held ministers and members in this country to ransom over the last number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has taken a tragedy for people who have previously been concerned about what would be the electoral implications to move beyond that. Here I give great credit to the leadership of Prime Minister Howard and Leader of the Opposition Kim Beazley&mdash;particularly Mr Howard in this case. But it is awful that it has taken a tragedy to move people beyond being held to ransom in their own electorates. We know that that has been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that there could be the holding to ransom of a minister about the importation of medications if the minister is bound to give approval before the medication is introduced. I am also concerned that this amendment does not require the minister to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="576"> say why the minister would not give an approval. That is, the requirement for the minister to report is clear but the requirement for the minister to report why there was not approval is absent. That is a bit of a defect in the proposed amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand your amendment, Senator, you are also proposing that the minister's approval be a disallowable instrument in this place. Again, I would suggest that that is something I will very strongly argue against. I am not sure if you can indicate to me across the chamber whether that will be proceeding or not. I gather it is not proceeding. I thank you for that, Senator Harradine. I think that there is great wisdom in that because, again, it is a very provocative and possibly a very dangerous precedent and challenging amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even so, the minister's approval is going to have to be gazetted, and that still allows for a concern in the community to be raised at every opportunity by somebody drawing to attention in this place&mdash;or to communities or lobby groups&mdash;that such approval has been given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I think Australia needs to be congratulated for is the way that, by and large, we muddle through with a fair amount of equanimity, even when people hold significant and passionately held different views. We do not have, at this stage, too many people shot because they either provide termination of pregnancy or seek it. We had a police raid a few years ago in Brisbane that set an example that nobody wants to ever see followed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passions run high on some of these issues and, by and large, Australia has managed this very fraught debate with a fair amount of even&hyphen;handedness. I would hope that that continues, and I would suggest that there is the possibility, with the reporting of this in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> by the minister, that it will lead to recurring or more often occurring debates on this very fraught issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps you would say, Senator Harradine, that I have just answered my own argument and that if we draw on the history of Australia's reasonableness to this point we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can count on it in future. I hope that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the few minutes left to me I would like to raise the point that abortifacients are a restricted good under the customs restricted importations legislation. They are category 1 as I understand, but I might be inaccurate about that. Underneath them is a second category called `aphrodisiacs'. A few hundred years ago witches were burned at the stake for coming up with mumbo jumbo like aphrodisiacs. I find it quite remarkable that they are still listed there. My parting comment would be that, if we had more restriction of aphrodisiacs, we would need less restriction on abortifacients.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will keep my comments brief tonight in the hope that we can at least get through the second reading stage of this bill, which seems to have been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  forever. It goes back to last September when it went through the House of Representatives. I just say, though, that the industry groups are very keen for this to go ahead. Among other things, it will establish new procedures for listing, on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, drugs for supply and use in Australia&mdash;and the sorts of drugs we are talking about are vitamin supplements, herbal remedies, herbal medicines, et cetera. It will also clarify the distinction between food and therapeutic goods to minimise some of the confusion about what is actually regulated under the act. It will also amend the procedures for reviewing decisions relating to the registration of therapeutic goods on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to briefly deal with some longer term problems with the therapeutic goods legislation. I understand the minister is aware of these. I want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that no new substances have been approved for use in natural products in Australia since the introduction of this legislation, and that was back in the late 1980s. I believe this is due to what really are very difficult approval processes for these substances. I look forward to the secretariat representing the minister giving us some time lines for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="577"> looking at some of the longer term problems with this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot go and leave my comments tonight at just that. I believe I have to comment on what has become the substantive debate about this legislation, and that concerns Senator Harradine's amendments. Obviously, Senator Harradine has a longstanding interest in these issues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While respecting Senator Harradine's views, opinions and beliefs on this issue, I do have to make it very clear to senators that what we are voting for, if we support those amendments, is a restriction on women for the right to choose. They are restricting a woman's choice, to require her to terminate a pregnancy only by surgical means. They will effectively take away what is now termed the morning after pill or RU486 and future generations of this pill or a similar substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe it will be achieved by the minister saying yes or no. I believe that the effect of these amendments will be to discourage and dissuade manufacturers from trying to walk the two courses. The normal course of events for any medication that is possibly dangerous is to have medical and scientific evaluation. Of course these drugs, and indeed a wide rang of drugs, particularly some of those that are used for treating cancers and some of the experimental drugs in the HIV&hyphen;AIDS area, have to undergo the most rigorous possible medical and scientific testing that they can. But by singling out this particular type of drug, we are setting another course, a political course&mdash;a political series of hurdles&mdash;and, as Senator Crowley has already said, opening it up for particular interest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> groups to put enormous pressure on individual members of parliament, and on the minister in particular, to get their particular view across.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I obviously accept the right&mdash;indeed in this country we appreciate the right&mdash;to all have individual views, but I believe that by making this particular drug subjected to this second test, it will simply deter manufacture. It will deter those people who have developed these drugs overseas from ever seeking approval in this country. I may be wrong, but I believe with RU486 that has already happened. I will have more to say on these particular amendments in the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is brought forward by the government as a priority bill for introduction and for passage in this session. The provisions of the bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the ARTG, the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This new process should significantly reduce the approval times to a matter of weeks without affecting the quality or the safety of the products in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the new scheme, the products must meet the same criteria as they currently do. The criteria include a statement that the goods are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, being the purposes identified in the application for marketing and not other purposes which go beyond the accepted indications for the therapeutic uses of that product. The scheme also provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods which have been identified in the first five years of its operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A mechanism to address shortages or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the act the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill introduces changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="578"> with the penalty units classification used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality or safety or efficacy from the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also included in this bill are provisions to permit warrantless entry of premises to seize goods, but limiting this power to situations where there is an imminent public health risk of death or serious injury and where there are reasonable grounds for believing that illegal activity is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition for food has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of therapeutic goods which excludes food but fails to define the term. What constitutes food in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words `prescribed dose' and `frequency of administration' included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This will ensure that technical and scientific data that should be lodged in connection with a general marketing application will be evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administration Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The bill also corrects a defect in the legislation regarding the ability of the secretary to approve the inclusion on the ARTG of products for export only where those products have been refused marketing approval in Australia. In those circumstances, the secretary is currently empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods. This power is however limited to goods that have been manufactured in Australia for export only and does not extend to products imported into Australia solely for re&hyphen;export. The bill proposes that this provision be amended to ensure that the secretary's ability to require confir mation from Australia's trading partners of their willingness to accept those goods which have been refused marketing approval in Australia extends to all products irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in Australia or elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, this bill will benefit Australia's therapeutic industry and further enhance Australia's role as a leader in drug evaluation, registration and regulation in the region. The main act has now been in place for some five or six years and, although it has generally worked well, there have been some problems&mdash;and they were touched upon by Senator Lees. As a result of that, the government will be reviewing the workings of the bill and reviewing the bill in consultation with the appropriate industries, some members of whom I see in the gallery here today, and we hope to do that in the fairly near future. I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA>Let me make it perfectly clear that the concerns expressed by Senator Crowley were unwarranted. I was trying to suggest it might have been better for people to listen to the arguments advanced in support of these amendments prior to dealing with them at the second reading stage. I did not suggest that it was necessarily against standing orders for that to be done; but I thought that it might have been a better way of dealing with them. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> However, Senator Crowley chose to do it the latter way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of these amendments is perfectly clear: to ensure that these particular drugs, which are significantly different in nature to other drugs which are termed therapeutic goods, should not be left entirely in the hands of science technologists and the sponsors of the particular drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have distributed to honourable senators explanations of the amendments. The first amendment seeks to establish restricted goods as defined. That is to say, drugs within regulation 2 of the therapeutic goods regulations&mdash;including progesterone antagonists and vaccines against human chorionic gonadotrophin&mdash;intended for use in women as abortifacients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill that we are currently discussing is, in fact, a bill that was first read in the Senate on 16 October last year. The government sought to have the bill dealt with during the time for debating non&hyphen;controversial legislation. The government at that particular stage indicated that it desired to deal with this matter as a non&hyphen;controversial debate. That was overturned because members of the government themselves realised that, with my amendments, it could not be so regarded as non&hyphen;controversial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had correspondence from the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia strongly opposing the proposed amendments on the basis that the Therapeutic Goods Administration processes require an independent scientific and clinical assessment as to the safety, quality and efficacy of particular drugs sponsored. It was these processes which moved me to propose this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="580"> As a result of the Baume review in 1993, the controls over clinical trials in Australia have very much loosened. The new clinical trials notification scheme, the CTN scheme, simply requires the sponsor to notify the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the trial of unapproved products and send a certificate of approval given by an institutional ethics committee. On the payment of the $110 CTN notification fee, the Therapeutic Goods Ad ministration allows it to proceed prior to the consideration by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, ADEC, and possible listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, ARTG, for marketing purposes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second matter is one about which I spoke in this chamber just the other day: the Senate committee report into Eastlink.

It is in the public interest as well as in the interest of the electricity industry and the government that the issue be more fully examined.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One hundred and seventeen student delegates from 104 schools from all sectors in every Australian State and Territory took part in the Convention organised by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention was opened by Senator Margaret Reid, who was introduced by Sir Ninian Stephen, the Chair of the Constitutional Centenary Foundation. Senator Reid delivered an address on behalf of the Prime Minister, which drew parallels between the Schools Convention and the purpose and function of the People's Convention to be held in 1997. In particular, the Prime Minister noted the importance of "open inquiry and debate" on constitutional matters and stated his Government's commitment to "foster and encourage calm and serious debate about Australia's Constitution so that, if changes are to be made, they can be made with wide understanding and support".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other speakers included Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, Senator Bill O'Chee, Professor Elaine Thomson, Ms Pat Turner, and Ms Cassandra Gelade.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very substantial majority agreed that the preamble should be changed irrespective of the outcome of the republican debate, because there were reasons for change apart from the references to the Crown. All delegates agreed that statements in the preamble about the Crown, (or anything else) should be consistent with Australia's current constitutional arrangements, as expressed in the body of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What changes should be made?</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was widespread agreement that the preamble should be completely rewritten, although some elements of the current preamble might be retained. Logically, the new preamble should be included in the Constitution itself, by referendum, rather than left as the preamble to the Constitution Act. A small minority of delegates sought more limited changes to the preamble which might, on this view, remain in the Act rather than the Constitution. The uncertainty about the way in which changes of this kind might be brought about was noted, with the choice lying between co-operation between the Commonwealth and all State Parliaments or approval at referendum.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="585" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Consignments of pig middles are only able to be imported from Canada or the southern island of New Zealand. AQIS has no record of any importations of pig middles from the southern island of New Zealand. Only one consignment of pork middles has been imported from Canada since December 1995. This consignment was imported purely for evaluation and testing and was not used for commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) This information is commercial-in-confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) As this consignment was used for evaluation at a Quarantine Approved Premises prior to disposal by autoclaving or incineration, processing details are not relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The labels used for marketing the pig middles would be determined by the importer, wholesaler or retailer of the product. Under current arrangements, labels are required to comply with the provisions of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA) which prohibits false and misleading labelling of all products (not just food); <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="586"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Australian Food Standards Code which requires all packaged and certain unpackaged food to carry country of origin labelling; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Commerce (Imports) Regulations for imports which require certain goods (including food) to bear a trade description.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present there are no definitions provided in the TPA, the Food Standards Code or the import regulations for descriptions of claims to Australian origin. The Federal Court has decided that products can be described as `made' or `produced' in a country if the product acquires its essential character or qualities in that country. Case law provides industries with guidance how to apply country of origin claims to specific products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) This information is commercial-in-confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) During the 1996 election campaign, the Government pledged to improve anti-dumping and countervailing procedures, including reducing the time taken to obtain dumping remedies, to ensure Australian producers are not disadvantaged. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is now considering the steps necessary to give effect to this commitment. A timeframe for action will be drawn up when these steps have been determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The issue of food origin labelling is currently being considered by the National Food Authority (NFA). The NFA has advised that it is developing a draft standard setting out country of origin labelling requirements for food products to be included in the Food Standards Code. The draft standard is based on a three tiered system of origin labelling definitions agreed to  by the food industry, unions, and farmer and consumer associations. Once finalised, the proposed changes will be considered by the NFA Board. The NFA will then make its recommendation to the National Food Standards Council (NFSC). The NFSC is comprised of Health Ministers who are responsible for food standards at the Commonwealth, State and Territory level. A majority of Ministers must approve the recommendation before it comes into effect. There are dispute resolution procedures in place should any members disagree. A lead time of at least 12 months after gazettal will be permitted to allow manufacturers to make the necessary labelling changes. The NFA advises that it should be able to make its recommendation to the NFSC within the next few months. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
