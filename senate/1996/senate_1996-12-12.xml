<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">REFORM OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my August ministerial statement, Reforming Employment Assistance&mdash;Helping Australians into Real Jobs, I outlined the government's vision for the most radical changes to employment services since the establishment of the Commonwealth Employment Service in 1946. Since the release of that statement, the government has undertaken extensive consultations about the government's proposals with interested groups in the community across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this sitting I am introducing a package of legislation to provide the statutory framework for implementing the government's reforms to employment services. As well as this bill, the package includes the reform of Employment Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1996 which would cover other matters required for the implementation of the government's reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth services delivery agency bill 1996, which has been introduced in this sitting, completes the legislative framework for the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective of the government's reforms is to ensure that labour market assistance has a clear focus on real job outcomes and makes a genuine difference to those assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of legislation would provide for reforming employment services in a way which is largely consistent with the feedback we have had from the community in that consultation process. At the same time the reforms remain true to the government's belief that labour market assistance must be made more effective by focusing clearly on real job outcomes and opening up the employment placement market to the advantages of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms to labour market services in the bills should also be seen in the broader context of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's commitments to deficit reduction and budgetary discipline. These commitments are essential for increasing the growth capacity of the Australian economy and ultimately for delivering sustained reductions in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government's structural reforms will produce an environment in which business, particularly small business, will continue to grow and create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Workplace Relations And Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 allows for more genuine enterprise bargaining, opening the way for more flexible workplace practices and greater productivity and international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Microeconomic and regulatory reforms will reduce business costs and add to the competitiveness of Australian firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No government program can equal the benefit that will flow from getting Australia's economic policy setting right as the base for creating jobs. However, government together with private enterprise and community organisations can play an important role in equipping job seekers with the skills, experience and opportunities to benefit from real jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the government's reforms are significant and far reaching, much of the machinery to achieve them is not new. We have built on previous arrangements which worked well&mdash;in particular individualised one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one assistance for disadvantaged job seekers. The referral procedures in this legislation for employment assistance have refined and streamlined the current referral procedures for case management. The numerous programs that were operating, either poorly or not at all, and that were, in many cases, simply churning job seekers through those programs without obtaining real outcomes, have been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My August statement outlined six principles for the reform of employment services. They were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The assistance to job seekers should be based on their individual needs and their capacity to benefit from it in terms of achieving an employment outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Providers should have access to flexible forms of assistance that fit the needs of job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The incentive framework should reward providers of labour market assistance primarily for placing job seekers in real jobs, with additional incentives for those most in need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A competitive market for employment placement services should separate purchaser from providers and ensure that providers operate on the basis of competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Conditions for payment of income support for unemployed people should be linked closely with active employment assistance measures. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7260"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Job seekers and employers should be able to receive high quality and streamlined service from the agencies and providers with which they interact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is in keeping with these principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aims of the legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of this legislation is to establish the mechanisms to deliver employment services and to establish a fully competitive market for employment assistance to job seekers. In particular, the bill would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Enable the Commonwealth to engage entities to provide employment services;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Define the criteria for participation in the employment assistance scheme ( "employment assistance" as it is called in the bill was referred to as "intensive employment assistance" in my ministerial statement)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Provide for the procedures for referring participants in the employment assistance scheme to employment placement enterprises (or EPES);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Outline compliance requirements of job seekers under the bill;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Allow for the investigation of complaints about the provision of employment services;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Include provisions to ensure the confidentiality of information concerning users of employment services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation would complement the Commonwealth services delivery agency bill 1996 that would establish and provide for the management and activities of the agency as a provider of integrated government services&mdash;social security and employment services in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Provision of employment services</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill would provide for the provision of "employment services".

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment services providers are to compete for contracts to provide employment services which would be awarded by tender.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's intention is for employment assistance is to be based on an assessment of the personal needs of each job seeker. Its aim is to enable that person to gain employment or improve their employment prospects. The legislation would provide for the minister for employment, education, training and youth affairs to make a written determination of services which will be taken to be the provision of employment assistance. Assistance may involve training, job search assistance, wage subsidies or other innovative and flexible forms of assistance. EPES would be free to decide with the participant the optimal kinds and mix of assistance needed to get the participant a job. Participants would generally receive employment assistance for 12 months, although extensions will be allowed in particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agency would be responsible, on behalf of the employment secretary, for deciding which job seekers would be participants in the employment assistance scheme. The agreement between the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employment secretary and the agency will specify guidelines for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My ministerial statement indicated that (intensive) employment assistance eligibility should be confined to job seekers who have been unemployed for 12 months or more or are assessed as at high risk of long&hyphen;term unemployment, and who are:</PARA>

The determination may also include matters to be taken into account by the agency, on behalf of the employment secretary, when determining a person is not eligible for employment assistance.

For this reason, the legislation would provide discretion on the part of the agency, on behalf of the employment secretary, to ration the flow of people eligible for employment assistance into employment assistance participation. Eligibility for employment assistance does not imply automatic or immediate access to employment assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff in the agency would be acting under the authority delegated by the employment secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depending on available employment assistance places, the agency would notify in writing a job seeker who is eligible for employment assistance (or who is likely to become eligible) to attend an interview. Generally this interview would be with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7262"> the agency. However, the agency may nominate another person to conduct the interview. This could be, for example, if the agency considers that the person should have a professional assessment of barriers to employment. If the agency considers that the person could reasonably be referred to an EPE for employment assistance, the person must be notified in writing that he or she is now a participant in the employment assistance scheme and should choose an EPE. Whether a person could reasonably be referred to an EPE would often depend upon whether there are sufficient employment assistance places available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that participants are fully aware of their rights and obligations, the legislation would provide that the participant must be given written information about employment assistance and informed that he or she will be required to enter into an employment assistance activity agreement (EAAA).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my ministerial statement I flagged the concept of "capacity to benefit". The public consultation process revealed a community concern that in applying the notion of "capacity to benefit" from employment assistance, the government would permanently exclude some very disadvantaged people from employment assistance and deny them any form of government assistance other than income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After discussions with community sector representatives the government has decided that what is really at issue here is the necessity for some job seekers to have a special needs assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not intended to mean that some people will be put on the scrapheap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It means that the government recognises that it is not fair to require some unemployed people to go through the hoops of preparing for employment when they are in no position to hold down a job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The vast majority of unemployed people will not require this special needs assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a special needs assessment is judged to be required, it will be a formal and objective assessment of a job seeker's personal characteristics to see whether employment assistance of the type and level able to be offered is really fitting for their special needs.

If a job seeker's personal circumstances change during participation in the community support program, eligibility for employment assistance would be reviewed.

The terms of the EAAA must take into account the participant's capacity to comply with the agreement, such as their education and the state of the local labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation would require the participant to negotiate and comply with their EAAA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make a number of amendments to enhance the Fisheries Administration Act 1991, the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fisheries Administration Act and the Fisheries Management Act came into effect in February 1992 and the proposed amendments seek to correct minor anomalies in them that have been identified over the last 4 years, streamline their administration and generally improve the efficiency of fisheries management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the Fisheries Administration Act, a number of the proposed amendments seek to clarify the wording to put beyond doubt the original intention</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About the functions of the australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). In particular, the amendments make it explicit that AFMA is not only to devise but also to manage and carry out, adjustment, restructuring, exploratory and feasibility fishing programs. Secondly, AFMA is to have the function of providing expertise to and exchanging information with states and territories as well as overseas bodies having functions similar to AFMA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment provides for the maximum period for which a person can serve consecutive terms as a director of AFMA to be expressed in years instead of as a number of terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of further amendments specify arrangements under which subcommittees to fisheries <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7265"> management advisory committees may be established and operate. A minor consequential amendment is also made to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to enable that tribunal to determine travelling allowances payable to management advisory committee and subcommittee members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both the Fisheries Administration Act and the Fisheries Management Act, some definitions are clarified and some new definitions are added.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the Fisheries Management Act is concerned, one of the most significant amendments gives effect to the government's policy announced before the last election to provide greater security of long term access to fisheries. The purpose of these amendment is to protect the fishing industry against changes in government or administrative policy which the revocation of management plans might otherwise entail. This will give greater security of investment to both fishing operators and financiers. Under the amendments, where a management plan for a fishery is revoked, any subsequent plan that covers all or part of that fishery must provide that holders of statutory fishing rights at the time of the revocation will have first option on a proportional basis to similar rights granted under that subsequent plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the management act seek to improve arrangements for the registration of interests and dealings in statutory fishing rights and administrative arrangements in respect of fisheries which are managed by a fisheries joint authority under commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fisheries joint authorities provide one type of arrangement for achieving co-operation between the commonwealth, the states and the northern territory in the management of fisheries. Joint authorities are bodies consisting of commonwealth and state or territory ministers responsible for fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As things stand, the ministers in the joint authority may delegate powers to AFMA, but AFMA has no intrinsic powers in the management of joint authority fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The philosophy of the management act is to divorce the commonwealth minister from day-to-day management decisions and, to this end, the primary function of the minister in relation to commonwealth fisheries is to accept plans of management determined by AFMA. This is not the case with joint authority fisheries and, after due consultation with the states, the amendments seek to rectify this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill therefore amends the management act to create the same relationship between AFMA and joint authorities as it has with the commonwealth minister in-respect of other commonwealth-managed fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments to the Fisheries Management Act focus on various enforcement, penalty <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and related provisions, a number of which arise from recommendations made in the 1993 report fisheries reviewed by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of these amendments relates to the powers of officers to enter land or premises specified in a fish receiver permit. Currently, an officer may enter such premises only with the consent of the holder of the fish receiver permit or under a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to amend the act to enable officers to enter premises subject to a fish receiver permit for monitoring purposes at any time without the requirement for either consent or warrant and to secure property pending the obtaining of a warrant. However, the power to seize property or documents will still be conditional on the officer having a warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tn other circumstances, where a warrant is required for a search to be conducted, there has been criticism that the obtaining of warrants under section 85 of the management act is cumbersome compared to obtaining warrants under the Crimes Act 1914. The bill amends the act so that it reflects the crimes act provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 95 provides for various offences which, with the exception of offences relating to foreign boats, are dealt with summarily and attract maximum fines of $10,000. This level off penalty is inadequate when the commission of single offences can net the offender in excess of $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to section 95 increase the level of penalties, those currently at $10,000 to $25,000, those currently at $5,000 to $12,500 and those currently at $2,000 to $5,000. Maximum fines applicable to certain offences involving the use of foreign boats are set at $50,000 and there is no intention to raise these penalties. However, in line with commonwealth criminal law policy as expressed in the crimes act, opportunity is taken to express all penalties as penalty units, currently with the value of $100 per unit. This enables a change to the unit value in the crimes act to have effect in all commonwealth legislation in which penalties are expressed in these units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Torres Strait Fisheries Act, being of earlier origin, lacks some of the features included in the administration and management acts. It is proposed to amend the torres strait act to give the torres strait protected zone joint authority one of the powers considered central to modern fisheries management, namely the power to make management plans. These amendments envisage the making of management plans for torres strait fisheries based on units of fishing capacity, which could be based on inputs or outputs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 is to make amendments to portfolio legislation and to make amendments to other legislation affecting the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Honourable Warwick Smith MP, Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government announced on 4 June 1996 that the National Capital Planning Authority would be known as the National Capital Authority reflecting a greater emphasis on the Authority's statutory responsibility for fostering an awareness of Canberra as the National Capital. The new name more accurately encompasses the broad responsibilities of the organisation in representing the Commonwealth's ongoing interests in the Australian Capital Territory. As well as planning, the Authority has land and asset management responsibilities and has taken over the role of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coordinating the Commonwealth's interests in the promotion and marketing of the National Capital and the integration of such activities with tourism strategies. The new name has been in use for non&hyphen;statutory functions since 1 July 1996, and the amendment to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 will enable its use for statutory functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 contained in this bill include a provision which will enable the Agency to charge a fee where services for and related to drug testing and educational services are provided on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agency provides a commercial drug testing service in addition to its public interest drug testing program conducted as part of the Agency's statutory obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1995&hyphen;96 over 950 tests were conducted by the Agency on a `user&hyphen;pays' basis representing over one third of the Agency's annual tests. Under its commercial drug testing program the Agency has entered into contracts with national sports leagues such as the Australian Football League and the Australian Rugby League and, international sporting organisations. The Agency conducted drug testing at the 1996 World Junior Athletics Championships and at the 1996 International <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald Sun</EMPHASIS>  and Commonwealth Bank Cycle tours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By charging for selected services the amendment will enhance the Agency's ability to further contract professional and international sporting organisations. It will enable the Agency to respond to the demand for drug testing especially in light of the increase in professional sporting competitions conducted by Australian sporting organisations within and outside Australia and the increase in international competitors training or competing in Australia in the lead up to the 2000 Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integrity of Australia's sports drug testing programs are recognised throughout the world. The Government is committed to the work of the Australian Sports Drug Agency and the betterment of its programs in the lead up to the 2000 Games. The bill will also amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 to provide that a competitor who interferes with a sample by deliberately disrupting the sample collection and sealing process in an attempt to compromise the integrity and accuracy of the sample may be penalised. The inclusion of an act of wilful interference as a doping offence will further enhance the integrity of the Agency's drug testing program and ensure that fairness and equity between competitors is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes amendments to the Coral Sea Islands Act 1969. Australia exercises sovereignty over the islands on Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7267"> which are located approximately 600 kilometres to the east of continental Australia and 150 km north of Lord Howe Island. Those reefs already form part of a marine nature reserve established under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. The proposed amendments to the Coral Sea Islands Act 1969 as part of this portfolio bill will incorporate the Australian islands on these reefs into the Coral Sea Islands Territory and thus ensure that there is an adequate system of laws applying to those islands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of amendments to the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. It removes a tautology in the present definition of an "ecological community", and also clarifies the assessment of an "endangered ecological community".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The period within which the Minister must gazette any new inclusion of Endangered Species or Vulnerable Species or other amendments to the Schedules to the act is extended to 90 days from the time the Minister receives advice from the independent Endangered Species Scientific Subcommittee. The increase will allow adequate time for the Minister to make a decision and also recognises the requirement at subsection 23(4) for the Minister to consult with Commonwealth agencies when considering the listing of a key threatening process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 regulates the substances that can be dumped at sea. The proposed amendments to that act will bring it into line with current practice and ensure that Australia can meet its international obligations agreed at the November 1993 Consultative Meeting of the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, known as the London Convention. The amendments are long overdue given that most of the international obligations which flow from the 1993 agreements have already entered into force in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current Australian practice does now allow the dumping at sea of radioactive waste or material, nor the incineration of wastes at sea. The amendments bring the act into line with the current practice, with a revised definition of radioactivity (above exempt levels as defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency), and the prohibition of incineration of sewage sludge and industrial wastes at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ban on dumping of industrial waste at sea came into effect internationally on 1 January 1996. Except for jarosite, Australia does not dump industrial waste at sea. Australia applied to the London Convention for an exemption from this ban to allow dumping of jarosite for a limited time, to the end of December 1997, to allow alternative processes of the waste to be developed. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also allow for Public Environment Report (PER) processes under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, in relation to an application under the Sea Dumping Act. The Sea Dumping Act already provides for an Inquiry and an Environmental Impact Statement directed under the EP(IP) Act. The proposed amendments will extend the running of the statutory period under the Sea Dumping Act to allow for the completion of procedures relating to a PER under the EP(IP) Act. Other changes to the act are `housekeeping' amendments intended to remove anomalies between existing text and the present amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes a number of amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to correct drafting errors, remove redundant provisions and effect a number of substantive changes. In particular, the bill makes changes to s.38J to clarify upon whom obligations are imposed in relation to the discharge of waste in the Marine Park, with particular application to Defence vessels and aircraft, to avoid an unintended result. Presently, discharges from Defence vessels and aircraft for the purposes of combating pollution incidents or saving lives are not lawful under the operation of s.38J. The provisions in this section were originally not intended to apply to Defence vessels and aircraft, because their activities are closely controlled by Marine Park Zoning plans. The correction of this anomaly will not have an adverse effect on the Park itself. The Zoning Plans allow for the conduct of defence operations in the Park, subject to the reasonable directions of the Marine Park Authority. The Marine Park Authority has worked closely with the Australian Defence Force on matters concerning the Marine Park. This means for example that the Navy's operational guidelines dealing with discharges of waste exceed the standards required of tourism operators. In addition, the Royal Australian Navy has spent around $50 million upgrading existing shipping to meet the requirements of Annex 4 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 known as the MARPOL Convention, even though the element of the MARPOL Convention which deals with the discharge of sewage is not yet in force internationally. Given that the Zoning Plans are binding on the Commonwealth, there is already sufficient control over discharges from Defence vessels and aircraft, justifying their exemption from s.38J.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes provision for the power of delegation for the Minister under section 7A. Section 7A of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act allows for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to provide assistance to other institutions or persons on matters of environmental management. However such assistance must have the approval of the Minister administering the act. The act prevents approval from being given where the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7268"> provision of assistance would adversely affect the ability of the Authority to perform its functions under that act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment allows the Minister responsible for administering the act to delegate his or her powers to grant such an approval to the Authority or the Chairperson of the Authority. In exercising the delegation, the Authority or the Chairperson would be required to apply the same test as the Minister in determining whether to approve the provision of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is an acknowledged world leader in the area of marine management, and the ability of the Authority to provide assistance on this issue on a cost recovery basis to other institutions and persons both nationally and internationally enhances that reputation. It also allows the Authority to take advantage of new ideas and approaches in other areas and modify its approach here in Australia to ensure the best management approach for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I am of the view that a delegation to the Chairperson of the Authority would be both logistically efficient and accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, with respect to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, proposed amendments will clarify the scope of enforcement provisions which may be made under Plans of Management. The first of the Plans of Management prepared under the 1995 amendments, dealing with the protection of dugong in Shoalwater Bay, will soon be put into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes minor amendments to extend the Customs Act 1901, the Quarantine Act 1908 and the Migration Act 1958 so that the provisions of those acts may be applied to the Commonwealth Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands. There has been an increase in unauthorised arrivals on the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands. The Government proposes to amend these acts to provide a legal basis for border control, including over possible importation of drugs, for control over vermin and the import of diseased wood or fibres. It also provides a sound platform for the orderly management of persons arriving in the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes amendments to the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to clarify matters arising from drafting errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area Conservation Act 1994 is amended to update a reference to an Agreement made between the Commonwealth and Queensland, to make clear that it includes that Agreement as amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will not have any significant financial impact, though a minor increase in revenue could result from the amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enable the Agency to raise fees for its services rendered on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the Autumn sittings, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. 1&mdash;That regulations 1 to 6 (inclusive) of the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996 No. 261 and made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. 2&mdash;That regulation 7 of the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996 No. 261 and made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>In moving these two motions together, and recognising that there is only 10 minutes for my contribution this morning, I say that the opposition sees these two government proposals as indicative of the mean spirited approach they are taking to students in the whole education sector. We are talking here of proposals such as these coming as part of a package of an attack on the education sector, which has led to some $1.9 billion in cuts and, in respect of students, some $800 million being taken out of their pockets over a short period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has sought to do by the regulations that are subject to the disallowance is to increase the age of independence and, in doing so, to reverse an important reform of the previous government which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7270"> brought the age down from 25 to 22 in three annual steps starting in 1992. The presumption that people up to their mid&hyphen;20s have a relationship of financial dependence on their parents is patently untenable. Before we reduced the age limit, it was very much one of the two top priorities of student organisations in their annual budget submissions. To reverse it now, to try to argue that students in their mid-20s should be presumed to have a financial relationship of dependency on their parents, is patently untenable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here, basically, essentially and starkly, is a grab for cash. It is a baseless excuse to try to argue that students are dependent. The real agenda here can be exposed to be the fact that the original decision in the budget papers would have saved some $242 million from students' pockets over the course of the forward estimates. That decision has been amended slightly. What we are talking about now is savings of some $210 million through the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), in the budget statement, referred to this measure targeting the well&hyphen;off families. This is double speak. It comes from the minister for double speak. Essentially, the families we are talking about here are families that have very modest incomes. Remember, Austudy starts to taper off at a joint family income of some $22,650.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also talking here of a growing number of people who can be classified as being Howard's losers. Some 14,000 people will have their payments reduced and some 12,000 will become totally ineligible for payments. So it is a grab for cash. No matter how the minister tries to justify it, no matter how she tries to describe it, no matter what language is used in the budget statements in terms of targeting well&hyphen;off families, we are talking here of ripping some $210 million from students on the pretence that they should be presumed to be financially dependent on their parents until they are in their mid-20s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the first of my two disallowance motions for this morning. The issues are pretty simple. It is a matter of judgment for the Senate as to whether we dig our heads <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into the sand and argue that people should be presumed to be financially dependent on their parents up to that age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second motion goes to regulations which are, I think, particularly mean spirited and particularly devastating in their impact. I have had a number of students come to see me over my years as a member of parliament&mdash;students who cannot live at home, students who have been forced out of their homes for one reason or another, and students who are very keen and have been very keen to continue with their secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You get some real heart wrenching cases. Time and time again, you look at their statistics, you look at their income, you look at what they need to keep them at school, what they need to basically realise their ambitions of finishing year 12 and going on thereafter, and quite often it is a little amount of assistance that is needed to either buy the books or give them the capacity to stay at school. If they do not get that assistance, they are forced into taking unemployment benefits or they are forced into leaving school and seeking work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a vicious circle that they find themselves in. Quite often, I have gone through situations with young people and tried to work out with them their income and how we can top up that income. What the previous government did was to introduce a schooling incidentals allowance. It is an allowance which is paid to homeless secondary students, an allowance which cost some $11 million over four forward estimate years, which is what we are arguing about here, and a measure which is assisting some 8,500 students&mdash;students living basically on the breadline. What the government is seeking to do is to take away this financial assistance of some $300, payable at the beginning of each year, to help homeless Austudy and Abstudy students complete their secondary education by assisting with such expenses as books, equipment and course costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure was going to have full effect from the beginning of this year. It is obviously justified as a measure that helps young people at critical times. It is much more important to them than it is to the budget revenue outlays. It is much more important <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7271"> for individual students. I just cannot understand the logic behind taking this particular measure away from young people, who find it quite critical. The government says that it will be abolished subsequent to a review of 1995-96 budget measures. But there really has not been a comprehensive review about this. Once again, the minister for double speak is coming in here and saying, `Well, we have reviewed it and it should go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, we are talking about depriving people of assistance&mdash;people who critically need it. We are also talking about a self-defeating measure. You force kids out of school, they have to go on unemployment benefits, they have to seek work and at the end of the day it costs government more by withdrawing this sort of measure. This is the same group that will be hit by another exceptionally mean budget measure&mdash;that is, the cessation of case management of secondary students who are on the student homeless rate of Austudy or Abstudy. That measures saves $14&half; million. The government says, `Oh no, we are going to maintain or re-establish the job placement employment training program. That will cost us $11 million.' You are still talking about a big reduction of funds&mdash;some 25 per cent&mdash;as opposed to the previous measure that was in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just cannot work out how a minister for education can deprive young people&mdash;people on the borderline&mdash;of assistance in this particular instance. Case management of young students is basically geared towards achieving family reconciliation, assistance to them and working out their particular needs. That measure has gone. With it has gone the supplementary measure, which is quite critical. We are talking here of $11 million over the forward estimate years. As I said, it means nothing in terms of the budget bottom line but it means a hell of a lot to young people who are forced to make hard decisions based on, quite often, less than $100 that they need to keep them at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition is keen to ensure that these two sets of regulations go down this morning. We cannot see any justification for them. We see them as particularly mean-spirited. We also see them as having no justification in a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy sense. No matter what the minister says about them, no matter how the government tries to argue that they are ripping money away from well-off families, that is just not the truth, and they should not continue with that particular line.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motions put forward by the opposition today. On many occasions we have expressed our concerns and our opposition to the increase in the independent rate age&mdash;that is, from 22 years to 25 years. Senator Bolkus is quite right&mdash;the matter of the age at which students are eligible for the Austudy independent rate has been one of the top priorities for student organisations for many years. Indeed, I remember lobbying Senator Bolkus on this very issue quite a few years ago as a student. The ALP certainly took its time to reduce the age of eligibility. It had actually reached a point where it was 22 years. We supported that, although we continue to have concerns about the lack of parity between the Austudy benefits level and that of unemployment benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also oppose what Senator Bolkus has described as a mean-spirited measure, but certainly one that we consider quite callous&mdash;that is, the proposal by this government to remove the schooling incidentals allowance. It was only introduced this year, providing $300 to secondary school students receiving the homeless independent rate of Austudy. Senator Bolkus pointed out that this was a measure designed to assist students in that category, with the purchase of books and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find the removal of such money particularly repugnant in light of recent findings and the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">School students at risk&mdash;</EMPHASIS>one that people in this place may be aware of&mdash;that was released this week. This report challenges the common perception that homeless youth are somehow all street kids, saying that homeless school students often move between various forms of temporary accommodation. This report called on schools and governments to become more caring institutions. Certainly that caring element is not reflected in the measures before us proposed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7272"> by this government. The report also found that up to 14 per cent of high school students are at risk in this nation and the greatest proportion of those students who were at risk were in years 10 to 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of a one-off grant&mdash;$300&mdash;for books, paper and all the other requirements that a student needs at the beginning of the school year, we consider quite miserly and mean-spirited. It is certainly not the act of a caring institution. In light of the radical and unfair changes to the higher education sector&mdash;the changes that passed this place within the past week&mdash;we must remember that student financial assistance, be it in the form of Austudy, Abstudy or TEAS, its predecessor, has proven that it has been shown to be a key factor in ensuring that traditionally disadvantaged groups, particularly young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, have had a shot at education, at a TAFE level, at secondary school and at a tertiary level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about here is something quite fundamental to ensuring a degree of access and equity in our higher education and secondary school systems. We are talking about removing one of the very props that assist those students to enter education at a number of levels. We consider the removal of the schooling incidentals allowance, combined with the increase in the independent rate age, to be two promises not only that the coalition has broken but ones that will have a devastating impact on current students as well as aspiring students. It is worth remembering that the coalition government went to the last election promising that they would maintain Austudy. They certainly made a lot of promises in the education sector, which have since been broken. I plead with the government that this is one area in which you should certainly not be breaking those promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Bolkus outlined, the current age for the Austudy independent rate is 22. That in itself we consider an anomaly. We know that young adults pay the same kind of living expenses as other adults, whether they are 18 or 25. At 18, 21 or 25 you incur the same living costs as an adult. I think that that is perhaps a wider debate that we should have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at some point in this chamber&mdash;at what age are young people classified as independent and adult in this community, because it is quite an anomaly that you have to be 25&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or 31 in this place, as Senator Brown suggests. We are not talking about a luxurious benefit. We should never forget that Austudy&mdash;and I am sure the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) will remind us of this&mdash;was designed as an income supplement, but we have moved away from that even. Let us not forget that the majority of students who obtain Austudy are living on 38 per cent of the poverty line and the independent rate is around 68 per cent of the poverty line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that when TEAS&mdash;the forerunner to Austudy&mdash;was introduced back in the 1970s it was at 117 per cent of unemployment benefits. These days even the maximum Austudy allowance at the independent rate is well below the single rate of unemployment benefit, and we do know that most students receive far less than this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The millionaire Wright family was splashed across the headlines of papers many months ago. We have all debated long and hard the mythical Wright family and we threw in a couple of kids and a Range Rover. But that sinister example put to the estimates committee perpetuated some kind of stereotype that Austudy was both easy to access and plentiful in its benefit&mdash;neither is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research this week demonstrates this quite markedly. Academics from Monash University who are well known for their work on Austudy&mdash;and I refer to Ian Dobson and Bob Birrell&mdash;show us the impact of the proposed changes&mdash;that is, the increase in the age rate from 22 to 25. Dobson and Birrell in their document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and place</EMPHASIS>, Vol. 4, No. 1, page 81, show us that 60,000 current higher education students will be affected in some way by this change. This is a lot of young Australians. They will receive lower benefits or they will become ineligible for Austudy. The impact will worsen as the age of independence changes&mdash;it will become further entrenched. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7273">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I ask the minister&mdash;this is a question I have asked before and in estimate committee hearings&mdash;is it still the case that the eligibility for the independent rate will be assessed at the point of enrolment? That is, you could be 24 years and nine months old&mdash;that is, below the age of 25&mdash;enrolled in a course, do that course for two, three, four, five or even six years, and you could be a 30&hyphen;year&hyphen;old and still not be deemed eligible for the independent rate. I have had no satisfactory answer to that question. I again ask the minister to explain if it is the case that students' eligibility will no longer be assessed on their birth date, but at their point of enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In October 1996, 50,305 students were in the 22&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year age group. While they have apparently been protected by the grandfathering of these changes to the age of independence, we can reasonably expect that a similar number of students will be dealt a harsh blow by the passage of these regulations in the near future. We can also assume that a substantial proportion of the 16,269 students over 25 years of age in 1996 and who started their course prior to turning 25 would be deemed still dependent on their parents' income under the proposed new rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dobson and Birrell predict that 17 per cent of those currently in receipt of Austudy&mdash;nearly one&hyphen;fifth&mdash;would become ineligible and over 50 per cent would have their benefits reduced. We are talking about thousands and thousands of young Australians, both students and aspiring students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Already it is not easy to be eligible for the independent rate. To be eligible for the independent rate, one requirement is that you have to have worked 35 hours per week for three years out of the last four years. This discriminates against those who maintain their independence through part-time or casual work&mdash;something I would have thought this government would have promoted for young Australians; certainly, that is the impression I get from the Minister for Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as Senator Bolkus pointed out, with massive changes to the labour market and high levels of youth unemployment, it is crazy that we should be making these changes. These changes, coupled with those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> radical and regressive changes to the higher education system last week, will further put education at every level out of the hands of those disadvantaged in our community. It is now time to stop using young Australians as a means of plugging this government's black hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the minister to respond to that question about eligibility being at the point of enrolment. I hope that other senators in this place will support the disallowance motion before us today and give those young Australians aspiring to be educated through our system some hope for the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur with the previous speakers, and the Australian Greens will support the disallowance motion moved by Senator Bolkus. I think the reasons have been already well canvassed. Listening to Senator Stott Despoja I am reminded that it was not until the 1930s that the world shook off the idea that women should not have the vote until they were 32 years old. It was okay for men at 21 years of age, but not for women until 32 years of age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) is trying to reinstitute the philosophy of the early part of this century that people are not independent minded until they get to the age of 31 or 32. She is at least taking the sexism out of it. She is going to ensure that men are also recognised as being unable to think for themselves, act for themselves and be independent until they get to the age of 31 or 32; they are still tied to the parents' strings at home and should not be getting any recognition for independent means or assistance to be independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst Senator Vanstone may not have got it quite right, at least she is evening up the discriminatory idea that people over 25 who have got into their course before they turn 25&mdash;even if it is a six-year course&mdash;are tied to their parents and should not be recognised as independent and, therefore, should have their Austudy allowance cut out. It seems pretty mean and silly, and it is going to hurt a lot of people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7274">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I wanted to talk a little more about the abolition of the schooling incidentals allowance, which is $300 to be given for books and incidentals to assist those kids who, through no fault of their own, are down on their luck in our community but want to make a go of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is supposed to be about assisting those who will help themselves. It parades at the top of the masthead the idea that enterprise should be given every assistance. But here we have those Australians who are having a tough time. They are very often on the emotional roller-coaster of their teen years. They have often lost contact with or the support of parents and frequently have come from abusive households. They are out on the streets or they are certainly away from the supportive family background that gives people the full right to opportunity. Here is $300 to help them get a go at secondary schooling. What is the minister and this government going to do? It is going to cut that $300 away from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what else the government is doing, because it says this is part of making up for the so-called $10 billion black hole. These kids cannot come and have a business lunch or dinner with Senator Vanstone. They are not going to very readily be able to find their way into the precincts of this building to twig the ear of the government when it is making budgetary considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government&mdash;at the same time it was considering cutting this paltry $2.8 million per annum spending in the interests of that $10 billion black hole that Senator Vanstone speaks about so much&mdash;was also considering cutting $800 million a year out of tax rebates to the major mining companies like BHP, MIM and CRA. That is the diesel fuel rebate. The miners did have access to this place. They were able to twig the ear of a compliant government. They got their $800 million a year restored. For what? Basically to go across and enhance their profit line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at BHP alone, there are six executives there earning over $1 million per annum, and there is one who is very close to earning $3 million per annum, assisted through the government's diesel fuel rebate. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That $3 million per annum for one person, influential on the government, is equivalent to the $2.8 million that the government is cutting from some 8,000 struggling kids in Australia. It is when you take this equation that you see how out of kilter and how divisive this government's priorities are. Take $3 million from 8,000 homeless and struggling kids and hand it across to one BHP executive. That is where the equation ends up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This can only be described as callous, unethical, immoral and abusive of the whole idea that this country of ours is about having a fair go. I think there is no other component of the budget that underscores how the government's priorities are about money and adding to the privilege of those who already have it at the expense of those who do not have influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just such a remarkably callous attack on the unfortunate in this country and such a patent hand across to those who have power, influence and money and, therefore, an open door to this government. It is an abhorrent little piece of penny&hyphen;pinching from the poor. The government should be ashamed of it. I cannot understand how the government and the minister have the hide to stand up and defend this while, at the same time, they are handing $800 million across on a platter to their friends in the mining corporations to help line their pockets or, as Senator Margetts would have it, the bottom line, which is the profit line that those companies will be posting on the stock exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know it is going to fall on deaf ears. At the moment there is only one government member in a seat opposite and one in the chair, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson. They simply are not listening to this debate. The mind is made up; the heart is closed; the deed is done. I just hope that we do muster the numbers in the Senate today to stand up for those people who cannot stand up for themselves and give them a bit of a fair go.</PARA></SPEECH>

We all understand that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7275"> the government seeks from time to time to raise money. But to raise money in this particular manner suggests to me we are dealing with a government that is heartless, callous and determined to reduce the level of equity in access to higher education than we have come to expect in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austudy beneficiaries total some 481,000 people in this country at the moment. According to the annual report at page 155, that is the figure. However, I noticed that the figures actually increase slightly in terms of the numbers the department has advised me of this morning. For secondary Austudy, there are 211,000 beneficiaries. For tertiary Austudy, there are 297,000 beneficiaries receiving assistance. These are not all wealthy people by any stretch of the imagination. Do you recall the infamous Wright family matter? It arose out of the desire of this government to secure savings in this particular area&mdash;a total savings in excess of $500 million over the next four years. About $500 million is being proposed to be gathered from this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department invented the Wright family to try to convince the electorate so that it could justify these punitive measures. That was on the issue of the means test in particular. But this is the sort of context in which we are working. This government is seeking in its regulations to remove the schooling incidental allowance for students. This allowance is a one&hyphen;off payment of $300&mdash;the princely sum of $300. What is this money used for? It is payable to secondary students who are receiving the homeless independent rate of Austudy&mdash;that is, they are unable to live at home with their parents, they are orphans, refugees or state wards, or have parents who cannot exercise parenting responsibility. What is the allowance used for in particular? It is used for the purchase of books, equipment and other educational expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a measure which, in the end, will affect some 8,500 people; 8,500 homeless people who are receiving a schooling incidental allowance of $300 each. What sort of money are we talking about? We are talking about $2.75 million in the first full year of its operation. It is a miserable amount of money. It is designed to attract a very <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small part of the overall package of measures. On top of that, this is a measure which is designed to raise the age of independence for Austudy purposes to 25. That affects some 13,700 students. Some 6,720 females and 6,980 males are beneficiaries and receive higher benefits to qualify for assistance. About 12,000 people&mdash;nearly 6,000 females and 6,000 males&mdash;will also lose benefits. This device is aimed at attracting savings of $62 million in the first year. Measures totalling $138 million are proposed by this government. These regulations amount to only $2.75 million in the first year, and $62 million in terms of raising the age of independence in the first year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not suggesting for a moment that these measures in themselves are insignificant. The amounts of money might be insignificant for the state of the government as a whole. In the scheme of a budget which is seeking to take some $4.2 billion out of this portfolio, it might be insignificant. But, for the individuals, I think you can say it is very significant. I repeat that we are talking about $300 payable to secondary students receiving the homeless independent allowance&mdash;that is, they are unable to live at home with their parents, they are orphans, refugees or state wards, or have parents who cannot exercise proper parenting responsibilities. This $300 is used for school books, equipment and other educational expenses. In the scheme of things I do not think this government is going to be bankrupted. I do not think the budget is going to be blown apart if the Senate accepts these propositions. But, for the individuals, it means a considerable amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw attention to the annual report. The annual report indicates that the proportion of dependent beneficiaries on low incomes is some 96 per cent of dependent Austudy beneficiaries. Some 96 per cent of persons are on low incomes. The number of beneficiaries whose family incomes are in the lowest 40 per cent of all Australians are on special assessments. These are not necessarily wealthy people. The actual means test that this government is seeking to introduce does seek to address some issues in regard to people who are arranging their tax affairs in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7276"> such a manner as to reduce their taxable payments and, therefore, reduce the amount of money so that they are able to attract certain benefits. This is not one of those measures. This is for homeless people. It is for people who are refugees, orphans or state wards. This is a callous move by a callous government. I do not think that the Senate ought to support such a proposition. Therefore, I would ask the Senate to agree to the disallowance of these particular regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that is quite determined to reduce access to higher education. If you look at it in the context of the recent changes to HECS, the introduction of up&hyphen;front fees and, of course, the changes to ancillary fees, then the burdens that are being imposed on students are quite considerable. This government is seeking to raise $1.2 billion in revenue. I quote directly from attachment A of this government's regulations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In keeping with the targeted nature of student assistance and the community's expectation that families are primarily responsible to provide for their children's education, the level of AUSTUDY payments to most younger students is based on an assessment of their parents' ability to support to them.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a travesty of the notion that people have a right to expect support from their government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this measure, we are talking about people who are 25 years of age. We are not talking about little kids in terms of the proposals to raise the age of independence for Austudy. We are talking about citizens of this country with the full rights and expectations of citizens of this country. Amongst these expectations is the expectation they are entitled to have: that the government will provide assistance to them in the form of decent educational facilities so that they can be active participatory members of our community. In turn, they give back huge benefits to our society by their capacity to contribute fully when they are fully trained and skilled. I think it is wrong to suggest that persons who are 25 years of age have to be dependent on their parents. It is quite clearly a measure that the Labor government sought to address by reducing the age of independence.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, what have we got here? A proposition that seeks to impose measures to restrict the schooling incidental allowance benefit of $300&mdash;affecting 8,500 Austudy and Abstudy beneficiaries on the homeless rate who would have schooling incidental allowances paid&mdash;and measures that affect some 13,700 students who are beneficiaries and who will lose benefits as a result of this government's actions to raise the independence level for Austudy, and some 12,000 further students who are continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New students are expected to be totally ineligible under this measure by this government. The net result is, as I say, seen in the context of changes to HECS and the introduction of up-front fees. The introduction of ancillary fees are measures that can only be aimed at reducing equity and participation in higher education. This is a device that clearly cannot be sustained on equity grounds, Minister. I would ask senators to support these disallowance motions moved by the opposition.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown has mentioned a number of the issues in relation to the schooling incidental allowance. I just want to emphasise that it may mean the difference between attending or not attending school for a number of these students. It is mean spirited and it is not worthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the increase in the age of independence from 22 back up to 25, the government is cutting over $500 million from student income support by tightening the means test, increasing the age of independence to 25 and restricting access to migrants and permanent residents. Altogether, it is a fairly substantial package of cuts and burns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Austudy alone, there are cuts of $514 million over the next four years. This will affect one in five students eligible for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7277"> Austudy. One in five Austudy recipients will either have their Austudy taken away from them and be made ineligible, or have a cut in their payments. One hundred and twenty&hyphen;five thousand Austudy students will be worse off without any student income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens disagree with raising the age of independence back up to 25. It was 25, however, and it has been progressively falling to 22. We support 18 as an end goal in the definition of independence. We do not believe that anyone who is 22 or 25 and is independent should be deemed to be on their parents' income. The notion is ridiculous. It smacks of compulsory families&mdash;I think that has been the theme of the budget in general&mdash;and increases the financial burden of children on parents. This actually is a trigger point for family tension and conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not been honest in saying that 25 is the top end of the age of independence, because the definition is applied to age upon initial enrolment. This means the student could be anything from 28 to 31 by the time they finish their degree and will still be deemed to be on their parents' income even if they have moved out and are completely independent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now we come to the bogus bourgeois Wright family. It is a sad state of affairs when the government has to make up a whole lot of rubbish about rorting rich families just to cover up its massive Austudy cut to needy families. Make no mistake: these are cuts to low income earners&mdash;people with low incomes and assets beneath the threshold to qualify for Austudy for their secondary school and tertiary aged children. There are some very disadvantaged people within this group. Many are homeless, young, from broken homes and with histories of abuse. It is totally unfair and inappropriate to be attacking these people and slashing their incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Wright family fabrication has reinforced the fact that the government is making large&hyphen;scale policy changes in a great experiment without planning based on statistics or proper problem identification, and without heed to any of the negative impacts. The massive Austudy cuts are compounded because they are occurring in a context of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thousands of students living in housing related poverty because the government refuses to bring Austudy up to the amount of the dole and supplement it with a rent assistance component to assist students with their housing needs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having got that off my chest, I would like to simply say that there are certain principles which are offended by this particular measure. I will deal firstly with the question of raising the age of independence from 22 to 25. That assumes that the parents will be paying for the cost of the education of those persons from 22 to 25 years of age. The government assumes that, but the taxation department does not assume that. The taxation department assumes that the parents pay not one cent for those students&mdash;not one cent. That is a matter of considerable concern to me.</PARA>

Had the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Australian Labor Party voted for it&mdash;had that principle been applied&mdash;the burden on tertiary students and graduates who had become eligible for repayments would have been reduced by a third. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now you come into this chamber and virtually support the principle by saying that you propose to disallow the government's proposal, based on the assumption that the parents have to pick up the tab. But, as I have said, the taxation department does not make that assumption. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7278"> The government should have a look at this. It should realise that its tax threshold ceases to apply to people at the age of 18. I applaud the government for its actions on the family tax initiative, but the tax threshold for children still ceases at age 18. So it is even more important for the government to relook at this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that issue, it is very important for the government to look at the sibling concession, which was abolished by the previous government. It is a matter in which I have had a considerable interest for a considerable time. I am not going to bore senators by reading out the file relating to it, but I remind people around the place that I raised quite considerable concerns when the concession was abolished by the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the example of a family with three children in tertiary education who are receiving Austudy, and the parents' income is getting close to the stage where it would be affected. Under those circumstances, the concessional rate was 25c for every dollar earned by either of the parents, so the Austudy would have been reduced by 75c. That was the result of tightening the Austudy income test for families by removing the sibling concession, which was done in 1992. The effect was that, if you had three children on Austudy, you would have lost three times 25c&mdash;which equals 75c&mdash;in Austudy for every dollar earned by a parent, either by the primary earner or by the secondary earner in the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to former Senator Sowada, who vigorously opposed the government on that matter, as honourable senators would remember. I supported her very strongly as well. But, sadly, we were not able to disallow that regulation. The government should have a really good look at this at some stage. Frankly, until they do, I am not in a position&mdash;having applied that principle even to this budget measure&mdash;to support the government on this matter. Unless some very substantial information comes from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), I will be supporting the motion for disallowance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to hear from the minister on the matter of $300 for books, incidentals and educational materials for secondary school students who are `homeless'. I know that there is discrimination involved. I know a large number of families who are even more in need than some of the students who are getting this money. Those young people, the sons and daughters, are going to secondary school and are deprived of being able to get the books and educational materials that would be appropriate for them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That regulations 7.1, 7.2 and 7.4 of the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1996 No. 246 and made under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973</EMPHASIS> , be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>I apologise to the Senate for not moving this motion earlier today. I am moving it now because the government is anxious to have some degree of administrative certainty. The Democrats are happy to oblige. I am also aware that this disallowance motion does not have the support of the majority of the chamber, so I will speak very briefly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7279"> This motion relates to the independent at home rate. The measure was imposed by the former Labor government, was recently disallowed by the Senate, as people would recall, but is now in front of us in the form of coalition policy. The categorisation of a 22-, 23-, or 24-year-old living at home as some how not independent is yet another example of how both the ALP and the coalition have been prepared to jeopardise the future of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, the regulation takes $20 every week from the full independent rate if you live at home. This forces people in this situation to live on $216.70 a fortnight. While independent students qualify for rent assistance, obviously that component of the allowance is not necessarily applicable here; however, it was a mean and penny pinching measure designed to yet again ensure that Austudy would never necessarily be enough to live on. We consider the removal of the $20 as callous and quite hypocritical. I think both the parties stand condemned on this particular issue in the eyes of students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition were in opposition, as recently as last June, I believe it was Senator Tierney who in 1995 criticised the independent at home rate. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly refer to each of the points raised, starting with that raised by Senator Stott Despoja. I thank her for moving that motion today. It will allow some administrative certainty. I think she is correct in her assertion, reluctant as it is, that she does not have majority support for her proposition. What the senator is seeking to do there is disallow a portion of some regulations that were reintroduced. I will not go into the history of that; I am sure all senators understand how those regulations were inadvertently disallowed. It would be uncharitable of me to rehash those arguments today, so I will not. I just say thank you to Senator Stott Despoja.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I come to the schooling incidentals allowance.

That is the case. But there are other concerns with this. This was announced as a sort of pre-election bit of sweetening, if you like, by the previous Labor government, as I understand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just extra money. Senator Carr  interjects that they spend it on food. That is a case for changing the allowance as a whole, not for saying, `We are giving you an incidental book allowance and, by the way, we don't care whether you spend it on books.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us try to be a bit generous here on both sides. Perhaps I could seek your generosity so that I do not take up any more time than I need. You could let me have my 10 minutes, as others have graciously let each other have, to try and get through the agenda. So the government is concerned that this does not have to be spent on books. It is just extra money, and it is extra money that does not go to children who might be in equally impecunious circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that this government is spending a very substantial amount of money on the reintroduction of the JPET scheme, which is primarily targeted at young, homeless people&mdash;$11 million a year over two years. We can come into this place and look at one change and say, `You should not be doing that. Isn't it dreadful.' But if you do not consider it in the broader context of the other changes then, with respect, senators, I think you are being a little bit unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reintroduced the JPET scheme. A number of them are going already and we are spending $11 million a year for two years on that. That is of particular assistance to young, homeless people. We have expanded access to JPET to include refugees. This is not a mean-spirited government. If you take one issue that is being lost then, fair enough, you can say, `That is mean spirited.' But it is not issue by issue; a whole range of things are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7280"> being done here. It is $11 million to reintroduce JPET and expand access to it to include, for example, refugee kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, of course, we have the homeless youth pilot project, which is of particular interest to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). He got that going very soon after getting into government. We are spending $8 million over two years on that. Those two measures together represent a very substantial commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, I think you would have to agree&mdash;when you put the two together and add them up and look at this small savings measure, recognising that it does not need to be spent on books and recognising that other kids in equally impecunious circumstances do not get it&mdash;that this money is much better applied to something like JPET or the homeless youth pilot project, where it can really do some good and where we can guarantee that. That is the government's reasoning for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me shift to the issue of age of independence, on which I have heard a lot of discussion, some of it not as straightforward as I might have liked. After all, it was the previous government who for 18 years had 25 as the age from which the independent rate for Austudy would apply. This is the independent rate for Austudy, not the age at which the government says you are independent in every other respect. This provision was changed only recently, yet suddenly there has been this road to Damascus conversion, as if what the previous government did for so long is now completely unacceptable. I think that is unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure how old Melanie Howard is&mdash;she must be 20, 21 or 22. If you think the Prime Minister's daughter should get Austudy by virtue of her age, if you think Alan Bond's kids who are living at home should get Austudy simply because of their age, then fine&mdash;support this disallowance. If you want to say, `It does not matter how wealthy your parents are. It does not matter if you are living at home. We don't care if your parents are millionaires. We think that once you turn 22 you should be able to get it. We don't care if your father is the Prime Minister. We would like to tip a bit of Austudy into you,' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then you have a different perception of targeting of assistance than this government has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We used laugh at Labor when they were in government and say, `There you are with your rich mates.' But I never thought I would see the day that you would actually come in here and vote that the Prime Minister's daughter ought to be able to get Austudy. It is a misconception.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a couple of points to make. Caring and listening is what you assert to be, but there is nothing caring and listening about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these particular proposals. One thing about all programs, whether it is this one or any other, is if you look at the exception and the unintended consequences and base your policy on them, you will have no programs at all. If you look at the assistance that Senator Newman's husband might be getting, for instance, and pay to everyone else income support on the basis of that, you could deprive everyone across the country. What you have to do is look at the areas of need and, if there are unintended consequences like Melanie Howard getting benefit, it is very easy to fix that up. Just ring her father and say, `Listen, your daughter should not be on it.' See what answer you get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really need to look at those areas of need. As Senator Carr pointed out very succinctly earlier, if you look at the number of dependent Austudy beneficiaries on low incomes, you are talking about people who are basically in the lowest 40 per cent of all Australian family incomes as being those targeted by Austudy assistance. For instance, 96 per cent in 1995-96 was the proportion of dependent beneficiaries on low incomes. They are the sorts of people these programs are targeted at. This 96 per cent of the 275,000 or so are the ones that you will deprive of assistance, not the odd Bond daughter or Melanie Howard. You could easily target them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of targeting, let us also remember that Austudy starts to taper off at a joint family income of $22,650. It would be very hard for Melanie Howard, given her stated dependence, to avoid that particular provision. Mention was also made of the JPET scheme. The argument used by Senator Vanstone is a bit bogus. That scheme has been reintroduced, and it has taken the place of a scheme which cost a lot more money and which provided case management, individual student by individual student, to basically assist them and give them some career support. To argue that that is a subsidy I think is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the incidental allowance, I have listened to the debate this morning very closely. No-one has come up with an argument against the allowance. Senator Harradine has suggested that there are other people in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7283"> need who could also be assisted by a similar scheme but no-one has actually put forward any evidence to say that the allowance is not assisting students who are in a situation of need and crisis. So there is an argument for perhaps extending it but not an argument for doing away with this particular scheme as it now operates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1966 amends the tax and superannuation law in several areas, including measures relating to offshore banking units, gifts, expenses of complying superannuation funds, taxation of foreign source income, forgiveness of commercial debt and the use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes. The bill implements the coalition's election commitment to double the FBT minor benefits exemption to $100. The FBT reform will help reduce compliance costs of FBT for employers who provide minor benefits to employees and will ensure that employers who provide only irregular minor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7286"> benefits of less than $100 avoid paying FBT altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has moved a second reading amendment. The amendment, which the government will not be supporting, has no real relevance to the bill whatsoever. We will not, of course, be giving any support to it. Let me just make a few comments about the opposition's second reading amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has delivered on its election commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from Labor's eight per cent to six per cent. The superannuation contribution surcharge will make the superannuation system more equitable for all Australians while ensuring that superannuation remains an attractive option. I understand the Labor Party supports the concept of the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry made comments on debt forgiveness. I wish to make two brief comments on his remarks. Labor did announce this measure in the 1995 budget. Legislation was not introduced until November 1995, and the bill lapsed because of the election. The provisions were incomplete. We did not delay the measures. The measure was to commence on 9 May; however, the bill containing those measures lapsed. The change of government created a situation of uncertainty, given that full details of the new rules were not available. In response to these business concerns, we decided to make the rules apply prospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, Senator Margetts raised some issues in relation to the use of tax file numbers for superannuation purposes. I think Senator Margetts has a copy of the letter that we have received from the Privacy Commissioner on that issue. We have consulted widely with the Privacy Commissioner. The purposes for which the tax file numbers can be used are limited to locating, identifying, amalgamating and transferring superannuation accounts. Some of those issues may be explored further in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not surprise Senator Margetts that we will not be supporting her second reading amendment. It proposed that an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) would serve to ensure that the tax obligation of a company cannot be reduced to a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> level below 20 per cent of the company's net income. Under this rule companies would pay the greater of the tax calculated under the current law or an alternative minimum tax&mdash;the so-called AMT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central objection to an AMT is that it would impair equity and efficiency in the taxation of companies. For example, all deductions, including carry-forward losses, allowances, rebates and other concessions available to companies are deliberate policies, the product of tax laws considered and passed by parliament. If parliament were to leave those tax laws as they are but at an AMT, the availability of concessions would be determined arbitrarily. A company's tax assessment would not be determined by anything which could specifically entitle it to the concessions but by the operation of an arbitrary ratio. In short, an AMT would be an arbitrary and unpredictable limit on the availability of tax concessions.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your support, Senator Conroy. In addition, in relation to the drawbacks in terms of equity and efficiency, an AMT would have two unwelcome effects on companies generally. First, administrative and compliance costs would be increased as companies would be required to maintain two sets of accounts. Secondly, an AMT would create uncertainty about the company's future tax liabilities and cash flow. For those reasons and others, we will not be supporting the second reading amendment proposed by Senator Margetts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I have actually spoken about this amendment to a certain extent. Our amendment effectively changes the dividend imputation from 100 per cent to 50 per cent. This is worked out by a formula in section 160AQT. That relates to the assessable income related to franked dividends. A 50 per cent imputation is arrived at by halving the franked amount in the formula.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who get dividends get rebates of 36c in the dollar for every dollar they get in dividends. Any battler may own a few shares, just as they may have a lotto ticket. The main recipients of dividends are unequivocally in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the top 10 per cent of income earners. Halving the 160AQT assessable income formula has the effect of halving all the various dividend tax rebates. It halves the amount of money people can claim as  already having been paid as tax. It would cut additional benefits of dividends from 36c in the dollar to 18c in the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the Senate for allowing me to table table 1.6 of that report by Phillip Raskall. It does make clear the implications of dividend imputation and makes clear the kind of manipulation that is made possible for the rich as a result of this action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those making over $500,000 a year, dividend income increased by nearly 11 times in the year dividend imputation was introduced. It increased another five times in the next year to a level 54 times that pre&hyphen;imputation. While the total income in the over $500,000 bracket grew by 13 times, the average tax paid per person in this category dropped by 70 per cent. This is because the dividend income was effectively tax free. In the following year the company tax dropped, so they got it both ways. The tax free status of dividends ended and these people, who were very wealthy by any standards, suddenly shifted their income base and dividend income dropped back to around 12 times the pre-imputation levels while tax paid per person more than doubled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that dividend imputation results in a massive benefit for the wealthy. With this amendment, as with my earlier one, I seek to address this balance. One hundred per cent dividend imputation is not fair, just or equitable. It is entirely anti-progressive and has been used as a rort as much as any other legal means of tax minimisation. I would rather see this rort closed, since it is aimed at the top end of income earners. I would rather see this than some of the mean spirited cuts that have been made as a result of this budget because the government said they had no choice. Well, they do have a choice, and so do the opposition. In this sense we are giving that choice to the Senate. I urge the Senate to support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

That has been the subject of many budget submissions we have made to governments. Senator Margetts has highlighted how it is overly generous. I want to point out that it costs $2 billion a year and that it does deliver massive benefits to high income earners&mdash;67 per cent of imputation credits flow to high income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits have been extended to non-resident shareholders, so that adds a further $700 million to the cost. I agree with the political point which says: `Why do you make the choices in government via appropriations to cut so excessively when really you could make a much more courageous and fairer choice and look at tax design flaws?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most other OECD countries have opted for partial, rather than full, dividend imputation. The OECD itself has argued that the cost to revenue often exceeds the rise in private sector savings. We are being told by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that we want to do something about national savings. Here is a good place to start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Monash University's tax economist, Professor John Head&mdash;as I recall, a designer of this system&mdash;has now said that it is time to take a look at it. Other Australian researchers, including ACOSS's Professor Julian Disney and the University of New South Wales' welfare project, have all criticised full dividend imputation as a policy not meeting its original objectives, unless you wanted to design a policy which has as its objective a costly sop to the rich. That was not its objective. It is not meeting its objective and it is clearly time to review it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasurer Costello can start his attack on the so-called riddles and rorts in this country by looking honestly at the tax system and at the several major design flaws&mdash;dividend imputation is one of them and tax deductibility of interest is another. The point I want to make is that any review ought not be retrospective because a lot of people have developed their financial planning based on current rules and they do have to have the time to adjust accordingly. This applies <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> particularly to self-funded retirees who always write in volumes whenever you start talking about dividend imputation in any form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that these people rely heavily on this. It is very important to them. On their behalf, I say to Senator Margetts that it would not be fair to pass this amendment today. It would have a retrospective impact because it applies to all investments even when people have acted with knowledge of the current law and arranged their affairs accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support Senator Margetts' objective in moving this motion because I do think we need to point out to the government and to Australians that there are other choices. You do not have to cut dental programs for the poor when you have got a choice of doing something about dividend imputations which flow to the rich. Those are the sorts of choices I want to see this coalition government making&mdash;fair choices, choices where people can afford to pay. But because I do not believe that we should do things which have a retrospective impact, I cannot support this amendment today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor will not be supporting the amendment moved by the Greens to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. Currently, under existing tax law, companies can pass on the full benefit of having paid tax on company benefits by way of franking credits on dividend distributions to their shareholders. This was introduced by Labor to end what was, in effect, the double taxation of company dividends. The Greens amendment could see this effectively halved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One important point to make about such a move is that it would have a very significant effect on superannuation funds and, therefore, on superannuation fund beneficiaries. Many superannuation funds invest in companies that pay franked dividends in order to take advantage of the franking credits. According to the tax statistics of 1993-94, super funds receive $1.7 billion in gross dividends and claimed $548 million in franking credits to help offset the payment of the tax on superannuation fund earnings, which is entirely legitimate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7289">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this proposal, there would be a shift of hundreds of millions of dollars from the accounts of superannuation fund members into the government tax collection coffers. We believe that the more money people can save for their retirement, the better off they are. Unfortunately, this amendment would only undermine the savings of superannuation fund beneficiaries by shifting money from their accounts into Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the only reason why we oppose this amendment. I just highlight that as an undesirable consequence of Senator Margetts's amendment. The other reason, broadly, is that we do not believe it is appropriate to significantly write the tax acts in an unconsidered way in dealing with an omnibus taxation laws amendment bill, which is what this is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment moved by Senator Margetts would halve the imputation or the franking rebate available to resident individuals and superannuation funds for franked dividends. Senator Margetts would be aware, as would Senator Kernot, that the dividend imputation system removes the double taxation of company income that applied under the classical <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system of company taxation. Full imputation represents an equitable rather than a concessional treatment of dividend income by ensuring that in most cases company income distributed to resident shareholders bears the same total tax as other forms of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A substantial behavioural response to the introduction of partial imputation would be likely, which would erode some of the revenue gained from such a measure. Companies would obviously look for tax minimisation and tax shifting opportunities because of the reduction in franked dividends to shareholders compared with the situation under full imputation where they may well retain rather than distribute profits. The proposed amendments would reduce the franking rebate available to residents by not affecting non&hyphen;residents, who would continue to be exempt from dividend withholding tax on franked dividends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substance of the argument of Senator Margetts and Senator Kernot&mdash;and I notice that Senator Kernot is not supporting the amendment, but she clearly has some sympathy for the sorts of views that were put forward by Senator Margetts&mdash;seems to be based on the assumption that the dividend imputation only has impact on high income earners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) oppose Schedule 4. We simply oppose the bringing in of tax file numbers to superannuation at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this time. We have two major concerns on the issue, and they have not been addressed. The first is the slippery notion of `voluntary', used by the government. When you say, `You don't need to give the number but, if you don't, you'll be taxed at the highest marginal rate of 47 per cent,' this may fulfil guidelines, but it is hardly voluntary in the ordinary meaning of the term. In fact, it probably fits the legal definition of coercion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are particularly concerned that proposed section 299Q would assume that employees have agreed to provide a tax file number when their employer provides it. When we brought this up with government advisers, the response was that 299P allows the commissioner to set an approved manner for quoting tax file numbers, and that this would or could require employee permission. We have got no assurance that it will. There was some indication that there would be a form to fill in, but that is not part of this bill, obviously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also worried that the rhetoric of permission may be legally fulfilled by a note on a form saying that, in supplying an employer a tax file number `voluntarily', an employee is taken to have authorised the employer to pass that tax file number on to the superannuation fund. Legally, there may be an implication that the employee, having read this note, can decide to prevent the employer from passing on the number to a superannuation fund by refusing to supply it to the employer, and of course paying punitive tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have suggested a statement that there will be a separate line requiring a separate signature, without which the employer is not authorised to pass on a tax file number to a superannuation fund. We have just received a draft version of such a form specifically authorising an employer to pass on a tax file number to a superannuation company. I was going to seek leave to table it, but I guess the government is in a better position to table it than I am. Perhaps the government could table it. If I could get an assurance that such a form will be provided, this may go part way to addressing my concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7292"> The second issue is that access to tax file number data goes well beyond what is re quired. I understand that there are restrictions on using data for other purposes, but I cannot see why superannuation funds even need access to non&hyphen;relevant information included in the tax file number database. It would seem a reasonably simple matter to provide some sort of filter so that the Australian Taxation Office makes available only relevant information&mdash;that is, address, phone number and information about other superannuation fund moneys. No other information should really be necessary. No other information should really be accessible to the commercial sector. If we could get an assurance that measures would be put in place to prevent access by superannuation funds to other information, it would go some way to addressing our concerns, although we retain major reservations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue at stake is that tax file numbers are increasingly used to collect and integrate a broad range of information, including economic information about major purchases, bank accounts, wages, superannuation and so on. It includes information from social security. Since anyone receiving family payment of home child&hyphen;care allowance&mdash;which is a broad cross&hyphen;section of the population&mdash;receive it from Social Security, those with access to the tax file number database have access not only to existing commercial and economic information, but a range of personal information as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see why there is a greater pressure on various departments to have access to this number, but it was never said to be designed for this purpose. It certainly was not what Mr Keating said when he introduced it. He said that this would not be a de facto Australia card. Guess what? That is exactly what it is becoming.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. Senator Margetts, like us all, is concerned to ensure that there are proper privacy provisions in relation to tax file numbers. Senator Margetts raised a number of questions. I will respond to those. I think one of the questions was why tax file numbers are required. They are required for four reasons: firstly, to reduce the numbers of loss beneficiaries in the superannuation system; secondly, to reduce <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the numbers of small amounts in the superannuation system; thirdly, to facilitate the efficient administration of superannuation; and, fourthly, to assist in properly supervising the superannuation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been very keen, Senator Margetts, to consult with the Privacy Commissioner on this basis. The government does this because we have great concerns, like you do, about privacy issues which are raised. You would be aware that there was a letter that has been passed to you, signed by Mr Kevin O'Connor, to Mr Shawn Fracchia, regarding the use of the tax file numbers in this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Fracchia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT ACT (No.2) 1996&mdash;TAX FILE NUMBERS AND SUPERANNUATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to previous correspondence and discussions on this matter and to your recent request that I confirm in writing the views I have put to date on the proposals in the Bill for the greater use of tax file numbers in the administration of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In commenting on the proposals to date I have sought to ensure that they are consistent with the provisions of the Tax File Number Guidelines, which I am required to issue under the Privacy Act, and that the same protective framework will apply to the proposed uses of tax file numbers in the superannuation industry as applies to uses authorised by taxation and assistance agency law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular I have been concerned to ensure: that the principle of voluntary quotation of tax file numbers by individuals is maintained; that individuals are properly informed of a range of matters, including that quotation of their tax file number is not compulsory and the consequences of not quoting this number; that superannuation funds are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7293"> permitted to use tax file numbers only for the limited purposes set out in the Bill; and that superannuation funds will handle tax file numbers in a secure way that accords with the Tax File Number Guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am now reasonably satisfied with the way that the Bill, and its accompanying explanatory material, addresses these matters. The provisions specify, among other protections, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> individuals may be asked (by superannuation funds or their employers) but not required to provide their tax file numbers for superannuation purposes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> superannuation trustees may only use file numbers to locate, amalgamate, identify and transfer benefits for members;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> tax file numbers may only be used to identify amounts held for a particular person where other information is insufficient to identify the amounts; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the tax file number is not to be used as a general administrative number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have recently prepared and had tabled in parliament amendments to the Tax File Number Guidelines which ensure that the Guidelines will apply to any current or proposed uses of tax file numbers for purposes authorised by superannuation law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some minor uses of the Tax File Number in the superannuation area were previously covered by the definition of taxation law in the Guidelines. Given the scale of the uses now proposed I have recognised this by introducing a new definition of superannuation law. The revised Guidelines make it clear that Tax File Numbers are now authorised by law to be used in three areas of administration&mdash;the original area of taxation, the assistance agency area introduced in 1990, and now superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am continuing to consult with the Australian Taxation Office and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission about such matters as the content of the proposed circular setting out the responsibilities of superannuation trustees and the approved form for the manner of collection of tax file numbers by superannuation trustees and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask you to note that the comments in this letter should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the proposals in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me commence my contribution on the social security legislation by indicating that the Labor Party will be moving a second reading amendment to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill. This second reading amendment sets out our view on the activity test regime that is being proposed by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government has no commitment to assist the unemployed. The government will, with the passage of this legislation, make the lives of Australia's unemployed people harder, and it will make it harder for them to find a job. When they cannot find a job because there are no jobs to find, they will be subject to hoops and hurdles to get the income support they and their families need. In a decent society like ours, this is not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills seek to give effect to almost all of the social security measures&mdash;largely harsh ones&mdash;announced by the coalition government in the 1996 budget. If passed, they will see the safety net that was built and strengthened by Labor in government seriously compromised. They go a long way in turning our social security safety net into a social security tightrope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overwhelming majority of these arise not from good policy but rather from an ideological zeal on the part of the government to slash government spending. These measures are a long way from meeting the coalition's election promises. These bills are another demonstration of the coalition's betrayal of the Australian people. They have broken promises and revealed their true colours on so many issues of importance to Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They wooed voters with weasel words and rhetoric about delivering to families and about protecting the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. They said they were pro family, and they said they were about reducing unemployment. Yet they present us with legislation such as this which breaches many of their commitments, which assaults the poor, the needy and the most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7295"> vulnerable in our community and which undermines the wellbeing of families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's response to this legislation and, indeed, to all the measures announced in the 1996-97 budget is based on how the measures weigh up against three principles: does a measure betray a promise, is it equitable and does it contribute to national savings? When we looked at these bills in detail, we discovered that in a great many respects the proposed legislation falls sadly short of meeting these three principles. It does betray many promises; it is inequitable; and some of the measures proposed will certainly not contribute to national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of a massive $1.5 billion over four years from the social security safety net alone underlies the betrayal of the government. This has to be the most cynical broken promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because it was a promise that meant so much to the community and so many people believed it. I have to say that we in the Labor Party will not stand by and allow Australians to be betrayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation does not reflect a commitment to protect the poor, needy or most vulnerable in our community. In fact, it is an attack on them. Many of the measures contained in the proposed legislation will actually worsen the plight of unemployed people and other social security recipients. Rather than address the issue of unemployment, the government has chosen to implement measures that will slash the range of benefits to unemployed people and to income support recipients more broadly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we said in our minority report, the proposed  legislation is based on the premise that unemployed people are seeking to rort the system. The reality is that the majority of unemployed people are honest and genuine job seekers. The excessive and unworkable measures to tighten the activity test and expand the breach provisions, coupled with the abolition or tightening of a number of schemes that actually assisted job seekers, makes this bill very anti-unemployed. Labor believes the government's efforts should be devoted to reducing unemployment rather than to cutting people off payments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are determined to amend sections of the bill to reflect a commitment to equity and to attempt to keep John Howard and his government to their commitment to protect the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. Labor cannot and will not stand by and allow the most vulnerable in our community to pay the price for the coalition's ideological obsessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I do not propose now to deal with all of the measures contained in these bills in detail, I do want to refer to some of the more significant measures. Schedule 3 of the budget and other measures bill seeks to abolish the minimum rate of payment to under&hyphen;18-year-old sickness allowance, newstart allowance and youth training allowance recipients. The Labor Party will be opposing the measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. The government is proposing to introduce a youth allowance from January 1998, merging all major forms of income support for young people. It will be means tested on parents' income and will cover young people aged 16 to 20 years old and students up to 25 years old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is consulting on this new youth allowance, and rightly so. The proposal has far&hyphen;reaching implications for our young people and on their incentives to train and look for work. Rather than prematurely legislate to bring social security payments to young people in line with Austudy arrangements, we believe that these changes should be considered in the context of the community consultation process. Abolishing the minimum rate of youth training allowance and cutting under&hyphen;18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds off payments on the basis of parents' income opens the door to doing the same for young people up to 25 years of age. It would be premature in the extreme to pursue this measure in the absence of the results from the consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 5 of the bill seeks to tighten the activity test administration and simplify the penalty periods that apply to newstart allowance and youth training allowance. Schedule 6 seeks to tighten the provisions relating to unemployment due to industrial action. The opposition has serious concerns about the measures contained in this schedule, and we <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7296"> have prepared amendments to attempt to address these concerns. I would like to make it clear that, while we support tough measures in regard to fraud and compliance, we do not believe that people should be cut off from payments without good reason, or for inordinate periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the proposed new activity test regime is one that is excessively harsh and unreasonable, particularly in the absence of positive measures by the government to assist the unemployed to return to the work force. We believe that elements of the proposal are unworkable and unfairly penalise honest and genuine job seekers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 1 tightens up the use of employer contact certificates. We believe that it is unreasonable to require completed employer contact certificates to be provided with an initial claim for unemployment payments. Our amendments ensure that the employer contact certificates can continue to be utilised, but not until the person is actually receiving a payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 2 introduces a new and extreme definition of unsuitable work. The new definition puts the onus on job seekers to negotiate and overcome issues that may make a job unsuitable. It is unreasonable to compel job seekers to undertake any work offered where there is no training provided or where they lack the qualification, skills or experience necessary. The requirement to provide proof of an attempt to rectify a situation with the employer where the work conditions constitute a risk to health or safety, self-employment or a move away from home and communities to look for a job which may not exist places unreasonable obligations on job seekers to negotiate with prospective employers despite their not having the knowledge, skills, confidence or capacity to do so. We will be seeking to omit large parts of that schedule. We do concur with the government that it is unreasonable to compel a person to enlist in the reserve forces as part of taking up a job offer, and we support them on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 3 of schedule 5 extends the penalties for breaches of the activity test to six weeks for the first breach and 13 weeks for the second and subsequent breaches. The activity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> test regime that we introduced while in government is a tough one, but it was developed under an arrangement of reciprocal obligation where the community undertook to pay income support for those actively seeking work, and to provide the labour market assistance and the employment services that unemployed people need to get back into the work force. In turn, unemployed people were obliged to meet the conditions of the activity test. Penalties were tightened further under the Working Nation job compact, where people were given greater access and variety in training and guaranteed at least some work experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has abandoned the concept of a job compact and reciprocal obligation. In these circumstances, we believe the proposed penalty regime is too harsh. We will therefore be moving amendments to limit breach penalties to the equivalent of just over four weeks non-payment for a first breach and just over six weeks non-payment for a second or any subsequent breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been convinced by the case that has been put to us by community and welfare groups to impose penalties in the form of rate reduction rather than non-payment, and our amendments reflect that. We will be moving amendments which ensure that all penalties for activity test breaches or administrative breaches are served by way of a reduction in the rate of payment rather than a non-payment period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We propose that payments be reduced by 16 per cent, slightly higher than the current withholding rate of 14 per cent. Under this regime, people's payments would be reduced for 26 weeks for a first breach&mdash;a long reminder, I might say&mdash;and for 39 weeks for a second or any subsequent breach. Under this regime, the capacity for significant savings remains without causing undue hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 3 also introduces a period of rate reduction instead of non-payment periods for administrative breaches. We support this measure in principle but are of the view that the 25 per cent reduction is too harsh. Again, we propose a regime of a 16 per cent reduction for 13 weeks, rather than a 25 per cent reduction for eight weeks. The same principle <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7297"> applies to those current administrative breaches designed to become activity test breaches under part 4 of schedule 5.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part 5 extends the non-payment period for moving to an area of lower employment prospects from 12 to 26 weeks. We believe that this measure is extremely harsh and unfair, taking little account of the range of reasons an unemployed person may seek to move home. We seek to omit this part from the schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the measures contained in schedule 6 to tighten industrial action provisions to ensure that, where a person is unemployed as a result of industrial action, the person will not be eligible for a payment for six weeks after the industrial action has ceased are also unreasonable and ideologically driven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns are detailed more fully in the minority committee report but, overall, we believe that the proposal does not sufficiently take into account the new industrial relations regime created by this government through its workplace relations legislation. The proposal is unreasonable, unworkable, untenable and unduly harsh. As a result, we will be moving to omit the schedule from the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the beginning of my remarks that this bill breaks election promises&mdash;promises which over the course of time have become non-core and disposable promises. It is a blatant breach of election commitments such as the commitment not to abolish the earnings credit scheme. The coalition said that the earnings credit scheme will be retained by a coalition government&mdash;black and white. This bill represents a complete breach of that&mdash;a direct broken promise, a real betrayal of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same with employment and education entry payments. The coalition said, `The coalition will maintain the current employment and education entry payments.' That is not true&mdash;a direct broken promise, a betrayal. That is something that Labor will not allow to happen. On entering employment most social security recipients encounter considerable costs associated with the purchase of clothes suitable for work force participation and payment of child care and transport costs. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> These are particularly high costs for disability pensioners and those who may have to purchase additional supports or require attendant care. It is also true for people entering education. The employment and education entry payments introduced by Labor were a recognition of those costs and gave assistance in meeting them to further remove barriers to employment and education for social security recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to touch very briefly on schedule 13, which tightens the eligibility for disability support pension by inserting new impairment tables. We are concerned that some 34,000 people are expected to lose eligibility for disability support pension as a consequence of being reviewed under the new impairment tables and that a further 5,000 people a year on average are expected not to qualify for disability support pension under the new tables. Alternative income support payments such as Newstart allowance may not be available in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will be moving amendments to schedule 13 to restore the impairment ratings for minor disabilities not considered under the new impairment tables to contribute to a person's continuing inability to work. We will also be moving an amendment to insert a provision which allows the department to take account of non-medical factors like illiteracy in determining a person's eligibility for disability support pension if the person has an impairment rating of 15 but not the otherwise required 20 under the impairment tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 14 limits the payment of child disability  allowance arrears to three months before a claim is made. We will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. Again, the measure fails to recognise the hardship which can be suffered by the parents of children with disabilities which take over three months to diagnose or where it takes more than three months to establish a pattern of extra care and attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7298"> Schedule 20 relates to the application of the below threshold deeming rate. We will be opposing this measure by seeking to omit the schedule from the bill. Labor supports measures which encourage social security recipi ents to maximise the return on their resources but this measure relies on pensioners and allowees being able to access safe accounts which pay interest at the deemed rate. In the current climate where interest rates have been officially cut and where the minister must again consider whether or not to cut deeming rates, the concession on the first $2,000 for a single pensioner or $4,000 for a couple is especially critical to pensioners and allowees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other measures in both the bills that are before us and we will be needing to deal with all of them in tedious detail through the committee stage. But as I said earlier, I will be moving a second reading amendment to this bill, which has been circulated in the chamber. The amendment reflects the remarks that I have made in relation to the government's proposals to tighten the activity test. Labor believes it is very important to have a tight activity test regime for unemployment payments to ensure compliance and to maintain the integrity of and Australian support for our social security system. We have always believed that, and I think our actions in government confirmed that belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we believe that such a regime can only be equitable if it is part of a reciprocal obligation between government and unemployed people. It is the government's obligation to provide labour market assistance and other employment services for unemployed people, that level of assistance that they need to re-enter the work force. We were the ones when in government who tightened the old work test to increase compliance and developed it to the current activity test regime. We implemented the reciprocal obligation where `an unemployed person is required to actively look for work and in return society accepts an obligation to pay income support'. That was accompanied by the reciprocal obligation on society to provide training and retraining programs for those who are expected to meet the conditions of an activity test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took that approach in the 1990s and further toughened up the penalties following the One Nation statement. That tightening was combined with a job compact where we gave more to unemployed people by offering them <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a six-month subsidised job. The government has reneged on its part of the bargain with this legislation and the activity test regime in this legislation is unconscionable in the context of the government's failure to meet its obligations to unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The social security bills before us today implement policy changes announced in the August budget relating to the social security portfolio. As such they give us a clear indication of the attitude that those in the National-Liberal government have towards social security recipients, in particular, towards the unemployed. Unfortunately, that attitude does not seem to be one of compassion, support and encouragement but more one of enforcement, suspicion and oppression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes without saying that this year's budget was a particularly tough one for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7299"> unemployed people. The estimate from the Australian Council of Social Services was that over 30 per cent of the budget cuts over the next two years will come from low income and unemployed Australians. The cumulative impact of the budget changes which will affect unemployed people will I believe be a downward spiral into poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People will have to use their savings before qualifying for an unemployment payment. The conditions on receiving a payment will be substantially tightened. The penalties for breaching one of those conditions will be increased. And all this is set against a background of $1.8 billion over the next four years being cut from Labor market programs; programs designed to help the unemployed return to the work force. In other words, as a direct result of government policy, it is going to be harder to get an unemployment allowance, harder to stay on that allowance and harder to get off the allowance and back into full-time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Michael Raper from the Welfare Rights Centre recently said, `There seems to have been a shift in emphasis from seeing unemployment as the main issue to making the issue the unemployed.' ACOSS president, Robert Fitzgerald, has been reported as saying that in Australia the welfare needs of middle income earners are being put above those of the unemployed. He believes that we are adopting a system that divides middle income earners and the unemployed as the deserving verses the undeserving poor; those in true need and those not quite in need; those that we should support wholeheartedly and those we should be suspicious of. This is a dichotomy which the Democrats reject completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Unfortunately, this current government seems happy to allow suspicion of the unemployed to remain in the community, and I suspect the reason for that is that it minimises the political cost of making massive cuts to the social security portfolio, which is exactly what the August budget has done. Not once since the election can I recall having heard a government minister speak with any compassion about the plight of the long-term unemployed, the difficulties faced by older unem ployed people or the desperate situation of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead, what we have heard are numerous statements on how widespread welfare fraud is and the need to crack down on that alleged fraud. These statements have not been backed up with any factual evidence but instead play upon the worst misconceptions that some in our community hold in relation to our welfare system. The evidence that is available would seem to completely contradict the impression that some in government ranks and the media have been trying to put across. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an overview of the last few years in this regard. In 1993 a visiting fellow to the ANU, Dr Richard Weatherly, undertook a study looking at the compliance policies of the Department of Social Security. Dr Weatherly found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no basis for the commonly held belief that fraud is rampant within the system. Compared to other domains, public and private, the incidence of Social Security fraud is modest. An analysis of overpayments identified by DSS contravenes public impressions of widespread cheating.</PARA>
<PARA>To my knowledge, Dr Weatherly's findings have not been criticised or challenged, yet they quite clearly contradict the line that this government has been pushing on welfare fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently released departmental figures showed that, of over $380 million of overpayments made by the department, convictions for deliberate fraud involved just $4.7 million&mdash;about 1&half; per cent. Yet the government continues to focus its attack on alleged social security fraud while saying very little about tax fraud or doctors defrauding the Medicare system; activities which cost the public purse far more than social security fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1993 an Auditor-General's report conservatively estimated that Medifraud and doctors' overservicing of patients account for about seven per cent of the Medicare budget&mdash;in other words, over $320 million per year. In contrast, overpayments made by the Department of Social Security in the same period amounted to $130 million, with only a small proportion of that figure being due to deliberate fraud by social security clients.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7300">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 1994 article by community lawyer Jude McCulloch noted that despite these figures the policing of social security recipients is far stronger than that for doctors. McCulloch made a number of observations. Firstly, the system of paying Medicare claims to doctors remains essentially an honour based self&hyphen;assessment scheme, while Social Security utilises stringent personal identification requirements, data matching between government departments, regular customer reviews and other compliance measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, while DSS seeks prosecutions through the courts for all those committing welfare fraud, doctors are more likely to be required to undertake counselling and conciliation by a group of their peers. In 1991-92 DSS undertook more than 2&half; million reviews and prosecuted more than 2,000 people. In that same year, despite the enormous amount lost through Medicare overservicing, just four doctors were prosecuted. Finally, while little public attention has been devoted to fraud by doctors the concerns about social security fraud have in McCulloch's words `taken on the dimensions of a moral panic.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program noted, even the terminology used when discussing these issues is different. Social security recipients are `rorters' and `cheats' while doctors have merely been `practising inappropriately'. Regrettably, what we are seeing is a hardening of the community's attitude to social security recipients and an encouragement of the suspicion of the unemployed about which Robert Fitzgerald spoke. Genuine social security recipients are being made to feel that they are a drain on the community, and there is little acknowledgment that many of them are out of work due to circumstances over which they have no control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this climate that the government has introduced the bills we are looking at today. They are bills that will give the department the power to force the unemployed to move to another town or lose their payment; prevent around 2,500 widows each year from receiving the widows pension; impose grossly unfair penalties on unemployed people who fall foul of the rules; force disabled people on to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment queues; force people to use up their savings before being able to receive a range of social security payments; and force older unemployed people to eat into their superannuation. The list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are disappointed to see this legislation  brought on. We totally reject the philosophy which underlies it. It is a philosophy that says it is everyone for themselves and, if you are unemployed, you deserve to do it tough. It is a philosophy that says that unemployment is the fault of the individual, that there are jobs and that unemployed people simply need to be pushed harder to look. It also says that people should be reduced to poverty before the government has any obligation to support them. The Democrats will not be supporting the tougher aspect of these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish with an analogy. One thing that this government has done in order to support its attack on the poor is to employ scapegoats. I will tell the Senate where the word `scapegoat' comes from. It comes out of the ancient Hebrew sacrificial system. The scapegoat was a real goat. The goat was paraded in front of the assembled nation and before the people. It was then identified by the high priest laying his hands on its head. The confession of every sin of all the people was then transferred to the goat so that the people were thereby absolved of their sin. The goat was then taken into the desert and released. The fate of the goat was of no further concern to the people. The idea was that it should never return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7301"> It is easy to see how that idea was adopted and adapted to become part of the English language and culture. Other cultures have similar concepts. In our culture, a scapegoat is one who is identified in the mind of the community as a focus for all that is wrong in society. That person is vilified as one to whom blame for all the community's ills should be attributed. The community is thereby absolved of responsibility and guilt. The scapegoat is in a position of weakness and, therefore, has no power to resist. It is driven out to the edges of society, where what happens to it is of no further concern to the community. All sense of guilt for the scape goat as a victim is transferred from the community to the scapegoat as the burden bearer for the community's sins. This government has clearly identified the poor as the scapegoat that it will drive to the outer edges of this nation.</PARA></SPEECH>

I am standing here because the same government that is giving $6 billion over four years to the big corporate wealth sector of town is pinching $1.7 billion out of the pockets of the needy in this country. They used to sit on the opposite side here, you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, and say that the Keating government was increasing the gap between rich and poor, and so it was, because it was set down this economic rationalist pathway. The parameters showed that, and the then opposition&mdash;the coalition&mdash;were able to bring out the figures. Having complained about that direction being taken, what do they do when they get into government? They tread on the accelerator. They move to turboprop and they will be moving to jet thrust in the future where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the social cohesion that we have taken for granted in this country gets swept away as we move to an American style social set&hyphen;up where there will be people begging on the streets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might ask: how come? Under this legislation, people who infringe in the gaining <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of social security either through the activities test or the administrations test, can find themselves, instead of being off the social income for two weeks, off it for up to six months. It is a summary penalty. People will be penalised by the loss of up to $4,000 in social security because they have infringed&mdash;$4,160 is the six&hyphen;month penalty. That is greater than fines common for assault in the courts of $200 to $500. They will have no income and they will be left to turn to neighbours, to friends and, the minister has said, to the Salvation Army. She is going to give more money to the Salvos and to other charitable groups to help with handouts to the new destitute that this government will create. The reality is that that is not going to cover the lot of them. There are going to be many of these people panhandling on the streets of Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart and the other large cities around this country, because they have to have some money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Panhandling in the United States, where there are 35 million people living in poverty because of similar social attitudes to the one inherent in this legislation, is the better side of it. The worst side of it is the huge numbers of people breaking through windows, getting in back doors, invading other people's cars and stealing things, and creating a black market so that they can live. In New York, 25 per cent of the economy these days is black market, due to gangsterism and corruption, but also due to the fact that there are millions of people who just do not have enough money to make ends meet in increasingly expensive life circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to the beginning analogy between the government handouts to the mining corporations and the government take&hyphen;aways from the poor in this country. Under the diesel fuel rebate scheme 1992&hyphen;93 to 1995&hyphen;96, BHP was given $303 million and Western Mining Corporation was given $140 million. That is a total of $443 million. This government, by continuing that over the next few years, is going to meanwhile be making people who do not comply with the rules, or who refuse to move out of an area of unemployment because their partner has a sick parent, for example, who is not covered under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7303"> these rules, lose their benefits for up to 26 weeks&mdash;110,000 people affected in any given year with $377 million saved, according to the minister's figures. On the one hand, 110,000 people at the lower income level in this country will have $377 million taken out of their pockets, while two mining corporations will get $443 million put into their pockets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at CRA, it will be getting $124 million handed to it on a platter. This is tax they have paid being handed back to them, `Here you go. Put this onto your profit line. Pay your mega&hyphen;rich executives with this'&mdash;for CRA, $124 million over three years. But they are going to cut the rent assistance to young people who happen to be sharing a house by $110 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government's budget has been one of broken promises, betrayal and lies. Nowhere is this more demonstrated than in the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill that is before the Senate today. Just three days before the election, the then shadow Minister for Employment, Training and Family Services, David Kemp, wrote to the Australian Early Childhood Association saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the [Coalition] policy also states our continuing support for the community&hyphen;based long day care sector, and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector. The Coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>There must be a lot of people out there in the community child&hyphen;care sector who wonder very much about the real commitment of this government to what they call their mandate. Part of a mandate is not only carrying out actions that you have promised and were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> elected on but also desisting from taking decisions and taking away funds where it has been promised that that will not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's first budget has cut more than half a billion dollars from child care over the next four years. That is really a tragic situation. This includes the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres, cuts to child-care assistance, means testing of the child-care cash rebate and the withdrawal of funding for 5,500 new community based centres that were scheduled to be built in the next couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that it has cut the operational subsidy to put the private sector on the same footing as community based child-care centres. But the fact is that all over Australia local government bodies are finding that they have less money to provide the child-care places than they had before. Just as one example, Gosford City Council wrote to me when they first became aware of this issue and said that, for their seven long day child&hyphen;care centres, they will lose $287,000 each year from the taking away of this operational subsidy. This is repeated over and over again in each local government area across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were 380 submissions to the community affairs committee which examined this legislation, and only five argued for the abolition of the operational subsidies. Even in these submissions, it was acknowledged that there needed to be transitional arrangements for these sweeping changes. It was also recommended that operational subsidies be extended to private sector centres to meet specific objectives such as quality or educational standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an overwhelming picture out there in the community that fees will rise by approximately $25 a week per child. If you are a family with a couple of children, struggling to make ends meet, that is a lot more out of your pocket and an amount of money that a lot of people will just not be able to afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received a huge number of letters on this issue. I want to read a couple of them to indicate the depth of feeling that the community has about this particular issue and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7304"> real betrayal that people feel about having lost a subsidy that this government promised it would not take away. I have a letter here from a parent in New South Wales. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a concerned parent of two children currently attending a council managed centre. While I am at work trying to maintain an average standard of living, I know that they're both well cared for and well fed in a happy and friendly environment. My baby is fed and changed and my son is taught basic writing. Cuts to operational subsidy will take away this wonderful care and will also take away my choice to work and provide for my children. Finances mean I must work, and I would rather have good care than none. These cuts are wrong and will affect our children in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>I will also read a few interesting messages that I received, which I might hand over to the Minister assisting the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Newman) before I go today. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who will change my baby's nappy while I am at work? I hope you will.</PARA>
<PARA>And:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you have a family? Why?</PARA>
<PARA>To those people who do not have to struggle to make ends meet, who do not have children in child care, who have never had to face those difficulties, it may mean little to you, but the fact is that the cuts to these operational subsidies will mean that a lower standard of care is provided. It will mean that those centres will receive less cleaning and they will not be able to provide the comprehensive educational training that they do at the moment. In some cases, they will not be able to provide the hot cooked meals that they are at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, to those who really have sought child care in the general community, if you have a child between the ages of zero and two, you are not going to be able to find a place for that child within the private sector. For children above this age, the private sector is particularly good. But, because of the cost difficulties of providing that service for young children, if you want child care for a very young child, the only place available is in community based care. If that were the only reason&mdash;and it is not&mdash;to preserve the operational subsidy, I think that in itself would be enough. I want to express very strongly my <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposition to this move and the general eroding of the provision of child&hyphen;care services in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

Unemployed parents and students there take advantage of the children's playhouse for their children. It may have to close. It is faced, as are many similar centres around the country, with closure simply because many of the parents whose children use these centres do not have the extra money in their pockets for the extra fees that will have to be charged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a process of privatising and a process of increasing the distortion between the haves and have-nots again. It is a process of giving advantage to those who have money in their pockets and making it harder for those who do not. The bottom line on this occasion is the children themselves. We all know in this place that those first few years are the most important years as far as education and care <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7305"> is concerned for the rest of our lives&mdash;in setting how we perform, how we are fulfilled and what we achieve in the rest of our lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty incredible that this government should be truncating the opportunities for everybody to access the sorts of facilities that they are so used to. Instead, the government is handing child care across to a profit oriented system which will not primarily be interested in the struggling, the disadvantaged and those children who come from the most difficult backgrounds. It will aim at improving facilities for those who already have the money to make sure they get the best for their kids. It is unfair, unnecessary and I think it is a pretty appalling delivery of social policy. The Greens are totally opposed to this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 because community based child care is important to the community in which I live in Brisbane. It has been non-profit and it has been developed over a period of time since 1970. It has always ensured high quality, affordable and accountable child care, predominantly for those who are least able to afford child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The predominant feature has been the parent involvement in community based child care in the management area, whether it be in the staffing arrangements, funds management or responding to community needs, as opposed to the private sector, which has limited the role of parent involvement primarily just to fundraising. They are distinctly different groups. Of course, the community based child care has in itself developed a real ethos and a real spirit within the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operational subsidy has been very important to community based child care because in some ways it recognises the large amount of voluntary time spent by parents. This countervails the private sector, where the people who run those establishments draw salaries and are profit driven. Community based child care has, in effect, offered choice&mdash;a choice that has been extremely warranted for those who are less fortunate. Community based child care has turned any surplus after cost to the centre rather than to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> profit. So the ethos of these centres is very important and, of course, it builds a community spirit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The loss of the operational subsidy will mean either a cut in services or increased fees or both. To examine this, I looked at a centre in one of the electorates close by me&mdash;that is, the federal electorate of Bowman. I looked at the Bayside Community and Child Care Centre at Wynnum. The loss of the operational subsidy at that centre will mean that $39,000 per annum will be taken away from that centre. The number of places at that centre is 43; the number of families affected is 65. One in three of the places at that centre are occupied by full-time children in child care and two out of three of the positions are occupied by children in part-time care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of what the government is proposing in that particular centre sees that centre changing its fee structure from $126 per week to $141.50 per week. That is an increase of $15.50. Whilst it does not reach what we expected would be the limit, it nonetheless is a very significant increase for parents at that centre. The loss of the subsidy will, in effect, mean that the loss per place at that centre will be $17.44 per week. Therefore, there is an amount to be absorbed in the whole process. The amount to be absorbed will be in the order of $1.94 per place, which does not sound a great deal. When you convert it to a weekly amount, it is $83.42 or $4,337.84 per annum, which will not be covered by the fee increase which has been put into place in the Bayside Community Child Care Centre at Wynnum. That $4,337.84 has to be found somewhere or, in this case, it will mean a cut in the services or some other sacrifice within the operation of that particular organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it does not sound an enormous amount in terms of the budget of this parliament, it is a very significant amount in terms of a small organisation, such as the community based child&hyphen;care centre at Wynnum. This has undoubtedly meant an increase in cost for families. They are absorbing part of the increase&mdash;$15.50 per week. Put this together with other government initiatives which are attacking child care, and you will find that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7306"> even with the family tax initiative the battlers will still be behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of community based child care is that it is more likely to accommodate infants under the age of three, children with special needs&mdash;particularly those from non&hyphen;English speaking backgrounds&mdash;and those with disabilities. It seems that the government, in trying to create a level playing field for community based child&hyphen;care centres and the private sector, has overlooked the fact that we are not comparing apples with apples. What is coming to the fore is more of the economic rationalist pragmatism of the government, and we see community based child&hyphen;care centres being caught up in the ideological battle that the government wages. It is very hard to tell people in the disadvantaged groups that there is a level playing field when, in effect, child care is going to cost them more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of this debate that interests me is what is going to happen in rural and regional centres. I understand that, in the portfolio budget statements that came out, the government did give certain undertakings in respect of country centres. But I have looked at a list of 16 towns in Queensland and I wonder what their fate will be, even with the government undertakings. Whilst there is some undertaking to maintain some subsidy or some element of subsidy where there is disadvantage, what we are going to end up with, if that is the case, is two different classes of community based child&hyphen;care centres: those that have an operational subsidy, and those that have no subsidy whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That then raises the question of what will happen if those particular centres that are given some exempt status now are, in the future, faced with a private competitor. That is a concern, when you look at the range of centres that currently in Queensland rely wholly and solely on community based child care. They may be exempt today in some country centres, but they may be out of business tomorrow, because from what I can see there are no guidelines from the government at this stage for the support of rural and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regionally based child&hyphen;care centres, which are the sole providers of child care in those places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has offered some money to assist community based child&hyphen;care centres to purchase the financial management ability to enable them to restructure. Basically, this money will go to accountants and consultants who will know about the economic imperative of running some of these community based child&hyphen;care centres but will not know about the social imperative of the underlying social ethos that occurs in these places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the department has already written to a number of community based child&hyphen;care centres, advising them of the list of consultants, even before this legislation is passed. That is very pre&hyphen;emptive at best, and tacky at worst. I question the value of this change and of the assistance that has been given. While the assistance will nonetheless be important in these centres, when you look at the turnover of personnel in the community based child&hyphen;care centres over a short period of time, you can see how that assistance, which is confined to 12 months, really needs to be given over a longer period of time. I have looked at the second reading speech, and it is devoid of any real detail as to who will get the assistance, how long they will get the assistance for, and the criteria to be applied in the case of regional and rural community based child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other fear that has been expressed to me in this debate is this: whilst the operational subsidy is in focus today, is it going to be the capital works grants that will be in focus tomorrow? This manic, driven desire to reach a level playing field may well cause the capital works grants to become the focus in years to come, although not currently. The government's move to remove the operational subsidy to community based child care is ill timed and ill conceived, and it ignores completely the community spirit in the community based child&hyphen;care centres. It is something that is completely unwanted by this child&hyphen;care sector, which is so important in our community today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Child Care <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7307"> Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, although more in sorrow than in anger, I have to say. I must remind the Senate again that it is very depressing for me to read the letter of 28 February this year from Dr Kemp&mdash;I do not have it with me, but I have it in my office&mdash;advising that there was absolutely no intention to alter or change the operational subsidy and that there was no intention to run down, or in any way move against, community based child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said in a number of debates that, if that was the promise and the argument being put to the people of Australia in the run&hyphen;up to the election, a lot of people in the community could feel extraordinarily cheated as a result of this government's actions immediately it had won the election. The government has absolutely savagely attacked the community based sector. There is no commitment to expand the community based child&hyphen;care sector. All further development of this area has now ceased. That is so deliberately and directly contrary to the empty assurances that Dr Kemp was giving that I believe people could feel&mdash;and very properly&mdash;well beyond annoyed: betrayed, actually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operational subsidy to the community based sector has been an ongoing concern for a long time, particularly in the debate about how to get some kind of equity between the private child&hyphen;care centres, which do not get the operational subsidy, and the community based centres, which do. It is not the first time that there has been discussion or debate about this. But it certainly is an extraordinary move to abolish it completely in one fell stroke and to not really address, with any serious dollars, what it is that has made the community based sector deliver a different sort of child&hyphen;care centre and, in very large manner, to justify the operational subsidy dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is going to be very critical for government to establish some kind of close monitoring, perhaps even more than the accreditation program, of the quality between the two sectors&mdash;and, in particular, of the ongoing quality within the community based sector&mdash;as a result of these dramatic changes. I cannot argue it any better than the back of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the explanatory memorandum, which points out, under the heading `Financial impact', that the savings from removing the operational subsidy will be $108.8 million over the first four years&mdash;that is net, as I understand it&mdash;after taking into account $10 million for support for children with high additional needs, especially children with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I presume that that is an amount of money extra to the supplementary allocations, which presumably will not be changing&mdash;but I do not hold my breath on that. There will also be $8.3 million over two years for advice to services, and $4.1 million per year for supplementary grants for severely disadvantaged areas. A lot comes out&mdash;$108.8 million net in savings&mdash;as against something like $22 million going back in. It is laughable that you could possibly expect that centres that are going to lose $108 million will be able to seriously continue with anything like the same sort of quality child care, when they have so much less money to assist them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that there is always room for efficiencies in child care, as there is in schools, in parliament and everywhere else. You should never rest on your laurels by thinking that you have got it perfect. But this is way beyond any ordinary understanding of what might be efficiencies in the system. I am very concerned because, as my colleagues have explained, the fees will rise very dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most centres have indicated that their fees will rise from 1 January because that is going to assist them with spreading the increased costs over the year. It is also, of course, when parents are more likely to join up for child care and it makes good sense for centres to set their fee rise from that time. I am not sure that all centres will do it, but I certainly have advice that many will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means that, as of 1 January, while parents are getting their $4 tax handout in one hand they will be losing at least $20, if they have littlies in child care, from the other. It lends a whole new flavour to the notion of a fistful of dollars: while they are giving you money with one hand in the front, they are picking your pocket around the back&mdash;and taking far more than they are giving. Families <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7308"> will know that. Indeed, they know it now and they are very concerned about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appreciate that a lot of the arguments are directed at the impact on working families. Some of my colleagues have also highlighted that the increased fees will not only hurt working families. They are going to hurt families who are preparing to go back to work, where somebody may be studying or training and simply cannot take up those opportunities if they do not have child care; at that stage, they may well be receiving no extra income. So, for the benefits for their family, all they will see will be an extra $20 going out per week, and that is with just one child. I am giving a ballpark figure; according to some estimates, it could well be much more than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a great concern in this place that child&hyphen;care centres were&mdash;to quote some of those opposite in times past&mdash;dragging children out of the home, taking them from mothers' breasts and putting them into the hands of the state. I think we have passed that kind of rhubarb nonsense, although there are a few from the Lyons Forum who probably still use that sort of language. But the real problem is that there is a failure to recognise that many people using child care use it for occasional care. They use it for appointments, for visits and voluntary work, and to take a break, to get some respite, from the pressures of littlies. They are going to have those opportunities in the balance because of increased fees. For many families it just means that they will no longer participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard so many people explain that the benefits of child care are far greater than just having a place to put the little one while you go and work. It has never been like that. It has never been the intention of child care to be up&hyphen;market baby&hyphen;sitting&mdash;anything but. The one strong word coming out of child care, just as much as it comes out of families, is that it is the quality of care that is provided to our children that matters. What child care has been doing all along, at least from the Labor Party's point of view, is assisting families in the invaluable work they do in rearing children. It has not been supplanting them; it has been supplementing them. For <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many families, that supplement&mdash;the extra assistance, the socialising for the children and for parents, the expanding of ideas of what little ones can do or what parents might provide to do with their children&mdash;will now be going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot say it better than my Tasmanian colleagues have done in highlighting the challenges for so many of the child&hyphen;care centres around Tasmania. I cannot claim to have visited them all, but I have certainly visited many. And so many of them are in areas where there is only a limited option for employment. Many of the parents using those centres are using them more under the occasional care banner and they simply will not be able to continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a few questions I would like to ask the minister, or put on notice, and I think it is important to have answers to them. In the explanatory memorandum, on page 2, there is a comment in relation to the child&hyphen;care cash rebate&mdash;another broken promise. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Childcare Cash Rebate will not be claimable for care provided by a partner in a child care business to the dependent child of another partner in that business;</PARA>
<PARA>I would certainly like some elaboration on that point as to exactly what sorts of children are meant. That is, does this mean those partners are still partnered and not separated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not quite clear in the explanatory memorandum exactly what circumstances this would cover and what payments would be prevented by it. I would appreciate some comment on that. I would also like to know where these changes fit with the government's claim for a national plan for child care. These steps will quite clearly make a very significant inroad into community based child care. There was also the promise in the budget that there be no further community based child care. How does that fit with a national plan for child care? Will we be seeing private child&hyphen;care centres taking up whatever further requirements there will be for child care? Is there any proposal to moderate and assist the closure of child&hyphen;care centres, which so many of us anticipate will be required as a result of this legislation?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7309">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the harsh things for me is to have seen, over three years, a significant coming together of the two sectors of child care&mdash;the private and the community based. Indeed, I am very struck by the powerful combination of those two sectors now working very closely together to see the continuation of viable child care. I do not believe that this piece of legislation will assist the development of child care. It will not assist families&mdash;in fact, families will be the most injured. It is also important to note that the number of people employed in child care will now be under significant threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a major concern to me, especially when I look at this piece of legislation in conjunction with the industrial relations changes. The commitment to equal remuneration has gone, and the award protection for part&hyphen;time and casual work has gone. Eighty per cent of workers in those areas are women. When we look at the changes for part&hyphen;time work&mdash;the lack of protection and ongoing income security&mdash;and now this increase in child&hyphen;care fees, we can make only one conclusion, and that is that this government would like to see a significant move of women in the work force out of the work force and back into the home. I do not believe that this supports the choices of families. Also, asking families to take $4 with one hand and pay out $20 to $25 with the other is not assisting them. This piece of legislation should be defeated.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, having particular regard to its effect on working women. I start with this quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have long accepted in the Coalition that the provision of adequate, affordable available child care facilities ought to be part and parcel of the armoury of facilities and policies that are available for both men and women in Australian society in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA>It may surprise people on this side of the chamber, and parents concerned about the future operation of community based long day care centres, that that was, in fact, a quote from an address that Mr Howard gave to the Coalition Women's Forum in 1995. I know it surprised me because it is far removed from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the actions of the coalition government in announcing the budget plans for child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to touch briefly on the issue of women in the work force, and particularly their struggle. I bring to this debate experience from the trade union movement, from a union which represented a significant number of women who were employed in many occupations in the work force, including women working in child&hyphen;care centres. I bring to this debate the experiences of a great many women who work in many industries and also the direct experiences of women who work in child&hyphen;care centres, particularly in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can say that with regard to the women who work in the centres I have not met a more dedicated group of women, young and old, and my organisation worked to see that they were properly represented with respect to pay and conditions. They are not a militant bunch of people. They are very dedicated, like nurses and other of the caring professions, to the duties that they have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those centres that we have visited operate in all of the areas of the state of Tasmania, from the west coast, north&hyphen;west coast, rural and remote areas, and Launceston&mdash;the city that the minister resides in. We heard earlier mention of the Ravenswood Centre, which will be threatened by these measures, as will many centres in Hobart and in the surrounding environments. All of those centres exist for one reason, and that is because there is a need for care. They do not exist because there is a government policy that there should be child&hyphen;care centres. They do not exist because there is funding. They exist because there is a need for care, and, predominantly, the care is provided for working families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If child care is not affordable then, firstly, as has already been stated, people will forgo child care. They will either withdraw from the work force, or they will seek inferior, perhaps backyard, options. But the withdrawing from the workforce will be a significant event for many of the women who use care. Many women go to work because there is an economic necessity. But they work also because they want to be a contributing part of their household. They want their skills recognised not only in the home. Many of the women in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7310"> the workforce contribute skills and their time and work very hard in the home, as well as performing an occupation. Affordable child care has been an important aspect in making that possible and dealing with the aspirations, as well as the living standards, of working women in the community. Without that provision, there will be a diminution of the quality of life and the expectations of a lot of women in the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw senators' attention to the repeated word `choice' that time and time again this government has bandied around. I refer senators to the address to the coalition women's forum on 23 June 1995. Mr Howard then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second great principle is that and this is very important to many of the tenets of debate about policy these days and that is that it is the role of government to provide and facilitate choice.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at the type of choice that Mr Howard is offering parents of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have the choice to pay exorbitant fees for quality child care, or they have the choice to use backyard child care, or they have the choice to leave work because affordable child care does not exist. Probably, some will have the choice of moving to another child&hyphen;care centre because some people cannot afford choice, and the first centre will close because it becomes economically unviable. A centre like Ravenswood, in particular, will be affected. That centre has been struggling because it is in a high unemployment area and the provision of care in that area has made it difficult to keep the centre economic. If more people withdraw from it, then I have no doubt that the Ravenswood centre will close, unless there is money handed to it, which seems to me to be rather contradictory to the intent of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I once again refer to John Howard's address to that women's forum. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to say something about the principles that the Liberal party would bring to policies affecting women and then to say a few more specific things. The first and most obvious of all the principles that one has to state is that we do believe in a society which is built on the notion that every individual is special and important in his or her own right, and the most valuable, ongoing thing that any Government can do is to create a society where <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people have the opportunity to fulfil their own aspirations and their own hopes and their own dreams, to make their own opportunities and to have a feeling of self&hyphen;fulfilment which is so very important for all individuals, be they men or women.</PARA>
<PARA>That is obviously not true. It is, in fact, yet another non&hyphen;core promise that was fed to the voters of Australia. The coalition promised many things to working parents of Australia. Dr Kemp, on 28 February this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy also states our continuing support for community based long day care centres, and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector. The coalition has no plans whatsoever to change the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was in February. In July, the coalition announced the abolition of the operational subsidy for community based long day care. What a short&hyphen;term promise. I believe that Australians will find that such a blatant disregard of the truth and of the needs of working parents is not only wrong but offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the only attack on child care in the coalition budget. Over the next four years we will see cuts to the tune of half a billion dollars. We will see cuts to child&hyphen;care assistance. We will see means testing of the child&hyphen;care cash rebates and we will see the withdrawal of funding for over 5&half; thousand new centre based places to be built over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the coalition: who will suffer the most as a result of these draconian measures? Make no mistake about it, women, in a majority of cases, will be the parents who have to make the decision to leave work, to leave study and to leave the careers that they fought so hard to attain. I will now quote from a letter that I received recently from a constituent. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems incredible that after studying extremely hard for 5 years at Uni, at some hardship, that I may now have my future career put in jeopardy by such shortsighted funding cuts. I am sure I am not the only person who finds themselves in the situation where it is barely worthwhile financially to make the effort to work. It seems that the more we honest Australians try to better our lives and the lives of our families the more is taken away from us . . . I work . . . so that my family can maintain a reasonable standard of living which we cannot do <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7311"> on my husband's salary. We do not enjoy a lavish lifestyle by any stretch of the imagination.</PARA>
<PARA>The writer goes on to implore the Senate to do the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oppose this budgetary measure and allow us to continue to improve our future and that of our child. Don't let Australia return to the old draconian times, where only one parent could contribute to the family's income.</PARA>
<PARA>It is becoming blatantly obvious that what the coalition will do, by implementing these measures, is force women out of the work force and back into full&hyphen;time child&hyphen;care roles. Where is the choice in that? Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when it comes, importantly when it comes to the matter of childcare arrangements, it is parents who are best able to decide what is the best childcare arrangement for their children</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it's a question of whether we give people enough mechanisms to enable them to choose the kind of lifestyle that they want.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the Prime Minister there and that is why I am at a loss to understand why the coalition government chooses to remove mechanisms that enable women, particularly working women, to choose the lifestyle that they want for themselves and for their families. I urge the Senate to oppose this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The primary justification for the abolition of the operational subsidy for community based child care is to encourage services to become more efficient and cost competitive with the private sector. Taking that into consideration, and when I have visited community based long day care centres located in the townships of Tasmania, I have always been vigilant about any inefficiencies in a particular long day care service. Not on any occasion, to date, have I, after visiting and speaking to the dedicated coordinators, committee members, staff, volunteers and parents, come away with the view that a particular centre does not do its utmost to provide a service second to none.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Services such as the Ulverstone Child Care Centre&mdash;I know the Ulverstone Child Care <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Centre very well because it is where my office is situated&mdash;epitomise the picture that was presented to the committee of despair and unhappiness on the part of centre operators faced with the abolition of the operational subsidy. The Ulverstone centre, established 22 years ago, is licensed to care for 56 children. It is currently providing a quality service to approximately 200 children from families living within the town and outlying areas, with some families travelling up to 40 kilometres for care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present fee charged is only just affordable to parents, due to the fact that the area remains economically depressed&mdash;and I think Senator O'Brien touched on that. Many of the parents work in rural industries on a seasonable basis. Many are undergoing retraining or studying, or they are looking for work. Almost 50 per cent of parents utilising the centre are in receipt of the maximum child&hyphen;care assistance. Many other parents receive child&hyphen;care assistance at a very high level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of the clients they serve, the committee, in conjunction with the local government, has always been conscious of operational costs and has ensured that staffing, which makes up 80 per cent of the budget, has been as flexible and yet as workable as possible. They roster their staff on and off at times when it suits the people who leave their children there. The centre has maintained a commitment to those families in the district and to ensuring that they remain receptive to the wants and the needs of the parents. The operational subsidy has been central to the maintaining of a high quality child&hyphen;care service to these many parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centre has operated, year in and year out, as a break&hyphen;even proposition, with no money being set aside or invested but, rather, with money being pumped back in to provide, for example, much needed care in the district for children under the age of two. I understand there are only limited places in family day care for those two years old and under. The committee has advised that a fee increase for parents of between $22 to $24 a week is expected with the loss of the operational subsidy. Care for children under two will probably go altogether. A private centre has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7312"> just opened in the town and it does not care for children under two either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this debate began, that scenario at Ulverstone has been repeated to me from Circular Head Child Care Centre, which is in the far north&hyphen;west of Tasmania, to the Rosebery Centre on the west coast, from the Children's Playhouse at Ravenswood in Launceston to the Blackmans Bay Centre in the south of Hobart. East, west, south and north&mdash;all of Tasmania's community based long day care centres are up in arms about this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unhappiness being experienced by the hardworking staff and volunteers is well&hyphen;founded. They fear that, with this measure, an option will be taken away from some parents and others will have to suffice with poorer quality child care. In many respects what is so irksome for staff and volunteers is the knowledge that, with the loss of operational subsidy, they have to wind back the level of service that they have striven so hard to achieve over the years in ensuring that they remained the No. 1 long day care centre in their region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cannot come to terms with this measure as many have heard the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) state, in justifying the abolition of the operational subsidy, that 70 per cent of long day care places are provided by the private sector and 30 per cent by the community based sector. That is not the case in Tasmania, where the reverse is true. Seventy&hyphen;three per cent of child care in my state is community based; the remainder is so&hyphen;called private. However, a number of these private services are not, in fact, true private or operated for profit services as they are sponsored by schools or hospitals. So operators of centres in Tasmania are saying to me that the level playing field argument of the economic rationalists has no relevance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many in Tasmania see the abolition of the subsidy, which was introduced with no prior consultation, as a national measure mooted by the National Commission of Audit with no regard to what may have been the position in Tasmania. There has been no effort by the government to explain to the centres and parents in Tasmania why they have to become <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more cost competitive when there are so few private players, except in places like Sandy Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tasmania is getting the rough end of the stick on this matter, at a time when parents cannot afford the impost of a fee increase, let alone the dismantling of a system that was working perfectly well. An argument may be raised with regard to the cost&hyphen;competitiveness of long day care centres in Melbourne or Sydney, but the economics arguments do not hold water in Tasmania. There would not be too many economic rationalists in Tasmania. I have not yet heard any speak. I appeal to the government to look very carefully at the Tasmanian situation and take into account that, as I have already stated, our percentage figures are very different from those in the rest of Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the arguments against the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. I wish to address my remarks to the aspect of the bill that seeks to abolish the operational subsidy to long day care centres. First, I must declare my interest as a consumer of their services. I have two young children currently enrolled in a community based child&hyphen;care centre and, as a result, I benefit from the payment of the operational subsidy to that centre, the Subicare Centre in Subiaco, which receives in the order of $40,000 per annum to help meet its operating costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to congratulate my colleagues on their contributions to the debate. Their interest and their contributions have made out the case that the removal of the operational subsidy cannot be justified. We are particularly concerned as this measure is just one of a number of measures which the government introduced in the budget which represent a widespread attack on child care in our community. They also therefore represent an attack on the ability of women to be able to work and to know that their children can be placed in quality child care, if they choose to take that option. It does, as Senator O'Brien pointed out, remove the choice that is open to families. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7313">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken with, and have been written to by, hundreds of Western Australian women and by men. They are all concerned about the government attack on child care funding; about what it will mean in increased costs to them; about what it means for the quality of child care in Australia; and about what it means for the values that they hold as being important in the provision of child care. It is some of those issues regarding values that I want to address in a few remarks today, because some of the other arguments have already been well put by my colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am an advocate of community based child care. Over the past 20 years, those centres have performed an excellent job in providing high quality child care for young children in our community. They grew from voluntary community action; from groups of people in our community seeing a need and working together to establish, as a community initiative, centres that would provide a resource for working families and their communities. Their objectives had educational and philanthropic aspects. The centres have become part of their local communities&mdash;an important and integral part&mdash;and they help to build our society and our communities by contributing positive values and positive aspects to people's lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their priorities have become a benchmark for the industry. Child development principles; the use of quality, trained staff; support for parents: all have become priorities of the whole industry, as the private sector has sought to try to emulate the standards set and the values that community child&hyphen;care centre staff brought to the job that they did. They have been very crucial to the building of the child&hyphen;care industry in this country and to the building of the values and the ethos of that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are providing Australia with what is, as I understand it, one of the best quality child&hyphen;care industries in the world. The work of the community based centres has helped shape the whole industry by providing a positive contribution and positive values to our communities. In addition, as other speakers have said, they have provided specialist services to disadvantaged persons and to children with disabilities, and they have filled <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what would otherwise be a gaping hole by providing services for children under the age of two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great concerns I have about this measure is that I suspect that it will lead to an enormous shortfall in places for children aged zero to two in child care in Australia. The community based centres have effectively used the subsidy to provide staffing in child&hyphen;care rooms which provide for children under the age of two. It is an area where private providers have not been keen to provide places because of the extra staff and the resources required in providing care for those younger children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As someone who has placed both his children in child care before the age of two, I think that people are more apprehensive about this prospect when the children are so young. They are very concerned to ensure that the quality of care is of a high standard and that all the facilities are provided. So, it is a labour intensive and costly exercise. It is a fact of the history of child care in Australia that the community based centres have provided a lot of those places because of the unwillingness of the private centres to take on that work and because, as I say, of the ethos of community based centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government really needs to answer the question as to what is to happen to those places. How is it going to ensure that those places for children under the age of two continue to be provided as community based centres start to deal with the fact that they have a large section of their income withdrawn by the removal of the subsidy? They will have to make hard decisions, and those decisions will go to the question of numbers of trained staff, provision of places for disabled children, places for children under the age of two, and to some of the other quality issues that have become a feature of community based child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to labour the point, but I do want to make the point that the government has no mandate for these changes. The government wrote to concerned groups prior to the election saying that it would not remove the subsidy. It committed itself to the maintenance of the subsidy. So, parents and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7314"> women, in particular, around this country are angry because the government misled them and reneged on its undertakings in making this enormous attack on child care and, particularly, in its attack on the community based centres. Those parents and those centres have a right to be angry with this decision and that is why, I think, all senators would be justified in opposing this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What most concerns me about this measure is that it reflects ideology at work, rather than good management from the government. I am not sure, seeing their changes to child care announced in the budget, what their view of the future of the industry is. I do not see what the grand plan for child care of this government is&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be very glad if you would, Senator Newman, because I have read the debates in the House of Representatives and it certainly was not clear to me. I suspect that what happened when Cabinet were going through the budgetary process was that someone said, `Here are a few hundred million dollars we can save.' I have some very real concerns that the government does not seem to have a view of the industry, or the long&hyphen;term future of the industry. We have obviously had the EPAC report and that raises a number of vital policy issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that the previous government had a view of the role of child care in society, its role in helping women return to the workforce after having children, its positive role in maximising the potential of their productivity and for using their skills and abilities. I do not think this government has that view. I do not think that by these changes they are doing anything to support the very important national objective of allowing women to contribute to the national economy, to use their skills and to maximise their personal abilities and potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that as a result of this move by the government, we will end up with a privatised child&hyphen;care industry. I have spoken to a number of community centres that have said that they will struggle to continue. But, even in the case of those that are able to maintain their position, one wonders what will happen <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the values and the quality of care they provide because, effectively, they have been told that they have to compete on the same basis as private centres. That is fine, but that means that the sorts of things that community based centres did that the private centres were not able to do will now no longer be able to be afforded, and that is my great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will happen to those community values, to the role that parents and other members of the community play in the control of those centres, in helping to develop curriculum and policies, in fundraising and in the general life of the community? As someone who helped deliver some material for the annual fundraising fete for our child&hyphen;care centre the other day, I know that the centre is very much an important part of the community. What role will there be for those community values, for parents and other members of our community, in this new world of privatised child care? It seems to me that we would not accept such a move by the government if it was in primary school education.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would not accept a situation where, say, all primary school education had to be private, and where government or community based schools were told that they had to operate on a for&hyphen;profit basis. I know that is not an exact comparison but it seems to me that the government is saying that there is no role for the government or the community in the provision of child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those early years are the most important developmentally, if it is a vital time of a young child's life, why are we so keen to ensure that the community is driven out of a role in the care of these children but rather leave it to market forces in private centres? I cannot accept that that is a good result. I cannot understand the logic and, quite frankly, I reject the suggestion utterly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government seeks to make a big play of the equity argument and, to be honest, there are some issues here that need to be examined. The government argues that people in need in some areas do not have access to subsidised centres, whereas people like me, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7315"> who live in middle&hyphen;class areas, have access to subsidised centres. I think there is an important argument there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concede to the government that there are issues there that need to be addressed. But I do not know that the answer is to say, `We will take away the whole subsidy to all community based centres. Therefore, there will be equity because no&hyphen;one will be getting any support.' All centres will be reduced to the lowest common denominator, and the standards and the values that those community based centres have built will be wiped out but everyone will be equal, everyone will be even on this lowest common denominator platform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know that that is a constructive way to deal with the issue of equity in the provision of the operational subsidy. I think there has to be a much more clever response than that. As I said, I think this government's response is driven by the demand to reduce outlays in the budget. It is not driven by a view of how we can reshape the industry, or how we can reorganise or redesign the payment of operational subsidy to ensure that the values of the community centres&mdash;high quality staff and community values being represented within the centres&mdash;are maintained. I think there is an equity issue that has to be addressed. I think the government ought to be looking at those longer&hyphen;term issues of location of subsidised centres, of equity between those in community based centres and those in private centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to destroy that section of the industry that has provided the standards, the leadership and the quality care for many thousands of Australian children is not the answer. We will not solve anything by destroying community centres in this country. We ought to be ensuring that their standards and their values are spread throughout the industry so that we continue to have a very high quality child&hyphen;care industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those comments, I conclude my argument. I have not covered all of the issues that I would like to cover but they have been addressed in other debates. I think my colleagues have addressed them very competently. It is my honest hope that the Senate will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reject this change and force the government to think far more constructively and imaginatively about the future of community based centres in this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 that we are considering introduces two of the major changes to child care which were announced in the budget: the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care centres and the introduction of means testing for the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. This government justifies abolishing operational subsidies for community based child&hyphen;care centres on the basis that it will force these centres to compete on an equal footing with privately operated child&hyphen;care centres. That is, this government believes that by abolishing operational subsidies it will create a level playing field&mdash;one of the most overused and misused phrases in the English language&mdash;within the long day care sector and that this will lead to more efficient child&hyphen;care provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not believe that the government has fully considered the effect this decision will have on many families. That is reinforced by the extensive number of visits I have made to child&hyphen;care centres, both private and community based, and by the many deputations I have had from individuals and peak bodies. We are not convinced that leaving the future development of long day care centres to the mercy of market forces is necessarily a desirable or realistic thing to do. In fact, we would say that it is simply saying, `Our children are commodities to be split up, bargained for or auctioned, if you like, in the marketplace.' That is really what we are saying when we say that market forces will sort it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7316"> I was very interested to read the majority report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee's hearing on this issue. What intrigued me most was to see how closely that report followed the official coalition party line on operational subsidies. I have been in the Senate long enough to know that political considerations usually take precedence over most other things. However, even given that qualification, I find it very difficult to under stand how the majority of members on that committee could reach the conclusion they did when only five out of 380 submissions voiced any support for this course of action at all. Mathematically, it makes the mind boggle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee members who signed the majority report are members of the coalition. I guess that is probably not all that hard to understand after all. But while I accept that the old adage `It's quality, not quantity' may ring true in some situations, I really think that giving that much weight to five submissions out of some 380 does draw a very long bow. Let me remind the Senate that the commitment to abolishing operational subsidies contained in the majority report flies in the face of the coalition's pre&hyphen;election promises&mdash;but that does not seem to be a consideration these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As David Kemp explained to the Australian Early Childhood Association on 28 February this year, just two days before the election was held:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition policy also states our continuing support for the community&hyphen;based long day care sector, and we regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supporters of that sector. The Coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is plain enough, I would have thought. Since the budget was handed down in August, I have had thousands of letters&mdash;and I mean that quite literally&mdash;from parents and community day care workers expressing concern about the possible impact of abolishing operational subsidies and the impact that will have on the cost and quality of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the concerns which have been raised with me include these: fees in community based centres will rise by up to $20 per child per week; some community based centres will be forced to close because parents will not be able to meet the increased fees; some families, particularly poorer families, will be forced to withdraw from child&hyphen;care services; and the standard of quality in some community centres will be compromised. Whether or not all of these fears eventuate remains to be seen. But we need to underline in this chamber that the state where this will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact most heavily is Tasmania. I do not need to comment on that any further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats do not believe that this government should be taking such a drastic step as abolishing operational subsidies without first undertaking a comprehensive review of the role this funding plays and determining what will be the likely effect abolishing operational subsidies on families. Perhaps such a review would confirm that operational subsidies no longer play the role they were originally intended to. Perhaps a review would also confirm that operational subsidies need to be better targeted. But until such a review has been undertaken we cannot know. We will oppose this section of the bill today and we will remain firm in our opposition to the abolition of operational subsidies until the government undertakes a full and comprehensive review of this whole area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats deplore the way this government has attacked families. We believe that increasing the costs of child care, of medicine, of tertiary education, of home and community care services&mdash;and the list goes on and on&mdash;makes a mockery of this government's pledge to make things better for families through the much heralded family tax initiative. There is little doubt that, for many families, the additional cost of living which will result from this government's policies will far exceed the amount this government is giving them through the family tax initiative. This bill is really about a very massive experiment in radical social engineering. It is a change from community values to profit based child care, as though children have no value unless it is a dollar value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now turn to the second major change contained in this bill: the introduction of means testing for the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. After weighing up all the arguments with regard to means testing this benefit, the Democrats have decided to support the government on the implementation of this measure. I would like to point out, however, that this was not a position that we arrived at either lightly or easily. I want to acknowledge that there is a strong case for not means testing this benefit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7317">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the case against the introduction of means testing for the child&hyphen;care cash rebate hinges on the view that child care is a legitimate work related expense and that all families should be entitled to some recompense for the cost of work related child care. Those who support this perspective draw comparisons between child care, which is not tax deductible, and other work related expenses, such as union fees, stationery items, uniforms and protective clothing, which are tax deductible. In an ideal world, the Democrats would be happy to support this position. However, we do not believe we can justify not means testing the child&hyphen;care cash rebate when so many other crucial programs, in areas such as unemployment, health care, aged care and disability services, are also facing such brutal and significant cuts in funding.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, if you look at what Alan Ramsay had to say, there is a very big lesson here for a lot of people on your side of politics. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>He said that there were two unassailable facts about the Telstra debate&mdash;they are both very instructive. The first thing is that, if there is one thing that is absolutely crystal clear, it is that John Howard had a unequivocal mandate to proceed with this. Mr Ramsay also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second fundamental truth is that, unlike the Democrats, Labor doesn't have a shred of credibility when it comes to the issue of selling public assets. It was as opportunistic in opposing the sale of Telstra last election as it had been for years in government in flogging just about anything of any consequence, including the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas.</PARA>

As you well understand, the regulations that have been successfully, if you like, passed this morning, if I can put it that way, will mean that someone between the age of 22 and 25 who otherwise might have got Austudy next year&mdash;we are not talking about existing students; they have been grandfathered&mdash;living at home and from a wealthy family, will not get Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I raised the case with you that if you wanted to support Melanie Howard being able to get Austudy, good luck to you. But there would be a lot of other people who would think that it was unfair and inappropriate to design a system where she could apply if she <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wanted to and where you would pay it&mdash;just as you would pay Alan Bond's kids simply&mdash;because they turned 22.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you understand full well that for many years&mdash;18, in fact&mdash;the Labor approach was to make 25 the age of independence for Austudy. It is only recently that you dropped it down. It is not as if this is some huge change that you are unable to accommodate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have taken a fiscally responsible approach to income support. We have maintained a grants scheme. You do not need to believe what you read on the Democrats' home page, which says, `Fight the campaign to turn Austudy into loans.' That is not true, and everybody would have understood that from 9 August. Senator Stott Despoja, if she was not busy doing other things, would have recognised that. Because the Democrats want to keep the you-know-who's honest&mdash;as they always do&mdash;they would have taken that off their home page and not pretended that we were trying to turn Austudy into loans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even you, Senator Carr, who might disagree with a lot of things that my side of politics would do, would not engage in such a disgraceful misrepresentation as the one Senator Stott Despoja has engaged in on the Internet. As I have indicated to you, the department provided that material to the researchers. The figures relate to the plans for Austudy prior to the changes we made, which was that, as soon as someone has turned 25, they will get Austudy irrespective of whether or not they have completed their course. That is the change that we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, though, that you have raised the question of the socioeconomic stratum that would be affected&mdash;or which the study indicates would be affected&mdash;by these changes. It clearly showed that, by far, the greatest majority of people who would be affected are those who live in middle and upper income socioeconomic stratum postcodes&mdash;by far the greatest majority. So the percentage of people who are going to be hit by shifting the age of independence from 22 to 25 for future students is about 85 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have the study there&mdash;I do not have it with me&mdash;you might be able to tell me. Yes, 85 per cent come from the medium to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7324"> high socioeconomic postcodes. Yet again, this budget measure&mdash;which you wanted to oppose&mdash;is going to take by and large a benefit from medium to high income people.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coonan for her question. She has taken a particular interest in the development of a much better delivery system of labour market services to unemployed Australians. She raises the case today of disadvantaged Australians. The government aims to assist disadvantaged groups through providing them with a much more flexible system than what was available before&mdash;much more choice and opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The labour system under the previous government relied on a very rigid and inflexible structure. The government's targeting of labour market assistance for disadvantaged groups recognises the special circumstances that these people face. For example, we will make assistance available through the community support program in helping people who are not ready for employment at this stage to access services designed directly to address their needs and difficulties.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7326">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people on that program there will be a relaxation of the job search activity test while they are receiving this assistance. This will enable them to return to direct labour market assistance once their particular difficulties have been overcome. In working out the program details, we will work very closely with community groups who in fact raised this problem with us and with whom we have been consulting since the announcement of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are people who face multiple barriers to employment. There are groups of unemployed persons who have a combination of difficulties in returning to employment but whose disadvantages do not preclude them getting and holding a job, provided we give them some assistance. The government has recognised the difficulties these people face as well by providing significantly greater incentives for the successful placement of people in this group into employment compared with other unemployed persons. There will also be an extension in the period of time available for case managers to assist people in this group, from a maximum of 18 months to two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Disabled Australians also face difficulties in returning to work. A disabled person unable to return to work on a full-time basis will be able to take advantage of the incentive structure facing contracted employment placement agencies. The full outcome fee will be paid to an employment placement enterprise for placing a disabled person into employment for the amount of hours per week that the person is assessed as being capable of working. That is, they do not need to return to full-time employment if they are not capable of it. But if they can be placed in the equivalent of what their capacity is, then the full outcome fee will be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people, particularly because of the youth unemployment rate, face a particular problem in getting jobs. For that reason, the employment placement enterprises will receive the highest possible outcome fee for a young person returning to full-time education or training, which is the first foot in the door to getting a job or a better job.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy. In its resources policy for the last election, the Howard government committed itself to production of a white paper on sustainable energy policy for Australia. Can the minister tell us what progress has been made on production of this white paper? Will he also assure the Senate that avenues will be available for all interested parties to put their point of view? How will this be done?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7328" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Chapman very much for that question. As he said, it was the policy before the last election of this government to produce a white paper on sustainable energy with a 25-year time frame. In developing this critically important policy for the future, the government is intent on effective consultation with the community to give all interested parties&mdash;industry, environmental groups and individuals&mdash;a chance to provide their views. The government will therefore release a green <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7329"> paper, which I will do next week, setting out the issues which need to be considered in a sustainable energy policy to stimulate input from the community through the provision of submissions to the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The green paper draws attention to the high growth in demand for energy expected over the coming decades, especially with the economic growth forecast for the developing countries within our region. Globally and for Australia, energy consumed is likely to increase some 40 per cent between now and the year 2020. The green paper identifies some of the key influences which will impact on Australia's energy future. I point out that the green paper will not be a statement of government policy. That will come in the form of a white paper after the government has consulted with the community. Rather, the green paper is intended to stimulate the community's thinking about energy policy and to encourage informed debate on the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To help keep in touch with community views, the government has established both a ministerial and business round table and an energy policy forum to obtain views from principal stakeholder groups, including business, environmental groups and energy users. State and territory governments will also be fully consulted in the process of developing the white paper. We have allowed ample time for the community to prepare submissions in response to the green paper, and the closing date for receipt of submissions will be 31 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pervasive character of energy, its importance for industry, commerce, transport, households and recreation, means that getting the policy right is essential for our ongoing wellbeing. The expenditure on energy consumption in Australia is of the order of $35 billion per annum. Our  exports of energy commodities&mdash;coal, gas and uranium&mdash;generate some $12 billion per annum in export earnings. Our exports of energy technologies are worth over a billion dollars per annum. This means jobs and a very significant contribution to our standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that up to 20 per cent improvement in energy use efficiency may be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> achievable in Australia. This translates to a saving for this country of some $6 billion or $7 billion per year. Even if only half of this is realised, it is very significant. The electricity and gas microeconomic reform process is already achieving major benefits. We are seeing the increasing development of cogeneration, and this is bound to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commercial energy services industry, which drives efficiency and conservation through various technologies, is becoming more robust and more mature in this new environment. The essence of a sustainable energy policy, therefore, is to integrate economic, social and environmental objectives so that the welfare of the current generations of Australians is advanced while protecting the options available to future generations. The government's aim is to release the white paper setting out its policy in the first half of next year.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook also referred to disputes. The advice I have is that almost 90 per cent of franchisors and franchisees claim to enjoy a healthy commercial relationship.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have three answers. Senator Gibbs asked me on 10 December a number of questions about International Human Rights Day and Queensland offices. I would like to provide those answers. The first question was this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why has the government on International Human Rights Day closed the doors of the three Queensland offices of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission this morning?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that question which I have been provided with is that the existing cooperative arrangement with Queensland expired on 9 December 1996. The Attorney-General had put a broad proposal to the Queensland Attorney-General in June this year to negotiate a new arrangement consistent with the national approach and where contributions are reflective of the work done. This was followed up by one meeting of officers in August and then a number of Queensland press releases claiming that the Commonwealth had withdrawn from the current arrangements. That was not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the majority of states where cooperative arrangements have been in place&mdash;Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia&mdash;the commissions are run by the states. In respect <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of complaints brought under federal law, the state body acts as agent for the Commonwealth and those bodies are paid by the Commonwealth for so acting. This is in line with Commonwealth-state arrangements for service delivery in many other states. Such a national approach to cooperative arrangements was recommended by the review of HREOC, which was established by and reported to the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrangement which had existed in Queensland operated under a reverse arrangement. The Queensland commission, established by the federal government, acted as agent for Queensland in respect of complaints under Queensland law. That was despite the fact that approximately 80 per cent of the cases were state cases and 20 per cent were Commonwealth ones. Under the arrangement that has now expired, Queensland contributed only 50 per cent of funding for 80 per cent of the commission's output. This funding arrangement was clearly inequitable and was aberrant in terms of the funding arrangements that exist in other states.</PARA>

<PARA>This motion represents what is best described as a rolling guillotine. It is important to place on record that it is a guillotine not enforced by the government on the Senate. The opposition, for its own part, may well take a very different view of a guillotine that was proposed by the government, if the intention of such a guillotine was, in our view, to improperly restrict debate. What this particular motion represents is a cooperative attempt to deal with a heavy legislative program in a very limited time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guillotine means that each measure that the government has granted urgency for does receive an appropriate amount of time for perusal by the Senate. I think that is an important principle&mdash;not that we just move and see a range of very important bills dealt with without debate. That is one of the strengths of dealing with legislation in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition was happy to take this initiative. I must say that it is something that we would have liked to have been able to achieve in government. We would have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7335"> supported it when we were in government for the same reasons that we support it now. I must also say that this is something that the coalition would never contemplate when they were in opposition. We do hope that when we are on the government benches again we will see the same approach adopted by the coalition when it is in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the Senate that this is a commonsense resolution, a sensible way to deal with a difficult situation before the Senate. On that basis, I take what I think is the unusual step, as Leader of the Opposition, or as a senator representing a non-government party, of proposing a guillotine. I suspect it is probably unprecedented. But  I think the arguments for this cause of action are strong. I commend the motion to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just take a moment to note Senator Faulkner's comments that this is a cooperative attempt&mdash;and it is unusual. I remember so many years here when we had long and acrimonious debates about whether we would have the opportunity to impose a rolling guillotine, albeit one that was discussed by all the parties. I remember sitting here all that time copping the abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not surprising to me that the government today does not actually want to move this guillotine, but they are very happy to accept it. It is a very generous offer from the opposition. We support it. We are glad to have been part of the consultations. I hope the government at least has the graciousness to say thank you for something they are not prepared to do but which they really want us to do anyway.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I move:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 31 August 1995, the Senate referred the matter of the conditions experienced by outworkers in the garment industry to the Senate Economics References Committee for inquiry and report. The matter was re-adopted on 9 May 1996 after the com <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> mencement of the new Parliament. For the three month period from 1 June until 30 August 1996, work on this inquiry was held in abeyance while the Workplace Relations Inquiry was conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received 40 submissions from a range of individuals and organisations, including community groups, government departments and agencies, peak industry groups, garment companies and from the ACTU and the Textiles Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia. The Committee also received one petition, signed by 522 people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an effort to reach migrant outworkers, the Committee advertised in relevant community newspapers in 10 languages and on SBS radio. In addition, the Committee established a dedicated 1800 telephone line with a translator service for receipt of oral submissions. The Committee held public hearings in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra, and visited a number of garment manufacturing companies and outworker homes in Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outwork in the garment industry means sewing clothes in a private home. The number of outworkers has increased dramatically over the last decade as a direct result of recent major restructuring in TCF industries. Outworking is now so prevalent that it is not just a characteristic of the industry, the entire garment manufacturing industry is structured around it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the addition of a large outworker labour force and their associated intermediaries, the chain of garment production has lengthened. In some instances, as many as seven parties may be involved. Because the chain of garment production is so long, it has become easy for responsibility to be passed off from one element to another along the chain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there was debate about the absolute number of outworkers, with estimates ranging from 5O,000 and 330,000 people involved either on a full-time or part-time basis, the Committee concluded that there are sufficient people involved in the industry for concern about them to be warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most outworkers are migrant women, aged between 25&mdash;35, who have young children at home. Some are assisted by their husbands. Most have very poor English language skills and are thus unable to find work elsewhere. Elderly people and children assist in many outworker families with ancillary tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Problems experienced by outworkers include: low piece rates which translate to low hourly rates; impossible deadlines for completion of work; late payment, underpayment, non-payment for completed work, rejection of work and unreimbursed expenses; physical and verbal harassment from intermediaries, including blackmail, threats, coercion and bribes; substandard working environments; and worries associated with combining work with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7346"> family responsibilities. In short, outworkers are isolated, unseen, unorganised, non-unionised, and ignorant of their employment rights. For these reasons the Committee believes that outworkers, as a group, require special consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the availability of the various clothing trades awards, mechanisms exist for outworkers to be paid wages equivalent to factory employees, and some outworkers are paid award wages. However, the structural complexities of the garment manufacturing chain, and resultant ease with which various parties can shed responsibility, mitigates against full award compliance and it appears that the majority of outworkers are not paid award wages. Some outworkers are seriously exploited. In this context, the Committee notes that the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 will change the circumstances under which outworkers may be employed by providing for individual Workplace Agreements with scrutiny of such agreements available through the Employment Advocate. It is the Committee's view, however, that in accordance with the nature of outwork and past experience in the industry, it is probable that most outworkers will not be required to sign any contract and will continue to be employed in the same manner as they have been in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that occupational health and safety of outworkers is a neglected issue. Although the magnitude of occupational and secondary stress induced health problems is not known, the Committee is concerned that because outworkers are treated as contractors rather than as employees, the ultimate cost of accidents and illness among them may be being borne by the public sector. A number of recommendations were made to the Committee by Worksafe Australia and the Committee has endorsed those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence indicated that children are involved in outworking and the Committee concluded that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that some children are involved to an unreasonable extent. However, the Committee concluded that the situation endured by exploited children will only be ameliorated through an improvement in the employment conditions experienced by their parents. The Committee thus suggested to the Government that, having regard to Australia's international and national obligations to protect children from exploitation, consideration of this matter was warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues of taxation obligations and eligibility for welfare benefits were found to be of concern to some outworkers, particularly those who may have been coerced into infringements. As evidenced by the introduction of the Reportable Payments System and the Social Security amnesty for outworkers, these issues were clearly also of concern to the relevant government instrumentalities. The Commit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tee concluded that both schemes had merit. In particular, the Committee concluded that the Australian Taxation Office could take greater advantage of the Reportable Payments System to fully investigate taxation avoidance in TCF industries. In terms of the social security amnesty, the Committee has suggested to the Government that it consider its reinstatement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that despite a low participation rate, the Labour Adjustment Program has been of benefit to a number of people in TCF industries and the Committee has recommended that the government consider extending the cut-off date for prior employment of the Labour Adjustment Program to a date in the future to be determined in consultation with the Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that Australia has not become a signatory to the ILO Convention and Recommendation on Home Work, and the Committee has undertaken to review the Government's position in relation to the Convention in 12 months time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that a grant by the previous Government to the Textiles Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia for outworker related activities, which had resulted in a number of beneficial outcomes, had been cancelled by the new Government. Thus the Committee has recommended to the Government that in evaluating proposals for expenditure from the TCF 2000 Development Package, consideration be given to the need for outworker projects similar to those carried out recently by the Union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee endorsed the approach taken by the Union in promoting and establishing Deeds of Cooperation between the Union and garment retailers, manufacturing companies and government purchasers of clothing and has recommended to all government agencies involved in clothing procurement that they consider whether outworkers are used in the manufacture of that clothing and, if so, whether they are able to enter into such Deeds of Cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the draft voluntary industry `Homeworkers Code of Practice', originally promoted by the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia, could be an important step in changing the circumstances under which outworkers are employed, and has recommended that the Code be adopted by all participants in the garment retailing and manufacturing process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In attempting to resolve the problems faced by outworkers, quite a number of recommendations were made to the Committee by various government, industry and community groups. It is clear from the number of suggestions that a combined and coordinated approach is needed. Of those recommendations made, the Committee endorsed and recommended a range of other actions. These <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7347"> are detailed in the Committee's report. In brief they include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a voluntary label declaring that the employment conditions under which the garment was made have complied with legislative requirements;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GB6">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to take note of this report of the Economics References Committee. Following my work on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, I am pleased to be able to say that this report from the references committee is a consensual report involving a fairly lengthy and serious consideration of problems existing amongst outworkers in the garment industry and recommendations to the government with respect to those problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the overwhelming findings of the inquiry was that special consideration is required with respect to the difficulties faced by outworkers in the garment industry, both with respect to the potential number of workers involved working within the industry and the overall treatment faced by workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the Workplace Relations Act will introduce individual contracts across industries and some protections will be available to workers who would come under individual  contracts, the committee felt that they are unlikely to reach outworkers, given the nature of past regulation and the ability to enforce <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that regulation amongst outworkers. Award provisions, for instance, have been very difficult to enforce and often only by the department relying upon union intervention. In some respects that intervention will be restricted by title provisions on right of entry. I am sure we are all aware of this, given that we have debated it in the past in the workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to highlight the various forms with which outwork is exploited in the garment industry. It is not only in relation to the workers themselves but in the wider community that many difficulties can be highlighted. Outwork may be exploited by the garment manufacturing companies directly and indirectly in several ways. There is a table on page 34 of the report which highlights many of those ways. They include non-payment of award wages, reduced payments for acceptance of cash and complete non-payment of wages in some instances, all of which contribute to a reduction in the wages component of a garment manufacturer. When you calculate that to an hourly rate, there was evidence before the committee that in some cases that could be as low as about $2 per hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other difficulties include non-payment of outworkers for time spent on ancillary tasks such as unbundling, learning design and cutting threads. Costs normally paid by the manufacturing factory can often be borne by the outworkers&mdash;for example, cotton, thread, electricity, machinery repair and the leasing of machinery. Also, the deeming of outworkers as contractors often results in a shift in cost from the manufacturer to the outworker over such things as superannuation and insurance premiums. The payment in cash and inaccurate record-keeping results in losses in taxation revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unregulated hours of work results in overwork, with consequent health and safety problems among outworkers, the cost of which is then borne by the public sector through Medicare claims and welfare benefits. Also, the use of intermediaries to keep the work force one or more steps removed from the manufacturing companies allows the shedding of many of the responsibilities. In <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7348"> some cases, these are picked up by the social security, taxation and health systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other problem which was identified by the committee and which we hope will be resolved by further attention in this area is the exploitation of children. Families under pressure carrying out work at home can, according to some evidence before the committee, involve an inordinate amount of work by children in order to complete tasks in a hurry. This was found in some instances to be far from reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee made a number of major recommendations in relation to these difficulties. Page xv of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes the cancellation of the grant by the current Government to the Textiles Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia for outworker related activities. The Committee believes that the grant made by the previous Government to the Union for outworkers activities had already resulted in a number of beneficial outcomes.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> The Committee recommends to the Government that in evaluating proposals for expenditure from the TCF 2000 Development Package, consideration be given to the need for outworker projects similar to those carried out recently by the Union</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA>Another major recommendation of the committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Committee strongly believes that the Australian Taxation Office could take greater advantage of the Reportable Payments System to fully investigate taxation avoidance in TCF industries.</EMPHASIS>  The Committee notes that an important additional benefit of the Reportable Payments System is that it will assist in identifying all parties involved in the garment manufacturing chain, particularly those at the level of intermediary. In addition, the Committee notes that information gained from the Reportable Payments System is able to be used by the Department of Social Security to investigate welfare benefits fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>A further recommendation of the committee is that the government should look at further ways of facilitating voluntary regulation from within the industry. I would like to note at this stage that, during the inquiry and perhaps to some extent arising from the inquiry, some improvements were made in the relations between different parties within the industry in how the difficulties and the problems could be regulated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee found that there are two basic ways in which actions can be taken to improve conditions under which outworkers perform their work: legislative and voluntary. The union had proposed legislative action for the enactment of sale of clothing legislation. In contrast to this, both the union and the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia have promoted voluntary deeds of cooperation or an industry home workers code of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was mindful of the arguments put forward by both parties and concluded that voluntary action should be supported in the first instance and, in particular, that the proposed industry code of practice should be fully embraced by all parties involved. Should voluntary action fail to have any effect, then legislative action may need to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommended that an industry home workers code of practice be adopted by all participants in the garment retailing and manufacturing process. However, we regret that further progress had not been made at this stage. A couple of weeks before the conclusion of this report, negotiations had broken down. It was with disappointment that only a few retailers had become party to either an individual deed of cooperation or the industry code of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the committee has undertaken that we should review in 12 months time both this recommendation and several other recommendations within the report to see if further recommendations are required, particularly what progress has been made in relation to voluntary regulation within the industry.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly on the Senate Economics References Committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Outworkers in the garment industry</EMPHASIS> . I do support many of the things that Senator Jacinta Collins has said. This has been a very important inquiry. The issue was raised initially in this chamber by former Senator Sid Spindler. But the terms of reference that were eventually drawn up were endorsed wholeheartedly by all parties in this chamber because of the very important nature of this inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7349">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the chairman of this inquiry for the initial stages and, indeed, for a considerable time in the public hearings, I can say that the inquiry was conducted in an excellent manner and we were provided with a tremendous amount of information to help us look into what was perceived to be a very serious problem in the outworking industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this inquiry is an example of the Senate committee system working at its very best. People from all parties worked together to come up with a report on this inquiry. With only one exception, the recommendations are unanimous. That involved a little bit of give and take on both sides to make sure that the recommendations were unanimous&mdash;or as near to as possible. As I said, there was that one minor exception where government members recommended a different course to one of the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of this inquiry, we hope some good will come to those people whom we were looking into. There was always going to be one danger from the very start of this inquiry. When we had completed this inquiry, we wanted to make sure that those people whose hardships we were looking into would thank us for the work we were doing. There was always the danger that, in uncovering some of the injustices that do occur, some of these people may find themselves out of a job. They may not thank us for doing that. I think the report has been handled in a sensitive enough way and the recommendations have been put in such a way that the people whom we have been trying to help will indeed get some benefit from the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This is a very difficult industry to look into because it seems as though the problems that were being highlighted to us were caused by the chain of production. It was impossible for us at some stages to identify the intermediaries involved in that chain of production. They are the people we would really have liked to get at, because they are the ones who we think were putting some unnecessary pressure on home workers and outworkers at, one might term, the bottom end of the scale. I am very sorry that at some stage during the inquiry we could not identify some of these middlemen or intermediaries who were mak ing life for the outworkers or the home workers in the industry as difficult as it appeared to be from some of the visits we made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am conscious of the time. I am not going to talk about other things in the report, because it is there for everybody to see. But there were some issues that were highlighted. I think it is a very important report for people in the Senate to read and to understand because we spent almost 12 months looking at it and making sure we covered every angle. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I particularly commend the secretariat of this committee. The secretariat of this committee has had a horrendous year with the workload that has been placed upon it. When you consider&mdash;and this is the same secretariat as had to handle the workplace relations bill, which was a very constant workload&mdash;the amount of work that the secretariat put into this inquiry and the other matters of legislation that have been put before our committee, I can only say my thanks to the secretary, Rob Diamond. In the case of this report, I especially want to thank Dr Pippa Carron, who was involved throughout the inquiry and did much of the work in writing the report. I also thank Geoff Dawson and Merrilyn Pyle. Those four people actually form an outstanding secretariat in this place, and I can only commend them for their outstanding work.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate system has great value in drawing attention to problems and creating a public discussion. Outworking is a perfect example. I would like to compliment the Chair of the committee, Senator Jacinta Collins; the Deputy Chair, Senator Ferguson; and the secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outworking is an exceptional problem. It is on that basis that I want to draw attention to it. We fail to take action on outworking at our peril because of the social issues that are involved. Some of the salient features of outworking are worth while repeating: low piece rates, which translate to low hourly rates; impossible deadlines for the completion of work; late payment or underpayment or non-payment for completed work; rejection of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7350"> work and non&hyphen;reimbursement of expenses; physical and verbal harassment from intermediaries, in other words, blackmail and threats and coercion and bribes&mdash;and all of this to a group of workers that we identified as being, generally, migrant women who are 25 to 35 years of age and have children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are substandard working environments, and the worries are so shaded with combining work and family responsibilities. These stresses are compounded by the lack of English language and the inadequate training in so many cases. What the committee has discovered is a haemorrhaging of industrial standards and health standards. We found taxation abuse and social security abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would commend the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union for the excellent work it has done over a number of years and over a number of governments. It has struggled, in some ways on its own, until fairly recently, to deal with this tremendous problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a detailed report, and the detailed recommendations must be acted on. I believe they are both exceptional and serious. There is hope because the valiant efforts of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union and the responsible attitude of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia had moved to the situation where they had an advance draft of voluntary code of practice. I hope we hear more of that because&mdash;although, unfortunately, we have seen a setback in that process, with some of the retailers retreating from the signing of the voluntary code&mdash;we believe it is essential. In its recommendations, the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that an industry `Homeworkers Code of Practice' should be adopted by all participants in the garment retailing and manufacturing process. The Committee regrets that further progress has not been made towards establishing a voluntary Code and undertakes to review progress towards voluntary regulation in a further 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>So we will look at the matter in 12 months time. The problem is that some of the retailers have moved away, but very significant names in Australia are involved already. Target, Just Jeans, Country Road, Ken Done and Australia Post have signed. Significantly, we recommend that government authorities should sign <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that code. I will not go into the detail of that. But, because of moral and ethical reasons, there is every reason why every government authority should be involved in taking that stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will review these issues in 12 months. All I want to say&mdash;because I am conscious of voluntarily cutting my speech short&mdash;is that it is an important issue. I have not seen a better report for identifying the problems. It now requires government and the participants in industry to find the ultimate solution.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Seventh Report</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 19 November the Senate resolved to continue a reference of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 to the Parliamentary Joint Committee for further consideration. The Senate resolved on a motion that I moved pursuant to a recommendation of the Committee's sixth report which had examined the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue at stake for the continuing reference and the issue that is the focus of the seventh report concerns the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (RDA). That is, do the proposed amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 (NTA) offend the RDA?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government respects the Racial Discrimination Act. The Prime Minister has made <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7351"> that clear this year in statements to the parliament. Further, the Prime Minister has confirmed the Government's commitment to Mabo and the preservation of the integrity of the High Court's decision. The Committee has re&hyphen;examined the amendment proposals from the perspective of the RDA to ascertain whether the RDA would be overridden by the amendments: that is, whether the amendments are inconsistent with the Prime Minister's assurances. The Committee's seventh report clearly concludes that the amendments supported by the Committee's sixth report are not inconsistent with the RDA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reasons for the Committee's conclusion are quite transparent. The Native Title Act was regarded as a `special measure' under the RDA; the Preamble and Prime Minister Keating's Second Reading speech make this clear. Special measures may be provided to disadvantaged racial groups without breaching the principles of racial discrimination. The Attorney-General's Department advised the Committee that the traditional legal position in Australia has been that any laws covering racial matters must provide either `formal equality' or be a special measure. The benefits endorsed under the Native Title Act are special measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, special measures are endorsed out of a political judgement that they are justified. Being provided by the legislature, special measures can also be withdrawn or modified without inconsistency with the RDA. Nevertheless, the Committee has not taken the approach that special measures may be modified at will. Rather, the Committee's sixth report acknowledges that the right to negotiate is a valuable asset and should not be extinguished wholesale without sound reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its examination of this matter the Committee heard an alternative view to the effect that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the RDA require `benign discrimination' or measures ensuring `substantive equality'. The Committee's seventh report argues against this alternative view. Not only is it confronted by the fact that the courts have not adopted such a view, but it depends mainly on a footnote to a page in the High Court's judgement in Western Australia v. the Commonwealth (1995). The Committee cannot accept that the High Court relied on the alternative view in that case. It also cannot accept the argument of the alternative view that it is likely to be adopted by the High Court in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Convention and the RDA do not require substantive equality but only formal equality, and if special measures may not only be endorsed but also modified, then amendments to the NTA affecting existing statutory rights are possible without inconsistency with the RDA. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the NTA has proven unworkable, to the disadvantage of indigenous and other parties, then it arguably should be amended in the national interest. In the Committee's view this is possible without overriding the RDA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one further matter that deserves mention. The Committee has carefully considered the first minority report's proposal to amend the NTA by giving precedence to the RDA. The generality of the proposed clause would entail its unpredictability in the unlikely event of a conflict between the amendments and the RDA; this makes for bad legislation. Even more importantly, there is an implied admission in the minority recommendation that the RDA clause could apply in an uncertain fashion. If the minority was confident in its judgement of ways in which the RDA might be offended by the proposed amendments, then it should identify them and argue the case. The minority's RDA clause would result in a request to the courts to make sense of the amending legislation. It would abdicate our responsibility to unelected judges, and compound the scope for litigation. I enjoin the parliament, in consistency with the RDA, to fulfil its obligation to legislate for a more workable Native Title Act and I commend the Committee's seventh report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of Senator O'Chee, I present a statement on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances relating to an apparent breach of parliamentary propriety.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Apparent breach of parliamentary propriety</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators are aware that the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances scrutinises all disallowable legislative instruments to ensure that each instrument complies with its high standards of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. The Committee then reports to the Senate on any breaches of these standards and on action which it has taken to correct the problem. Usually the responsible Minister will meet these concerns by undertaking to amend the enabling Act or the instrument itself, or by giving further details about the background of the operation of the instrument <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7352"> which satisfies the Committee. It is therefore with regret that I report to the Senate on matters relating to a legislative instrument which the Committee believes has breached parliamentary propriety and in respect of which the Committee has not yet received satisfactory undertakings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The instrument in question is the Crimes Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 7, made on 24 January 1996. The Regulations were quite short and had only one purpose, which was to exempt the Australian Securities Commission from provisions of the Spent Convictions Scheme. That scheme provides for important personal rights whereby, if a person was convicted of an offence more than 10 years ago, was sentenced to less than 30 months imprisonment and has not reoffended, then the conviction is spent and the person is legally able to claim, on oath or otherwise, that they were never convicted of the offence. Also, other people who are aware of the offence must generally not disclose the conviction without the consent of the person affected and must not take the conviction into account in any decision making process. The enabling Act, however, provides for the Regulations to prescribe exemptions from the scheme. The Crimes Regulations in question exempted the ASC from the Spent Convictions Scheme in regard to all offences for the purposes of considering whether to prosecute, making submissions as to sentence, and assessing the suitability of a person to be employed by the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee scrutinised the Regulations and noted the advice of its Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, that the parent Act provided for the Privacy Commissioner to receive applications for exemptions from the Scheme and to advise the Minister on whether an exemption should be granted. The Committee noted that neither the making words of the Regulations nor the Explanatory Statement even referred to this requirement, much less that it had been observed, or to the substance of the Privacy Commissioner's advice, the obtaining of which was mandatory. The Committee assumed that this was because the matter was routine in nature, with no unusual or unexpected features. Nevertheless, the Committee wrote to the Minister on 15 April 1996 asking for confirmation that the Privacy Commissioner was consulted and, if so, of the result of those consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reply from the Minister, dated three and a half months later, advised that the Privacy Commissioner was indeed consulted, as required by the Act, but that the Minister had overruled the Commissioner's advice that the exemption should not be granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This advice was of considerable concern to the Committee. It meant that the sole provision of the Regulations was contrary to an express recommendation of the Privacy Commissioner in respect of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his statutory duty to provide such advice. The concern was compounded by the fact that, as a consequence of the delay in replying and of the making words and the Explanatory Statement omitting any reference to the Privacy Commissioner, the Committee assumed that there was nothing untoward about the Regulations and did not give a protective notice of disallowance. Also, importantly, the incomplete Explanatory Statement also meant that individual Senators with an interest in legislation affecting personal rights were not alerted to a matter of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasises that it did not draw any conclusions about the desirability or otherwise of the substance of the exclusion of the ASC from the Spent Convictions Scheme. The Committee was concerned, however, that the important questions which the Regulations raised were concealed, whether inadvertently or not, from the attention and scrutiny of the Senate. In this context I add that the non&hyphen;partisan Committee stays well clear of policy issues, but does attempt to ensure openness and accountability so that Senators should have every opportunity to take whatever action they see fit in respect of individual instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After receiving this startling advice from the Minister the Committee replied, setting out its concerns and suggesting that, in the circumstances, it may be appropriate for the Regulations to be repealed and remade, with a complete Explanatory Statement. The Committee noted that this would preserve the options of the Committee and the Senate but would not disrupt the present arrangements pending informed parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee also advised that it would write to the Privacy Commissioner and, after considering his reply, decide whether it would be appropriate for members of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to attend a meeting of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner subsequently advised the Committee that he was not aware that the Explanatory Statement failed to refer to his views on the exemption and that he appreciated the continued support of the Committee in seeking to promote a more open approach by agencies in relation to differences of view with his office, particularly where legislation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister then replied to the Committee advising that, in his view, the Explanatory Statement was adequate because it set out the provision of the Act under which the Regulations were made and general background, even though it did not mention the statutory obligation to receive advice from the Privacy Commissioner, or the result of that adverse advice. The Minister also advised, however, that he was prepared to adopt a practice under which the views of the Privacy Commissioner, if not included in the Explanatory Statement, would be communicated to the Committee at the same time as any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7353"> future Regulations were tabled. The Minister advised that he could not agree that the Regulations should be repealed and remade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee then met with officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to discuss the matter. The Committee is grateful to the Minister for releasing these officers. The Minister also advised that the delay in replying was unfortunate. In addition, a member of the Minister's staff wrote to the Committee advising that the Minister was conscious of, and regretted, the delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After considering the Minister's reply and the discussions with the officers, the Committee advised the Minister that it remained concerned at the way in which this matter was handled. The Committee advised that, in its view, any suggestion that the Explanatory Statement for these Regulations need not advise either that the enabling Act expressly required the Privacy Commissioner to receive and examine relevant requests for exclusion and to advise the Minister on whether an exclusion should be granted, or that the Privacy Commissioner in this case recommended against exclusion, but was overruled, is not supportable. In the present case the Committee considers that it is a breach of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also advised the Minister that his offer to communicate the views of the Privacy Commissioner to the Committee at the time of tabling of any future Regulations, if they were not included in the Explanatory Statement, would not be a satisfactory solution. This was because Senators would not be informed of relevant matters. Individual Senators give many notices of disallowance which may not be directly related to issues raised by the Committee. For instance, Senators may wish to disallow an instrument, or a provision of an instrument, on policy grounds. The Committee, on the other hand, does not raise matters of policy and operates in a non&hyphen;partisan fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context the Committee advised the Minister that it noted that present Commonwealth drafting practice for legislative instruments appears to be to include sometimes lengthy recitals in the making words that statutory consultation requirements have been met. The Committee gave instances of such recitals. In the case of another instrument, which the Committee understands was drafted by officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, the making words actually recite that the instrument was made after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee advised the Minister that it supports this practice and assumes that if the relevant consultations or advice led to results which were unusual or unexpected, such as a decision to override the Privacy Commissioner, that this would be explained in the Explanatory Statement. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee advised the Minister that it would, therefore, appreciate his advice that any future Explanatory Statements intended for tabling should include advice of any mandatory statutory consultation before the instrument was made and of the result of that consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the delay of three and a half months in replying to the Committee's first letter, with the result that the Committee did not give a protective notice of disallowance of the Regulations, the Committee advised the Minister that it accepted the advice that he regretted the delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also advised that it would write to the Minister responsible for the Federal Executive Council Handbook, asking for the Handbook to be amended to provide for Explanatory Statements to advise of any mandatory consultation. The current edition of the Handbook expressly refers to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this point I emphasise again that the Committee made no finding on whether the ASC should or should not be exempted from the Spent Convictions Scheme. This is a matter on which informed and well intentioned people may differ. It is, however, also a matter affecting the personal rights of those who come within the scheme and as such it is a matter upon which the Senate should have been fully informed. It is, as I say, a matter of regret that this was not done and a breach of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will report again when the Committee has received further replies. In the meantime the Committee considered that it should inform the Senate of its actions, which it is hoped will result in a better quality of both legislative drafting and of explanatory material.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overview</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised the usual large number of disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate, made under the authority of scores of enabling Acts administered through virtually every Department of State. Almost every legislative scheme relies on delegated legislation to provide the administrative details of programs set out in broad policy in enabling Acts which authorise such delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they conform to the same high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights which the Senate applies to Acts. If the Committee detects any breach of these standards it writes to the Minister or other law&hyphen;maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, by the end of the sittings Ministers have given the Committee undertakings to amend many provisions in different instruments or enabling Acts to meet its concerns, reflecting a continuing high level of cooperation from Ministers in its non&hyphen;partisan operations. The Committee is grateful for this cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 889 instruments. Of these, 192 were statutory rules, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series of delegated legislation. The other 697 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the 889 instruments was scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders. There were 101 prima facie defects or matters worthy of comment in those 889 instruments. The defects are described below under each of the four principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle broadly. Together with the Committee's fourth principle, it covers not only technical validity, but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety. The Committee noted that there may have been problems with instruments for the following reasons. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Validity</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments are invalid if they subdelegate legislative power without express authorisation in the enabling Act. One Ordinance purported to grant power to the Minister to make Determinations, which would themselves be disallowable instruments, without any apparent legislative authority. Two other instruments purported to confer upon individuals what appeared to be legislative power. Three instruments made by a statutory authority subdelegated legislative power to itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under s.49A of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Act Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>  legislative instruments may, in general, only incorporate material as it exists at the time the instrument was made, not as the material exists from time to time. In one case, the enabling Act expressly authorised some material as amended to be incorporated, but not the actual documents as amended which the instrument purported to incorporate. Another enabling Act authorised the law of a foreign country as in force from time to time to be incorporated, but the instrument incorporated material as amended which did not appear to be part of that law. Another instrument purported to incorporate amended material for which there appeared to be no provision in the enabling Act to affect the operation of s.49A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under s.48(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act delegated legislation generally ceases to have effect if not tabled in both Houses within 15 sitting days of making. On 3 December 1996 the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Bill O'Chee, made a detailed statement to the Senate on recent failures to table. Earlier in the present sittings, however, two legislative instruments ceased to have effect because they were not tabled in time. The sole purpose of both instruments was to provide for the payment of money from one Commonwealth agency to another and this was validly done within those 15 sitting days. The Committee points out that this procedure is undesirable because it means that the Senate is not given an opportunity to scrutinise such instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were other problems affecting validity. One instrument was neither signed nor dated. Another had insufficient information to identify who made it, the date of making or the authority under which it was made; some of this material was included in a covering letter, although part of this information was wrong. The Explanatory Statements for three instruments included errors which, if correct, would have made the three instruments void. A Note to another instrument advised that, to avoid doubt, the instrument commenced on making, while the Explanatory Statement advised that it commenced on gazettal; if it actually commenced on making it would have been void for prejudicial retrospectivity. One instrument provided that it would take <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7355"> effect from a specified date although the Appendix to the instrument advised that it would take effect from another date. One instrument included a report on a matter while the Act required a record of the matter. Another instrument did not effect its legislative intent. A number of instruments did not comply with an earlier undertaking by the Minister to ensure that the instruments complied with the requirements of the enabling Act. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that it would be administered according to what its provisions were intended to be, not what they actually were.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Drafting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the quality of drafting of legislative instruments should not be less than that of Acts. This standard was not always met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations which implemented firearms controls after the Port Arthur killings provided for guns to be tested by dropping from a height of not more than 45 centimetres, when it appeared that not less than 45 centimetres was intended. One instrument provided for offences with no apparent penalties. Another provided for approved persons with no provision for approval. Several instruments had no numbering while others had the same numbering. One instrument included apparently contradictory provisions. The Explanatory Statement for one instrument advised that it was removing an unworkable provision; the Committee asked why an unworkable provision was included. Other instruments included reference errors and deficiencies in drafting style. Three sets of Regulations were made on the same day, amending the same principal Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Retrospectivity</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under s.48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act legislative instruments which operate retrospectivety are void if they adversely affect any person apart from the Commonwealth. The Committee, however, will write to Ministers about any unusual retrospectivity, or delay, even if it is valid. One instrument, not amended since 1984, included references to provisions of Acts repealed a decade ago. One instrument, providing for the imposition of tax, operated with four years retrospectivety. Another provided for grants of money to private companies which could have been made a year earlier. Another provided for 10 months retrospectivity even though the authorities had known for three years that the instrument would be needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Explanatory Statements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to the initiative of the Committee all legislative instruments are now accompanied by Explanatory Statements. Some of these, however, do not give sufficient information to enable informed scrutiny of the instrument by individual Senators. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> One Explanatory Statement gave insufficient details of an important new primary dispute resolution process. Others were too brief to be useful. Others did not advise that the purpose of the instrument was to implement an undertaking given by a Minister to the Committee. Others did not advise of the date of gazettal of instruments which commenced on gazettal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Delegation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if a legislative instrument provides for inappropriate delegation of administrative powers. Several instruments provided for wide delegation of power, in one case to any person at all.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also interprets this provision broadly, to include every aspect of personal rights. The Committee noted possible breaches of personal rights for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Decision making safeguards</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative instruments which provide for administrative decisions to be made should include appropriate safeguards. One instrument provided for time limits for some decisions but not for others. Another provision required notice in writing of a decision to be given but not, as appeared appropriate in the circumstances, for a statement of reasons for the decision. Another expressly advised that a decision maker could take into account the commercial reputation of an applicant, but there was no requirement for the applicant to be made aware of any adverse material or to respond to it. Another provided subjective criteria for a decision maker to apply, including the criterion of any other matter which the decision maker considers relevant. One instrument, which was made partly to provide for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, reduced the existing rights of competitive athletes selected for drug testing. Another instrument provided an international organisation with a 10 months retrospective right to sue. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that it removed an existing right because legal advice was received that the enabling Act did not provide the authority for such a right; the Committee asked if the Act would be amended to provide such authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Privacy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee protects personal privacy. One instrument provided for the disclosure of personal information, subject only to subjective criteria, but gave no indication of to whom the information could be disclosed. Another instrument provided that a class of agent must provide information about people for whom the Agent acts when required to do so by a government agency. A number <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7356"> of instruments provided for the disclosure of private information in circumstances where it would have been appropriate for the Privacy Commissioner to have been consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Safeguards for business</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee ensures that legislative instruments which affect business operations should operate as fairly as possible. One instrument prescribed four well known private companies as the only companies which could do certain work for a government agency, including work connected with the 2000 Olympics; but the Explanatory Statement gave no indication of how the companies were chosen. Another instrument provided for unfair and apparently unintended restrictions on certain business activity, while another unrelated instrument provided for an unfair and unintended interruption to a permission to carry on business. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised of potential inconvenience for business people affected by an aspect of the official launch of the logos and mascots of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Taxes and charges</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee questions changes to taxes, charges and financial provisions generally, which in the circumstances may not operate fairly. One instrument increased a fee from $368 to $500 while another instrument increased a similar fee from $368 to $800, with no explanation for the difference. Another instrument increased an allowance for Commonwealth public servants by 40 per cent, four years after the previous increase. Another instrument had the potential to operate unfairly in respect of the recovery of medical and dental costs from members of the Australian Defence Force. One instrument provided only a Canberra telephone number for inquiries from everywhere in Australia from athletes selected for mandatory drug testing, but the number was not a free call. One instrument provided that agents must keep separate accounts for those whom they represent, but there was no requirement that the separate accounts be trust accounts. One instrument, made to correct an earlier instrument, inadvertently resulted in a hiatus in the payment of an allowance to Commonwealth public servants.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Discretions affecting business</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of instruments affecting business did not appear to provide for review of administrative decisions. One instrument provided for discretions relating to compliance by miners with mandatory requirements. Another granted a power to withdraw accreditation of commercial premises, with only subjective criteria. A number of amending instruments provided for unreviewable discretions although the principal instrument provided for review of similar discretions; one of these included a number of decisions affecting the commercial operations of a casino operator. One instrument provided a discretion to recover the costs of an inquiry into a business operator. Another provided a discretion to release commercially sensitive information. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised of review rights in respect of a discretion, but it was not apparent what these were. One instrument provided a discretion to exempt certain containers and packs from mandatory standards. The Explanatory Statement for another advised that a discretion was intended to operate as a sanction for a certain commercial decision.

Yet we hear urgings that we should ignore our responsibilities on the spurious grounds that one small territory, with the population of a suburban municipality in Melbourne or Sydney, by one vote, without any house of review, without attempting to state why a law rejected by every major inquiry in the world was proper, and in face of the universal opposition of its aboriginal population&mdash;whose remonstrance I bring before the parliament with this Letter Stick; that territory can pass a law that affects many Australians and then claim, nay, demand, that we wash our hands of our responsibilities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it would be strange if only those without religious belief could express an opinion on such a profound matter. The fact that no other parliament has passed such a law is striking evidence of the breadth of the opposition&mdash;something which Hippocrates expressed thousands of years ago when he said: "I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People like Colleen McCullough with no religious beliefs, and Professor Malcolm Fisher who describes himself as a "born again heathen" strenuously oppose lethal injections. There are religious and non religious people on both sides of this debate. Let us deal with the arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Regulation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the arguments is "Its happening already, so we should regulate it."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is like saying, "some people will obtain high powered automatic guns, so we should regulate, but not ban them."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person is willing to disregard a law which says lethal injections are never allowed, why will they be constrained by a law which says lethal injections are sometimes allowed?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If some doctors are prepared to take the law into their own hands and reject the clear requirements for knowledge and consent, why will they change their attitude, especially when dealing with an incompetent patient? An independent South Australian study found that 49 per cent of doctors and nurses who said they had assisted a person to die, did so without the knowledge and consent of the person concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Dutch Attorney&hyphen;General, Professor Remmelink found, many cases of euthanasia were <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> certified as death by natural causes. The law will have no impact on these circumstances. Indeed, the Northern Territory law is so poorly drafted that not only are the definitions of terminal illness and depression wide&hyphen;open, a coroner has no basis to investigate any death once a certificate is signed by the doctors involved in giving the lethal injection. Despite its procedures, the Northern Territory legislation has major flaws. If the safeguards are disregarded, the only witness is dead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as the law against automatic weapons won't stop possession of all automatic weapons, laws against homicide won't stop a minority of doctors from practising euthanasia. But the law does send a message, and in the case of many people, will protect them from abuse and save lives where people would have changed their minds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Euthanasia legislation sends a powerful message to the community that the vulnerable are expendable and not valued. What we legislate to allow, we approve and encourage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Voluntary euthanasia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor is this is a debate about personal autonomy. A lethal injection is not an autonomous action, even with the use of a machine. If only one person is involved, it is not euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can anyone recall the death of a family member or acquaintance that effected no&hyphen;one else? As the House of Lords Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the issue of euthanasia is one in which the interest of the individual cannot be separated from the interest of society as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With euthanasia, the patient gives up all control to the doctor. John Stuart Mill insisted that one could not in the name of freedom sell oneself into unfreedom. This is why we maintain that people cannot freely sell themselves into slavery. This is why our laws reject consent to bodily harm as a defence in a court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Euthanasia involves quality of life judgments by the doctor about the patient. If a physically well person is suicidal, we provide them with counselling and care. Witness our response to the tragedy of youth suicide. If an ill person is suicidal, the Doctor decides that care is no longer required. In the doctor's mind, death becomes an option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not to mention the pressures, subtle and otherwise, on the elderly and infirm, many of whom already feel a burden to others. This is why groups representing the disabled and the elderly have rejected pro&hyphen;euthanasia positions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But consider the objectives of euthanasia proponents, such as Peter Singer:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should treat human beings in accordance with their ethically relevant characteristics. . . They include consciousness, the capacity for physical, social and mental interaction with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7359"> other beings, having conscious preferences for continued life, and having enjoyable experiences. Other relevant aspects depend on the relationship of the being to others, having relatives for example who will grieve over your death, or being so situated in a group that if you are killed, others will fear for their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, the unconscious, the incompetent and the incapable have lost some or all of the characteristics which demand the protection of the law. Even being alone, having no&hyphen;one to "grieve over your death", may be sufficient to justify intentional killing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the authors of the Remmelink Report [the official report by the Attorney&hyphen;General into euthanasia in the Netherlands] state:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But is it not true that once one accepts (voluntary) euthanasia and assisted <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> suicide the principle of universality forces one to accept the termination of life without explicit request, at least in some circumstances, as well? In our view, the answer to this question must be affirmative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, Professor Singer has extended his principle to the conscious, but handicapped infant. And the Coalition of Organisations for Voluntary Euthanasia [COVE] has, as one of its commitments, that legalised euthanasia should apply to people with disabilities even if they do not have a terminal illness, a position that Professor Baume confirmed just yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A logical consequence of this policy is the finding of the Dutch Supreme Court that a doctor could give a lethal injection to a 50 year old woman whose husband had left her and two sons had died, but who was without physical illness and who refused bereavement counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proponents of euthanasia already argue that a lethal injection can be given to a person incapable of consenting. The events of the past century reveal that once voluntary euthanasia is accepted, the language of rights will be employed to argue that those who are incapable of giving consent also have a `right'&mdash;as determined by another&mdash;to a lethal injection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far from enhancing autonomy, euthanasia will lead to more control over the lives of many people. This is revealed in the Dutch findings that 27 per cent of people given a lethal injection had neither expressed consent nor had knowledge of their impending death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the consequences of a choice in favour of euthanasia. The discouragement of suicide is removed for certain categories of people on the judgement of others that their lives are unworthy of living because of sickness or disability. How can we establish categories of people who, if they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> suicidal, are to be given a lethal injection, without devaluing all the people in these categories? What is so compassionate about telling people who feel worthless that they are better off dead?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The steps in the Northern Territory Act do not address these issues. Euthanasia makes a mockery of autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">This Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three&hyphen;quarters of the population believe euthanasia is about turning off machines. This bill does not prevent the discontinuing of treatment, or providing patients with the most effective forms of pain relief, even if that treatment coincidentally hastens death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to restate the clear principle that the Legislative Assemblies have no power to make laws which permit or have the effect of permitting the form of intentional killing of another, whether conscious or unconscious, called euthanasia (which includes mercy killing) or the assisting of a person to terminate his or her life.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some say that there is no difference between turning off a machine or refusing treatment and a lethal injection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of us know of someone who has decided against another course of chemotherapy. We do not say that is the same as a lethal injection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person is given a lethal injection, it is the injection that kills them. Presumably, another injection would be given if the first didn't work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we turn off a machine, it is the illness which leads to death. If, as has occurred in many cases, the person continues to live, we care for them. There is no intention to kill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a simple test for euthanasia&mdash;that is to ask: "What would you do if the person lived?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you discontinue treatment and the person lives, you continue to care for them. If you provide pain relief which risks hastening death, you only provide more doses when required to relieve pain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Intention is the cornerstone of our ethical and legal systems. A person may shoot another, but not be guilty of homicide, if the shooting was in self defence, was provoked, or was an unforeseen accident. It is the intention to kill that makes the action an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when health costs are escalating, the population is aging, there is a contraction of hospital beds, the community is reluctant to raise taxes, the Economic Planning Council [EPAC] and others such as Bill Hayden have discussed euthanasia in the context of the cost of health, it is naive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7360"> to think that economic judgments are not being made and that pressures will intensify on the elderly. Consider also that it costs some $5&mdash;6,000 on average for palliative care for a dying patient&mdash;but just $25 for a lethal injection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a conscience vote about how we respond to a person who says "I want you to end my life." A wise and prudent judgement must take account of human nature as it is. To believe that with the stroke of the Administrator's pen all people will act altruistically, is to condemn people to unconsented deaths. In the analogous situation of capital punishment, we maintain that if one innocent person is going to be killed, even after the very public and due process of the law, that's too high a price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we should do is to provide high quality palliative care and enact modern refusal of treatment legislation, neither of which has been done in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we should take note that every major committee of inquiry in the world, that no parliament bar one, that the aboriginal people, the various religious groups, the world medical profession, and those representing people with disabilities have rejected euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have rejected it because of one unifying principle: The people who are most at risk are the most vulnerable, and a law which fails to protect vulnerable people will always be a bad law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To conclude what I was saying this morning, the mining companies are being handed $800 million on a plate at the same time as the poorer people in this country are having $953 million taken out of their pockets over three years. I want to conclude by giving a few more examples of how this works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The deeming rate on bank deposits held by pensioners is to be extended to cover smaller <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amounts of cash that pensioners have in their bank accounts. It means that, if the banks are not paying them interest at what is called the deeming rate, they are taxed on that interest anyway. So they do not get the money, but they are taxed on it. This will recoup an extra $40 million for the government. Meanwhile, Newcrest, a big mining corporation, is to be handed $53 million through a rebate of its taxes on diesel fuel. So, while $40 million is to be taken away from the pensioners, $53 million will go across to the mining corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $67 million which is currently available for incidentals to help people get a new job, get set up in the new job and, in particular, to make sure that they make the transition from unemployment&mdash;particularly long&hyphen;term unemployment&mdash;into a job, is to be abolished by the government. Meanwhile, in a three&hyphen;year period, Mt Isa Mines has had $63 million handed to it on a platter in tax rebates. So $67 million is to be taken out of the hands of those people who are struggling to get a job&mdash;money which would help give them a bit of advantage in getting that job rather than staying unemployed&mdash;but $63 million was handed across to Mt Isa Mines&mdash;no questions asked, thank you very much. Similarly, CRA has been given $124 million over three years. But, in the coming four years, rent assistance for single people in shared accommodation is going to be cut by $110 million. The government will rip it out of the pockets of young folk in particular, simply because they are sharing accommodation with somebody else&mdash;young folk who are struggling to make ends meet and who will be down to $40 or $50 to live on&mdash;but hand it across on a platter to one giant mining company that has executives on more than a million dollars a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hundreds of thousands of Australians are being denied a little bit of money to help make ends meet, while a few huge mining corporations are being handed money for something they have not done. It will essentially assist their continued hike in chief executive officers' pay lines of 12 or 13 per cent per annum. Some of them take home more than a million dollars a year. It is a pretty dastardly line of operation for this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7361"> government. It should be ashamed of it. We will be voting against the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 cognately. I wish to make some comments specifically about one grossly unfair measure for elderly Australians. This relates to the matter of deeming the earnings of superannuation for people who turn 55. In commencing my remarks, I would like to quote&mdash;this is an unusual procedure&mdash;the words of the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, Senator John Watson. He is not a Labor senator, very obviously. Senator Watson provided the best summary of the magnitude of the uncertainty and instability that schedule 1 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 has caused. Senator Watson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a problem for people such as our witness that, at a time of life when they are really increasingly out of touch with the financial community and with colleagues et cetera who may know something about these issues, we are expecting them to take advice on pretty technical issues that all of us have trouble coming to grips with. Yet you are asking our elderly citizens to look at rearranging their affairs. They have been pushed into a position of having to make fairly complex decisions and readjust their financial affairs and their manner of living in order to access benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate chamber that they are the words of Senator Watson when considering the evidence presented before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On budget night, the Liberals announced the removal of the means test exemption on superannuation assets and rollover funds for people aged 55. In announcing this measure, the government stated that people aged 55 and over who have retired and who will have poor prospects of returning to work should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> use all the assets at their disposal, including superannuation assets, to provide for themselves before turning to the community for support through the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will immediately and directly affect 67,000 Australians who are currently aged between 55 and the age pension age using income support payments in order to survive. The Liberals' claim, certainly initially, was that this measure will catch rorters and double-dippers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, for the 67,000 Australians who will be affected by this measure, it is a vastly different story. Of the 67,000 Australians affected, about half are currently in receipt of a disability support pension. And of the 67,000 Australians, less than seven per cent&mdash;and I emphasise this: less than seven per cent&mdash;have over $200,000 in superannuation or rollover funds. These are not the wealthiest members of our society. For many of the 67,000 Australians affected, their only real chance of long-term security and stability is the superannuation asset or rollover fund they will have when they turn 60 or 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberals speak of the 67,000 Australians directly affected by this measure as being effectively retired. Yet the people that I spoke to and those who provided evidence&mdash;there have been many, many hundreds of people who have written to the Labor opposition about this matter and there were at least five or six who gave direct evidence to the committee&mdash;want to work. They want to be able to provide for themselves. They do not want to rely on income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the 67,000 Australians affected have been retrenched and are unable to find new employment, for a range of reasons. We all know that the work force has undergone dramatic and radical change over the last decade&mdash;dramatic structural change, technological advances and trends towards casualisation and much greater mobility&mdash;for example, contracting out. These trends are well known in the employment market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7362"> Demographically, what is interesting about the 67,000 people who will be affected by this measure, those in their late 50s, is that, overwhelmingly they are white men who have lost their job, usually as a result of redundan cies or retrenchments as a consequence of structural changes in our economy. It is structural unemployment. It has also been shown that, for the majority of the men retrenched or made unemployed in this age bracket, the likelihood of finding new employment is extremely low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had some heart-rending evidence given to us by a 55&hyphen;year&hyphen;old former rail worker from Port Pirie in South Australia who cannot get another job. We had some heart-rending evidence provided by a bank employee from Launceston, in my home state of Tasmania. At the age of 55 and single, he can get another job, on occasions, but certainly not as a bank employee. He is supporting and putting his two children through university. We had the heart-rending story of an electrician who was made redundant by the Victorian Liberals. He is 55 and cannot get another job. This is fairly typical, unfortunately, of many people in this age bracket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cynics would suggest that this effective retiring of unemployed people at the age of 55 is a means for the Liberals to appear as though they are tackling the problem of long-term unemployment, because it will certainly reduce it by some 60,000-odd people. As I have said earlier, half of these 67,000 people, 35,000 Australians, affected by this measure, are currently on the disability support pension. These are people who are sick or disabled and therefore incapable of working. To require these people to draw down on their superannuation is a sign of a government without compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate: where was this measure in the Liberal Party's election manifesto? Where was it in Meeting our Commitments? You can search it, but you will not find this particular harsh draconian measure on aged Australians anywhere in the Liberal Party manifesto. The government wants people who have turned 55 and who are on government benefits to retire and use their superannuation so it can claim that it has tightened the social security net and made net savings on the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two points to be made in this context. People will have to formally retire&mdash;that is, never again seek work in excess of 10 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hours a week&mdash;so they may access part or whole of their superannuation assets or rollover funds. These individuals will have to sign a statutory declaration, having turned 55, stating that they are no longer seeking work&mdash;even if they want to&mdash;and will not seek work in future so that they may access their superannuation funds. They have no alternative. They have to access their superannuation because their government benefit&mdash;be it unemployment benefit or disability pension&mdash;has been cut. Once they cease to look for work, they will no longer satisfy the activity tests for jobsearch or newstart allowance, rendering them ineligible. At this point, the only money they will have to survive on will be their superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, what will happen when, in 10 years time, these people have used a part or all of their superannuation and they are totally reliant on the provision of the age pension? Gone will be the dream of many Australians to have a comfortable and relaxed retirement and old age. They will be rendered completely dependent on the continuing provision of the age pension. Some Australians will have to live in relative poverty that has haunted&mdash;and been a great fear of&mdash;their parents and their grandparents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor introduced the superannuation guarantee charge in 1992. Labor introduced universal superannuation so that all Australians would have the opportunity to have a comfortable, relaxed and secure retirement. What this government is doing is effectively delaying social security expenditure. The more people who are dependent on the age pension, the bigger the drain on the budget. By forcing people to fund their own sickness or unemployment benefits at the age of 55, the government is making all future Australian taxpayers fund the baby boomers' age pension requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting that, when we took evidence from the department, it did not show the effect of requiring people to take their superannuation in part or in whole when they reached the age of 55 and what the extra costs will be in five or 10 years time when those people reach retirement age and are collecting in part or in whole a higher pension.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7363">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation asked the Department of Social Security about modelling showing the effect on the budget and on national savings. The department was told the committee had not undertaken any modelling, nor had Treasury and Finance. That is, there are no figures that show how this measure will affect the budget over the longer term, and there is no modelling as to the effects of this measure on national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will undoubtedly increase costs to the budget longer term in respect of pensions, and the department admitted that. It will undoubtedly reduce national savings&mdash;again, the department admitted that. But they could give us no specific figures because they had carried out no specific modelling. Remarkably short&hyphen;sighted!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, this measure will actively discourage Australians to save. The irony of this measure is that it directly discriminates against the 67,000 Australians who,  over the last 10, 20 or 30 years&mdash;under both Labor and Liberal governments&mdash;have decided to forgo income, to sacrifice recurrent expenditure and to put money away in superannuation for their retirement. They were actively encouraged by both this government and the former Labor government to do so. They were told that it would be available for their retirement years. Now, when they need help to continue work or need to be cared for during sickness or disability, they are being told they will have to use their retirement savings nest egg&mdash;their superannuation&mdash;when they reach the age of 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As ASFA and the Retire Investment representatives informed the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, this measure has caused massive uncertainty and instability in the general community over the purpose of a retirement savings policy. It does not just concern those people who are very close to the age of 55 or who are already 55. About 900,000 Australians are currently aged between 50 and 55. There are 1.2 million Australians aged between 45 and 50 who are now asking themselves: was it worth putting money aside&mdash;in many cases voluntarily&mdash;and sacrificing expenditure for the sake of super annuation? Again, we could get no modelling from the government on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is likely that over the next 10 years the figure of 67,000 people affected in part or in whole by this very harsh measure will grow to 300,000, perhaps to 350,000 or 360,000. They will be required to draw on their superannuation asset when they are 55 because they cannot access unemployment or disability benefits in part or in whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure will affect so many Australians over the next two years because of the effects of the superannuation guarantee contribution. As I said earlier, Labor introduced this measure in 1992. It is currently at six per cent, growing to nine per cent. There is the possibility&mdash;I say `possibility' because I think the government will renege on this promise&mdash;of an additional three per cent employee contribution and a three per cent government co-contribution. So the moneys in superannuation accounts over the next decade is going to rise exponentially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently, members have an average of $38,000 in superannuation. I know the minister is very fond of quoting this figure.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level in superannuation is currently $38,000. It has doubled over the last five or six years because of the effect of the superannuation guarantee charge. It will double over the next five years. The average, Minister, will be in the $70,000s over the next five years. It will double again five years later. The average amount in superannuation accounts within a decade will be approaching $100,000. That is why it will not be 67,000 people who will be affected by this very nasty attack on superannuation; it will be the hundreds of thousands, Minister. You can laugh.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said earlier, it is effectively compulsory retirement for many of those unfortunate Australians who reach the age of 55 and who regrettably cannot find alternative employment. Unfortunately, for people who reach that age, the opportunities for further employment are much more limited than those for the rest of the community. This money in superannuation will double in the next five years, and by the year 2010 most Australians will have a superannuation asset of between $50,000 and $70,000. So the average is increasing very dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to the rhetoric of the minister, the money an individual accrues in superannuation is not a great deal. It is well recognised in the industry that, currently, an asset of $100,000&mdash;which the minister asserts is a lot of money&mdash;will buy an income stream, a pension or an annuity of approximately $6,500 to $7,000 a year. Seen in that context, $100,000 is not a great deal of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an income stream of less than the current age pension of $8,300. Superannuation of $100,000 will buy a pension of between $6,500 and $7,000 a year&mdash;less than the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> current age pension&mdash;yet there will be many thousands of people in the Australian community, many ageing and elderly Australians, who will be hit by this measure and who have less than $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to this particularly vicious and harsh measure against elderly Australians, we have had more communication from individual Australians concerned about the possibility of this measure than on any other measure in the budget. This is unsolicited correspondence and it does not take the typical campaign form that we often get in response to budget measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to say that Labor continued to actively encourage people to put money into superannuation. I am proud to say that Labor introduced national superannuation for all Australians, not just for those very few who were fortunate enough to have it prior to 1983; that is, less than four in 10 of the Australian work force. Now, some 92 or 93 per cent of Australians have superannuation. I am proud to say on behalf of the Labor Party that people's superannuation is growing rapidly. I am proud to say on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that we will oppose this measure. We will be moving two fundamental amendments to this particular measure when we get to the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is a nasty, vicious attack on elderly Australians, not just the 67,000&mdash;the railway worker, the teacher, the electrician and the bank clerk&mdash;who have lost their jobs and have little prospect of finding alternative employment, but also the hundreds of thousands of elderly and ageing Australians who will be affected. This comes from an uncaring government and was contained nowhere in their election manifesto. I am proud to say that Labor will be fighting hard against this in order to minimise its effect and, hopefully, defeat it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Schedule 13 of this bill revises the disability impairment tables used in assessing a person's eligibility for the disability support pension. Impairment tables were first introduced by the ALP in the late 1980s to stem the growth in the number of people claiming the invalid pension and long-term sickness allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7365">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of these tables was one of the first steps in a very strong push to move people with disabilities off income support and into the work force. This was also a driving force behind the ALP's decision to replace the invalid pension with the disability support pension and its associated policies in 1991 and it is one of the driving forces behind the revised disability impairment tables that we are considering today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To qualify for a DSP, a person must meet three basic criteria. First, they must have a physical, intellectual or psychological impairment. Secondly, that impairment must be assessed at the rate of 20 per cent or more under the current impairment tables. Thirdly, their inability to work must be a continuing one. These criteria will not change under the new legislation, but the revised impairment tables would make it harder for people to qualify for the DSP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason these new impairment tables will make eligibility harder is that they lower the ratings attached to many impairments and they do not allow the department to take into account non-medical factors which might impact on an individual's work related abilities. As a result, many people who currently receive the DSP will be thrown off this benefit if these tables are adopted. They will also become ineligible for the many programs which are specifically designed to help them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An estimated 34,000 people will lose their eligibility for DSP if these tables are adopted, and a further 5,000 people a year who would previously have been eligible will no longer qualify. These people will have to move over to other forms of income support, principally newstart. They will have to look for work and they will have to meet the relevant activity test, with any breach of this activity test being punishable by the withdrawal of income support for extended periods of time. Clearly, schedule 13 of this bill has the potential to leave many people with disabilities without any form of income at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that there are a number of problems with this bill. These include the fact that once people are deemed ineligible for the DSP they will have reduced access to employment programs specifically <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> designed to help them. People who are currently receiving the DSP will be forced to compete with 8.7 per cent of unemployed Australians for jobs which we know do not exist. Meeting the activity tests applicable to newstart and other benefits may be very difficult for some  people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities and mental illness. People who breach the activity test associated with newstart will be left for extended periods without any income and no real support to help them get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats simply cannot see how throwing people with disabilities off income support and other programs specifically designed to assist them can be either a positive or a desirable thing to do. I am not saying that there is not a very real place for encouraging and assisting people with disabilities to enter or re-enter the work force if that is what they are reasonably able to do, nor am I saying that people should be able to get the DSP without having to meet some kind of criteria, but there is a need for policies and mechanisms which ensure that people are not able to abuse the system in this area. However, when it comes to addressing the needs of people with disabilities, there is also a need to fully recognise the additional burdens that many of these people face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be brutally frank here: people with disabilities are still amongst the most disadvantaged groups of people in Australia today. That is because they face isolation and discrimination which comes from public ignorance and misunderstanding, and it is because there has been an acute reticence on the part of state and federal governments in this country to take the issues which affect them very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These revised impairment tables have more to do, I think, with the bottom line than with creating a better system for people with disabilities. As far as I am concerned, that is nothing less than deplorable. The tables contained in schedule 13 of the bill measure the impact of the person's impairments on their ability to work from a purely medical and, I believe, completely isolated perspective. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7366">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major flaws with these new tables is that they do not take into account the wider factors which may exacerbate a disabled person's work related abilities. This is in stark contrast to the disability impairment tables introduced in the late 1980s which were based on the concept of a whole person approach. A person's eligibility for the pension was determined by adding together a number of factors which included their disability, their age, their previous work experience, their ability to speak English and the availability of the type of work a person with those characteristics might reasonably be able to perform. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Let me remind the Senate that the Democrats opposed the ALP when they moved to cut back on these additional factors as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that the revised disability impairment tables are acceptable in their current form. Nor do we believe that in their current form they will do anything to improve the lives of people with disabilities. We believe the adoption of these tables would leave many people with disabilities a great deal worse off. As a consequence, we will be moving a series of amendments to this section of the bill which we think will go a long way towards rectifying some of the most glaring shortfalls of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill itself includes the artificially low impairment ratings designed to get as many people as possible off the DSP, the lack of recognition of the greater effects caused by multiple impairments, the absence of a table to assess chronic pain and fatigue based illness. Our amendments were put together with the help of people who are experienced in the disability area so that they would reflect the real needs and experiences of people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to stress that the Democrats have very real concerns about the effect that these impairment tables will have on the lives of people with disabilities. I urge all those senators who share this concern about the plight of disabled people and the effect of the revised tables to support our amendments to this section of the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill deals with mainly two issues. One is the government's decision to include superannuation entitlements for the purposes of social security income and assets tests where a person is between the ages of 55 and 65. This was dealt with quite extensively by Senator Sherry and I do not intend to deal with it any further. The second item that is contained in the bill is a reduction in the maximum rate of rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation. I would like to speak in detail about this matter as to date we have not dealt with it, except in a fairly minimal way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the maximum rent assistance which is available for single people in shared accommodation. The bill reduces the rent assistance available for single people sharing accommodation by a third of the maximum rate that is normally applied. Within the proposed new subsection 5A(1), the definition of a person who is single is: someone who is not a couple, has no dependent children and who shares with one or more people at least one major accommodation area, for example, a bathroom, kitchen or bedroom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of exclusions made, in particular, those people who are residing in a boarding house and are therefore under licence. But this is limited to a situation where the person also includes the provision of food or meals with their accommodation. This sort of situation is quite unusual, quite rare, in the modern situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, once again, demonstrates that this budget is a budget of deceit and a budget of broken promises. The repetition of this issue might seem tedious but the fact is that each of the budget bills that come before us illustrates that the basis upon which this government was elected is false in that they have no intention of keeping a large number of the commitments they made when they were actually seeking the support of the community during the last election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's social security policy <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A social security safety net</EMPHASIS> that was issued in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7367"> February 1996, not very long ago in time but a long way in terms of the intention of this government, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition recognises the vital role of the payment [rent assistance] in reducing after housing poverty. A Coalition government is committed to maintaining the real value of rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in there about reduction on any basis whether sharing or not. Despite the coalition's promise, this bill cuts rent assistance to about 80,000 single people who share accommodation. This will save the government $118 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government's reasoning behind this issue? The government believes its measure ensures greater equity in rent assistance between couples and single people sharing. It believes economies of scale means a person living in shared accommodation will have reduced costs and this should affect the amount of rent assistance a person receives. But this logic is inherently flawed. It misses the entire point of what rent assistance is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rent assistance is not about buying food. It is not about assistance with school books or the general expenses of life. Rent assistance is what it clearly states: it is about assistance with paying rent. Existing arrangements already take into account economies of scale. Currently, eligibility criteria ensure that where enough people are sharing a house and the rent for each person drops below a designated level rent assistance is not payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Tenants Union of Queensland said in its submission that single people sharing accommodation will still pay a minimum of 30 per cent of their income on rent before they receive any assistance. If rent payable drops below this level, then they no longer eligible for rent assistance. The concept of economies of scale where people will share additional costs is presumptuous about what share household living is about. The Tenants Union further noted that couples will share a  range of household expenses but people in a share household who are not couples, who are not intimately involved, often cover their own individual expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Housing Assistance Service also remarked in its submission that share house holds are not usually happily bonded environments, particularly when they live in adverse economic circumstances, where each of them is not very well off as they often rely only on social security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants Federation said in its submission to the committee that older renters are very serious about keeping their affairs private, and they will often not share expenses and therefore achieve any sort of economy of scale. The maximum rent assistance a couple can get is $70.40, and for a single person it is $74.60 a fortnight. A single person must pay $71.40 in rent before he or she is eligible for rent assistance, and a couple must pay a minimum of $116.20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple occupies one bedroom and a single person occupies one bedroom. The amount of rent is therefore not reduced in proportion to the number of people sharing a household, as rents go up with the number of bedrooms within the house. Only the other living costs are reduced if they are reduced at all by sharing. A single person living alone and paying more than $68.90 a week can get more rent assistance than a person who pays the same amount but lives with other people. Is that fair? What this government is doing with the stated objective of resolving one inequity is creating another glaring inequity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the people most affected? The tragedy is that young people and pensioners are those people who are most affected by this mean&hyphen;spirited change to rent assistance. It is very hard to find single accommodation. There are very few one bedroom flats or similar accommodation in cities, particularly large cities such as Melbourne and Sydney. The rental market is simply not geared towards providing this sort of accommodation. Young people, as I have said, will be most hurt by this situation, as 65 per cent of 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds that live away from home live in shared accommodation. So this is another blow by this government to the young people of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator West has pointed out, they are not only hit harder by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7368"> this particular move but also receive lower benefits through social security anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young people are mostly likely to be on lower incomes, and they are also most likely to be newly arrived in the work force. They may be seeking employment in these difficult times or they may still be students. But the end result is that they are some of the poorest paid members of our community, and they are a group that certainly are at risk of suffering the most under these changes. As I have said, young people are most likely to live in share accommodation because of the difficulty with meeting rental costs with their very limited income, whether they are working or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Youth Coalition for Housing estimates that unemployed young people under the age of 18 sharing accommodation in Sydney will be left with just over $47 per week and those between 18 and 20 will be left with just under $60 to meet all their living costs once they have paid their rent. I do not think many people in this chamber would be very happy about paying for their food, clothing, toiletries, general groceries and maybe attempting to put something into their piggy bank so they can improve their circumstance in the future on $60 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rents in Sydney are so high that sharing accommodation is nearly always the only alternative available for young people. The National Youth Coalition for Housing points out that in Adelaide, where rents are lower, people will not be affected as much by this measure. So the bill has a double whammy for young people seeking work. It creates a situation where they may have to move from cheaper accommodation where they are sharing to an area outside the main centres of the city. They may have to move to areas where support mechanisms are fewer, where transport is less available, where services are fewer and where in most cases job opportunities are fewer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, under the new activity test, if a young person were to move from the inner city where jobs are more available to the outer suburbs of Sydney, they would be hit by the new changes to the social security system in that it is a breach of activity test to move from a higher employment area to a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lower employment area. So, in trying to escape the effects of rent assistance, they will be hit by the new penalties being imposed by this government as well. It is six weeks on the first occasion and 13 weeks for subsequent breaches under this government's new regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the second group most affected are pensioners. A 1995 report by National Shelter into housing costs found that women over the age of 60 spend nearly 40 per cent of their income on rent. The Australian Council of Social Service says that this measure may provide an incentive for people such as the frail, the elderly or disabled to continue to live alone, particularly in circumstances where they really should not, where they would be better off sharing with others. So the end result is that hundreds of people currently sharing accommodation will suddenly face a one-third drop in their rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact on many people's sharing will be dramatic. As I said, many will be forced to move into areas where there is less employment or where rents for individual homes are higher and infrastructure is poorer. The Department of Social Security will also have extensive paperwork and a nightmare in collecting detailed information. There will be more than they have ever had before. They will have to collect data not just on people's income and assets but on the more intimate details of their lives. They will need to know where people are living, what sort of homes they are in and exactly what portions of the house they share, be it bathrooms, kitchens or a different room. The department will need to ask these questions to comply with this new legislation. People will have to fill out quite a large number of new forms to make sure that recipients are entitled to the amount of rental assistance they are claiming. It means more forms and requests for personal information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department admitted in the hearing of the Senate Community Affairs Committee that it currently has very little information about sharers. They do not even know who shares and who does not. In light of that admission, I was a bit surprised to learn that such an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7369"> accurate prediction has been made about the savings that will be achieved by this measure, and yet the department and this government are quite unaware of the extent of the impact of this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I am continuously surprised by this government's failure to appreciate the damage that they are doing to pensioners and young people in this community. When we were in government and this present government was in opposition, I was quite well aware of the difference in principle and policy between the two parties. However, I must confess that I was not aware of the extent of the harshness that would be visited on people in our community, especially those whom this government mouths platitudes about protecting, such as the elderly and the young. It is extraordinarily sad. I hope during the Christmas cheer which those opposite will experience overseas and here that they will examine their conscience and reconsider.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to address these two bills, particularly the rent assistance legislation. Before moving to it, I want to highlight two other items that are being included in this legislation. One is the abolition of the earnings credit scheme. This scheme was introduced not a great number of years ago to encourage people to take part-time work or casual work. It offered them a buffer to protect them from sudden changes of income that they would experience when finishing temporary and casual work, such as itinerant fruit picking. This is now gone and it will impact upon people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other item is amendments relating to debt recovery. People will now be forced to repay debts that they may owe the department even when it is the department's fault that overpayments have been made. People are going to be penalised not because they have made a mistake but because the department has made a mistake. It is one of the most cruel, callous, heartless and uncaring things that you could possibly think of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One case that has just come to my attention involves a single income family with two children. After the birth of the first child and the taking up of a parenting allowance, there <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was the sale of a small amount of land. The department was notified by fax. The parents must have been in contact with the department to have had the name of the person to provide the information to and the fax number. But they made a mistake; they did not keep the slip from the fax machine confirming that the material had been sent. They are now up for quite significant arrears. I assure the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) that she will be shortly hearing about this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with the rent assistance legislation. I dealt with this in a fair degree of detail in estimates, endeavouring, as Senator Neal pointed out, to get some facts and figures on the table. I wanted to find out the number of people who will be affected by this. I wanted a breakdown of the types of people, the situations in which they were living and how they would be affected. I am sorry, afraid and saddened that the department could not give me that information. They do not know how many people with disabilities in shared accommodation and in receipt of rent assistance will be affected. They do not know how many people in boarding and lodging places in the inner city, particularly in the city I am aware of, will be affected. It seems very sloppy that the government can bring in legislation and say in the budget and the estimates how much they think they will save, yet when you actually peel away the layers to find out why they think that, you do not discover it and it is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote one letter that appeared in the carers newspaper from the New South Wales division of the Carers' Association. It is a story of a mother and daughter. The daughter has worked for many years of her life and is now in receipt of a carers pension. The mother is an age pension recipient. They both get rent assistance because they are renting a two bedroom unit. You do not rent anywhere in Sydney and have much change left over on that income. Rents in Sydney are very high, despite what the national averages might be. The averages are distorted as far as the Sydney rents are concerned. You cannot say there are any similarities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7370">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This couple are in a two&hyphen;bedroom unit and they are both adults. Unless somewhere along the line the people involved, I and everybody else have been reading incorrectly, this mother and daughter&mdash;the daughter is on a carers pension to look after her mother&mdash;will have their rent assistance cut. Before anybody starts saying that they are not paying sufficient rent to get the maximum rate, let me say that they are paying sufficiently high rates of rent to be in receipt of the maximum amount of rent assistance. As the story goes, they are. I suggest that you look at these cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to know what will happen to people who live in those grotty, awful boarding houses in inner city Sydney. They might be called boarding and lodging houses, but the tenants do not get any food there. The only things that move on the benches in these places are cockroaches. The tenants are each paying over $100 per week in rent. They are sharing the most squalid kitchens or kitchenettes and bathrooms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">  From my understanding of this legislation, and from what I have been told previously, these people are affected as well because there is no meal component to the moneys they are paying out and they are sharing a kitchen or a bathroom. From my reading of this, that makes them subject to the cut to rent assistance. Many of these people are elderly, aged and frail. They may be people with disabilities, both physical and emotional or psychiatric. You cannot tell me the number of people involved in that. I ask you to talk to St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other organisations to see what the numbers are and to see what their comments are, because they are servicing their needs, along with the community health centres in the area. I will bet nobody has been to have any consultations or discussions with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also asked about the situation for people with disabilities living in shared accommodation. We have had this one shoved and pushed from pillar to post. We have had it dismissed because the states should be responsible for the accommodation needs of people with disabilities. Let me tell you that there are many people with disabilities out living in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> shared supported accommodation type arrangements who are in the private rental market. The department and minister should not tell me that they are boarding and lodging, and therefore they will be caught in the net because there is a boarding, a meal, component. When these people have supervision for 10 hours a week in their accommodation and they are on individual training programs and part of that program is to teach them how to be independent in their own home, to be able to cook their own meals, to be able to buy their own food, which is all part of their independent training program, do not tell me that is a board component. I have a lot more questions to ask about that, because I do not think the department and the minister have looked at the issues. I do not think they have identified the number of people who are going to be affected or where those people are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are people who cannot just take any accommodation. They have to take accommodation that may be able to cover and help them with their physical needs, if they have physical disability. In a country area that I am aware of, public transport services are inadequate, so they have to be living in accommodation that is in the central area of the town or the city. Because there is no public transport system, they have to be somewhere where they can walk to their employment. These are the sorts of issues and cases that should have been thought through before this legislation was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At estimates, I asked for and got a promise from the minister and the departmental secretary that there would be negotiations, discussions and consultations held with the organisations which provide assistance for people with disabilities. For the clients involved in this, it takes some time for their individual training programs to be amended, for their training schemes to be implemented and for them to start to learn to live on a lesser income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually had a meeting with delegates from ACROD last week and I asked about this issue. The only reason ACROD has had any discussions with the department about this issue is because ACROD initiated it. I am <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7371"> still waiting for the minister to initiate discussions and consultations with these organisations. The organisations themselves have had to initiate the involvement and the search for information. These are just some of the issues that I think need to be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that relates to accommodation is that people on low incomes do not have any discretionary funds. They do not have the ability or the wherewithal to save enough for the bonds if they want to move. That is why they are forced into these grotty flatettes. That is why they search for accommodation that is within their means and is cheap. With some of the changes to this legislation, you are actually going to be forcing these people to stay in higher costing accommodation, because the cheaper accommodation is probably where there are no jobs. They are really caught in a cleft stick. They can go hungry and stay there and get a benefit&mdash;maybe get a benefit&mdash;or they can move somewhere to accommodation that they have more chance of affording, but they will lose their benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the most heartless, uncaring government that we have seen in some considerable time. This is blaming those people who cannot afford the basic essentials of life. This is discriminating. It is callous and cruel. This is a government that said they were for everybody. Let me tell you, they are not for a whole lot of people in this world. I think it is a shame upon them. I am totally opposed to this legislation and I fully support the amendments that we moved.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These bills like so many before them, including the Workplace Relations Bill, do not represent government for all. They demonstrate the worst type of hypocrisy.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is not there for the old, the sick, young people, women, indigenous Australians, workers and it certainly isn't there for the unemployed of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of all the losers from the Howard budget, none have been more hard hit than recipients under the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social security system, developed and continuously refined and focused, under Labor governments was not about welfare. It was no about handouts. It was about a social safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This social safety net is being attacked and I don't think its an exaggeration to say that these bills, like others before them, are part of an ideological drive similar to that of Ronald Reagan in the United States of America and Margaret Thatcher in Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the dismantling of the Commonwealth Employment Service, thousands upon thousands of Australians will no longer have access to labour market assistance services. Thousands of other Australians will be adversely affected by the impact of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Take for example the abolition of the minimum rate of payment to under 18 year old sickness allowance, Newstart allowance and Youth Training allowance recipients</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The youth training allowance is currently means tested on parent's income, with a minimum rate of payment of sixty-five dollars and seventy-five cents per fortnight if the parent earns over the cut-off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abolition will mean reduction or complete loss of this payment for 5,500 young people</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is clearly premature, given the government's planned introduction of a youth allowance by January 1998&mdash;a youth allowance which will merge all existing payments to young people aged sixteen to twenty years and students under 25 years abolishing the minimum rate to under 18 year olds at this point in time could simply be a lever to extend that abolition of minimum rates to all recipients of youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes include amendments to tighten activity test administration and simplify the penalty periods that apply to Newstart allowance and Youth Training allowance we have heard much from senator newman about her efforts-to stop rorting within the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anti-fraud mechanisms she praises so highly are in fact those introduced by Labor. Any increase in sums recovered simply reflects the re-deployment of staff from service delivery to debt collection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor position has always been one of ensuring benefits go to the people who need them. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7372"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been accomplished by tight focussing of program delivery&mdash;not through throwing up hurdles to people making it more and more difficult for them to remain eligible for benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tightening of definition of `unsuitable work' will inevitably put jobseekers in an untenable position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is currently okay for a person to retain benefits after refusing a job which is considered `unsuitable'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new meaning of unsuitable work is an extreme one&mdash;it is much, much tighter</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Someone can currently apply for a job but not have the appropriate training or qualifications. This then is considered, quite rightly, `unsuitable work'. The jobseeker can refuse the job and retain benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now they have to show that they have tried to negotiate appropriate training with the prospective employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to do so will be defined as a breach and that person loses benefits for six weeks for the first `offence' (and I use the term deliberately) and 13 weeks for a second `offence'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This puts the onus straight on to the jobseeker. They need knowledge about training and they need to be able to effectively negotiate with their prospective employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up until now, people have been able to refuse work on occupational health and safety grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now they have to show they have tried to negotiate occupational health and safety changes with the prospective employer or else they lose their benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I remind Senators that the loss of benefit means the loss of family income. Saint Vincent de Paul will be very busy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again this puts the onus on the jobseeker to have the skills and knowledge to negotiate occupational health and safety changes with the prospective employer or else they lose their benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up until now, people have been able to refuse work due to family and personal considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example a proffered job may require a person to work hours from 3.00am to 1.00pm and entail an hour of travel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is no longer valid&mdash;and is therefore seen as a refusal to accept a job&mdash;therefore a breach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the above has implications in light of the Workplace Relations Bill and the `sign before you start' considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `unsuitable work' provision changes also mean that a person could be expected to move if a job becomes available but it is at a distance and too far to commute. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exceptions apply but they are very specific and many people would not qualify for an exemption. Refusal to move would constitute a breach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allow me to mention here the infamous dole diary. What an unmitigated failure this has been.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dole diaries do not require legislative change and so do not rate a mention in the legislation. However, failure to complete the diary properly constitutes an activity test breach and is another example of this government's intention to balance the books by eroding the social safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an added hurdle for a jobseeker to comply with and it is therefore easier for the jobseeker to breach and have the wrath of the department descend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to note that breaches as a result of dole diary errors are being recorded using the same computer codes as other compliance measures&mdash;DC, DE, and DP. There is no mechanism to tease out the effectiveness of the dole diary as a compliance measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be interested to see in future months how the government will try to show the effectiveness of this measure when the data is not being specifically collected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also changes the non-payment period for activity test breaches to 6 weeks for the first breach and 13 weeks for each subsequent breach. This will leave people with no means of support for 6 weeks and then 3 months if they breach again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wonder if we will see the springing up of charity bins in supermarkets around this country as has been the case in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let there be no doubt that the huge increase in the number of people thrown off benefit that this Bill will precipitate cannot and will not be absorbed by existing charities. They simply do not have the resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extension of the penalties for breaching will severely disadvantage and impoverish one of the most vulnerable groups in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then we have the amendments to the provisions relating to unemployment due to industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a deliberate attempt to frighten people off striking. Currently if a person is unemployed at the end of a period of industrial action, then that person is entitled to go on to unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, that same person must wait 6 weeks before becoming eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill tries to equate striking and not returning to work for whatever reason, with voluntarily quitting a job.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strike by members of one union may result in full workplace closure. All workers thus effected <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7373"> cannot claim benefits for 6 weeks after the action is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The employer may choose to use strike action as an excuse to close down the business. All the workers automatically become ineligible for benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The savings anticipated from the above are huge. (Three hundred and seventy-seven point three million dollars over four years). So it is clear that many people will suffer with payments being cut or withheld.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are certain measures in this bill that show that this government is not serious about getting people back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One such measure is the intention to abolish the earnings credit scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earnings credit scheme actually encourages people to get back to work</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It allows pensioners and other allowees to take up temporary or casual work without affecting their level of payment. Pensioners can accrue an earnings credit of up to $1,050 or $2,100 for couples combined to offset earnings from employment before their payments are cut.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government said prior to the election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are unemployed should be given every incentive to work if a person is not able to find fulltime work, he or she may be able to find part-time work."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The earnings credit scheme will be retained by a Coalition government".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet another broken promise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People may well be put off accepting casual or temporary employment as it becomes available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will have the effect of further distancing those people from the culture of work&mdash;a very negative outcome of a stupid decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also seeks to abolish the employment entry payment and modify the education entry payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me remind the senate of the purpose of each of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a social security recipient enters work or commences study, considerable expense is involved. Most people who have had a period of unemployment have depleted or no savings. The clothes needed to start work, the childcare arrangements necessary and the book, fees and other costs involved with commencing study impose a burden, a burden made considerably heavier by the planned changes to HECS and childcare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures recognised those difficulties and gave some assistance. We in the Labor Party believe these and other measures go some way <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> towards removing the barriers to employment and education experienced by social security recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most insensitive measures introduced by this bill is the limitation of the payment of child disability allowance to 3 months before a claim is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically this government is saying, if you have a child with a disability then you should know of your eligibility for assistance and apply for that assistance within 3 months. Through the Senate estimates process it was shown that over 75 percent of claims for child disability allowance involve  arrears of over three months. This amounts to over 11,000 people in any one year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eleven-thousand people who have a disabled child, who have the expense and the worry of arranging appropriate care, modifying their homes and their lifestyles to care for their disabled child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may well be that months or even years could pass before the parents become aware of the existence of this payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the policy imperative for denying these people arrears on this payment&mdash;a small compensation and acknowledgment of the difficulties they face.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure is callous and completely lacking in compassion. Objections to the proposed amendment to the treatment of lump sum compensation payments are perhaps best expressed by the Australian Council of Social Service. The bill also proposes to change the divisor used to calculate the compensation preclusion period where a person receives a lump-sum compensation payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be assumed that the current devisor (all persons average weekly earnings&mdash;$564.60 a week) was chosen as it reflects average income and thus the average weekly loss a person has experienced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be no rationale behind the decision to change to the single pension cut out point ($397.00 a week).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will increase by around one third, the period of time a person who receives a lump-sum compensation payment is not entitled to social security and must therefore live off their lump-sum, a large part of which is intended to cover the additional costs associated with their injury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will hit injured workers and their families very severely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what will this mean-spirited change save?&mdash;Fifty eight and a half million over four years. And what of the amendment to the application of the below threshold deeming rate?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will affect around seven hundred and twenty-one thousand pensioners and sixty thousand allowees for the saving of about forty million over four years. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7374"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently bank accounts with balances below the. Threshold of two thousand dollars for singles and four thousand for couples are exempt from deeming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not talking `share portfolios' here&mdash;just a little money in the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure means all bank accounts, regardless of how low the balance is, will be deemed as having earned five percent interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over half the financial institutions in this country do not even have access accounts which pay this rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this measure is reliant on pensioners having access to this type of account, the measure shows itself to be unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are serious difficulties associated with the changes to debt recovery.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Basically the amendment increases overpayment raising and debt recovery, increases the recovery of debts from non-customer debtors and re-defines the meaning of recoverable debts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the area of the redefinition of recoverable debts that the real difficulties arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unrecoverable debts currently arise when a person is overpaid due to the fault of the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This applies whether or not the person realises they are being overpaid or whether or not they can afford to pay the money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Council for Social Service also has expressed serious reservations about amendments to debt recovery, particularly debts caused by departmental error.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall effect of these changes is to make every over-payment a debt even if the customer did everything required and the Department of Social Security failed to act on the information provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will effectively remove any accountability the department has to clients to ensure that it takes action on advice from customers quickly to prevent over-payments."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor considered introducing a similar measure in 1994. The then opposition opposed the legislation on the grounds of departmental efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to read quite a lengthy quote from the then shadow minister Mr Ruddock, made on March 1, 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It seems to me that the difficulty with this matter is that, if this backdating is allowed to the date at which the person was no longer qualified, a certain laxity is allowed to develop in the administration. It means that nobody has to be conscious that there is a penalty that the department suffers, the revenue suffers if somebody is not making the decision that the person is no longer payable. It means that people might even be encouraged in the view that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they can let the matter go on and not draw it to attention in a situation in which there may be pressure to do other work, for instance."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the government wants to introduce measures that it considered unworkable in the recent past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hypocrisy is breath-taking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also introduces changes to the act which alter the social security entitlements advance payment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This scheme has been very successful in allowing social security recipients ride through periods of unexpected expense. A classic situation is the one in which someone needs to buy clothes to attend job interviews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston would have us believe otherwise, but I don't believe everyone has the money to buy shares let alone the necessities of life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill wants to restrict the uses of advances, limit them to one per year, reduce the amount of advances and standardise recovery to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restricting the availability of advances further restricts the activities of social security recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The money is repaid&mdash;so what is the problem?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the worse measures introduced in these bills, one which will have a profound impact on the lives of members of the community over the age of fifty&hyphen;five is the decision to include superannuation rollover assets tests for those aged between 55 and age pension age who have been unemployed for more than 9 months this measure in its current form will affect the lives of sixty-seven thousand Australians and would result in profound inequity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the aging population the measure in its current form could potentially affect three hundred and sixty thousand people. Over a third of a million Australians will be adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People are being asked to use up the funds they have saved throughout their working lives to supplement their old age before they can access social security assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will actively encourage people to withdraw from superannuation schemes and reduce the level of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally I wish to refer to a measure which will cause severe problems for many single people living in shared accommodation. That is the proposed cuts to the maximum rate of rent assistance by a third for single people sharing accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are people who already experience high levels of poverty. Not a share between them. It will particularly affect those people living in high rent areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current rules for determining rental assistance are based on the proportion of rent they pay. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7375"> is fair and reasonable. This bill seeks to further restrict access to rental assistance for some of the most needy in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined effect of the measures involved in both of these social security legislation amendment bills is a massive erosion of the social safety net that Australia can rightly be proud. We believe in dignity and quality of life for all Australians, not just for a fortunate few.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These bills expose the mean&hyphen;spirited nature of the government of today. The battlers will not thank them and will remember this government at the next election.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and other Measures) Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is an attack on the social welfare system&mdash;It is predicated on the misconception that recipients of social security benefits are there to rip off the system. It presumes that people on benefit are fraudulent&mdash;are lazy and do not deserve to receive a benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It completely ignores the fact that people are not on benefit because it is a good lurk. They are not there because they don't want to work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are there because they cannot find work or are too ill to support themselves and to support their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`If the price of progress is human misery, its not progress. If change makes people worse off, its not reform'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the words of The Prime Minister in an address to the Australian Council of Social Services in Sydney on 13 October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And yet what we see in this bill is an attack on recipients of welfare. There is no doubt that it will make people worse off. By the Prime Ministers own admission it is not reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first area of this bill I wish to address is contained within SCHEDULE 5 PART 1 and it deals with the proposed `Employer Contact Certificate'. This certificate is designed to act as proof that a person has applied for a position. It is to be signed by the employer. These forms must be completed and submitted to the DSS before a first payment can be received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the jobseeker fails to have this form signed then they could be deemed to have failed the activity test and incur a penalty for such a breach <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This obviously ignores the difficulty a jobseeker might have in getting prospective employers to sign forms. Some employers receive hundreds of applications for jobs&mdash;does the government think that employers will then sit back and complete these forms for every applicant? There is no requirement on them to do so. In fact for small business it would be deemed an unnecessary bureaucratic step which would impede rather than assist them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I fail to see how the introduction of such certificates will actually assist a jobseeker to find employment?.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that it will only lead to a far more complex paper trail which will discourage many jobseekers and see many people left incomeless whilst they are being penalised for failing a system that was designed to cause them to fail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to SCHEDULE 5 PART 2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment deals with the ability of a job seeker to refuse to take up unsuitable work. The government intends to move the goal posts in terms of unsuitable work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus will now be upon the jobseeker to prove that the offer of work was unsuitable and to establish that they tried to resolve issues that make the work unsuitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`That they tried to resolve issues that make the work unsuitable.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What if the reason the work was unsuitable was because the work offered was unsafe? What possible chance has a person applying for a job got to resolve an issue that the employer has not resolved already?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And how do you expect that the jobseeker would be able to prove that?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whose word will the government take?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An employer in breach of occupational health and safety legislation is hardly going to contact the DSS to support the jobseekers claim that that was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Oh sure the jobseeker turned down the job because I refuse to put safety guards up.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the likelihood of employers admitting that they are breaching legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same case would apply if the employer refused to provide training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What you will have is the jobseekers word against the employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What then constitutes a definition of proof?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an unreasonable expectation on jobseekers who may already have self esteem issues to resolve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It works on the false premise that they are on an equal power relationship with the employer. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7376"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It negates the individuals rights to choice based on family or health reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Individuals may be forced into taking positions which are dangerous or have unfair working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard promised the people of Australia that no one would be forced to accept an individual contract that was unfair. By this measure he is giving people on benefits no option but to accept an unfair contract on the basis that his Social Security legislation will fine them if they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sure you do not have to take the job&mdash;but don't expect to remain on benefit if you don't.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask Senators opposite&mdash;what kind of a choice is that?</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments in SCHEDULE 5 PART 3 seek to increase the penalties for breaches of activity tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first breach of the activity test is liable to an on the spot fine of 6 weeks benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second and all subsequent breaches will incur on the spot fines of 3 months benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are excessive fines to impose upon people who are already severely disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer Senators to the ACTU document of 22 October 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The imposition of penalties involving the withdrawal of essential income are not consistent with the values of a society committed to the eradication of extreme hardship and poverty'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 5 part 4 is similarly offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not content with being able to impose harsher penalties this government wants to expand its potential for revenue earning by broadening the definition of an activity test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now some events which are the result of an administrative error will be deemed an activity breach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The activity test is designed to apply to the active seeking of work. Yet this change means that faults such as a failure to declare income will be liable for activity test penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Declaration of income is not an activity that assists someone to find work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a situation frequently occurs as a result of an error or a misunderstanding of the DSS forms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An activity test fine for failing to declare income is completely inconsistent with the activity test onus on finding work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply a manner in which benefit can be with held and the government can save money.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within part 5 of SCHEDULE 5 the proposal is that if a person moves to an area which has lower <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> employment prospects then they will incur a fine of 26 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously the government assumes that they would only make such a move because they do not want to find work. Once again this government proves itself to be totally out of touch with the reality of living on a low income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person may decide to move for many reasons&mdash;many quite valid reasons. It may be to access cheaper housing, a pressing domestic need, or to be closer to family and community support. These are legitimate reasons to consider moving.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And for this legitimate move&mdash;this move which may be required to achieve financial survival&mdash;a person could be fined for six months. For 26 weeks this person will receive no income, more than doubling the current penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How does this government expect people to survive? To pay for rent and food?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What if it has already been decided that the unemployed person does not have the capacity to benefit for further employment assistance. Whilst it is decided that in effect they are unemployable they would still be penalised for moving to an area where they were equally unlikely to find employment&mdash;not less likely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard the provision is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now seek to address the provisions outlined in SCHEDULE 6.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no denying that the proposed amendments to the provisions relating access to unemployment benefit due to industrial action are an attack on union members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently a person is not entitled to NEWSTART allowance Youth Training Allowance, Partner Allowance, Mature Age Allowance or special benefit while engaged in industrial action.. However if a person is unemployed when industrial action ceases, the current legislation allows payment. The only delay would be through normal waiting periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This clause is designed to penalise workers for being involved in industrial disputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who at the end of an involvement in industrial action finds themselves unemployed would not be able to access benefit for another 6 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is totally unreasonable and totally transparent. It is an attack on union members rights to participate in industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Amendment states that the amendments are necessary because</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`workers can make a voluntary decision to strike knowing that once they cease their action unemployment benefits are available' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7377"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well how much more evidence do we need to demonstrate this governments complete lack of understanding about workers, industrial action and the problems in the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How distant are they from the needs of ordinary workers that they could so trivialise a workers decision to partake in industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact workers do not need to be actively participating in such action&mdash;they just need to be members of a union taking action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers take industrial action because they want to maintain their jobs and their job security. This can take the form of a strike. It can also be the result of a lockout, it could also be a case of a termination over imminent redundancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a further attack on the bargaining power of employees consistent with the governments attack on employees rights and standard of living in the Workplace Relations Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees don't take such action in an attempt to access unemployment benefits.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to SCHEDULE 11 this schedule deals with amendments of the Social Security Act 1991 to abolish the employment entry payment and modify the education entry payment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the removal of the bonus that people receive when they find a job or enter education. The bonus is designed to deal with the recognised costs that this incurs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefit is to assist people to get clothing, equipment, books etc .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is based on the findings of `Getting to Work' May 1988 which found that when entering work social security recipients encounter considerable costs associated with the purchase of suitable clothing, transport etc. New students are required to purchase text books and stationery supplies. It is very difficult for people who live week to week to afford the additional cost of these items. Such costs were seen to provide significant barriers for people entering the work force or educational institutions.</PARA>

This bill, predicated as it is on the false assumption that people on benefit are just ripping off the system, is only designed to save money without regard to fairness. The government does not care that it will mean that some people will be without income for as much as 6 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government does not understand the problems facing recipients of benefits&mdash;and frankly I do not think they care.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7378">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are numerous measures contained in this Bill that we on this side of the Chamber find will cause untold hardship to those unfortunate to find themselves out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like in my time to concentrate on a few of the measures contained in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To start I would like to make some general remarks about Schedule 5 of this Bill before moving on and making brief comments about some of the other schedules of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increases in penalties for activity test and the change of penalty for administrative breaches would have to be one of the most heavy measures for young people since unemployment payments were introduced by the Commonwealth in 1945.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I read in a letter from the President of ACOSS, Mr</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fitzgerald recently;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Extension of the penalties along the lines proposed in this Bill will severely disadvantage and further impoverish one of the most vulnerable groups in our community.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I abhor the provisions with regard to the amendments to tighten the activity test administration and Part 3 of Schedule 5 that extends the penalties for breaches to six weeks for a first breach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I read this Bill I became deeply saddened that a government could place itself in a position where it would be so wilfully and directly involved in causing poverty. To me this is one of the rawest or crudest of all the measures across all portfolios that came out of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is crude because there is not one skerrick of reason that can be called upon by the Minister to demonstrate why this measure is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least for example there was a rationale for penalties to be increased under One Nation&mdash;there was in that case a mixture as the Welfare Rights Network said of carrot and stick.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increases introduced then, copped a lot of flack from emergency relief providers but its gone a lot further now under a Minister that I truly believe has never had an understanding of the hardship that is experienced by individuals and families because of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No evidence exists that the first breach penalty in failing the activity test, has led to unprecedented recidivism on the part of our young people who are the most targeted under this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather the evidence is to the contrary that in losing benefit for 3 weeks it was enough for our unemployed young to experience real hardship and to never do it again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I use the word recidivism deliberately because I fear that this Government in all its efforts to show how it is hardening up the system&mdash;that it will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doing a greater disfavour to our young. Many unemployed young people are going to feel even further outcasts in our society&mdash;as if they are criminals because of measures such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the National Welfare Rights Network pointed out in their</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">submission the penalties are already extremely harsh, more so in fact than penalties for summary offences under the criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I abhor this measure as I see them as a stunt by this government to ensure that they appease the many people out there who unfortunately still believe the balance of the unemployed are bludgers and are able to merrily claim the dole fortnight in&mdash;fortnight out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Welfare cheats are not to be tolerated. That goes without saying. But in reading the recent Social Security Compliance Report tabled by Senator Campbell from the Minister for Social Security I sadly believe a perception is developing in society that there is some parallel between overpayments, debt recovery and payment cancellations and breaches of an activity or administrative test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find them abhorrent as the view that has been pedalled is</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that there are many unemployed who are aren't making a</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">genuine effort to obtain employment. I have spoken now to 3 case managers on the North West Coast of Tasmania to gauge whether that is the case. I am talking about the long term unemployed that were dealt with under the old regime. I asked whether unemployed people are that bad in keeping appointments and the like. The view of all three was that yes there are one or two but on the whole the overwhelming majority wanted work, were not intentionally obstructionist but unfortunately some had substantial impediments to employment like illiteracy and physical or mental health problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that this is also raised by ACROD in their submission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACROD fears that many of those that will be reassessed as ineligible for disability support pension will find it difficult to understand the gravity of failing to do something required of them under the activities test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be interested to know if this measure is adopted what the proportion of those breached were once in receipt of disability support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Federal Government have unfortunately decided to punish those already experiencing the hardship of poverty by bringing in a raft of changes that are clearly counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is hard to believe what will be the social ramifications when 91 thousand people under a tightening of the activity test are estimated will be affected. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7379"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know how many of these people are going to survive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without being overly melodramatic and adopting too freely a flood gates type argument l just wonder whether the introduction of this measure taken in tandem with all the other measures introduced in this Bill will in time be seen as a pivotal point in the development of a true underclad in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now want to refer to Schedule 7 a Schedule that we believe should be withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to waiting periods and the replacement with an income maintenance period is another attack like that of increasing penalty periods in that it will make it doubly difficult for people to return to the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People and particularly families will have their financial affairs compounded where a partner ends up becoming unemployed and will need to draw on their annual leave and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that with this measure there has been shown a lack of understanding as to how a family or individual live from day to day and as the National Welfare Rights Network points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government's proposals that people should use savings to support themselves ignores the fact that many people on low to medium incomes have very little disposable income and have few opportunities to acquire savings to meet the unexpected events in life. The money that many people receive as unused annual or other leave often constitutes their only savings when they become unemployed. They provide a necessary buffer to help people pay outstanding debts and expenses at the time as well as all the additional costs that cannot be met from the low levels of Newstart allowance over a period of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People should not as is stated in the minority report be punished for saving .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to also note that with the change from an annual leave waiting period to an income maintenance period people will be precluded from obtaining special benefit which would currently assist people who are facing particular hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also concerned that the extent of the proposed reduction in the threshold amount under the liquid assets test is over the top.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To decrease the threshold by 50% on the current amounts for singles and couples will as the National Welfare Rights Network states, reduce peoples' financial reserves to a dangerously low level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ameliorate these harsh provisions Schedule 7 the alternative proposal of Welfare Rights by replacing both the proposed liquid assets test and the income maintenance period with a new liquid assets test should be adopted. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally I would like to make some comments with regard to Disability Support Pension and the proposed amendments to the impairment tables.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reading the submission from ACROD, the National Industry Association for Disability Services and in hearing their comments to the submission in the hearing on this Bill I am particularly concerned for those on the cusp of being eligible for disability pension now, and having to become under this measure reliant on labour market programs because they fall short of the 20% impairment rating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Programs and access to programs I might add that are still up in the air. It was interesting to read the submission from ACROD to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs which raised in some detail, concerns about amongst other things the effect of the introduction of the `capacity to benefit' test and the capacity of those assessing individuals to understand fully the area of disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What struck out after reading the submission from ACROD on reforming employment assistance was just how uncertain the area remains for those who will be required to look for a job</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and also have the disadvantage of a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was pointed out in the minority report clarification is still needed in this area and for that reason Schedule 13 of the bill should be withdrawn until those types of matters are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I fear that this group of people will not be adequately catered for as their support needs will not be met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many other matters that I could raise with regard to this bill as listed in the minority report but I will leave it there except to say that this bill flies in the face of achieving a more equitable society. And further I wish to address the issue of the maximum rate of rent assistance for single people who share accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Coalition had adhered to its election promise of remaining committed to maintaining the real value of rent assistance then this measure would never have come into being.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, in my mind, not one basis or rationale for the introduction of this change when 80 thousand of the poorest people in our society will be singled out to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On all the evidence these people will now need to review where they live and how they will survive. Why will they receive such a bad break when other options were available?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, as was stated by the witnesses, in the hearing over this Bill, if, as the coalition state, the measure is designed to provide greater equity between single sharers and families in similar <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7380"> circumstances, why is it that this so called inequity is resolved downwards rather than upwards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Shelter said, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should be addressing the situation of couples rather than reducing the level of rent assistance to singles, I think, in effect, all this measure will achieve is hardship for singles and it will not resolve any inequity that couples face."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">End of quote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And from the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition when they said, and again I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If people living alone have higher unmet housing costs than those in shared accommodation, the solution should focus on improving their assistance and not penalising people in shared accommodation."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">End of quote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is exactly what this measure will achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we and the Australian Democrats say in the minority report new inequities would be introduced under Schedule 2.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the coalition woefully attempt to quantify the degree of inequity that currently exists with rent assistance&mdash;on the other side of the coin the effect of this measure on the poor has not been quantified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence suggests that this measure will be most felt by the young, disabled and older women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commonality for those people is that they will be in receipt of a low income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 80 thousand who are expected to be affected by this proposal many will live through an upheaval that will result not only in less disposable income but less self esteem as they realise that the government has dumped them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a charade for this Government to rely on the equity argument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The equity fallacy pedalled by the coalition to cover up their election falsehood on this matter is quite shameful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no equity in this measure but rather quite the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Organisations on the cutting edge, dealing day in day out on housing such as National Shelter, National Youth Coalition for Housing, and the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition are united in their view that this proposed measure is harsh with, a resultant hardship to many low income renters struggling to meet higher housing costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An interesting aspect to this measure is the potential for harm to people with a disability who live in boarding and lodging houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not satisfied with the Coalition view that the impact of this measure on people with disabilities <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> living in group houses is probably not as great as may have been expected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding was that many people with a disability live in group houses and cook their own meals as a team. They desire to be independent and so not receive meals on a regular basis because of that strong desire for independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the reasoning provided by the Coalition that the measure would not impact that heavily on people with disabilities is a little tenuous to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition do not understand what will be the extent of the ramifications from this measure on people living in boarding houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Likewise this measure comes at a time when we find efforts are in train to fundamentally change the nature of housing for low income earners across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To fiddle at this crucial time when wider reforms are mooted is a dangerous option as the extent of the social consequences are unknown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure also does not rest easily with other social security policies such as the proposed activity test requirements and breaches for moving to a more affordable area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would expect that many who would make up the 80 thousand affected will not be able to just pull up anchor and move into single accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather I expect, as has already been discussed in committee, they will just battle on with less money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the region in which I live, I am very concerned for the young people who currently live in shared accommodation and are in receipt of rental assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this proposal it is going to be difficult for those young people to search out options once they are hit with the reduction.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 seek to implement an important part of the government's budget. These measures reflect the fairness and responsibility of the government in the budget as demonstrated by the overwhelming public support for the budget measures. These budget initiatives follow a number of key objectives of the government&mdash;keeping necessary commitments to the poor and needy, asking people with their own resources <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7381"> to rely more on those resources rather than seeking assistance from fellow citizens and taxpayers, introducing greater simplicity in our very complex social security system, treating those in like circumstances in a consistent manner, and stopping rorts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 budget continues the proud coalition history of social policy. In this budget, we have provided extra assistance to around two million families, including sole parents, through the billion dollar family tax initiative; we have, for the first time, set aside money in the budget forward estimates so that we can keep our commitment to maintain pension payments at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings; and we have listened to the welfare sector and sought to introduce some of their suggestions for reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what the opposition has claimed, the government has largely kept its commitments to the poor and needy. Major concerns were expressed by ACOSS before the budget about possible budget cuts; none of those have been introduced by this government. This is a caring government for the poor. We accept that there are a number of measures we may have preferred not to introduce if we had been in the situation of inheriting a balanced budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we all know that the previous Labor government, of which Senator Faulkner was a senior cabinet minister, misled the Australian people before the last election. We had a need to pay off that Beazley bankcard. The social security recipients have been treated very fairly in this process, while we have had to make much more substantial cuts in other portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last five years of the Labor government, social security outlays grew by 35 per cent in real terms. The social security budget measures in total will reduce social security outlays by less than one per cent. This compares with the reduction in social security of three per cent by the Labor government in 1987 on that rare occasion when they were reducing government expenditure. These measures put in place our election commitments to provide extra assistance for carers, enhance voluntary work for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the unemployed, tighten the activity test for the unemployed and broaden the eligibility criteria for the widows allowance for those widowed, divorced or separated after the age of 40.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also many fair measures in these bills which were announced by the government in the budget. These include taking greater account of the leave payments received by people leaving a job and the savings that they have before they can access social security payments. Redundancy payments are not affected by these provisions. People will also be able to use their savings to pay off debts without disadvantage. The proposed compensation arrangements are fair. Age pensioners receiving delayed settlements should have these taken into account in working out their payment. They will be treated fairly according to the individual circumstances of economic loss which they are compensated for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed change in the devisor, away from $564.60 to the single pension cut&hyphen;out point of around $400, will introduce a devisor which is closer to the earnings of the average Australian worker receiving compensation. This is fair. The activity test tightening measures will fulfil our election pledge to tighten up arrangements in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to have activity test arrangements which are respected by and, more importantly, complied with by the unemployed. This is essential to having a system of unemployment payments respected by the public at large and by the taxpayer who funds the payments. Opposition parties sometimes forget about the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A critical element of the activity test system is penalties for non-compliance which act as a sufficient deterrent while at the same time being reasonable and simple. Unemployed people and DSS staff find it very difficult to understand the very complex system of penalties introduced by Labor several years ago. Labor should recognise that that mess they introduced needs changing&mdash;with sensible changes, as we are proposing. We have listened to the welfare rights campaigners, as they have acknowledged, so as to introduce a payment reduction rather than a complete <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7382"> loss of payment as at present for administrative breaches, which comprise 50 per cent of all breaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to activity test penalties, we are proposing to standardise the first activity breach at six weeks for all, which is the same as the current breach period which Labor imposed on long-term unemployed. We have then constrained the second and subsequent breach at 13 weeks rather than the non-limited compounding arrangement recently put in place by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point, I will address the proposed second reading amendment from the Labor Party. I presume that they agree with the government that some tightening of the activity test provisions is warranted. It is quite different from what you put forward to the Australian people in the last election and even from comments from the shadow minister over recent months. If this does represent a recognition that the government was right all along in pointing out existing deficiencies with the activity test, I recognise your belated conversion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community should be aware that the previous Labor government never provided labour market assistance for all long-term unemployed or other disadvantaged jobseekers. They cannot use this as an excuse for the complex system of activity test penalties which they put in place. Further, they just do not have the courage to admit the failures of their very rigid system of assistance with low job success rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition is continuing to provide substantial labour market program and training assistance to the unemployed with greater regard to achieving job outcomes for the unemployed rather than simply recycling them through programs, as many people who have been unemployed will testify. We reject the Labor Party approach to link activity test requirements to the overall funding of labour market program assistance. It is a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also recognised the need to be compassionate about activity testing for those who face extreme difficulties in the labour market. We will be relaxing the activity test for those very disadvantaged people unable to participate in labour market assistance. People <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> generally need to meet the activity test because they are receiving taxpayer funds in the  form of unemployment payments&mdash;no more, no less. This is what the Australian people and the vast majority of unemployed themselves accept, and it is what the government is seeking to introduce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has taken a fair and reasonable approach to the activity testing provisions, with staff of the Department of Social Security having significant discretion to ensure that it is implemented fairly and with existing review and appeal mechanisms in place as added protection. These provisions do not require unemployed people to negotiate changes to the occupational health and safety conditions or training for the prospective job. They are simply required to raise the issue with the prospective employer and seek to come to a suitable resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed abolition of the earnings credit, employment entry payments and education entry payments for allowees only still leaves social security recipients with significant work force incentives through the income test, particularly as a consequence of the July 1995 changes for allowance recipients. The $500 payment advance arrangements and assistance for new job starters available from the CES still enables social security recipients to meet equivalent employment and education entry costs, which they may face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party also needs to face up to the fact that, despite their extensive efforts to publicise these measures, the take&hyphen;up is very low and the intended impact on work force incentives has not eventuated. Where measures are not working, we believe it is appropriate to consider alternatives. These are already available in other forms, as I have explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes proposed for widows and partners are sensible, compassionate and would lead to a significant simplification of existing income support provisions for older women who face considerable difficulties getting a job. This also implements our election commitment to provide access to the widow allowance for those widowed, separated or divorced after age 40.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7383">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have sought to implement changes to the disability support payment impairment tables, picking up the results of the process of change started by Labor when they were in government. The previous Labor government recognised that there were some problems with the impairment tables which they introduced in 1991. In this bill we have merely sought to introduce the expert advice provided to the Labor government on the tables which they had not yet implemented before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would caution the Senate about trying to go back to the pre-1991 arrangements, where disability payments were provided to many people who did not have medical impairments. The Labor Party was correct to move down that track. The changes in this bill simply propose some necessary refinements following the experience and some identified problems over the last five years, which the Labor government was moving to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another measure which the government recognises as necessary is the proposed changes to debt recovery. At the moment DSS can recover overpayments in a number of circumstances, such as when people lose qualification, when people are pre-paid and when their income estimate is wrong. In these and other circumstances there may be no fault or blame on the part of the customer in terms of informing the DSS, and the debt is still recoverable according to their capacity to repay. We are seeking to extend this principle to all overpayments, with the recovery process still dependent on the capacity of the individual to repay the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such a change would increase the accountability of the Department of Social Security, as now they would be required for the first time to keep track of and report on all of these overpayments which are currently not recoverable. The reporting requirements would provide substantial incentive for the department to reduce these overpayments year by year, aside from the additional resources it costs DSS to raise and recover overpayments as opposed to getting the decision right in the first place. The government is willing to consider placing a reasonable time limit on the department to raise these debts.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned before, this bill includes measures which asked those with access to substantial financial resources to look after themselves. Key among this is the very sensible proposal to remove the means test exemption on superannuation assets in the social security means test for those who can access superannuation from age 55. This seeks to overturn a recent loophole introduced by Labor only in 1993, and treats superannuation like any other financial asset. This is reasonable in view of the tax favoured nature of superannuation compared to other financial assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those with small superannuation savings, such as the $38,000 often touted by the Labor Party and referred to again by Senator Sherry earlier, will not be affected. Those with larger superannuation assets will not have to eat into their superannuation capital sum, but are being asked to use some of the income growth to support themselves. Those who cannot legitimately access the superannuation assets are protected from these provisions. The change to rent assistance proposed for sharers is a response to the ridiculous situation at the moment whereby two single people sharing accommodation can currently receive nearly $30 a fortnight more in rent assistance than a couple in the same accommodation. Can the opposition parties explain how that is fair? I do not think that they have succeeded today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After these changes suggested by the government, two single people sharing accommodation can still receive $30 a fortnight more in rent assistance than a couple in the same accommodation. I was wrong before: two single people sharing accommodation currently receive nearly $80 a fortnight more in rent assistance than a couple in the same accommodation. With the way rent assistance is structured, many young people will not be affected by this measure because they are paying lower rent contributions and not receiving the maximum level of rent assistance, which is possible at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, these bills represent a fair and balanced approach to Australia's very complex social security system. It provides greater <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7384"> fairness and treats people in the same circumstances in a like manner.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating in the second reading the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 and the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996 cognately. That is the first problem that we in the opposition have, because the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) has an arcane title. It does not convey anything to anybody, but it contains the very important measures of the collapsing of the tax incentive for research and development from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. It also contains the measures announced in a joint statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 23 July last that syndication&mdash;a way in which companies can group together and claim a tax advantage for research and development&mdash;is to be terminated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are matters of major national importance. These are matters that have occupied the business pages and the general reporting pages of most newspapers in the months since the announcement. There are matters of high controversy here. Industry hotly contest with the government the basis for chopping the 150 per cent to 125 per cent and certainly hotly contest the issues of removing syndication as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report upon which the government's decision is allegedly based is a report which, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7385"> I would contend, is flawed and is not a report that actually finds what the government claims it finds. In a press release of the joint ministers dated 23 July, the government attached four examples in which they alleged the tax system was being abused under syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the evidence that was adduced before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which inquired into this legislation, we had a whole raft of Australian companies that came along and together claimed to represent about 93 to 94 per cent of companies who had applications for syndication before the Industry Research and Development Board. All of them said that the four examples the government had offered were not typical, did not resemble any of those that the companies had lodged&mdash;and they had lodged 94 per cent of them&mdash;would not have been approved under the IR&amp;D guidelines that were tightened by the former government in the innovation statement on 6 December last year and, therefore, would not apply currently; that is, the examples were fraudulent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge, for its part, the government has stuck by the examples. But someone here is not telling the truth. The voice of industry is so overwhelmingly compelling on this that it does raise the question: why, if the government wants to encourage research and development&mdash;as it alleges it does, although that allegation would be laughable in the face of the measures in this bill&mdash;would the government want to throw out the baby with the bathwater on syndication? Why wouldn't it, if it felt there were some abuse of the system, deal with that abuse and let the overwhelming number of very good cases that promote Australian industry go ahead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has not answered that question adequately in any way, shape or form. It is simply after the tax gain; it is not interested in the type of advantage Australian industry can get by good research and development, which will create intelligent jobs in this country, which will enable Australian industry to be more competitive internationally, which will enable us to grow our exports by manufactured goods and services and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> redress the problems of the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues are so important and so compelling that they ought not be buried in a bill which deals with five other measures. We in the opposition want to vote against the government on this. But&mdash;because of the way in which tax bill No. 3 is presented&mdash;to do so, we would have to vote against the whole six measures proposed by the government in this bill. I contend that this is a fraudulent way of presenting this legislation to the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I foreshadow now that at the end of my remarks I will move an amendment to the second reading. If the amendment is carried, one of the effects will be to enable the Senate to vote on the research and development components of tax bill No. 3 on their own rather than as part of an omnibus bill. One of the other effects of this will be to propose a series of steps in which syndication can be tightened so that the objective of the syndication scheme is realised. Therefore, further abuse, if any, can then be hived off and prevented so that this measure can perform its intended role and not simply be abolished. I intend to move that amendment at the end of my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, this is a complicated set of bills. tax bill No. 3 has six separate measures&mdash;all of which are important. We are opposing three of them, and we are supporting three of them. But there is another bill that we are debating here today too, and that is the research and development bill. This is a bill that has been hanging around for a long time. It is a bill that, just over a year ago when I was on the other side of the chamber and the responsible minister, I proposed to enact in this parliament because it dealt with one of the abuses of research and development; it dealt with the grave digging abuse. We in the opposition support the principle of this bill entirely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the evidence before the Senate committee revealed, however, is that there is a significant problem here that needs to be addressed. That significant problem is that, given the tortuous way in which companies apply for concessions under the research and development bill, they need to lodge an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7386"> application and have that application processed by the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism for it to be registered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 December 1995, when the changes to the grave digging elements of this bill were announced, there was a backlog of companies that had lodged applications but had not been registered, and they had not been registered for no fault of their own. They had not been registered because of the unavailability of sufficient staff within the department to deal with the applications that had accumulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This came out clearly in evidence before the inquiry. I understand this is a matter that the government itself proposes to redress as a consequence of the inquiry. I commend the government for moving its position to accommodate the reasonable concerns of industry here. We do not think they move far enough. I will have an amendment on that when we come to the committee stage. It will take the change the whole way and not just seven&hyphen;eighths of the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two other elements of this bill that need to be mentioned before I return in my substantive remarks to research and development. The first one is the amendment to the cooperative companies section of the bill. This is an amendment which cuts out an advantage that cooperative companies in this nation have had for 36 years. Cooperative companies have had that advantage because, for 36 years, the governments in Australia have wanted to encourage the cooperative movement to acquire its capital goods and make investments in a way in which they can be encouraged to develop and flourish. The cooperative companies in Australia are, I think, unique. They are something that governments of all colours and hues have supported over the last 36 years. But, alas, the Howard government will not. The Howard government proposes to close down this tax concession on the basis that the very small amounts of money it will save go to the so&hyphen;called bottom line argument for the budget, but without particular regard&mdash;and certainly without any investigation&mdash;of what the real effects on cooperatives will be. I think this is outrageous. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cooperative movement, which is mainly rural based cooperatives based on farmers, is outraged about it. I will not speak at great length on this matter now because I know my colleague Senator Sherry and my other colleagues in this debate will speak at considerable length on it. But what I want to say is that the cooperative movement represents the small end of business. These are small business people banding together to create a cooperative company in order to establish a market advantage for themselves in contradistinction to the big end of town. This is now virtually the only sector of the food industry in Australia that is Australian owned&mdash;and here is the government quashing them. We will be moving to reverse the government's intention in the bill on that</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, before I go back to research and development, there is the mining rights issue. The mining rights issue is very important to my state of Western Australia because it applies primarily, but not exclusively, to goldmining. It is when small prospectors find gold or another designated mineral and wish to then develop their lease and on&hyphen;sell that lease to a company which can mine it. They make their income by doing so. This is a provision that was inquired into in 1985 by the Gutman inquiry, and was required to stand. The now government, then opposition, voted with us in government to support that measure. It is interesting that they are now voting to remove that measure&mdash;something that they said they would not do they are now about to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I understand the arguments on this issue. I think that all income in one form or another should be properly taxed, but there is a major issue here of retrospectivity. This is a major issue of retrospectivity which is complex and difficult to understand at first blush. This is because, in a way, it is retrospectivity that is dealt with prospectively. That sounds like a contradiction in terms. But one has to understand how the system works to understand that those people who currently hold mining leases or did so on budget night did so on the understanding that, when they did on&hyphen;sell them, they would not be taxed. We will be moving an amendment which will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7387"> protect their rights. Anyone who has acquired or pegged a lease from budget night will have done so in the full knowledge that the government intended to close off that loophole and that, therefore, they should take their chances. There are 4,000 registered prospectors in Western Australia, 400 of whom are active at any one time. Those prospectors are not entitled to be dealt with retrospectively as the government intends. I know that my colleagues will speak further on this measure, in particular my colleague Senator Mark Bishop who is also from the state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now have left to me something like eight minutes to address the very complex issue of research and development. That is a joke. The reason why it is a joke is that the government has bracketed these bills to prevent, I think, a full discussion, although I must say there has been quite an extensive Senate inquiry. I therefore commend for the record the findings of that inquiry, particularly the minority report of the Australian Democrat representative on that inquiry, Senator Andrew Murray&mdash;I thought he found in quite an important way in that inquiry&mdash;but, more particularly, if I might say so, because I think our report goes further, the minority report of Senator Sherry and myself. That contains a very long discussion of these issues. Our minority report is 22 pages. It deals at length with all these matters in detail. Let me try to summarise them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction of the tax incentive of 150 per cent to 125 per cent should not pass; it should not pass in the national interest. What the government is doing here in syndication is applying a narrow cost&hyphen;cutting approach in taking a nominal saving which, if you take a whole of budget view, is in fact in all probability a nominal loss to the budget as well as a nominal loss to the economy of Australia. I say that with as much passion and force that I can summon for this reason: an index of a nation's future prosperity is the amount of private sector investment in research and development. It is axiomatic. Companies that commit to high levels of research and development are historically companies which succeed in the globalised competitive market of the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a laggard in this respect. On the most recent OECD figures, in the table on business expenditure on research and development, known as BERD, Australia ranks around 17th or 19th out of 24 OECD economies. We are down there with Turkey and Portugal and a few economies like that. That is not Australia's natural place in the world. The Labor government provided particular incentives&mdash;the 150 per cent incentive being the key one&mdash;to encourage Australian corporations and firms to spend more on research and development to become, therefore, more internationally competitive and to win in the international marketplace. What does this government do? Just as those companies are developing a research and development culture which is beginning to pay dividends for this nation&mdash;there is a whole raft of highly complex but very illuminating submissions here on the type of research and development that is going on in this nation&mdash;just as they are beginning to turn on to this, the Australian government chops them back and says that the incentives that it is providing will be competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those incentives are not competitive. In any case, if we are competitive, we would be competitive with the most successful economies in the OECD bloc, and we are not. We need to actually provide a better incentive in order to lift ourselves up to their level of investment in research and development. Might I also add that by chopping the 150 per cent to 125 per cent, the government explicitly, openly and blatantly breaks its own election commitments. Before the election, Minister Moore and Treasurer Costello made it clear to Australian industry that 150 per cent was to remain. It was a solemn core promise. What we found on budget night was that it was an expendable, disposable promise and it is now to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the literature on research and development points to the significance of investment in research and development and the future health of the economy. Might I say that the government obviously has a more immediate, narrow, cost cutting view than the importance of the economy overall, and that is what has happened here. Important measures for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7388"> industry have been overridden in the pursuit of savings dollars, which are counterproductive in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to syndication, because I think this is the most blatantly fraudulent myth that the government wishes to perpetrate on Australians. As I have said, in July, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism announced pre&hyphen;emptively the termination of the syndication scheme. They did so on a report from the BIE&mdash;what they claim to be the BIE. In fact, if you look more closely, they were wrong. They were misleading. It was not the BIE; it was the department, with someone seconded from the BIE to help with that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That report is a theoretical model which does not go to what new evidence would have accumulated given the tightening of the guidelines on syndication that the previous government introduced on 6 December. There is insufficient time to get anything like a population of reasonable examples to know how that tightening would have operated. What we see in this so-called report is a theoretical modelling based on a series of assumptions rather than a case analysis of what actually is the case. The document on which this is based is flawed. As I said in my earlier remarks, no-one in industry recognises the samples that have been put forward to justify this change as so&hyphen;called rorting of the tax system by syndication. The ministers have put them forward in their press release, and they stand condemned on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am convinced that there is always a need to be vigilant when you provide a tax mechanism like this, because those with disposable income and desire for tax avoidance will always find ways around regulations once they are proclaimed. So you have to keep a watching brief on these things and change the guidelines as ways of subverting the intention of the guidelines are found. That is not a criticism of those who are currently before us. Surveying the type of R&amp;D that they want to do, I think they are all respectable companies and I think that those that have been listed on the A list have an entitlement to have their syndicates considered by the research and development board. These are companies who <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were in full expectation of that before they were cut off at the pass by the statement of the ministers on 23 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The syndication scheme has worked well. It is a cost&hyphen;plus scheme for Australia overall. It is not a cost&hyphen;negative scheme. In my motion, I have set down where further tightening can occur in order to keep this scheme focused on its objective and to prevent tax avoidance. I ask the government to not throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Accept these suggestions for further tightening, allow the scheme to go on and allow the nation to harvest the opportunities that are there on research and development.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.28 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on these two bills before us. It is the view of the  Australian Democrats that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 is a fundamentally anti&hyphen;business bill, a fundamentally anti&hyphen;intellectual bill and a fundamentally anti&hyphen;competi <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7390"> tive bill. It goes against all the principles required to produce a clever country with high and ecologically sustainable living standards, and it will reduce our environmental capabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats will throw a lifeline to the Liberal and National Party senators and the House of Representatives members on this tax bill. I am well aware that this bill does not enjoy full support in the ranks of the coalition. The cabinet of the coalition is presiding over the worst conceived, most destructive, most short-sighted anti&hyphen;business package of cuts and changes possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many senators and members are as appalled as I am by this package. You, the government, have deserted the small country businesses. You have deserted the dusty, hard&hyphen;living prospectors. You have deserted the dynamic rural cooperatives, and you have deserted the productive farmers who are their members. You have deserted the clever university and institutional researchers. You have deserted the innovators and technologists of small business. You have deserted the competitive and hardy medium size businesses of Australia. You have deserted those big Australians who take on the world companies on their own terms. You have done so because you have cobbled together a hasty package of bills whose sole purpose is to look at the revenue side of your ledger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill has been repeatedly and devastatingly criticised by virtually every commentator, policy analyst and industry association that comes readily to mind. As with other industry bills that have been put before us, the evidence is conclusive that the broader impacts of these changes and budget cuts on productive R&amp;D, on industrial innovation and technological advancement, on the business sectors affected, on economic growth and directions, on environmental protection, or on Australia's overall international and domestic competitiveness have not been adequately evaluated by this government. That is why I refer to you having deserted what is supposed to be your own constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As stated in my November 1996 minority report on the Bounty Legislation Amendment <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bill 1996, the budget debates, the estimates process and Senate debates and questions all have combined to show that the government's principal motivation for the substantial cuts it sought in industry and export assistance programs has been to generate revenue savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, with this bill it is evident that the government, the Treasury and the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism have not undertaken&mdash;nor have they been directed to do so&mdash;appropriate and current cost benefit analysis, or sensitivity analysis or modelling, to assess the quantifiable impacts on jobs, investment, growth and competitiveness resulting from the specific policy changes it proposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under questioning by me during Senate estimates, a senior departmental official admitted not only that they were unable to confirm what the effect of winding down the 150 per cent tax concession to 125 per cent would be but also that it would be three years before the effects of these changes could properly be assessed. This means that, if the effects are profoundly negative, long lasting and detrimental&mdash;as numerous witnesses and industry representatives have claimed&mdash;important opportunities would be missed before remedial action can be taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats question the wisdom of taking on faith a radical leap&mdash;and it is a radical leap&mdash;into new business policy, new tax policy and new R&amp;D policy. How can we justify blindly trusting the judgment of those who hastily cobbled together a policy package whose sole and overriding objective is revenue and cost driven?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats support a credible, responsible and timely budget deficit reduction strategy. I would remind government senators that last year they voted against a deficit reduction package that we put forward. We believe, however, that the government's assumptions overstate the speed and the extent of deficit reduction required. While Treasury forecasts of the size of the budget deficit are important and useful tools for underpinning policy objectives, it is important to recognise that it is impossible for them to be absolutely accurate&mdash;and they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7391"> could be substantially inaccurate. We all in this chamber know it, and they know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this reason, it is particularly important that cuts which undermine jobs, profits, industrial development and competitiveness be treated with real caution. When evaluating industry programs, it is most unwise to solely focus on just one side of the ledger&mdash;on cost and revenue savings&mdash;without focusing on the effects on jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness and without focusing on the revenue&hyphen;positive benefits that such programs are capable of generating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The combination of a new and inexperienced government&mdash;I do not say that with any slander; it is just a fact&mdash;and the triumph of opportunistic ideological elements within the government and Treasury has been unhappy for business, industry, universities and R&amp;D programs. The government has failed to give due consideration to the fundamental importance of maintaining a stable policy environment for business planning and investment and for university and institutional research. The government has failed to recognise the fundamental importance of maintaining confidence in the certainty and durability of Australia's policy mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of deep regret that, in the defence of some questionable decisions, some ministers&mdash;including within this chamber&mdash;have chosen the pejorative, unjustified and demonising route of referring to industry and export assistance programs as `business welfare' and `rorts' and the like. Such an approach does no justice to the serious policy concerns that need to be addressed and represents a disservice to Australia's reputation for objectivity and considered policy debate in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has been widely criticised for the series of short&hyphen;sighted and damaging anti-business decisions it has undertaken since gaining office&mdash;for example, the imposition of a three&hyphen;per cent tax on imported business inputs, the abolition of the development import finance facility, cuts to business R&amp;D programs, cuts to export assistance programs and cuts to labour market programs, such as the new enterprise incentive scheme. Of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course, you have introduced new schemes, such as START, which are to be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also been strongly and rightly criticised for lacking an industry policy which provides a vision, plan, direction or aspiration for Australian industry, both domestically and internationally. The sole policy aim of the government has been to find cuts to existing programs rather than to genuinely seek to invigorate or enhance existing policies and programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another area of criticism, which you are starting to react to, relates to Australia trying to lead its competitors on tariff reductions and free trade. Unilaterally adopting a leadership role versus our competitors, and thereby reducing Australian competitiveness, can be very harmful to specific industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise to the Senate in advance. We have had a short time, as you all know, in which to produce our amendments to this bill. We will be circulating them in the committee stage. The amendments will go to the substantive issues, which include the 150 per cent to 125 per cent R&amp;D tax deduction, syndication provisions and the retrospectivity question. They will go to the co&hyphen;ops issue, the mining prospectors issue and a number of technical and other substantive issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with the 150 per cent issue. In slashing this tax concession to 125 per cent, the government shows that it has lost sight of the central role of research and development in creating and fostering internationally competitive industries. The 150 per cent tax reduction concession for eligible research and development expenditure was established in 1986 and has actually deteriorated in terms of its applicability, due to changes in the company tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This concession is without doubt one of the major contributors to Australia's research and development successes and growth. I would suggest that, within the OECD and within the tiger economies, continued application of strong R&amp;D effort is absolutely essential if we are to not see a future scenario of Australia's gentle decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of independent and thorough economic studies have singled out this 150 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7392"> per cent concession as one of the key factors responsible for the dramatic growth in business expenditure on R&amp;D which has occurred over the past decade. I was speaking to a senator earlier today and he said, `Oh, but it is going to cost the government such a lot of money if this does not go through.' I tell you: it will cost a lot more money if it does go through, and I would urge you to reconsider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the strong efforts of some firms in industrial sectors, Australia's overall private sector R&amp;D performance remains by international standards very low and can be described in some ways as appalling, because we have one of the lowest ratios of business expenditure on R&amp;D to GDP in the OECD. I would say to you, as someone with considerable international experience: that is a waste of the outstanding intellectual capital we have in this country. Even our growth rates in business input to R&amp;D, which until recently were relatively high, have dwindled and are now mediocre in comparison with our international competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government responds, led by a set of people who I do not think understand this field, by reducing the 150 per cent tax concession to a top rate of 125 per cent. It may be in their terms a good way of getting headline figures about ensuring short-term budget savings, but we do not believe this is a means of ensuring genuine, lasting, long-term economic development. We expect that the coalition will be in power for two terms and we think they will rue this policy if they allow it to go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government really wants Australian industry to prosper, if it is serious about making Australia a key centre for research and development in the Asia-Pacific region, then it will need to rethink its approach and not walk away from its commitments. If you pursue these kinds of policies, you will find your ability to pursue a second term much harder than it would otherwise be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill passes, it will simply ensure that ever increasing quantities of Australia's already inadequate investment in R&amp;D head offshore. Critics do not want to listen, Treasury do not want to listen and industry people do not want to listen. I do not know what <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> experience they have of business and management in the wide world, but I have a great deal and this is a wrong policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that this tax concession is very generous compared with other international measures. This criticism is not well founded. In an extremely competitive world environment, it is probable that Australia needs to increase and not decrease its business R&amp;D incentives. The level of industry R&amp;D in Australia has to be recognised as below the OECD average, and it has to be lifted up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats accept the evidence provided by industry and research specialists that the reduction in the value of the concession will cause a harmful reduction in R&amp;D to the detriment of Australia's future economic growth, environmental protection, competitive strength and export performance and that it will encourage Australian R&amp;D to move offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> carried a report on 13 November 1996 claiming that the Productivity Commission in unpublished statistics concluded that the decision to reduce the 150 per cent tax concession to 125 per cent will encourage less research and development. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eighteen per cent of R&amp;D activity and 12 per cent of R&amp;D by foreign&hyphen;owned companies, had been induced by the 150 per cent tax concession. But the 125 per cent concession would induce only 10 per cent of R&amp;D by Australian firms, and 8 per cent of foreign&hyphen;sponsored R&amp;D investment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a significant reduction of between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. Moreover, the report stated that the commission also found it is mostly smaller firms which were influenced by the concession. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One quarter of firms with fewer than 20 employees undertook R&amp;D on the basis of a 150 per cent tax concession, falling to 20 per cent for a 125 per cent tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7393"> I now turn to the matter of syndication. Syndication has been subject to a particularly nasty form of demonising by ministers of this government. I, too, have had people whispering in my ear about the rorts, but I have to rely on credible evidence. No credible evidence whatsoever has been provided in any parliamentary or public forum for the exist ence of rorts in approved R&amp;D syndication schemes. Where previously there was some inefficient or inappropriate approval of syndication applications, the tightening of eligibility and screening criteria in December 1995 was effective in providing for tighter processing of applications, and that has been acknowledged by both the department and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real question is whether syndication is the most appropriate and efficient method of promoting R&amp;D. That question has not, in my view, been adequately answered, either in evidence before the committee or in other forums. The government has made a case that syndication does not always produce optimal or cost effective results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite obvious misgivings I have been expressing as to the government's motives and conclusions, the Australian Democrats will support the government on the abolition of syndication. But we would not have done so were it not for the government's introduction of the innovative new START scheme. However, you should recognise that we will not support you in abolishing syndication without a guarantee, which we would seek from the other side during the debate, that START will continue and without adequate provisions to eliminate unfair retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other areas which I will not go to in any length now, because I appreciate that this debate time is limited and I want to give my other Senate colleagues an opportunity to speak. We will be dealing with cooperative companies. We will be opposing your intention to remove section 120(1)(c). We will also be dealing with the matter of the mineral and prospectors' provision, 23PA. We will support you in that venture, but with an amendment to cater for unfair and retrospective conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope&mdash;I think many in the government benches might hope also&mdash;that you will reconsider on some of these areas during the debate. I dearly wish that we will be able to defeat you, particularly on the measure affecting the 150 per cent tax concession.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (No. 3) 1996 is an omnibus bill of nine separate amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. I do not propose to speak on each and every item but I wish particularly to focus my remarks on cooperatives; namely, the repeal of section 120(1)(c) of the tax act which would deny cooperatives one of their few effective sources of funds to enable capital expansion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I do so, I would like to make a few short comments on one other provision in the bill. The new provision that provides for an income tax rebate for low income earners is welcomed and supported by the opposition. The only point I wish to make here is the increase in costs employers will incur in having to vary their payroll systems to cater for the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not raise this as a criticism of the initiative but when this increase is added to the costs employers will face in keeping a record of the background of employees who qualify for the family tax initiative, as well as the increased costs that employers will face from the administration of the new $1.5 billion superannuation tax, one must wonder when all of the coalition's rhetoric about reducing paperwork faced by small business will in fact become a reality. From this series of government initiatives it appears the government is more intent on increasing the paperwork burden than decreasing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made some comments in this area, I now want to address the removal of section 120(1)(c) of the tax act and the effect this will have on the many thousands of cooperatives&mdash;I was surprised it is over 2,500 cooperatives&mdash;which mainly operate in rural and regional Australia. This section of the act dates back to 1930 when it was introduced to recognise the unique nature of cooperatives by virtue of their status of being owned by their members. As the evidence tendered to the Economics Legislation Committee demonstrated, cooperatives face disadvantages not faced by other trading enterprises in their efforts to raise capital to fund capital expansions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cooperatives are precluded from raising equity capital through public share floats. As such their only source of funds is from capital <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7394"> raised from their own members, who have limited funds, particularly in times of a rural downturn, internal funds generated by the use of section 120(1)(c) or external borrowings. Evidence tendered to the committee suggested that banks view cooperatives as an inherently riskier investment due to their unique status as a cooperative. Consequently, cooperatives have to pay a risk premium in the form of higher interest rates on external borrowings than that enjoyed by public companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This discrimination would appear to be totally unfounded and one must wonder how banks will view cooperatives in the future when assessing an application for borrowings, given that the repeal of this section will only decrease the amount of internal funds generated and therefore available for the repayment of loan borrowings. Given this scenario, I can only see banks seeking to charge a higher rate of interest to compensate them for the increased risk due to the decrease in available cashflow that cooperatives will have to repay external loans if this section of the bill is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It interesting to note that no supporting evidence was given to support the view that cooperatives were inherently riskier investments than other trading enterprises. Nonetheless, this would appear to be a real barrier to cooperatives securing external funds on terms as equal as other business borrowers. This highlights the importance of the continued maintenance of section 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act and how it provides one of the few avenues for cooperatives to access funds for capital expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But as is quickly becoming the hallmark of this government the repeal of the cooperatives provision is yet another bash the bush exercise by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on top of the slashing of funds to rural and regional Australia and the one-third sale of Telstra that will see higher costs for local calls and most probably restricted access to new technology for rural subscribers. I note the laugh from the other side but I believe in a few years you will live to regret these anti-bush, anti-rural and regional, measures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What would you know about it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would know about it. I was an assistant to Bob Collins when he was the parliamentary secretary to the minister for primary industries. I lived in rural and regional Australia as well. I grew up in a small country town.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is most surprising is the avid and unwavering support given by the National Party as they help the economic dries led by the Prime Minister and his Treasurer to sell out the interests of rural and regional Australia on the alter of economic rationalism. Black Jack McEwen, as he was known, must be turning in his grave as he watches the supposed leadership of the National Party sell its soul to the Liberal Party for little or no gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has become of the National Party? I always thought that a coalition implied equal standing, equal say and equal respect among the parties involved. But here we have a coalition where one partner, the National Party, has been gagged, bullied and berated to the point where it is no more than a poor cousin to the Liberal wets. The National Party struggles for relevancy and is slowly fading away to the point where it will no longer even be considered relevant unless they take a stand on the sorts of issues that we are considering in this legislation today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I therefore ask: where is the National Party?  When will the National Party stand up for their constituency and say that enough is enough?  When are they going to cease being the doormat of the Liberal Party?  When are they going to stand firm in their beliefs and stand up against the attacks on the bush and rural and regional Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill does present an opportunity for the National Party. It is their opportunity to draw a line in the sand and say no to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The National Party needs to be honest to themselves and realise they got conned on Telstra&mdash;and there is growing public evidence from National Party members about that each day&mdash;they got duped on funding to rural and regional Australia in the budget, they got done on imported chicken meat, despite their protestations prior to the last election, and they are slowly getting <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7395"> done on competition policy. Will they get done on the issue of cooperatives? I sincerely hope not. But unless they take a stand on this issue they inevitably will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to know is why it is so hard for the National Party to say, `We are going to stand up for rural and regional Australia?' I particularly say to two senators in this place, Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee: come down and stand up for rural and regional Australia, stand up for the interests of cooperatives which you tell them privately you are going to do but publicly we will wait and see what you do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suspect that they will do nothing. I hope that Senators Boswell and O'Chee have read the remarks made by their own National Party colleagues in the other place. But, if they have not, I would like to remind them and remind the Senate about the comments made by some National Party members in the other place. The member for Dawson (Mrs De&hyphen;Anne Kelly) said: The benefit of cooperatives is easily seen . . .</PARA>
<PARA>She later went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A cooperative has considerable disadvantages compared to a company. They are not in a level playing field situation.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Anthony, the son of the former Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, said that cooperatives are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . extremely important for Australia's rural constituency.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great benefit of cooperatives is that they are always run and owned by Australian businesses . . .</PARA>
<PARA>But the statement which sums up the importance of cooperatives to the National Party and the statement which I draw to their attention, in particular, Senators Boswell and O'Chee, is the statement by Mr Anthony, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third part I would like to highlight, which is part of the heart and soul of the National Party, is in relation to cooperatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Anthony, the member for Richmond, could not have put it more succinctly. `Cooperatives are part of the heart and soul of the National Party.' Yet here we have before us a bill which will drive a stake through the heart of the National Party, according to Mr Anthony; a bill designed to destroy one of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> main underpinnings of rural business enterprises in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say to Senators Boswell and O'Chee, who have been furiously trying to reassure cooperatives, particularly in Queensland, to come down and stand up for rural and regional Australia. Stand up for farmers. Stand up for what you represent. Stop being a doormat, and start saying no to the destruction of rural cooperatives in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senators Boswell and O'Chee are not convinced by their own colleagues in the other place, then I would ask them to look closely at the evidence presented by the cooperatives themselves to the Economics Legislation Committee. Let me quote from the report. The Mackay Sugar Cooperative Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the major motivation for the operation and formation of cooperatives is the desire for primary producer members to control the processing and marketing of their produce.</PARA>
<PARA>The submission then went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They should therefore continue to be taxed on the same basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Golden Circle, another Queensland company, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's principle of competitive neutrality is focused on domestic competitiveness within specific industries and ignores the fact that cooperatives compete in export markets where foreign primary producers are often subsidised and multinational companies have access to cheap finance.</PARA>
<PARA>These are two major Queensland cooperatives that have put forward the case for the retention of section 120(1)(c). The question is: are Senators Boswell and O'Chee going to support the cooperatives of Queensland and their members, or are they going to sell them out for a relatively modest total gain against the total budget of $12 million over three years? Is that what the heart and soul of the National Party is worth&mdash;a lousy $4 million a year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7396"> It is my honest belief that Senator Boswell is a man with both a heart and a soul, particularly when it comes to representing the interests of his National Party constituency. I am sure that Senator Boswell will not sell out the cooperatives of Queensland for $4 million a year. It is a shame that his colleagues in the House did, though. And I have drawn atten tion to a number of comments they made about this matter. At the end of the day they were quite happy to remain a doormat of the Liberal Party and support this attack on rural cooperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell has become a strident critic of competition policy reform and its impact on rural and regional Australia. Only recently Senator Boswell said in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not enough time has been devoted to the ramifications of Hilmer on the fortunes of small business.</PARA>
<PARA>I therefore ask: what assurances have the National Party got on the ramifications that the repeal of section 120(1)(c) will have on the future of cooperatives, which are in the main small business enterprises? My guess is they have none and that the transitional provisions in the bill are no more than a few crumbs the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has thrown the National Party in the hope that they will go away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this worked in the House because the National Party members en bloc voted for this measure, but I certainly hope that Senator Boswell will not be so easily conned. Just in case Senator Boswell has any doubts as to the motivation for the repeal of this section, I refer him to the remarks made by Mr Miles, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, when he introduced this bill in the House. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures will prevent the effective 200 per cent tax deduction which was previously available for the cost of certain assets and which provided cooperatives and government lending institutions with commercial and taxation advantages over other companies. These advantages are not justifiable and are inconsistent with competitive neutrality principles.</PARA>
<PARA>This assault on the many thousands of rural and regional cooperatives is driven by the fact that the Liberals consider section 120(1)(c) to be inconsistent with competitive neutrality principles. Once again, the economic rationalists of the Liberal Party want to deny cooperatives one of their main sources of funding, because it does not comply with the objectives of competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn specifically to Mr Miles and his comments. Mr Miles and his avid support for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this bill paid no regard for his own electorate of Braddon, in north&hyphen;west Tasmania, and in particular the expansion plans of UMT, a cooperative that employs 346 people and generated sales of $171 million in 1995-96. If Mr Miles had any concern for UMT, which is based in his electorate of Braddon, he would be aware that his government and the Australian Taxation Office are now trying to reinterpret section 120(1)(c) of the tax act, which would be to the detriment of UMT's $45 million expansion at Spreyton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Spreyton project was predicated on the interpretation of section 120(1)(c)&mdash;an interpretation which has been relied upon for the last 60 years&mdash;that cooperatives which borrow funds from a government or government instrumentality and subsequently use those funds to purchase an asset will be entitled to the full deduction under section 120(1)(c).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, through the Australian Taxation Office, is trying to reinterpret this section so that only assets purchased from a government will be eligible for the deduction. This is a blatant attempt to deny legitimate deductibility to cooperatives that have entered into contracts in good faith. I will read a letter to UMT signed by the acting assistant commissioner of the legislative services branch of the Hobart division of the Australian Taxation Office. It is pleasing to see a member of the National Party in here at last listening to these comments about cooperatives.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this interpretation is non-binding, it is also an implicit threat that the Australian Taxation Office will seek to deny tax deductibility for a loan where that loan is used for non-government asset purchases.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where is Mr Miles on this? Of course, he is 100 per cent behind the government and the Australian Taxation Office. Mr Miles is effectively attempting to deny UMT a deduction that it is legitimately entitled to and which it in good faith embarked upon on in its Spreyton development on the understanding that it would be entitled to this deduction. Mr Miles, regrettably, is inhibiting much needed investment on the north-west coast of Tasmania and in Tasmania in general. The north-west coast has one of the highest unemployment rates of any region in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable member for Braddon fully supports the Australian Taxation Office in the attempt to deny the UMT cooperative a tax break that it is legitimately entitled to. From his comments in the House, Mr Miles appears to support the Taxation Office. Mr Miles should let it be known that he should be supporting the expansion plans of UMT or any other Tasmanian cooperative. But, regrettably, the provisions of this act and the attempt to reinterpret section 120(1)(c) may scuttle these developments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will not be supporting the repeal of section 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Furthermore, the opposition will be seeking an unequivocal statement from the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp)&mdash;I hope that it is unequivocal, unlike his answers to questions in this place&mdash;that section 120(1)(c) of the Income Tax Amendment Act allows for full deductibility for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> assets purchased from both government and non-government sources and that this statement supersedes any other statement to any contrary effect. In the absence of such a statement from the Assistant Treasurer, I foreshadow on behalf of the opposition an amendment that will state explicitly that section 120(1)(c) is to be interpreted so as to apply to the purchase of both government and non-government assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I note with deep regret that there are no National Party senators speaking on this piece of legislation. I hope that it does not reflect in their vote.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Cook. Australian business must really be questioning their vote in the last election, believing that they would be voting for an environment of growth. All they have received from this government in the area of industry policy has been negative. Funding to Austrade and AusIndustry has been cut by $134 million. The computer bounty will be abandoned, while changes to syndication and tax concessions will reap no less than $2.2 billion out of industry research and development over the next four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comparison is that carefully managed government intervention under Labor through targeted programs encouraged more investment in research and development and provided essential support to new and expanding exporters. This Liberal government's policies will inhibit growth in commercial investment in research and development that Australia has enjoyed over the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7398"> Ten years ago, Australia was trailing the world in research investment. We were destined to a lower standard of living if our industrial base did not become more sophisticated. This was recognised. The Labor government sought, through a variety of assistance and incentive schemes, to turn around this nation's investment in research and development. In 1983, commercial invest ment was at 0.23 per cent of GDP. Through government intervention, it grew to 1.61 per cent in 1994-95. If that growth continued for another 10 years, it would have seen Australia move from an economy of assets to an economy of knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's policies place this development in jeopardy. All respected commentators have claimed that this government's changes to what has been described as one of our most successful industry policies will result in a stifling of the expansion and momentum that has been gained in research investment. A major plank of this policy is the 150 per cent tax concession on research and development expenditure. This government's intention to reduce that to 125 per cent constitutes nothing less than a halving of the incentive, because its value is in the percentage beyond the 100 per cent that would be available if the expenditure is written off as a normal expense. So this government has effectively halved the incentive to business to invest in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government intends to also abandon the successful syndication scheme that has brought researchers together with financial backers to produce not only some of the strategies and programs outlined by Senator Sherry but also leading edge technology which we need to take our economy into the future. As Senator Cook and Senator Sherry both outlined, the syndication scheme is the embodiment of the cooperative and an attack on the provisions can be interpreted in no other way than a fundamental handicapping of small business, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if this government recognises the value of research and development to our economy, it is taking a complete gamble that there will still be businesses willing to invest in research, regardless of the level of government incentives. I am sure there will be some, but all predictions are that many investments will just not go ahead, or they will go overseas where the incentives are far more attractive. Recent surveys of companies already investing in this area have indicated that up to a quarter of respondents would be considering moving their research overseas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the Bureau of Industry Economics, the small business sector contributed almost $500 million to Australian research and development in 1993&hyphen;94 and spending in this area by small business has had a faster average annual growth rate than expenditure by big business. Indeed, the sector expenditure on research and development trebled in the decade from 1984. If syndication becomes a scheme of the past, then many small to medium sized enterprises will cease investment in research because they cannot share the financial risk by taking on a partner. The government's alternative Start program does not offer small to medium sized enterprises any capacity to advance through research and development. It is, therefore, a bill that I believe exposes the muddled, mixed up and scatter&hyphen;gun approach by this government to fostering small business growth and expansion. It will not assist anybody in the corporate sector unless they sit at the bigger end of town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a government which publicly commits the success of the national economy on the backs of small business, their policies are quite incredible. We are not talking about small enterprises like the local corner store whose investment in research probably would not get past a bit of community market research. There are a multitude of small enterprises who are technology and research driven in their quest to be nationally and internationally competitive. The information technology sector is one quite classic example of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Information technology, I believe, will be the major industry of the future. Australia really could be at the crest of the wave of this development&mdash;I have spoken about this in this place before. Revenue to Australia from information technology grew from less than $20 billion in 1990 to over $33 billion last year. Significantly, this is also an industry centred on dynamic, small enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Capital Territory and region is home to quite a vibrant information technology industry, dominated by small operators. Nationally, it is important to remember that 95 per cent of these businesses employ fewer than 20 people. Government incentive <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7399"> schemes meant that high risk ventures for small firms would be rewarded in some way, if not in product development. This government's industry policy will not severely hamper the development of this one sector that they are relying on so heavily to create jobs, from the micro to small and medium enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister for industry's recent attempts to secure further incentives for small business is another example of this government's patronising and narrow understanding. Yet we again see Mr Costello's juggernaut of fiscal contraction flatten Mr Moore's attempt to secure cabinet support for a Commonwealth procurement scheme that was promised by the coalition prior to the last election. According to press reports, this policy would have guaranteed at least 10 per cent of the Commonwealth procurement budget for small to medium enterprises and link the procurement process with local industry development. This would have been a sound policy that would have been applauded, certainly in my own region, the Canberra region, particularly having been starved of funds, with cuts to the public sector and a lack of innovative and forward looking policy for the national capital region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This type of initiative could have alleviated some of the pain that is being felt by residents of the Australian Capital Territory and surrounding area, pain that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) publicly acknowledged yesterday. But again, the anti&hyphen;interventionist stance of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has won through and steered the government away from a policy that would have embodied sound industry development. A smart government would be encouraging the nation's intellectual capacity. This government is putting it to sleep.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes&mdash;with the leading agrarian socialist not here to defend the cause of rural and regional Australia. Under those circumstances, with the absence of Senator Boswell, I will set down the path of doing so. What we have here&mdash;as I said yesterday in a question to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp)&mdash;is a mean spirited affair where the government is whisking away minimal amounts of money from cooperatives which are the heart and the backbone of places such as Queensland and other states in Australia. Rural people are being exposed to the ravages of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at what has brought this on one will see that it is the paranoia of the government to have a level playing field mentality in everything. Quite contrary to what I was told yesterday, there was no consultation in the process&mdash;and I will come to that later on. This is clearly borne out in the submissions that I will refer to later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is interesting to note that the amendment to section 120(1)(c) will affect some 17 major cooperatives throughout Queensland&mdash;including Golden Circle, Tully Sugar, Proserpine Sugar, Dairy Farmers Cooperative, Isis Sugar, Mossman Sugar, Dairyfields, Suncoast, Gold Macadamias, Darling Downs Bacon, Capilano Honey and so on. As one can see, the list covers rural and regional organisations in Queensland that will be hit by the changes to this very section. Of course, there are similar organisations in other parts of Australia that will also be hit by the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Senator Sherry traversed a lot of the area before. I basically want to focus on the Queensland situation. It is interesting to note that these cooperatives are unique in their structures. They are invariably and totally owned by primary producers. The profit is turned back into the enterprise and also back into the community. It is not profit which is going into corporate profits, which will find its way into the pockets of those already well heeled or overseas; it is going back into the regional and rural communities in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7400">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to one thing in the report from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee&mdash;the suddenness of this decision by the government. At page 24, the second dot point on that page, which came from evidence deduced in the hearings, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change is abrupt, particularly in light of the long history of the concession.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes into a section of quotes. It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The government has had the company and taxation laws in place over decades which have served to entrench the legal and cultural restrictions under which we operate and promoted the present cooperative structure. Section 120(1)(c) was introduced over 65 years ago and co&hyphen;operatives have based, in part, their company structures around the availability of this section and need time to efficiently and effectively reorganise to meet any changes required.'</PARA>
<PARA>So this came abruptly and is not out of character with what this government has done. Of course, what they have done is affect their business mates&mdash;quite callously in my view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I do not want to take up a great deal of time. But I want to look at some of the problems and some of the situations in my state of Queensland. Since Australia's self-proclaimed leading agrarian socialist is not here, I will refer the Senate to a number of these submissions. It is worth while noting the submission of Capilano Honey Ltd to the Senate inquiry. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overnight and without prior warning the government signalled its intention to repeal the Section 120(1)(c) of the Tax Act with immediate effect.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for consultation! So much for going to their constituency to find out what they thought! They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has failed to take into account the forward planning of businesses including present contractual commitments to both banks and suppliers. It has failed to realise the impossibility of changing a corporate structure overnight in order to access equity by other means.</PARA>
<PARA>The government will counter that by saying that there are transitional provisions. They, by my reckoning, do not go anywhere near far enough. The Capilano Honey submission goes on: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our present plans of $7.5 million investment expenditure will reduce to approximately $4.5 million over a three year period.</PARA>
<PARA>This is as a result of these changes and shows the nature of these organisations. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capilano Honey Limited is a co-operative with more than 90% of its shareholders as beekeeper/suppliers. It is a medium sized business of $50 million turnover, of which half is export business.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not just domestic business that is being affected by this government's decision; we are dealing with export business as well. The submission further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in the top 500 of Australia's private companies. It has around 100 direct employees and supports the beekeeping (apiarist) industry which employs many more.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we turn to Golden Circle. Golden Circle, in its submission to the same inquiry, noted that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is a grower owned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>again grower owned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unlisted public company which has operated the largest fruit and vegetable cannery in Australia since 1947. Employment at the Northgate operation varies from 750 to 1700 depending upon seasonal requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 750 shareholders are predominantly located in regional areas of south east Queensland, and as the only significant processor of pineapple in Australia, Golden Circle accounts for over 80% of total pineapple output.</PARA>
<PARA>These people have been completely deserted by the National Party. We then go on to have a look at what the Mossman Central Sugar Mill from North Queensland says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of Section 120(1)(c) will mean a deferral of part of our program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, their program of expansion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of our structure traditional capital raising alternatives are not feasible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deferral will affect the Mill, cane growers, work force and others in the district.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Section 120(1)(c) concession results in cost savings which become income which is distributed as cane bonuses to cane growers who pay tax at a higher rate than the Mill does on retained earnings.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So there is more of the constituency of the National Party left absolutely high and dry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to the submission of the ISIS Central Sugar Mill. Again, its submission is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7401"> an interesting indictment of this government. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 120(1)(c) has been in place for over 60 years. ISIS Mill's forward planning and forward commitments assumed its retention. There has been no consultation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on its repeal and I question the bureaucrats' and Government's understanding of the issues. The potential damage to ICIS Central Sugar Mill and the Australian economy by its repeal far outweighs the projected benefits contained in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, it is mean-spirited. We are looking at $2 million in the first year, $4 million in the second year and $6 million in the third year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, it is worth looking at the Co&hyphen;operative Federation of Queensland. This organisation represents cooperative organisations. It is worth looking at what they had to say in their submission to the same inquiry. They said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I want to conclude by saying that, by removing the tax deduction, the government is significantly hampering the capacity for regional cooperatives to expand, value add and create jobs. The measure amounts to a new tax, in effect, on debt for primary production cooperatives. This is another kick in the teeth for regional Australia and National Party members who have stood by and allowed it to happen. As a result of the meas ure, many cooperatives, which are 100 per cent Australian owned, will have little option but to accept takeover offers from multinational companies which they have until now resisted. Australian jobs, investment in regional communities and export potential will all head offshore.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 is an omnibus bill. Like most omnibus bills, it has good measures and bad. There are several measures that we are happy to support and others we oppose. There are a number of amendments to this bill which have our support. On balance, we cannot support this bill. For the sake of several measures we consider important, including some of the tightening on research and development, I hope it can be amended in such a way as we can support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can support the tax rebate for low income people, the rebatable annuities and several of the research and development measures. We are happy with the changes to infrastructure borrowing and the changes to cover tax exempt entities which become taxable. We are opposed to the change to the research and development deduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. We are opposed to the elimination of research syndication. We are opposed to the changes to cooperatives and the changes to the medical rebate. We are not happy with the treatment of prospectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will try to cover the major issues in this bill now and our basic stance on some of the amendments in the hope that this will speed treatment in the committee stage. The area that has attracted by far the greatest attention is the treatment of research and development. I regret that the government did not heed the recommendation to cover this contentious and involved issue in a separate bill. I think it would have allowed the other measures to be dealt with far more easily and quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7402"> Before I go into this contentious area, I note that Senator Brown has circulated an amend ment to ask for a report on which companies receive research and development benefits, how much, for what and under which provisions. Such information would have proved useful at an earlier stage and could prove invaluable in the future. I will be interested to see the comments from the government in relation to this, but it certainly highlights a problem, which is that the  Commonwealth is basically generating an expenditure through loss of revenue from a program specifically targeting commercial industry. Such a thing should be considered an expenditure and be as accountable as, for example, the diesel fuel rebate. We can get information on the rebate&mdash;who gets it and to what extent&mdash;but we cannot get similar exact information in relation to research and development programs. As a consequence, we get Treasury and the ministry coming to us and saying, `This is a rort; we can't tell you who, but it's happening.' Given the government's record on using hypothetical examples, I think we still have cause for suspicion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the 150 per cent rebate, we have a number of problems with the 150 per cent research and development measures. What needs to happen is targeting rather than simply cutting the rate as a budgetary measure. They did not have the backbone to make the diesel fuel rebate cuts. We would rather see this tightened than the rate cut while maintaining the same loopholes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will support the opposition amendments on this. We will support the second reading amendment intended to demonstrate how the scheme could be tightened up. The answer to stop a scheme from being abused is not to making the abuse less expensive through decreasing the benefit; it is to tighten the definitions of eligibility for the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also support the opposition's committee stage amendment to oppose changing this scheme from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. Research and development is important. The government uses the rhetoric of the clever country when it suits it. Senator Alston did so yesterday in relation to an amendment to the Telstra sale bill. It was an amendment to end the exemption of commercial companies from state and territory law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 150 per cent tax deduction is intended for use by companies that are doing their own research and development and are making enough income in their primary activity that a tax concession has meaning. Research and development is a real expense and a deduction is really effective only when there is income to offset it. If there are problems, such as companies buying other companies for their losses and tax credits in relation to R&amp;D so that they gain a tax benefit without actually doing any R&amp;D, they should be addressed directly. Changing the rate of the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent does not address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I understand that the syndication provision was intended to provide venture capital for R&amp;D in smaller start&hyphen;up companies. Venture capital is always a difficult thing to obtain. Various means have been tried. For several years, the government went into the business of picking winners and providing grants to those businesses with ideas that the government believed had high commercial promise and, later, had high commercial promise and an export orientation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is not particularly good at picking what applications in industries will be successful. It is a tricky thing. Simply having a good idea or even a good product is not always enough. Venture capital is risk capital and a lot of these risks bear little fruit. The thing with venture capital is, where an investment does bear fruit, it might bear very good fruit in terms of successful businesses which involve a high level of value adding and substantially add to the breadth and depth of the economy as well as to the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said that governments are not good at picking winners, but never is the private sector necessarily. However, both may be reasonably good at picking potential winners. The problem with venture capital is that, whenever the economic bean counters look at an entity, public or private, that provides venture capital, they come to the inevitable conclusion that such investment is risky. The result is almost always to eliminate venture capital or to try to make it a no-lose proposition by increasing its cost.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7403">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An example is the now dead managed investment companies, or MICs, which got government support to provide venture capital. After a while, the conservative accounting principle took over and most of the investment funding was put, if I recall correctly, into land speculation&mdash;not exactly what was meant by `venture capital'. Another example of a venture capital scheme was the Perth Stock Exchange's second board. This was also heavily abused and used speculatively on a principle similar to junk bonds with far less scrutiny over the quality of projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The syndication scheme gives an incentive to private sector companies to support research and development where the results of that research and development are not of direct productive benefit to the investors. This is almost the definition of a private sector venture capital scheme. Certainly, many of the people doing the research and development are doing projects that appear worth while. They fit the definition of potential winners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Partners must register with the research and development board. It is not a case of simply making a tax claim. There is obviously scope for scrutiny over whether an R&amp;D project is actually doing research and development. If the scope for abuse is too broad, it can be tightened. We would support such tightening and, indeed, will do so in respect of several areas such as the feedstock provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Venture capital schemes to provide investment from the private sector are worth while. They are important to a clever country. If the government wants to change the way it supports the provision of venture capital, it should put forward its proposal legislatively rather than simply asking us to scrap what we have. I know the government wants to shift to a system of government grants and a kind of second board, but I would like to see details before I would be willing to axe the current system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now move to part 6 of schedule 1 dealing with cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives&mdash;defined as those whose primary business relates to the acquisition of animals or commodities&mdash;are currently given some special deductions in relation to income used in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> repayment of loans from government. These loans are provided to carry on its business or to acquire an asset. The special deduction is on top of the normal business deductions for expenses, which include the purchase of assets necessary for that business. This is, therefore, a double deduction in relation to such expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basis of the original policy is a recognition of the fact that agri&hyphen;pastoral cooperatives usually have a harder time getting funding from regular financial institutions and pay higher interest rates as they are at higher risk of default. I also think that there was some recognition that frequently the only way small farmers can effectively get a fair price in a market is to pool their products and sell them as a unit. To do so does not create massive advantages to small farmers, nor does it eliminate the risks and difficulties involved in farming. It just puts smaller farmers on a level with the larger and sometimes corporately owned farms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of reasons for supporting cooperatives. A small farmer has difficulty getting the same level of discount on agricultural inputs available to large farms. Larger buyers, such as supermarket chains, will often overlook small producers as not worth the trouble, preferring to deal with someone capable of providing produce at a higher volume. Cooperatives allow smaller farmers to act collectively like a big farm. Cooperatives in supporting smaller farmers generally assure that a lot more money goes into the local economy. Money made by cooperative members is generally spent locally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Support of cooperatives is certainly in line with the Greens (WA) policies for support of more decentralised regional development, higher levels of self&hyphen;reliance, and small and medium sized locally owned businesses. That goes along with our ideas in terms of agri&hyphen;forestry and the ability to work that into better value adding in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course some cooperatives engage in activities the Greens have problems with. For instance, cooperatives for growing cotton may use large quantities of pesticide and build weirs and dams that cause negative environmental effects. One could say the same of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7404"> examples of some small business or some large businesses&mdash;this is not the way to deal with these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many farmers are, of course, concerned about land care. This is often specifically the case for many small family farms. One of the things that works most strongly against small farmers is the onerous nature of debt, which is perhaps the greatest single cause of unsustainable agricultural practice. Where it is a choice of trying to wring every dollar from the land to service a loan or farming sustainably and losing the farm, most farmers will farm intensively, even when they would rather not and know it is not in their long-term interest. For this reason alone, we would do what we could to support cooperatives, which improve profits and specifically those measures in relation to the repayment of loans. We do not propose to punish all cooperatives simply because some farmers may farm unsustainably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also note that recently the Taxation Office has been trying on a new interpretation of the act&mdash;to read 120(1)(c) as if the treatment were an `or'&mdash;to try to end the double deductions. Senator Sherry has amendments to clarify that the interpretation used so far&mdash;that is, that a double deduction applies&mdash;is the intended one. We will support Senator Sherry's amendments in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to medical rebates, we have an amendment to oppose the changes to medical rebates. Currently, cumulative annual qualifying medical expenses which are above $1,000 attract a rebate. Qualifying expenses are those above expenses covered by Medicare. So if a treatment costs $200, and Medicare will pay $190 of that, the qualifying expense for the rebate is only $10. Given that Medicare covers much of most expenses, one needs to be getting considerable levels of treatment before one qualifies for the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government now wants to increase the cumulative level before qualifying for a rebate to $1,500. This seems to be another cynical revenue earner, especially since government is also limiting increases in Medicare payments for medical services, which will push doctors away from bulk-billing and into partial fees above the Medicare component. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The partial fees approach has the additional disadvantage that patients must pay up-front and then go to the Medicare office to get a partial refund. Bulk-billing allows the doctor to directly bill Medicare, and the patient does not have to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole process simply makes medical treatment more expensive. As with tertiary education, we are increasingly going to a system where free universal services are being replaced with increasing levels of partial user-pays&mdash;a base coverage topped up with fees. This disadvantages the poorest while assuring that those better off get a substantial subsidy for their expenses. As fee components of cost increase, the income level for which a service is accessible increases. Ultimately, as with the current HECS regime, we start seeing a system of partial subsidy for a service that only the middle and upper income earners can easily afford and where the poorest are often entirely excluded. This should not be allowed to occur with health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In relation to prospectors, we will support the Democrat amendments. This would recognise the retrospective aspects of this measure. I will speak more on this during the committee stage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendments are measures we support and believe address our concerns on research and development. I will leave further discussion to the committee stage, except to say that there is a very important role for the Senate to play in this regard. I hope that all senators are looking at how they can improve the bill. That is the role of the Senate. It is not being obstructive; it is enabling a bill which has some good measures to go through with those measures intact to allow the community concerns to be addressed. I certainly hope that happens with the support of all senators looking carefully at their responsibilities in this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few brief remarks in respect of the sale of mining rights provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 and the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1996. I will then make a few comments on the titanium industry as it affects my state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7405">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my home state of Western Australia, the issue of mining, particularly in relation to the gold sector, is of substantial importance. I must initially state that changes to the current taxation arrangements for the gold sector do not surprise me, considering recent comments by the Western Australian Premier, Mr Court, that he would be happy to look at the issue of a gold tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons for the change here, though, are somewhat incomprehensible. The main thrust of the argument is that the law regarding exemption was relevant to the 1940s and the 1950s, when minimal reserves were not considered adequate and there was a need to provide incentive for small prospectors to search for these particular minerals, as identified in the report. Apparently, the government now considers the level of mineral reserves in Australia to be adequate and, therefore, there is no need for the tax exemption as an incentive any longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This argument ignores two fundamental points. Firstly, the mining industry is just as ever an integral and essential part of the Australian economy. We as a nation cannot take this sector for granted. History illustrates that taking it for granted results in the low level of reserves that were the reason the tax exemption was introduced in the first place. Secondly, this change has the potential to destroy or, if not destroy, harm many communities and mining sectors in Western Australia. In Western Australia there are mining towns full of small prospectors and leaseholders, searching for minerals which can then be mined by major companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will mean a number of consequences for small prospectors. They will be at a disadvantage when compared with big mining companies. The small prospectors will be taxed under the proposals for selling the mining rights, but the mining companies will not be able to claim a deduction for buying those rights. In the area of gold, most discoveries are made by small prospectors. The figures suggest that it is something in the order of over 95 per cent. These prospectors and their eventual success keep towns like Kalgoorlie and the eastern goldfields alive. These people should be encouraged rather <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than have their livelihood taken away from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report by the committee also highlights several transitional problems. The changes are retrospective and will have the impact of placing upon small prospectors large tax bills for income accrued over a period of time through the increased value of a lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's responses are a few tax deductions. However, when compared to the new tax on income received from selling mining rights, any tax concessions will now be wiped out. Overall, many of the changes in the bill are supportable. However, that particular issue I have mentioned today and those mentioned by my colleagues will do much to destroy investment in our industries, research to improve our competitiveness, and incentive for small investors and prospectors to continue adding to the economy through mineral exploration. These changes will have both a national effect and a local effect in areas like regional Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I turn to some correspondence I have received from the Australian titanium minerals industry. I presume it was received by other senators in this place. I normally would not have much regard for such a submission because they are usually self&hyphen;seeking. However, I was caught by the comments in this document to the effect that, during the past 10 years, Australia's titanium minerals industry has grown to be a $1.2 billion a year export earner on the strength of the extensive investment in downstream processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The investment has depended heavily on technology advances in processing titanium minerals to synthetic rutile and titanium dioxide pigment. Some of the research which that industry has engaged in is: improved efficiencies in synthetic rutile production, enhancement of synthetic rutile products, processing and reuse of synthetic rutile waste, energy efficiency and recycling in titanium dioxide production, reduction of titanium dioxide solid waste, reuse of titanium dioxide waste, and new extraction and process technology for waste zircon. All this work has had a major impact on the competitive position of the Australian titanium minerals <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7406"> industry. In fact, some of that research will be critical to the industry's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, they make three comments which are particularly pertinent and should be put on the record. Firstly, they say that the proposed tax allowance cut from 150 per cent to 125 per cent effectively reduces the level of government support for individual projects by 50 per cent. It is pertinent to point out that most of the industry's projects have qualified for tax exemptions in the past or would be expected to qualify in the future. Removing government support for research will lead inevitably to the shelving or cancellation of sections of this work. It is worth noting also that some of the programs most at risk are those aimed at improving environmental management. Because these projects may not contribute to the industry's bottom line, they will be harder to justify from a commercial viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second complaint that should be placed on the record is the classification of some essential research investment as capital expenditure, ruling out any form of deductibility other than depreciation. This change is potentially crippling to research programs based on pilot plans or test facilities. The third complaint that needs to be addressed is that the new definitions of research possibly eliminate much of the work undertaken by mining and mineral processing companies. Their complaint is that the apparent emphasis in their report on experimental activities and high level risk does not favour the practical research and development programs needed for successful mineral processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is useful to place those complaints on the record as they are affected by the government's proposals to amend the R&amp;D concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. In the interest of time, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly I must point out that there are many aspects of this Bill which are supportable. By and large they will tighten up the processes and encourage more scrutiny in our industry policy. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However there are some significant proposals that will be disastrous for Australian industry and the mining sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly from the outset it must be understood that this Bill is not what it should be about. As far as the Government is concerned it is a revenue raising Bill rather than a Bill dealing with research and development and our nation's industry policy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill by the Government affects industry policy in this country through the main avenue of research and development. It also has harmful impact on the cooperative company provisions and the sale of mining rights provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these areas will be affected by this Bill and will have a resulting impact on industry policy in Australia and our level of company investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government Bill is reflective of a broader Government approach to policy since it has taken Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard government views the Research and Development incentives as a simple tax measure which can be reduced to help with what the government perceives as an outlay problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course this is typical of what is wrong with industry policy in Australia today. Rather than a tax measure the R&amp;D tax rebate is an essential tool in industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ignore this point, as the Government has done, is to place a lesser rating on industry policy and deter investment in Australia instead encouraging valuable investment dollars to be spent overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of reasons the Government puts forward for the slashing of the R&amp;D concession. None of them are based on a strategic view of industry policy, instead they are a result of the Government believing its own press in relation to Government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of the reasons for the need for the cut is that there has been an increasing usage of the concession, particularly by syndications. Rather than seeing this as companies investing in Australia and improving its efficiency and production through R&amp;D, the Government sees it as a burden on its own fiscal position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears unable to realise that the result of current work which results in R&amp;D support will create greater opportunities for investment and jobs in Australia, far offsetting any outlays initially by the tax concession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to accept from the Government for example that the tiger nations of Asia have a much lower rate for R&amp;D and therefore this is justification enough, we must be sure to examine fully how their system works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Malaysia for example, while it is true that the R&amp;D concession is much lower than Australia, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7407"> even with a shift to 125% rather than 150%, it is also true that it is part of a comprehensive industry policy, designed and targeted to have impact on certain areas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal by this Government is not part of an overall industry plan. Rather it is a taxation measure designed to reduce Government outputs without any real thought or focus on its impact on industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this change will be evident in the planning of industry in this country. Rather than current investors developing new initiatives here, they will now look to other nations which more actively and in a greater targeted way, increase research and development and the industry production spin offs which stem from that</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shows a lack of understanding in international industry policy to say that because these other nations have a reduced R&amp;D tax concession, this is reason enough for Australia to do the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather though than just being based in poor theory there are also other structural problems with the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example the issues of syndications, co-operatives and mining rights are all controversial and have resulted in much national attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This highlights a need to ensure that the issues are examined fully in the national interest rather than just being rammed through in the one Bill. Failure to do will result in supported measures being rejected with the aforementioned parts thus interfering with tax reform in areas where there is no disagreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this were the only example of Government failure in industry policy it may be passed off as inexperience. However when one remembers the fiasco with the Ships and Book Bounty's, we see a pattern of no commitment to industry and a large comment to revenue raising by this Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now look at the impact of the changes in relation to each issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly they are in blatant contrast to the election commitments of the Coalition. In the election documents they stated that they would,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Maintain support for R&amp;D through me 150% tax concession. We will re&hyphen;examine the impact of proposed changes to the definition of eligible R&amp;D to the operation of the tax concession as an effective incentive for innovation."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a clear indication that the Coalition promised to maintain the 150% R&amp;D tax concession There is also no mention of change to the rules affecting syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Majority Report of the committee argues that a 125% tax concession is a more effective level that 150%. In the same breath it admits that the reduction of 25% will result in less R&amp;D. The two <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arguments can only be compatible if one accepts the premise of the Government's argument that a more effective R&amp;D rate is one which results in less Government outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However it does nothing for the effectiveness of industry policy and future investment. This is supported by the Industry Commission which heard all the arguments on why the R&amp;D rate should be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After its hearing it rejected the arguments and itself argued for the retention of the 150% level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These points I have just mentioned provide argument for the Opposition view that the Government has no mandate for these changes. There have been either no alternate views put forward since the Industry Commission to discredit these views and clear indication by the Government that they would keep the 150% level are reasons that they have no mandate to change the 150% level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Cook has previously used as a very good example of the<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> effect of the changes, the case of Intact Tasmania. The result of the change on a company which has 30% of the world market in the held of aluminium speed ferry's will be to increase their costs by some 20%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my own state of Western Australia Ship Building companies are now receiving a double whammy by this Government. They are</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">being attacked through changes to the Ships Bounty and now they are being attacked through the R&amp;D changes. Austel Ships which operates out of Fremantle must be wondering what it ever did to John Howard to deserve this kind of treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, in regard to the tax concession, it is worth making further note of the comments by Associate Professor Chris Peterson who is a past member of the Industry Research and Development board and chairman of the Tax Concession Committee on the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He argued that the significance of the concession is two fold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly it plays a role in the strategic planning of our industries. The concession and its size is something which must now be factored into their thinking, whereas in the past these decisions were made by line managers on a case by case basis rather than with a strategic view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly the R&amp;D concession contributes more to the national economy than it takes out through outlays. The strategic role of Australian industry in regard to research and development will become a financial burden for individual companies rather than an opportunity for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course some of the reasons behind the changes are even further cynical. In many ways the change to R&amp;D is an excellent case study of the influence the National Party is able to exert over the Govern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7408"> ment. In response to criticism in the `West Australian' newspaper about the cut in R&amp;D assistance, the Science Minister made the following comment,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It had to be reduced to 12% in the budget to enable retention of the diesel fuel rebate."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we support the retention of the diesel fuel rebate, surely it is not something that should be used as an excuse for stopping research and development in our Industries. Unfortunate as the decision is, I accept that it was an excellent face saving exercise for the Deputy Prime Minister who was under considerable internal pressure at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now turn to Syndications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has dealt poorly with this issue generally and disgracefully with regard to the individual companies concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be naive of me to suggest that there is no one who tries to manipulate the syndication system for their own personal advantage. I am sure it goes on. However this is a problem with the checks and balances of the process rather than with the whole issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to endorse the points made by Senator Margetts. She has covered the field extremely well. The Australian Greens take the same point of view. She foreshadowed for me&mdash;and I thank her for that&mdash;the amendment to the motion that the report of the committee be adopted at the end of the day. The amendment would lead to information about the huge amount of money&mdash;currently $680 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million per annum if you do not include the so&hyphen;called gravedigging provisions&mdash;that goes to the corporate sector as a result of the research and development tax concessions. It is effectively money which is given to the corporations. It is a benefit they get that other corporations do not. It is analogous to the diesel fuel rebate. It ought to be seen as government expenditure. But I know there is very great concern in the government about the amount of money that is being spent in this way and about the way in which it is being spent. That is why this part of the legislation is before the Senate tonight. I will be moving a return to order which would provide the Senate with information about the concessions: the name of each company, its registered address, a brief description of each research activity for which a concession is given, the total cost to government revenue of the concession for each research activity, and the cost of the components of the research activity, for example, the feedstock and the core technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the Senate will support that amendment because whatever the outcome of the debate tonight, it would mean that we are much better informed when this issue comes up next time around&mdash;and it is going to. I expect we might even have the government considering whether or not it should support this amendment. I hope the government is looking closely at it. I do not know whether the government has got a crystal ball so that it knows whether this legislation will go through tonight. I think the government would be in a much stronger position to argue its case next time round if it had this information. After all, information is the currency of democracy. If we were enlightened, we would be in a much richer position to make a more democratic decision on this matter next time round.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not sure whether Senator Harradine wanted to speak or not. I understand he cannot be contacted at the moment, so I will proceed. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 delivers on two more of the government's election promises: to provide a tax rebate for low income aged <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7409"> persons, and to allow equity investments in SMEs to be taxed under the CGT provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also implements a number of 1996-97 budget announcements relating to the medical expenses rebate, the sale of mining rights, cooperatives and research and development. I understand that the opposition has a second reading amendment regarding research and development. The government will not be supporting that second reading amendment. That is not a surprise, I suspect, to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have announced a series of changes to the operation of R&amp;D provisions in July and in the budget context. I also understand that the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens have amendments that they will move. I propose to make appropriate comments on the amendments at the relevant stages of the committee process. I am not even sure, at this stage, whether we have all the amendments on hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will do a rapid stocktake but, as of three minutes ago, some amendments were still coming through. Of course, we will closely examine those amendments. Any cooperation that we can receive from senators around the chamber to make sure that we have a complete set of amendments, before we break for dinner, would be a great help so that we can order the process in a sensible way after the dinner break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of speakers got up to speak on the issue of cooperatives. The government would like them to reconsider the views that they put forward. The paragraph in the tax act is an anomaly. It allows double deductions for capital expenditures. It is not available to all cooperatives. It is not available for borrowings other than from government. The paragraph is also an anachronism introduced in 1930&mdash;and that was referred to by some of the speakers&mdash;to facilitate the transfer of government infrastructure to relevant marketing cooperatives. That purpose is not relevant today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in recognition of that that the government has announced generous transitional arrangements, Senator, designed to ensure that the cooperatives make a smooth transition to the new tax arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there may be some opposition to the increase in the medical expenses rebate. The budget announcement must be seen, I believe, as part of a package of measures made in the budget which encourages people to take out private health insurance. Both the private health insurance incentive and the Medicare surcharge are designed to encourage people to retain or take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook and other speakers spent a lot of time in their remarks talking about research and development. Let me reassure the Senate that the coalition government is maintaining a strong commitment to research and development&mdash;and that would not have been apparent, I would have to say, from the hyperbole that Senator Cook shared with the chamber. We have announced a reduction in the headline rate from 150 per cent to 125 per cent for R&amp;D and for the abolition of syndication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, many overlook that total Commonwealth government support for R&amp;D will remain in excess of $3.5 billion in 1996&hyphen;97. I have a few brief remarks on the R&amp;D premium rate reduction from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. The benefit of the R&amp;D tax concession comes mainly from the immediate or accelerated deduction of expenses, which would otherwise be allowed only over a longer period. By reducing the premium rates of deduction from the maximum of 150 per cent to a maximum of 125 per cent, this parliament will save revenue while keeping the same, or perhaps slightly greater, net economic benefits from the concession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, at 125 per cent, the overall net economic gains from the concession are more likely to add something&mdash;true&mdash;even if there are errors in the data used and even if the economic conditions vary from those assumed in the established economic model. The detailed analytic results of this modelling <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7410"> were attached to the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government announced a new support for R&amp;D, establishing the Start program. Under the Start program, the government will provide a flexible package of assistance totalling $340 million over the next four years to encourage large projects containing highly innovative or technically risky R&amp;D. That has strong support for commercialisation from the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government has maintained funding for CSIRO cooperative research centres and the technology support centre program. The election commitment to increase CSIRO's funding base by an additional $115 million over the next four years has been honoured. The government will fund CRCs at about $145 million in 1996, rising to $148 million in 1998&hyphen;99. To increase the effectiveness of R&amp;D assistance, the government is focusing that assistance towards increased outlays on R&amp;D and away from tax expenditures. I think that development received no recognition in many of the remarks which were made in the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our decision to end syndication is a sound one. Syndicated R&amp;D arrangements had become focused on tax minimisation rather than on the provision of genuine R&amp;D. Technically, syndication arrangements provided significant taxation benefits for investors but limited direct assistance to researchers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will conclude my remarks. As I was saying, the tax benefits of syndicated R&amp;D arrangements commonly exceeded the cost of R&amp;D work still to be done. The main focus of syndicated arrangements was to provide payment to researchers for R&amp;D already completed rather than for R&amp;D still to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Syndicated R&amp;D has been characterised by poor targeting. The government considers the best way to encourage genuine R&amp;D is to provide assistance directly to researchers rather than to wealthy investors. In all R&amp;D syndication, the cost to revenue is greater than the cost of any further R&amp;D work carried out by the syndicate. In this sense, there is no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `good' syndication to protect. This is no reflection on the quality of the R&amp;D projects that might seek some of the spill&hyphen;over from the large tax benefits obtained by investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be an extensive committee debate on this. Apart from the amendments to be moved by the government, at this stage I understand there are 11 groups of amendments to be moved by the other parties in the chamber. I hope that we now have all those amendments on hand so that we can conduct an ordered process in the committee stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, am opposed to part 3 of schedule 1, as are the opposition and the Australian Democrats. I want to make a point here. Under part 3 of schedule 1, the government is attempting to require people to have spent $1,500 instead of $1,000 of non&hyphen;reimbursed medical expenses before getting a 20 per cent rebate on the excess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument that the government has put forward is that since people are now getting the benefit of the $100 single health insurance rebate it is all right to cut the value of the medical expenses rebate by $100. It sounds reasonable on the face of it. But, and it is a big but, families tend to have higher medical expenses and would be hit harder. Secondly, the medical expenses rebate covers uninsured <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expense. To that extent, taxpayers have not benefited from private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health funds have been putting up premiums. Self&hyphen;insurance needs to be treated no less generously than insurance premiums to ensure that the health funds are subjected to competitive pressures not to raise their premiums. I would have thought the government would have accepted that argument and would have rejected the argument of Treasury. Indeed, the first argument goes against the government's view of supporting families. This is anti-family or discriminatory against families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A further reason is that the health insurance rebate will only be available to those in registered health funds. What about competitiveness that you are talking about all the time? Persons covered by commercial insurance arrangements&mdash;and here again is the heart of the government&mdash;including trauma benefits attached to life policies will get no benefit from the new health insurance rebate yet are denied recognition for a further $500 of medical expenses. It just does not make sense. I am using principles of the government's own policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In point of principle, all medical expenses in my view should be outright deductible in any case. Taxation is supposed to be based upon the ability to pay and a person who has to outlay money to achieve normal good health does not have the same ability to pay tax as a normal healthy taxpayer. That has been my view all along. It has also, incidentally, been my view on accumulated sick leave in respect of whether or not that ought to be cashed out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view has always been that you are either blessed with good health or you are not. In this particular case it seems to me that the principle that I have just espoused should apply. That might be too much for the government, but I do suggest to the government that it ought to have a very good look at this issue as to the question of the family, as to the question of competitiveness and as to the question of discrimination against those people who are not insured.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to make a few notes before we finish on this particular item regarding medical expenses rebate. We will be opposing this part of the bill. We find that this is one of those nasty little pseudo savings items that are tucked away in the budget. At the moment the threshold is $1,000. This schedule increases it to $1,430 for 1996&hyphen;97 and then again to $1,500. This government has prided itself on this budget calling it family friendly. I would argue that this is a long way from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the people who are going to be worst affected by this measure we see that they are largely going to be people with chronic illnesses and people with disabilities. Even if people do have private insurance, where there is chronic illness in the family the expenses build up. I call again on the government to reconsider this measure. It is a saving of $25 million, yes, but look at whose pockets it is coming out of. It is coming out of the pockets of those who can least afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not just talking about people who are in the situation where they are able to put their hand in their pocket for medical expenses. We are talking about families who fork out regularly for everything from pharmaceuticals to additional X&hyphen;rays. As you know, even if you are insured you cannot get the gap payment back between what many doctors charge and what is the official rebate. For these reasons, the Democrats oppose the increase in the threshold.</PARA></SPEECH>

That committee inquired into research and development, cooperative companies and the sale of mining rights. This was not one of the issues on which we had a hearing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have listened to the arguments from Senator Harradine, Senator Lees and Senator Cook, and the general <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> argument related to the family. I do not think one can doubt that this government is hugely committed to the family and assisting the family.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One which you might like to take note of, Senator Lees, is the huge benefit to families which is now flowing through from the interest rate cuts. They have been variously calculated. At $100,000 per average mortgage, the assistance to the family is in the order of $188 a month. That is an enormous assistance to many Australian families. The family tax initiative is another huge benefit to families. Two million families will benefit and $1 billion will be expended in that particular policy, which will be effective from 1 January next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in the generality, I do not think there can be any doubt of the huge commitment of this government to the family and to the measures which are already assisting families. In relation to the announcement that we have made on the medical rebate, the budget must be seen as part of a package of measures which encourage people to take out private health insurance. Both the private health insurance incentive and the Medicare surcharge are designed to encourage people to retain and take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rebate is being retained at the rate of 20c in the dollar. Only medical expenses net of reimbursements from health funds qualify for the rebate. The increase in the threshold is consistent with other incentives announced in the budget for people to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We understand the great sympathy and support that senators have expressed for the family. I point out that we are already delivering great benefits to families, and that should be seen in the generality of the budget. This is a measure which we feel in that context is appropriate. Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Margetts.</PARA>

That means that, while I will vote for the Democrats amendment, I will still seek leave to improve on it by moving mine at a later moment. This is a very important issue for this chamber. In particular, there are four Liberal Party senators who ought to focus on this debate very closely. They are Senator Campbell, Senator Panizza, Senator Eggleston and Senator Ellison.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government senators interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that government senators are interjecting that it is not a case of retrospectivity. For the record, I say go to the record of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing in which the prospectors association, an accountant on their behalf, and, indeed, a former Liberal Party senator in this chamber, former Senator Crichton&hyphen;Browne, gave evidence to the inquiry&mdash;and argued to the inquiry and through the inquiry to this Senate&mdash;that this is a retrospective taxing arrangement and should be chopped out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain why it is retrospective in terms of its taxation and why Senators Campbell, Panizza, Eggleston and Ellison should cross the floor on this vote&mdash;they are senators elected by the State of Western Australia to this states house to represent the interests of that state. There is no interest group in Western Australia that commands more bipartisan support, I would contend, than the small prospector association. Indeed, the mining industry depends on the activity of the small prospectors to discover mineral deposits which would not otherwise be discovered. The reasoning that the government has put up&mdash;that this was appropriate in the 1940s and 1950s but is not appropriate any longer&mdash;is specious in the extreme. Why those four Liberal Party senators should cross the floor and vote for this amendment is, quite clearly, that they represent the constituents most <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7415"> affected here. Those constituents are wanting to see from their state senators a vote of support for their industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining industry is carried on the back of prospectors. Without the type of work that these people do, you would not discover the minerals in the first place. These are small people in terms of their business interests. There is an idea that a prospector is someone who will strike it lucky and make a fortune overnight. The truth is that most of these people are very moderately rewarded. They are not excessively wealthy. They are people who work in arduous circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure was announced by the government in the budget on budget night. Up until then, the provision had stood the test of time over many years. In 1984, the Gutman inquiry came down with the recommendation that this provision stand, not be deleted. That was accepted by the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, and was then proposed to the Senate and supported by the Liberal and National parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are good reasons in income tax principles why we should not allow any person to have an income which is untaxed. But there are no good reasons, in any principles to do with taxation, that the operation of those provisions should be retrospective. It should not be retrospective for this reason. When those small guys got out there and found these deposits, pegged and registered them, they did so against the present law. They had an expectation of remuneration or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> return in the present legal terms. They improved on their leases in order to try to sell them and make a return but, for whatever reason, on budget night they did not expect that this law would change and they were caught short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only sensible way the government can introduce this principle is by grandfathering in all of the existing leaseholders. A way of doing that is by the Democrat amendment that is before the chamber. I frankly think a better way of doing it is by the amendment that I have. But I am prepared to vote for the Democrat amendment. If that fails, obviously, mine would fail. But if it succeeds, I will move mine and test to see whether we can take this the full distance. But it is a retrospective measure. This is a question of putting the Western Australian Liberal senators in this chamber on trial. Are they going to stand up for their state or are they not?</PARA></SPEECH>

The proposal in a sense is simply that we will delete part 6 of schedule 1.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Democrat spokesperson on rural Australia, I absolutely relish the opportunity to speak to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). There is a section of this bill which clearly demonstrates this government's absolute stubbornness and lack of understanding of issues affecting the rural sector. This bill seeks to knock out a 200 per cent tax deduction for eligible farming cooperatives who take out government loans for capital expansion. The revenue involved in this measure is negligible in comparison to the total revenue of about $130 billion involved <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in all of the budget measures. This is a measure of about $6 million a year maximum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assistance that this measure gives to farmer owned companies in marketing and controlling the sale of their own products is immeasurable. Anyone with any knowledge of the rural sector knows the value of the cooperative movement to country Australia except, it would seem, the Howard government. I think I am probably prepared tonight&mdash;we will see how the vote goes&mdash;to exempt at least part of that government. It remains to be seen yet whether I can make that statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of Australia's most successful rural industries are cooperatives, particularly in Queensland, where the cooperative movement is one of the proud parts of the history of the National Party in Queensland, which as a government over many years has supported rural cooperatives. That is to their great credit. For many years I have strongly supported the cooperative movement because of the great benefits it brings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of Australia's most successful rural industries are cooperatives, especially in Queensland. I will just name a couple: Mackay Sugar Co&hyphen;operative Association Ltd, Golden Circle, Capilano Honey Ltd and KR Darling Downs. If there are some Australian icons which we have seen disappear in recent years, there is certainly a Queensland icon that I do not want to see disappear&mdash;that is, Golden Circle pineapple juice. It is an absolute icon in Queensland. I am sure Senator Boswell would agree with me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax deduction which this government seeks to remove allows farming cooperatives to engage in capital expansion and to contribute to regional development projects such as dams and bridges with other proven provincial bodies. It is not much but it indicates a commitment to supporting Australian farmers over huge corporate multinationals, which would be more likely to take over small farming cooperatives without this little bit of support from the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken to many of those cooperatives. I should perhaps name a few who came to see me, including the Queensland Farmers' Federation, David Woolrych from the South <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7418"> Burnett Meat Works Co&hyphen;operative Association Ltd, Tony Wagstaff from Golden Circle, Bryan Smith from the Dairyfields Co&hyphen;operative Association Ltd, Brian Raphael from the Macadamia Processing Co&hyphen;operative Ltd, and John Cameron, the executive officer of Australian Sugar Milling Co&hyphen;operatives. There is a lot of support for this particular measure and a lot of support to stop the government from removing the support for farming cooperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this government wants to place small farmer cooperatives on the same so-called level playing field as the multinational agribusiness companies puts the lie to the claim that it cares about rural Australia. Any Australian living in a struggling country or provincial town has to be sceptical about a government that does not understand farmer cooperatives. Clearly, traditionally conservative voters are becoming sceptical, as Lex Buchanan of the Queensland Farmers' Federation said in a press statement this week. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the primary industries sector felt it had been neglected by the Coalition since it came to power in March . . . the conservative parties could not accept that they would always be the "natural" party for the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a great deal of disillusionment, where the farmers are concerned, with the Coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't predict where people will vote in the future, but that disillusionment is becoming more and more apparent.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats, however, do understand the huge value of the farmers cooperative movement in Australia. That is why we move amendments and support others in moving this amendment to restore the tax deduction and why I commend the amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, Senator Sherry in particular, Senator Hogg, Senator Lundy and Senator Bishop <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> spoke for the Labor Party in the second reading debate at some length on this tax bill. Senator Sherry dwelt at some length in his remarks on what the National Party Queensland senators&mdash;Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee&mdash;might do on this bill and called upon them to stand up for their state. I certainly hope that his call has not fallen on deaf ears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not, therefore, intend to speak at length on the merit of this, because I have set that out in some detail on pages 48, 49 and 50 of my minority report in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report. A couple of things are worth mentioning, though.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that, if this amendment goes through, expansion plans by the Golden Circle Cannery in Brisbane will be put on hold and a number of workers whose jobs are there if the expansion goes ahead would face employment difficulties. I also understand that the same is true with United Milk in Tasmania. That is the largest cooperative in the state of Tasmania. It employs over 400 people and its sales last year were $170 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is an important measure. In the evidence given to the inquiry, two things were said by the cooperatives themselves that bear repeating at this point. They said that the deduction, which the government is by this bill trying to close off, helps to compensate cooperatives for the disadvantages they face in raising capital for investment. They are not allowed to raise equity through the public share float. Their ability to raise capital for members is limited to the members, which means their ability to raise capital is limited to the fortunes of rural Australia. If rural Australia is doing it hard, their ability to raise capital is circumscribed, to a considerable extent, by virtue of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well, they said that another disadvantage of the cooperative structure is that the members do not have access to dividend imputation. Thus, the concession is not a fair advantage for cooperatives, as the government says. It acts as compensation for other disadvantages. I am aware in the majority report, the report from government members, they did not accept those submissions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7420">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether the minister might answer those two specific points that have been raised, because they are points on which a fair bit of this turns. The argument here is about a laudable form of cooperative enterprise in the area of rural cooperatives, particularly cooperatives that are marketing rural products&mdash;one of the few areas of the Australian food industry that is owned by Australians. I wonder whether the minister might comment directly on those two points raised by the cooperatives themselves.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I announced the government's reasons for this initiative in my second reading speech. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The effect of paragraph 120(1)(c) is that the marketing cooperative can claim an effective 200 per cent tax deduction for capital expenditure, full depreciation for the cost of the asset and deductions for capital repayments if the asset and the loan came from government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paragraph is an anomaly. It allows double deductions for capital expenditures. Double deductions can distort investment decisions by cooperatives as well as providing them with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. However, in recognising the important contribution, this touches on a point that Senator Cook raised. Having recognised the important contribution of cooperatives in the primary production sector, the government has announced transitional arrangements designed to ensure that cooperatives make a smooth transition to the new tax arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht got up to speak. I have to say that&mdash;and this is pretty hard to say, Senator&mdash;that was really one of your least effective contributions, even by your standards. Senator, do not tell me now, because we do not want you to take up any more time, but I wonder whether the cooperative that the senator's family sent its milk to could still use this double tax deduction. It would be interesting to see whether that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only some tax cooperatives can access the double deduction. Senator Schacht, the advice that I have is that some of the largest area cooperatives in Victoria have not qualified for this double deduction for years. So the one that you got started may well not qualify, but it has not stopped their development, as you reminded us, nor their export drive. So I put it to you that the government believes this is an important measure and urges the chamber to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to add to the general jollity and excitement of this measure, but I do want to commend the chamber to my minority report on pages 61 and 62 of the report. There was something important which emerged from the hearings. The first was the nature of the evidence from the cooperatives concerned who appeared before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee hearing. They did feel a sense of betrayal and shock. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7421"> They also indicated that it was a lesson to them to upgrade their lobbying and campaigning skills, because they had somewhat taken it for granted that the cooperative movement was not under the same kinds of rationalist pressures as the rest of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

One of my first encounters with cooperatives was in the mid&hyphen;1950s. Indeed, I spent a considerable amount of time in the mid&hyphen;1960s on committees inquiring into the role of cooperatives in the development of developing countries. Unfortunately, some of those went astray. But, in Australia, the principle which binds a lot of people together, including a lot of small farmers, is the cooperative movement. In fact, probably a number of the members of cooperatives often think of themselves as being the managing directors. They have that deep&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that sense of ownership&mdash;exactly, Senator Woodley. That sense of ownership is very important for self&hyphen;esteem and also productivity. Taxation and cooperatives come together. This is because, for the past 66 years, cooperative companies which met the strict requirements of 90 per cent of their business being done with 90 per cent or more of their shareholders were eligible for deductions for principal repayments on borrowings from a government to acquire assets used in their business. In the August budget it was announced, of course, that deductions under 120(1)c would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> removed from 7.30 on that night. This bill attempts to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Outside rural and regional Australia cooperatives are not well&hyphen;known. But they have an enormous effect on the economy of this country, particularly the economy of rural and regional Australia. Their importance is vital to the future of this country. Their major role is in Australian ownership of food processing companies and their integrated path from the primary producer to the processor, on to the domestic and international marketplace where they have played an enormous and successful part in export growth. Their massive infrastructure development plans for the future to ensure that Australian primary produce is processed for the international export market by Australian owned processors. The future plans of food processing cooperatives far exceed the plan of multinational companies which, unfortunately, now control 80 per cent of Australia's food processing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Multinational food processors make great headlines when they are to invest millions a year in their Australian food processing companies. But cooperatives are the modest unsung achievers with definite plans for at least $&half; billion of capital investment over the next five years. The necessary tool in this regard is this section which the government is seeking to excise from the tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cooperatives cover a diverse range of industries. This information is absolutely vital for consideration of this matter. I know Senator Boswell is very much involved in this. I am grateful for some of the information that he has given me on this particular matter. The cooperatives cover such diverse industries as sugar. There are not too many sugar plantations in Tasmania. I think most of them are up in Queensland. Forty two per cent of all sugar milling is done in cooperative mills. Of course, there is dairying, which is a very important industry in my state. UMT, as I think Senator Cook mentioned, is the biggest cooperative in my state. It is located largely on the north&hyphen;west coast. That is a success story in Australian primary industry. Rationalisation has resulted in a successful industry with massive export sales and a rapidly growing export market. There is the fruit <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7422"> industry with, as has been indicated, Golden Circle and Ardmona. Although there is important Australian processing ownership through meat cooperatives in the beef industry, it is increasingly being taken over by foreign countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to see advantages being given. The minister has indicated that there is double taxation. But let me say that cooperatives have not got access to capital from where multinationals get capital. Indeed, there is an imputation question; that is a very important matter. I would also like to ask the minister about the imputation that has been referred to by Senator Cook. I think Senator Cook asked the minister a question about that matter. I would be very interested to hear the response from the minister. As I understand it, franking does not apply to cooperatives&mdash;unlike companies. Franking credits that would normally go to companies go as a direct benefit to Treasury. They are calculated by accountants as literally millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be understood by all concerned that cooperatives are not like corporations. They are prevented by law from raising capital because of the restrictions on the numbers of shares members can hold. They often must keep costly inventories of their members' seasonal produce. Treasury can cook up these particular ideas, but they have lost the plot, frankly. They have lost contact with the real world if they are putting this to ministers. I believe, frankly, the committee should reject this proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there is a subsequent measure. Finally, I ask the minister one point, if he would not mind responding to this. Is it a fact that there is nothing to stop a state government and a cooperative achieving the same result&mdash;if you are successful in this area&mdash;by entering into an agreement to share gross revenues until the amount subscribed by the government is recovered? This income would be tax exempt as the state government is tax exempt, and would achieve the same result as a deduction. Is that or is that not the case? Or are you thinking of levying taxation on state governments?</PARA></SPEECH>

It is necessary only because the Australian tax office has put forward outrageous interpretations of paragraph 120(1)(c), which says that a cooperative must acquire assets from a government in order to write off a loan from the government. That is what ATO says paragraph 120(1)(c) means. But that view clearly is wrong.</PARA>

We should not have to do this but, in view of the history of this, we perhaps need to in this case. It is a shot across the bow, might I say, of those responsible for the sorts of interpretations that cooperatives have been faced with. I support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Cook.

<PARA>This amendment is in the context of what occurred this morning when the disallowance motion on the Austudy regulations was not adopted. There is an argument, I suppose, that the government made a budget decision and the Senate decided to consider a motion put forward to disallow the regulations to increase the age for independent status under Austudy from 22 to 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be argued that that was a budget measure and perhaps it should not have been overturned by a disallowance motion. However, I voted for the disallowance motion because I was of the view that the regulations increasing the age for independent status under Austudy from 22 to 25 presupposed that the parents of the student would be footing the bill. That was the government's assumption, but it is not the taxation department's assumption. The taxation department gives absolutely no recognition at all for the expenditure that is made for students who would thus have lost out their entitlement to independent Austudy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the government's therefore successful raising of the age for independent status under Austudy from 22 to 25, students between those ages and indeed between 18 and 25 are now means tested for Austudy on the basis of parental income. Given that the government expects parents to support students from the age of 18 to 25, I believe it is time to restore the student tax rebate in the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will recall, Mr Chairman, that I moved a motion at the end of the debate on the increase of HECS that there should be a recognition in the taxation system that self-education expenses by way of HECS payments should attract a tax deduction. You and I, Mr Chairman, voted for that. Unfortunately, on that occasion we were not successful in that particular effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be a statement emanating from Treasury that the amendment to restore the student tax rebate involves double dipping, but it does not. If a student does get Austudy the available dependent rebate for parents is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reduced by $1 for every $4 of income over $282 including Austudy received by students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a student were on full Austudy, the parents would have little or no entitlement to the rebate. It may be noted that the wording of the rebate provisions dates back many years, and the separate net income test goes back further. It was applied to the dependent deductions under the pre&hyphen;1970s Liberal governments. I say that quite deliberately to the government, if it is holding itself out as a family positive government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's family tax initiatives, though touted as $1,000 per child, amount to a $200 tax rebate. In any event, it is limited to children under the age of 16 and students up to 18 years of age only. So there is this area between 18 and 25&mdash;which was 22&mdash;which needs to be filled. When questioned on the issue of the family tax initiative in the Senate, the government admitted that the family tax threshold is not available for students over 18 years. The rebate for a student aged 18 to 25 is set at $1,000 and indexed to be equal, in my proposal before the chamber, to the without child level of the spouse rebate. This is considered appropriate as both classes of persons are adult dependents. They are over 18 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this proposition is a matter of clear equity. I believe that fairness should apply. It would be a proper acknowledgment of the fact that the government is saying that the parents of those students whose Austudy payments are virtually cut out or minimised can pick up the tab. That can be quite expensive, particularly in the case of families with a number of dependent children who are students. I mean students who are 18 years of age and over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to explain to honourable senators that paragraph 159HA(7)(a) is intended to omit other than the amount specified in column 3 of the table and, in subsection 159J(2) in respect of a dependent included in class 3 or 4, it deals with the indexation of the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment to subsection 159J(1A), which states `omit or class 4', is the operative provision in this amendment that restores the rebate for students aged 18 to 25 years. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7426"> Subsection 159A(1B) omits the words `where but for subsection 1A' and substitutes `where a taxpayer is or but for subsection 1A would be' and protects the higher with child spouse rebate for those with students aged 18 to 25. That is quite natural, because they are in fact adults. The amendments to subsection 159J(2) set the actual rebate at $1,000 for students aged 18 to 25 years of age. The other measures in that particular clause are self&hyphen;explanatory. So I commend to the committee the adoption of this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For those of us who are concerned about the overall impact of government legislation at the moment, there is a little saving grace in what Senator Harradine puts forward. But I cannot allow the opportunity to go past without saying that it is very disappointing to have this amendment put forward this afternoon when this morning the vote in the place was to cut children who are not in the family, who are outside very often because they have been excluded through circumstances beyond their own control, by $300 million in students incidentals allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that Senator Harradine has a constant pattern of giving some break to those people who are lucky enough to be within the family fold, as we are seeing now, and, on the other hand, of cutting out assistance from those who are unfortunate enough not to have that circumstance. I do not know what the motivation is. I do not know whether it is to subtly say that we might force them back into circumstances out of which they have come. It seems to be a very limited magnanimity towards people who are struggling to get an education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Senator Harradine voted for the government's overall cuts in education and the increase in HECS fees. The disincentive that we argued at the time involved poorer people in our community being able to go on and get a tertiary education. He gave some ameliorating amendment for those people lucky enough to be within the home as a salve to the wider wound of those cuts. Tonight we are getting a bit of the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be good for Senator Harradine to reconsider the circumstances of those people <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who are not lucky enough to be in a traditional home with the support of traditionally caring parents in what has become a very lucky circumstance and is being loaded in that direction by this sort of amendment. It  does play on the good nature of people who are trying to consider the wider community and not the narrow view that Senator Harradine has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just cannot understand why in the morning Senator Harradine would vote against a $300 allowance to school kids who do not have family backup to try to help them get back into a secondary education, go on to a tertiary education and get through against all the odds of the education stream into a career and fulfilment while in the evening he puts forward an amendment like this, which most of the good natured people on this side of the parliament will at least be attracted to support. It is inconsistent and unfair to those people who are down on their luck in our community. I fail to see the magnanimity, to put the most modest word I can on it, that is in it for those people trying to get an education who are in harder circumstances than many of us in this place might have faced in our time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will support this amendment. It is a logical extension of what we regard as the illogical decision of this government to treat intelligent 25-year-old adults still at university as children. If it is good enough for Austudy to say that a 25-year-old in the top 10 per cent of intellectual achievement is a child and a dependant, obviously the tax act should reflect it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment will give families a maximum of $19 per week in tax rebates paid to the parents, not the children, because this government views a 25-year-old adult as not capable of running their own financial affairs. That $19 per week is roughly equivalent to the basic family allowance payable to students up to the age of 18 at school and the government's new family tax payment. For consistency of policy, the government should support this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we also sought to pick up the parenting allowance as well, the payment should rise to $1,700 per year. But $1,000 has a logic to it, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7427"> so we will support it. It is well short of the $128 per week which a student would get on full Austudy. It is well short of a decent social policy that recognises that a 25-year-old adult smart enough to win a place at a university should no longer be treated like a child. But this government has chosen to put in place an illogical and discriminatory policy on Austudy. They should complete the circle by ensuring that the tax system reflects the policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is obviously some logic in this amendment if you follow the fact that this morning there was a vote related to what I call compulsory families. It made sure that students cannot get independent allowances until they are 25. I was pleased to see the pressure put on by various members of the Senate, including the Greens and the Democrats. It helped to get some change in the government's legislation. It was very unclear until this morning that that change had occurred to make sure that it did not go up to the age of 31, which was the original decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of these compulsory families, we are left with very few alternatives but to support measures such as these, which give some recognition of the cost to families who may have to support an adult student up to the age of 25 who has no means of getting independent Austudy. It is very regrettable that we need to support such an amendment. A fairer go for students would have been much better from the government.

<PARA>This is a small amendment with a large effect. It seeks to close down the infrastructure borrowing tax concession from the end of this year. While we will support the tightening measures which the government proposes in item 6, they really are tinkering around the edges of the fundamental issue. The fundamental issue is that the infrastructure borrowing tax concession is, to use the government's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7429"> terminology, a rort. It is poorly targeted, open to abuse, excessively generous and completely unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Council for Infrastructure Development told the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that there is no shortage of funds for infrastructure investment and there just are not enough projects. So why prop it up with a $200 million a year gift to the financiers and bankers who set up these finance schemes? Why indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has received three reports in the last 18 months telling them that the infrastructure borrowing tax concession is a waste of money. The Economic Planning Advisory Commission private sector infrastructure task force said that the scheme was not needed and there was no tax disincentive for investment in infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June the government's own National Commission of Audit recommended that the scheme needed to be reviewed because it did not seem to be necessary. Earlier this week the Senate superannuation committee, in a unanimous report, called on the government to review the purpose and operation of the concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a waste of money. Treasurer Costello has vowed as recently as question time today to work to stop the tax system being riddled and rorted. Well, here is one of his riddles and rorts. Let's get rid of it and let's save $200 million next financial year. I urge the Senate to support Senator Kernot's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition intends to oppose division 1, part 1 of schedule 4&mdash;one of the key features of this bill. This is the proposal that deals with the reduction of the 150 per cent tax incentive for research and development to 125 per cent. In my speech on the second reading debate I provided a great deal of detail about this amendment. I do not need to traverse that ground now. What I do need to say is that this was clearly spelt out in the government's election policy as a commitment by the then opposition, were it to be elected as government, to retain the 150 per cent tax incentive. What we have here is an explicit and blatant breach of that election undertaking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If opposition in this chamber were to be in the majority against this change that the government seeks, this chamber would be enforcing the mandate that the government sought from the electorate. There is a certain justification in that when we find that the government has claimed a mandate for a number of things in this chamber, most recently the Telstra bill, earlier the industrial relations bill, and so on. They have a mandate for 150 per cent. That is what they sought and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7430"> that is what they got, but they are now wanting to break that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I make is that Australia, in terms of the OECD nations of the world&mdash;there are 24 of them&mdash;is ranked 17th or 19th in the amount of private sector expenditure on research and development. This provision is in the act in order to encourage more research and development in Australia. Commonly, it is understood that countries with a high commitment to research and development have greater prospects for employment and economic growth in the future than countries with less commitment to research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be voting, if we voted in opposition to this government measure, to improve the economic prospects for young Australians looking for employment in intelligent and skilled work, as well as to back companies to do more R&amp;D and help grow the economy and enable it to become more competitive, given that the economy is now mostly a globalised economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the absolute cornerstones of this bill and it is one of the areas in which the Senate inquiry received a lot of submissions. Perhaps I should turn to one of them that may, Mr Temporary Chairman&mdash;interestingly, since you are in the chair&mdash;be of some interest directly to you because you are a Tasmanian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the inquiry, Incat, the Tasmanian manufacturers of fast aluminium ferries, made a quite comprehensive submission as to why they have achieved world-class manufacture in ferries, how they have stolen a march on more developed manufacturers in the world and why winning that lead and maintaining it requires them to spend a lot of money on research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Incat is a research and development intensive company. It has succeeded in growing from quite a small concern to now a very large one because of the amount of money that it spends on research and development. What did it say to the inquiry? Let me quote its very words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decrease in the taxation concession from 150% to 125% means that each dollar incurred on R&amp;D will now cost the company 55 cents where it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previously cost 46 cents. This represents a 20% increase in costs. Taking into account the eligible expenditure incurred for 1996 the nett cost to the company will rise by $72,000 to $440,000. This increase equates to the salary of one of our R&amp;D personnel and has a severe impact on future R&amp;D programs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a leading Australian company, a company that has helped penetrate the world ferry market so that now Australian fast ferries command 30 per cent of that market&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CALVERT" NAMEID="5F4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator Calvert</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Forty-three per cent.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will stand corrected. The exports of this commodity, fast ferries, is valued at half a billion dollars per annum. It is on the same level of export value as the entire wine exports from Australia is, but this industry does not receive the same international recognition for the reason that its market is entirely overseas. You do not have consumers of its product in Australia like you do of the wine industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it is the only area of complex sophisticated technology where Australia has a world marketing lead. Why do we have it? We have it because this is a company that has done the hard yards and spent funds on research and development. It says that, by making this change, its costs will increase. It will be able to do less R&amp;D than it would have done before and, under another bill due to come up next year, we know it will have a nine per cent increase in costs imposed on it by the abolition of the ships bounty. We also know that there are other changes to things on which it depends&mdash;Ausindustry, Austrade, a number of other market development grant schemes, like the EMDG scheme, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> That is one example. It is a pertinent one for this debate. This example can be replicated across industry. If Australia is to maintain a foothold in the area of pharmaceuticals and in the area of telecommunications and information technology, the fastest growing industry in the world, it has to have an R&amp;D rich investment, otherwise the majors will outrun us, they will create the technology which will dominate the market and we will have to conform our technology to their needs. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7431">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia does not hold its head up in that international technology race, then we will import foreign product from overseas and, if we do, the current account will blow sky&hyphen;high through the roof and the problems for the budget will be exacerbated beyond all belief. This is one of the few measures that you can say, in a post-protectionist society&mdash;Australia having phased down its tariffs to globalise its economy and be competitive in the world&mdash;is World Trade Organisation consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why the ferry industry is upset is that the OECD agreement, which would phase down subsidies to this industry sector worldwide, has been blocked in the US Senate. It has now been thrown out and it is unlikely to be approved by the United States, which means that the other countries in the world&mdash;the Scandinavians and the north Asians, the Japanese and Koreans&mdash;will not sign it either. So this area of ship manufacture is going to become one of intense trade conflict in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All other nations provide assistance of considerable value to their industries for research and development. We have a world lead in this particular industry. I can do nothing more than refer again to the words of Bob Clifford, the Chief Executive of Incat, when he said that his company would be put at a severe disadvantage if the R&amp;D concession was cut back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, that is a visible and better known example. There are equally convincing examples elsewhere in all other industry sectors, too. The committee was inundated with examples of fine research and development, which will now not be as likely to be conducted in Australia. Some of it will be conducted overseas. We will lose our marketing edge. I implore the Senate to vote against this measure of the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why I say Treasury is that, since this was introduced by the Labor government in the mid-1980s with the strong support of then industry minister Senator Button, it has been opposed by Treasury year in, year out.

As a result, industry was taking advantage&mdash;and as a former small business minister, I saw many small businesses starting to get the culture of innovation in this country&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You did not have to run them, Senator. You just had to visit them to find out. Over that period, Senator Ferguson, I think my staff counted that I visited over 500 small businesses around Australia. I can tell you about the Technology Industry Exporters Group, which is a group of 70-odd high-tech Australian companies. When I met their executive and visited some of their firms, they all said that they had accepted the encouragement and policy advice of the government to become exporters, to deal with our current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 150 per cent tax deduction was absolutely critical for those scores of small developing SMEs to become exporters. They could take their innovative idea, take it through the prototype, develop a commercial product and then export it. The R&amp;D tax concession was critical at 150 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course Treasury would claim that they were tax rorters. That has been the consistent advice. Tonight we have seen a number of examples of this Treasurer taking advice from the department. The attack on the cooperatives is one of the most astonishingly stupid decisions&mdash;all for a $6 million saving. Then we have the former Assistant Treasurer interjecting and saying that it was a measure of equity. No wonder we saw such dreadful measures in this budget when Treasury advised the Assistant Treasurer that that was a measure of equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also saw Mr Peter McGauran, the Minister for Science and Technology, on the public record on a couple of occasions, spilling the beans. The reason this concession had to be cut from 150 to 125 per cent to save several hundred million dollars was that it was going to pay for the fact that the government left the diesel fuel rebate untouched. He said in conversations which have been reported that that was the reason this tax concession had to be cut. It had to pay for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> political decision to preserve the diesel fuel rebate for the mining industry, the farming industry, the forestry industry and the fisheries industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what this Treasurer is about. One part of industry has to be punished to support another. There is no comprehensive industry policy, and there is no broader view about a manufacturing policy for Australia or about value adding. One of the reasons we have a current account deficit in this country is that we do not value add enough. We do not turn our intellectual capacity into high value added products. That is something that Treasury and this new Treasurer would not understand, because a city based Melbourne establishment lawyer would not know a factory, a farmer or a cooperative if it fell on top of him. That is going to be one of the great problems for this government over the years ahead, unless members of the coalition government stand him up and demand a broad industry policy that has a strategic thrust about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Cook mentioned the fast ferry export industry. When I was the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, I had responsibility for that industry for a couple of years. I have to say that it was a great pleasure to be associated with an industry developed from scratch by Australians over a 20&hyphen;year period. When you went and visited Incat's factories&mdash;whether they were in Tasmania; Henderson, which is south of Fremantle; and New South Wales&mdash;you saw an industry that had been developed. They all said that one of the things that really gave them the spurt from the mid-1980s was to be able to claim the 150 per cent tax deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook said they now export half a billion dollars worth of product. They are the best in the world. The reason: they have the best innovation, the best design, the best skill workers, the best management skills and are able to beat anyone in the world. When you go overseas, these are the ferries the rest of the world wants to buy. They are the best design at the best price, and they work very well. We lead the world. We now have that industry looking at converting that design into fast cargo ships.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7433">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would not happen with this mob in government taking away the R&amp;D. In one fell swoop in this budget, the ability to develop a fast ferry into a fast cargo ship that can take our high value added products from Australia into the expanding markets of Asia&mdash;instead of doing that in 21 to 28 days; doing it in seven days and, therefore, giving an advantage to our high quality manufacturers, whether they are in products or food processing&mdash;has gone down the drain. They cannot do it. When you put this on top of the fact that they have removed the ship bounty without waiting to see what the rest of the world would do, it is a double jeopardy to an industry that ought to be used as an example to the rest of manufacturing. It is an astonishing decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you have talked to the ship builders since this government came in, their view is very blunt. This minister, this Treasurer and this minister for industry do not care. They would make the comment that, if you were trying to get in to see the minister or the Treasurer, you would have a better chance of breaking into Fort Knox than getting a chance to speak and put the view on an industry that already employs several thousand workers. They are workers who are paid, on average, $1,000 a week for their high quality work. These are high quality, high value jobs, developed from an industry that has the innovation and the flexibility to be the best in the world. It is astonishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know every government claims they always have budget problems. But we keep knocking off the industries that are actually changing our current account deficit and have a chance to improve it. What does this new Treasurer say? He says the current account deficit in the long term is the number one problem. He has introduced in this budget decisions that are going to completely exacerbate it. I know he is a new Treasurer and that he is enthusiastic, but essentially he is naive. When all those documents came in to the Treasurer and the finance minister, the old Treasury bureaucrats had had them in the bottom drawer. They got them out and said, `Here we are, Minister.' They take off Ralph Willis's name or John Dawkins's name and give the brief. They put on Mr Costello's <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> name and say, `Here's a saving for you. Knock off the 150 per cent tax deduction for R&amp;D.' They did not tell him, of course, that they had put it up to every Labor Treasurer since 1985, when it came in, and that it had been knocked back. They had a try every year in the ERC. It was always on their savings list, as were bounties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury and the Department of Finance were against any area that provided strategic assistance in developing industry. And so it goes. We will never get a strategic industry policy in this country to get value adding into manufacturing and exports while the dead hand of Treasury is there all the time undermining it. I made a similar point in one of the recent estimates committee hearings. Senate Winston Crane said, `You made a decision about this some time ago.' I said to him, Senator Crane, you're going to have to learn pretty soon that governments come and go, but Treasury's always there giving the same advice.' That advice is to flatten any strategic plan for industry in this country. It will go on and on. I have to say that at least on many occasions our government had the wit to tell Treasury to put them back into the drawer. We said, `This is not on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that, leading up to the budget, there was a clear leak from the Treasurer's office that he was not going to put up with any more `business welfare'. That was the phrase he used. That was put out in his name. I just about fell over. A year ago Treasury was giving the same advice to the Labor government. They were saying, `We've got to close down business welfare.' When we were putting together the innovation statement, Treasury's advice was that it was all business welfare. It was as though it was some gigantic rort. We chucked that in the bin too. It is at this level that this innocent, naive city slicker Treasurer has been taken for a ride by these Treasury officials. The Treasury advice will not change. That is not their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish on a comment John Button once made to me. Of course, he had more than his fair share of battles with Treasury and Finance over industry policy. He said, `What you've got to understand, Schachtie, is that&mdash; </PARA>

Everybody now says that the western ring road in Melbourne is a major improvement to the efficiency of business.

When we got down there and met the heads of Melbourne business, all the ministers knew everybody by their first names. The officials did not know any of the heads of business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I raised this in estimates, I was told there was some sort of advisory committee&mdash;a group of people who run around and take soundings from business. Whatever soundings they take, it does not change their advice one iota. Labor and Liberal governments come and go, but the advice will always be the same. The advice you have fallen for is to knock off and reduce this concession. It is a horrible decision. If you leave it there, in the long term this country is going to pay a very big penalty. This is one of the worst long&hyphen;term decisions&mdash;if not the worst&mdash;in this budget. It is about time the Senate made sure we voted this one down.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thanks for the big interest rates! Let me tell you, Senator Schacht, that that is one of the most extraordinary contributions I have ever heard. As chairman of the legislation committee, I listened to the submissions of the people who wanted to make submissions to the committee. I never saw you there on any occasion. I doubt whether you have ever read the report that was put down, because you did not quote from the majority report at all. You may have used the little bits that suited you in the minority report. Let me tell you, Senator Schacht, that you have talked about just about everything except the things that are involved in this part of the bill and the reduction of the concession. You talked about former Senator Button. You have gone back over history for some time, and a lot of things that are quite irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there were differing points of view in the evidence in this particular inquiry. When the government decides that it wants to make some changes, the people who generally come along to give evidence are those who do not like what the government is doing. You picked up every single issue that they raised, but you did not ever listen to the other sides of the argument. There are a couple of things in the report that I think you ought to be reminded of. It is a comprehensive report. I think it is one of the best reports that the legislation committee has put out for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there is a substantial minority report. There is also another minority report from the Democrats. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important part of what the majority report of that committee had to say&mdash;and I think you need reminding&mdash;is that it accepts that the reduction in the generosity of the concession will lead to a marginal reduction in the amount of concession claiming R&amp;D. The committee notes also that the government affirms the importance of R&amp;D to economic strength and intends to compensate for this through the newstart program of direct grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important question in the design of the concession is not the absolute amount of R&amp;D in the economy but rather what is the most cost effective rate of concession in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7435"> gaining social benefits in exchange for public subsidies. Not once did you look at that and quote that in what your were saying, because this is the alternative point of view, which you have obviously taken no notice of. A subsidy, or a subsidy at a certain rate, which does not change recipients' behaviour when compared with no subsidy or some lower rate respectively, is simply a windfall gain to the recipients and not a cost effective use of public money. It is just not a cost effective use. You have chosen to totally ignore that opinion in putting your opinion before this house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as that, at the margin, giving a high subsidy to an increasing amount of increasingly less valuable R&amp;D may increase the total amount of R&amp;D but it does not increase the net social benefits. If the R&amp;D uses resources which, even after accounting for spillover benefits, could be more profitably employed elsewhere in the economy, the same applies to any activity. Statements to the effect that the R&amp;D concession is relatively generous, whether compared with other industry assistance, or by international standards, imply a judgment that the concession rate is set higher than that which is most cost effective.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some would say that this is backdoor syndication, and the government has announced its intention to end syndication. I do not believe it can be fairly characterised that way. Even if it were characterised that way, it may well be instructive for the Senate to hear what the government said about syndication prior to the election. The government's policy statement on science and technology, in reference to syndication, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guidelines may well result in the drying up of one of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund research and development.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>What they were referring to are the guidelines that the Labor government introduced in the Innovation Statement on 6 December 1995. These were guidelines aimed at cutting out any abuse of the syndication system. I believe&mdash;all the evidence that the committee received when it inquired into this consolidates this belief&mdash;that those guidelines are effective in doing so. However, the government, then the opposition, was saying that they may be too tight, that they may in fact have gone too far and that therefore syndicated research may dry up. So they were making it clear by saying that they were strongly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> supporting syndication. But that is not all they said. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Coalition is not planning specific changes to existing programs of industry support for research and development&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>we know that is hollow from their intention to abolish the computer bounty&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Coalition as an early priority will review these programs to determine whether they might be improved.</PARA>
<PARA>The way in which the government is intending to give effect to that election undertaking is to abolish the program. It can hardly be said that you are improving it by abolishing it. Nonetheless, what they are seeking to implement here tonight is the repudiation of their own electoral mandate. They say further in the same policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making that assessment the Coalition particularly will take into account the following factors . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And there is a whole range of factors, as one might imagine. One of the pertinent ones is whether the government's revised syndicated research and development scheme guidelines will be much less attractive to investors. The signal here is that they were looking to improve it rather than abolish it. And so it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing about this is that this is the industrial research and innovation policy produced by the government when it was the opposition. Who was the responsible shadow minister at the time? The responsible shadow minister was none other than the now Leader in the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. I notice that he has had the good grace to head for the door of the chamber and leave, as the perfidy that has been entered into by his government is being exposed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treatment of feedstock was one issue raised. It should be remembered that the detail of this proposed amendment is the result of consultation with industry in Melbourne in September this year. Industry indicated that they were not entirely comfortable with the changes to feedstock. However, the industry accepted that a change was required and that the treatment of the expense item was satisfactory. Increasingly, it became apparent that the manufacturing process said to be R&amp;D would claim inputs at the premium rate while the output would be assessed at only 100 per cent. The bill seeks to allow deductions for only that part of the output that is consumed in the process to receive the premium rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the pilot plant, it should be remembered that that occurred as a result of consultations with industry in September. Industry indicated that they were comfortable with the proposed changes to pilot plant. Core technology has been modified. Again, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> detail of this amendment was discussed with industry. Industry did not, I am advised, appear unhappy with the decision to modify the treatment of core technology. Core technology expenditure was found increasingly to be a vehicle for structuring finance. It would deliver a claimant company a substantial tax benefit for R&amp;D previously conducted rather than new R&amp;D. I urge the Senate to support the government's position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final part relates to the treatment of interest on debt, which has been limited to 100 per cent deductibility. Again, I am advised that industry did not appear unhappy with the decision to limit the level of concession to 100 per cent on interest expenses. Interest on debt was limited to 100 per cent to discourage the practice of funding R&amp;D entirely out of debt while using equity in other areas of the company. For example, assume you had a company with $100 of business expenditure, including R&amp;D expenditure of $20. The smart thing to do would be to fund the R&amp;D out of the debt so that the interest expense is at 125 per cent rather than the normal 100 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government rejects the amendments that the Australian Democrats have put forward. As I said, we have consulted with industry. They are well aware of the position. I have stated the advice we have received from industry in relation to each area. I urge the Senate not to support the amendments that have been moved by the Democrats.</PARA>

I have been persuaded by arguments from industry that changing the definition in the manner suggested would be counterproductive to effective and well&hyphen;understood R&amp;D activities. This would simply exclude a tremendous amount of legitimate and vitally important R&amp;D. It will exclude R&amp;D of the sort that should be encouraged and motivated. It is a measure whose sole purpose is budget savings. It is just another way the government can pull out research funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, I am concerned that by the use of the term `high level of technical risk' the government will be able to exercise a significant degree of restrictive discretion which will enable it to deny assistance to research projects on a pretty arbitrary basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose items 71 to 73 of schedule 4. These are the substantial provisions by which the government gives effect to its attempt to legislate by press release by outlawing syndication. Much has been said about this in the debate. There is a shonky report on which the government claims to justify its actions. There is a press release that industry does not recognise as being typical. Industry represented 94 per cent of all the applications that were before the IR&amp;D board. In any case, they would not have got through the tightened guidelines that we introduced in the innovation statement on 6 December last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a press release by the two ministers with four examples of the truth&mdash;which no-one other than the government recognises&mdash;of what has happened since the guidelines were tightened on 6 December. It is on that basis and on the basis of this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7445"> report that the government claims is from the BIE, but is not&mdash;we now know it is from the department, not from the scientifically based analysis of the BIE&mdash;and a report which is not about examining the evidence but is about running a few computer models to see what assumptions come out at the end, that there is an allegation of widespread rorting. There is large&hyphen;scale rebellion out there in industry that they are being totally misrepresented by the government on this. I do not have any time to develop my remarks further, but I certainly want to indicate that we believe that these items should be opposed. I oppose them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to take the same opportunity but, unfortunately, I am not quite as prepared as Senator Murray. After the tabling of the report of the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into outworking in the garment industry today, in tonight's adjournment debate I would like to update an adjournment speech I gave on 19 November reporting progress towards voluntary industry regulation to stamp out the exploitation of outworkers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since this time, Fair Wear, a national coalition of church and community groups and trade unions, has been formed to educate consumers to make ethical shopping choices, to promote retailers and manufacturers to sign <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an industry home workers code of practice, and to encourage other retailers to sign such a code. It is hoped that shoppers will be concerned about the exploitation of outworkers in the garment industry who may be working for as little as $2 an hour and that they will buy from retailers who have signed the home workers code of practice. I would like to highlight those retailers who have so far come to the party: Target, Just Jeans, Country Road, Witchery, Ken Done, Australia Post and Jacqueline Eve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fair Wear, the coalition, has been mounting demonstrations in shopping centres in the pre-Christmas shopping season to educate consumers and to encourage retailers to sign the code. This coalition is, unfortunately, bitterly disappointed that at the last moment a significant group of retailers backed away from an earlier verbal agreement to support the code of practice. These retailers include: Coles-Myer, Daimaru, Fletcher Jones and Table Eight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After helping to initiate the home workers code of practice, these retailers have now refused to sign it. Through the Australian Retailers Association, they have proposed a new code which promises complete confidentiality to retailers and manufacturers found to be in breach of award wages and which makes the industry fully self-regulatory. The coalition sees the need for external grassroots monitoring that the unions can provide. They encourage consumers not to think that a code which does not involve any external regulation would actually assist outworkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The home workers code of practice was a well thought through and workable proposal originally supported by several retailers, the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia along with several manufacturers. At this stage, the council is also not agreeing to proceed with the code. I should also indicate that there is also another group of retailers who have been unwilling to be part of any negotiations at this stage. They include: Big W, Sportsgirl, Sussan, Best and Less, and Westco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to highlight some of the community groups that have been involved with the Fair Wear coalition. These include: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7446"> the Uniting Church of Australia, the Women's Electoral Lobby, the YWCA of Melbourne, the Textiles Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia, Community Aid Abroad, the Australian National Committee on Refugee Women, Asian Women at Work, the Australia Asia Worker Links, the Sydney Forum of Religious for Justice, the Australian Forum for Justice, the Mercy Foundation, the Institute of Sisters of Mercy of Australia, the Dominican Committee for Justice and Peace, the Good Shepherd Youth and Family Service, the Missionary Sisters of Service, the Good Shepherd Provincialate, the Brigidine Social Action and Awareness Group, the Australian Catholic Social Justice Commission, the Baptist Church Social Justice Group, the Baptist Union of New South Wales, the Church and Trade Unions Committee, the New South Wales Working Women's Centre, Women's Health in Industry, the Dale Street Women's Health in Adelaide, and Women in Industry and Community Health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given a fairly broad level of community support and very general community concern about the problem of outworkers in the garment industry and given the fact that the report I tabled today was a consensual report of all senators involved in the committee suggesting that all parties involved in the garment industry&mdash;the retailers, the manufacturers, the intermediaries, the workers and the government&mdash;facilitate such a voluntary agreement, it is disappointing that we are at this stage. Tonight I urge all those parties to see if some resolution can be reached, particularly before the Senate revisits the matter within the next 12 months.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not often speak on the adjournment debate. I know it is late at night, but I think this is the first time in 10 years that I have spoken on the adjournment debate. I do want to raise a matter tonight which has been a dominant political issue in my home state for the past two years&mdash;the controversial issue of the state Liberal government handing over the management of South Australia's water supply to an overseas owned company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a deal that was brokered by Premier Olsen, the new Premier. It is a deal that has seen a massive cover up at every step of the process. It is a deal worth $1&half; billion over 15 years. Every detail of this deal has been kept secret from the people and the parliament of South Australia. It is also a deal that the public of South Australia are opposed to and about which the public has been persistently misled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to go a long way to find someone to buy South Australian water&mdash;that is what the locals say. In this case, they did. They went to Kazakhstan and to France. I turn first to the latest instalment, the latest refusal of the state Liberal government in South Australia to come clean on the embarrassing facts surrounding this ill&hyphen;advised $1&half; billion deal. This is a story of exotic deals, exotic places and exotic relationships. Who, for instance, knows that Kazakhstan is involved in this particular set of deals?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think all of these deals and relationships will be slowly revealed against the will of the Olsen government. I have been made aware of some of the information which will ultimately be made public. To me this deal leaves the 1970s loan affair somewhat for dead. It has the capacity to bring down Premier Olsen. If South Australia goes to an early election next year, it will be because Premier Olsen will be afraid of what may be revealed in subsequent months on this particular deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a grievance speech on the last sitting day of the South Australian parliament, Labor leader Mike Rann asked a number of questions. He asked whether the new Premier Olsen still had confidence in the professionalism and ethical conduct of Mr Terry Burke, the consultant paid half a million dollars for his role in the water contract. He asked whether it was true that Mr Burke&mdash;despite NCA interest and a South Australian police inquiry&mdash;had since been employed by the South Australian government, on John Olsen's instructions, to work on the MFP smart city project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Burke is an intriguing character. He has been indulged at the expense of the South Australian taxpayers. He has availed himself <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7447"> of massively expensive hotel rooms at taxpayers' expense. He is a character who celebrated the last French nuclear test at the Red Ochre restaurant in Adelaide with Bollinger champagne and then tried to make the South Australian taxpayer pay. He was not paid; he was knocked back for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rann also asked whether the Premier was confident that negotiators working for the government during the water tender did not improperly pass on information from one tenderer to another in order to influence the outcome of the process in favour of United Water. He also asked whether he had informed the then Premier Dean Brown of interest shown in this matter quite some time ago by law enforcement authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 December, John Olsen was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper denying allegations of police investigations. This is despite the existence of communications between the Commissioner of Police in South Australia and Mike Rann that confirm the existence of a South Australian police inquiry into this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we go back a little bit further, in July this year Mike Rann was contacted by a citizen of South Australia who was concerned about information she had been given on the water deal. She had informed Rann about serious allegations by a South Australian Water Corporation executive about the bidding process. These included claims that the government's lead negotiator Mr Terry Burke had been involved in unethical and improper conduct during the process. A South Australian Water executive had told her that Mr Burke had involved himself in unauthorised meetings and that he had even socialised with the United Water executives outside the confines of the designated negotiations room for the water contract. These meetings took place, it was said, in Adelaide, Sydney and even on a boat on Sydney Harbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was not just one informant. The senior business leader contacted the South Australian shadow minister for industry, Kevin Foley, with similar claims of irregularities. I have since been told that Premier Olsen and his office were informed of similar allegations at the time, but they failed to take <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the allegations to the NCA or to the police. Rann, however, advised his principal informant to take her information immediately to the NCA and to the South Australian Auditor-General. She took legal advice and she agreed eventually to give her information only to the NCA, as she wanted to provide the information only to law enforcement officers. She was most concerned about confidentiality, given the nature of the allegations, and her own safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The informant asked Mr Rann to intervene for her. He spoke to the NCA's South Australian Director, John Ganley, whom I gather spoke personally to the informant and arranged for her to be interviewed. Sometime later I am told Mr Rann phoned Ganley with additional information, including information concerning an interstate businessman who had volunteered to be interviewed by the NCA. Rann was told that&mdash;and I think he has said this as well&mdash;the investigation should be more appropriately conducted by the anti-corruption unit of the South Australian Police Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 August, Rann was asked by the NCA to prepare a letter giving it the authority to provide his confidential information to the South Australian police. Mr Rann told the NCA he was happy to speak to officers of the South Australian anti-corruption unit to expedite their inquiries, but I gather that since that time he has received no contact from the anti-corruption unit and was informed that the business leader who offered to provide information was not interviewed. I understand that just a couple of days ago Mr Rann lodged a freedom of information request to secure the detailed accounts and receipts of Mr Burke's extravagantly expensive involvement with this contract. It seems that, while the South Australian taxpayer pays, Mr Burke plays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party here and in South Australia&mdash;and I do not think it is just the Labor Party; I think it is the South Australian public as well&mdash;are starting to be more demanding of answers to this particular problem. Labor could have raised these matters in this place and also in the state parliament back in July, but I think Mike Rann did the right thing in presenting the information to the law enforcement agencies, particularly the NCA at that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7448"> particular stage. He is concerned. He is disappointed that the key people have not been interviewed, as yet, by the South Australian police. I think his request for a full investigation is one that is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is just the latest instalment of what is dragging out to be a sorry saga. Public opposition to the water contract in South Australia is so overwhelming that the Liberal government has fought in the courts all year, including this week, to prevent the public release of opinion polls on the issue. The government paid taxpayers' money to a former Greiner staffer, Ian Kortlang, to conduct the polls. Then they refused to tell the public the result. I think this is only a small example of the practices and secrecy that are the hallmarks of this deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $1&half; billion contract was awarded to a shelf company called United Water. Neither the contract nor its details have ever been made available to the public or the parliament. We know that South Australians are paying $1&half; billion, but we do not know much else. John Olsen told us that United Water would become a majority Australian&hyphen;owned concern. It is, in fact, almost wholly owned by the Compagnie Generale Des Eaux De France, CGE, and Thames Water of Britain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After an extra glass of wine, I might do it as well as you, Senator. We do not know much about the water contract, but we do know a bit about CGE. Reports of widespread corrupt practices by officials of CGE and its affiliates surfaced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  and in the international press in 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that year, Premier Olsen was asked in the South Australian parliament about the integrity of a key player in CGE. The opposition leader told parliament&mdash;and this is Mr Rann&mdash;the CGE's Chairman, Guy Dejouany, had been charged with corruption and released on bail of one million francs in what <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Times</EMPHASIS> of London described as `the most intensive corruption investigation' in France for 15 years. That was on 18 June 1995.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliament was told that some 20 senior executives of CGE's French based subsidiaries had been named in bribery cases. Olsen's response to the South Australian parliament was that the South Australian government would only sign a contract with companies of the highest integrity&mdash;you would wonder what his benchmark was. Shortly after this he announced the preferred tenderer as United Water, and then a few other facts turned up about the tender process that John Olsen did not want to surface. Do you know&mdash;and it is intriguing and quite ironic&mdash;that Dean Brown has been found guilty, convicted and executed for the offences that John Olsen has committed in South Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor discovered that, on the day that the closing bids were due&mdash;4 October 1995&mdash;United Water was given four extensions of time totalling four hours. The two unsuccessful bidders were not told of the extensions made available to their competitor. They had to get their bids in on time. The whole process was supposed to be videotaped in a secure room to prevent tampering with bids. The security tape ran out almost three hours before United Water's bid was received. It was not replaced. At the same time the contract manager left the building and did not return until after United Water's bid had been received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The auditor&hyphen;general has had concerns about the situation in South Australia. The auditor&hyphen;general's report found major flaws in the bid process. We are talking here of a process which has been immensely unpopular in South Australia. South Australians do not want their water supplies run by an overseas company. They are angry at being misled about the level of Australian ownership. They are suspicious about the whole secretive and sordid process. In closing at this particular stage, I will just reiterate the point that I made earlier. This matter will drag out. The information will be brought out over time.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7449">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to speak about wetlands. It is increasingly recognised worldwide just how important and valuable wetlands are. Although wetlands come in many different forms, including lakes, swamps and tidal flats, one feature that is common to them is the enormous biodiversity that is associated with them. Wetlands also provide many other crucial environmental services&mdash;for example, flood control and nutrient filtering. They are also major producers of food energy for the wider environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of all this biological and ecological richness, wetlands are extremely beautiful and spiritually significant places. In a continent like Australia which is largely arid or semiarid, these areas of permanent or semipermanent water feature centrally in both Aboriginal cultural and spiritual life, and also in post&hyphen;colonial literature and history. Arguably our most loved national song, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS>, is based in a wetland environment with a name&mdash;billabong&mdash;that resonates with Aboriginal poetry and cool refreshment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another feature of wetlands is the way in which they are connected across the surface of the planet through the miraculous phenomenon of migratory birds. These bird species are, and should be recognised as, international roving ambassadors for the protection of the world's environment and the world's wetlands. Australia forms a vital link in this transnational odyssey. The Japan-Australia migratory bird agreement lists some 90 species of transequatorial birds which rely on Australia for their survival. Through such instruments as the Ramsar convention and the Japan-Australia migratory bird agreement, increasing efforts are being made for international cooperation to protect the world's remaining wetlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The remaining wetlands in my home state of Western Australia are a vital part of the local, regional, national and international environment. Wetlands are found throughout Western Australia, including in the most arid desert environments. Wherever they occur they are of great importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the Environment</EMPHASIS> report published by the Environmental Protection Authority states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Across Western Australia, wetlands provide the most biologically diverse and productive habitats, contain highly specialised plant and animal communities and support complex biological, physical and chemical interactions.</PARA>
<PARA>Nine Western Australian wetlands are listed under the Ramsar convention as wetlands of international significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of tragic record that much of Western Australia's wetland heritage has been destroyed or severely degraded since European colonisation. According to the EPA report, some 70 to 80 per cent of the wetlands of the Swan Coastal Plain in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia have been destroyed or degraded since European settlement. It is even more distressing to know that, in full knowledge of how important these places are, the destruction of Western Australia's remnant wetlands continues with varying degrees of government support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give some small indication of how important Western Australia's wetlands are and how threatened they are, here are some examples: the Western Australian coastline, with its associated wetlands, is one of the six recognised major international transequatorial flyways for migratory birds. Important sections of this coastal route are at risk from pollution and development. For example, the wetlands of Roebuck Bay near Broome are in the top five migratory bird sites in the world. Despite this, they are threatened by mineral sands mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 50 of the migratory bird species listed under the Japan&hyphen;Australia migratory bird agreement are recorded from the remnant wetlands of the Peel-Harvey region in south&hyphen;west Western Australian. Important parts of this wetland system are being destroyed as I speak. Places like the Creery wetlands languish under the threat of canal housing development. The south&hyphen;west of Western Australia is particularly rich in wetlands. Even now, entirely new species and even new genera are being discovered in the south&hyphen;west wetlands, such as the newly discovered genus of frog known as the `sunset frog'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 80 per cent of the original wetlands of the south&hyphen;west have been destroyed through some combination of clearing, agriculture, mining, housing development, draining, pollution, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7450"> invasion by weeds. Although the remaining wetlands of the south&hyphen;west are of incalculable value, they continue to be sacrificed for the most base of commercial benefits or ideological motives. For example, the wetlands spread throughout the south&hyphen;west forest region are being destroyed by the direct or indirect impacts of forest management practices, including frequent prescribed burning, road construction and dieback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this, the Court government has recently&mdash;as is now a matter of record in this chamber&mdash;excised an area of wetland ecosystem from the D'Entrecasteaux National Park on the south coast for mineral sands mining. In a fitting irony, given the Japan&hyphen;Australia migratory bird agreement, the company seeking to mine this wetland is the Japanese Nissho Iwai Corporation. In the agricultural region, many surviving wetlands are under grave threat from rising watertables and salinity. Despite this, important remnant wetlands are being destroyed for commercial benefits. For example, the important Lake Chinnocup `A' class nature reserve is under threat from gypsum mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elsewhere in the state, the mining and pastoralism industries have had and are continuing to have profound destructive impacts on surviving wetlands. For example, the mining industry is operating in many places in such a way as to draw down watertables or otherwise interfere with groundwater and drainage systems, thereby disrupting the water systems of adjacent wetlands. Pastoralism is responsible for massive wetlands impacts across much of the semiarid region of Western Australia, with sheep and cattle destroying fringing vegetation and causing erosion and pollution of wetlands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recognition of the obvious value of our remaining wetlands and the very strong level of community concern and support for their protection, the coalition parties, prior to the last state election, promised `unprecedented attention to the protection of [WA's] Wetlands.' Wetland conservation was, and continues to be, a priority issue in WA, and the coalition's pre-election commitment to their protection was one of the main reasons they <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were seen then as a credible potential government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is utterly disgraceful that four years later the record shows that not only have they not acted in any comprehensive manner to protect our wetland heritage, but also the Court government has been actively engaged in the ongoing destruction of wetlands. For example, ongoing land clearing is affecting wetlands in urban and agricultural regions. Wetlands have been modified to cater for urban expansion, for example at Canning Vale and Jandakot. Wetlands throughout the metropolitan area are potentially threatened by Perth's increasing reliance on unregulated bore water usage. The Ascot Waters wetlands have been bulldozed for housing and the adjacent salt marsh conservation area has been earmarked for modification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Secret Harbour wetlands near Mandurah have been destroyed for a housing estate. Commitments on the creation of a scientific park and the protection of wetlands of Port Kennedy near Rockingham have not been honoured. The Creery Wetlands near Mandurah are a continuing risk of housing development. Some of the state's only surviving near-pristine wetlands in the Kimberley remain unprotected and/or unmanaged and are suffering increasing degradation through feral animals, grazing, fire, unmanaged recreation and tourism and mining. The Lake Chinnocup Nature Reserve is at risk from mining. Nationally recognised wetlands of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park are threatened by sand mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The draft state wetland policy, released by the then Labor government in 1992, has not been finalised or implemented despite being promised. The south-west agricultural zone wetlands environmental protection policy has not been finalised or implemented despite being promised. Many Ramsar listed wetlands have too little or no resources for their management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, unlike the coalition government, are deeply committed to the protection and fully resourced conservation management of Australia's remaining wetlands&mdash;and I say unlike the coalition government because they made promises and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7451"> they have not kept them. We are also committed to the repair of those wetlands which are capable of restoration and management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats will work at a state, national and international level, to ensure that wetlands, which form such a crucial aspect of our national wellbeing, are not further eroded.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>
