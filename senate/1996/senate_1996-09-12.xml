<TITLE>Industrial Relations</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that any reform to Australia's system of industrial relations should recognise the special needs of employees to be protected from disadvantage, exploitation and discrimination in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the petitioners oppose the Coalition policies which represent a fundamentally anti&hyphen;worker regime and we call upon the Senate to provide an effective check and balance to the Coalition's legislative program by rejecting such a program and ensuring that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The existing powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) be maintained to provide for an effective independent umpire overseeing awards and workplace bargaining processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The proposed system of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) should be subject to the same system of approval required for the approval of certified agreements (through enterprise bargaining). Specifically an AWA should not come into effect unless it is approved by the AIRC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The approval of agreements contained in the legislation should be public and open to scrutiny. There should be provision for the involvement of parties who have a material concern relating to the approval of an agreement, including unions seeking to maintain the no disadvantage guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Paid rates awards be preserved and capable of adjustment, as is currently the case in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The AIRC's powers to arbitrate and make awards must be preserved in the existing form and not be restricted to a stripped back set of minimum or core conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The legislation should encourage the processes of collective bargaining and ensure that a certified agreement within its term of operation cannot be over&hyphen;ridden by a subsequent AWA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The secondary boycott provisions should be preserved in their existing form. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The powers and responsibility of the AIRC to ensure the principle of equal pay for work of equal value should be preserved in its existing form. We oppose any attempt by the Coalition to restrict the AIRC from dealing with over&hyphen;award gender based pay equity issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) A `fair go all round' for unfair dismissal so that all workers currently able to access these remedies are able to do so in a fair manner, at no cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Workers under State industrial regulations maintain their rights to access the federal awards system in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore urge the Senate to reject the above proposed reforms to the area of industrial relations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The undersigned are extremely concerned about threats to university funding and express their support for Australian public universities and for government measures to ensure that the highest possible proportion of school leavers and adult students can have a university education.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the (Commonwealth Parliament of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House our concerns that extra tertiary places, previously announced for Queensland universities, may now be revoked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous Federal Government allocated an extra 7600 funded student places for Queensland universities over a three year period. In addition $43.8 million in capital funding was set aside for campuses and facilities in regional areas, including Ipswich, Logan, the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Wide Bay, Gladstone, Rockhampton and Cairns. However these initiatives are now in doubt following recent comments and speculation by Federal Government Ministers. Any reversal of the above decisions will severely disadvantage potential Queensland tertiary students. Our State continues to experience rapid growth and education services remain a priority need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We request the House to call on the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to guarantee that the tertiary places and facilities, previously announced for Queensland universities, be delivered.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that any further reform to the higher education sector should be undertaken in a planned, consultative manner in order to achieve clearly specified social and economic goals. We the petitioners oppose the random, ad hoc and irresponsible nature of the current threats to reduce Commonwealth funding to universities which are damaging to our international reputation as a provider of high quality tertiary education; disruptive to orderly planning and long term development for the sector, needlessly painful to staff and students attempting to work within the current environment; and devastating to our regional economy which is still recovering from drought.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, of course, his second attempt to bring her down in this way. The first instance is history. In the second instance, he being dissatisfied with the determinations in the past, he has decided to have another go on another alleged set of facts. So he gives the notice of motion; presumably, he would not do that flippantly. He presumably believes he has got a case to support the claim that he makes. I would have thought that on any reasonable assessment of natural justice, if he has got that case, he ought to bring it and the Senate should have its opportunity to make its determination, rather than simply make the allegation, put it on the public record and then seek to leave it hanging over the senator for a period of three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is totally unreasonable in any circumstances, let alone all the circumstances of the history of this matter. Therefore, what he is seeking to do should be opposed. If he wants to pursue his motion, he ought to do so and he will either win or lose. If he loses, hopefully, he might get on to something more constructive in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Returns to order are an important procedure of the Senate in terms of obtaining information, with which I am extremely familiar. As Senator Hill knows full well, I was the subject of quite a number of returns to order. Despite all the huffing and puffing, I actually do have some high regard for the institution of parliament. I also have a fundamental view&mdash;I have certainly exercised it in Senate estimates as well as with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> returns to order&mdash;that information which is fairly asked for is entitled to be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill is correct when he says that on a number of occasions the sheer omnibus nature of the demand was absurd in the actual volume of work and material that was required to produce the papers required.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the government has been entirely at fault in this.

Clearly, the government has just ignored this. They knew perfectly well that it was happening. Senator Hill has waited until now to jump up and say, `Oh, this is all too terrible.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to say that the government would be voting against this motion and I will explain our reasons very briefly. In relation to Senator Margetts's motion there are three points to be made. Firstly, the Commonwealth government has absolutely no jurisdiction over this land management decision in Western Australia. In relation to the excision of this area in D'Entrecasteaux National Park, the Western Australian government will be going through a whole environmental impact assessment process involving the Environmental Protection Authority in the instance that mining is proposed. The Commonwealth has absolutely no jurisdiction there. It is possible that, under certain circumstances in the future, the Commonwealth may be required to act. There may be processes that do trigger Commonwealth action on behalf of the Minister for the Environment. That could occur if export licences were sought, for example, and if the Australian Heritage Commission Act came into play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second important point to note is that there is multiple use of national parks across Australia. This, of course, is not unusual or specifically a Western Australian phenomenon, as most members of the Senate would know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third and final point I would like to make is that Senator Margetts's motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . calls on the Federal Government to put into practice the rhetoric that it has used in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I ask all honourable senators to understand that the government's intention is not to put into practice rhetoric. We are very keen not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to put in place the rhetoric of the National Heritage Trust Bill and its funding by the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra. We are, in fact, very keen to urgently put in place the billion dollars plus worth of programs which will make an historic difference, not only to the amount of resources that are going into environmental rehabilitation and conservation, but also, very importantly, in relation to this motion, to increase the cooperation between the two larger levels of state and federal governments which the Natural Heritage Trust Bill will ensure. It will see the biggest increase in cooperation between state and federal governments on a whole range of issues, and vegetation protection within national parks is, of course, a crucial part of that. As I say, we have not opposed formality, but we will be voting against this motion for those reasons.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I do not intend to canvass the whole issue. Obviously that would have been canvassed if there had been a full debate on the issue. I would like to say, however, that Senator Campbell has used even more so, I think, part of the argument that has been used in the past in relation to mining. He said there is no power for the Commonwealth government to intervene. I remind Senator Campbell that there are the corporations powers. I also remind Senator Campbell that the government tried to throw away the export powers&mdash;tried to toss them away&mdash;and the rest of the Senate caught them and threw them back. Basically, the government maintained those export powers and it is possible for the government to intervene via export powers and, if you like, some elements of corporate power if they so desire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a defining issue in the environment in Western Australia.

<PARA>I never thought I would be so grateful that someone objected to my motion. Very briefly, in relation to the suspension, why is this motion urgent? The D'Entrecasteaux National Park on the south coast of Western Australia is an extremely important area from both an ecological and an Aboriginal cultural perspective. I will elaborate on both of those issues if the Senate agrees to suspend standing orders and allow proper debate on this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Suffice it to say that the entire area of the national park is listed on the register of the National Estate. The matter is urgent because last week the Western Australian government passed the inappropriately named WA government reserves bill, which excises 368 hectares of fragile woodland and heath land adjacent to Lake Jasper in the D'Entrecasteaux National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for this outrageous decision is to allow Cable Sands WA Pty Ltd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Japanese company Nissho Iwai, to undertake mineral sands mining. It sounds like a great deal, does it not? We allow a foreign owned company to come and export both the mineral sands and the profit overseas and at the same time give them the green light to trash our precious natural heritage. I thought this only happened in developing countries under the guiding hand of the World Bank, but perhaps I am naive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding that, whilst this bill has passed both houses of the Western Australian parliament, the bill has not yet received royal assent. That is why it is an urgent matter to debate it. The bill is, however, due to go to the Western Australian Governor in the very near future. Consequently, I feel that this creates an opportunity for the federal government, with the support of the Senate, to intervene and urgently request <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Western Australian government not to proceed with the formality of obtaining royal assent for this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to debate this motion today in order to send a strong signal to the Western Australian government that there is strong opposition in the Senate to the idea of allowing mining in D'Entrecasteaux National Park or, for that matter, in any national park. There are options for the federal government to intervene and they should be taken now.

<PARA>We are dealing here with an issue of great interest to many people in Western Australia, and I am sure many people from other parts of Australia as well. The reason this is of interest is that the area is of such great significance as an area that is very dear to many people's hearts. The issue has a historical context. It has been debated for some years, including with the previous Labor government in Western Australia. In 1990 the Western Australian Labor government released a policy on mining in national parks, ironically called `Resolution of Conflict', which allowed exploration of D'Entrecasteaux National Park for three years from that date. There was an immediate community response with large rallies, petitions, letter writings and a sustained campaign of non-violent direct actions. These protests continued for several years and resulted in a number of arrests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This is not just removing some small part of a national park that is on the edge. There is social and spiritual significance for Aboriginal people in the area. The lake and its associated sites represent a visible link with the past. Lake Jasper, part of the park adjacent to the area which is being excised, contains a great deal of information about our pre-European past. The lake is tied to the land for which Aboriginal people feel a deep association through blood affiliations to the country and through custodial responsibility as a result of residents. The lake provides a dramatic and exciting illustration of Aborigi nal habitation of the area. It is important in its ability to provide a way to present Aboriginal culture to Australian and international visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the extent of the dispossession of the past, the tangible and dramatic evidence of Aboriginal occupation of the land that the lake provides lends it a spiritual significance as a symbol of continued and lengthy Aboriginal association with the country through the constant and dramatic changes that it undergoes. I would like to read a letter which was sent by the Manjimup Aboriginal Corporation to state Labor politicians in Western Australia. They say in summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Aboriginal traditional owners and custodians of the area:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Object to mining in the area as it has the potential to create a direct physical impact on the site itself. We feel that any physical impact to the lake would be an absolute disaster for our community, people and culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Object to mining in the vicinity of Lake Jasper because such an activity in such close proximity will take from its value and is an affront to the spirituality of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Object to the excision of the national park as the piecemeal cutting up of this area further reduces the country that we can use for cultural and community activities.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Let there be no misunderstanding&mdash;there are huge implications here. The lake is unique; it was the first and only underwater prehistoric campsite to have been discovered in Australia. The sites and inundating landscape on the floor of Lake Jasper illustrate the dynamic and changeable nature of geomorphology over a relatively short time span. The lake has a substantial peat bed, which may provide the first comprehensive record of south-western vegetation history through the sampling and analysis of the peat. There are a number of other issues concerning Aboriginal significance, but that gives you the general flavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the wetlands perspective, the area proposed for excision includes part of the catchment of Lake Jasper, the largest permanent freshwater lake in the south-west of Western Australia. For many people who have not seen a mineral sands mining site, this is hard to imagine because, unlike many other mining sites, it is extremely extensive. It is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3362"> not in one little spot, it is not down in the ground, and it is not a hole in the ground. The physical nature of mineral sands mining means that the whole of the topsoil and everything with it is stripped&mdash;and is stripped over a large area. That means that anything growing on top obviously has to go. It means that any of those species which rely on that extensive area lose their habitat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some areas of mining you could say that there will be a rehabilitation process. But let me be quite clear: I know of no example in Western Australia where mineral sands mining sites have been able to be rehabilitated to a natural bush state. The technology and the research has still not enabled that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what happens? You excise a large area of national park and you turn it into cow land. That is fine if you are a dairy farmer, but it does not in any way, shape or form rehabilitate that important area to its natural form, rehabilitate the plant life or provide a habitat for the animal life, and so on. So, if you lose that area to national park, you have lost it for all time. That means that you have lost that buffer zone. Certainly, it seems almost incomprehensible that you would do that so close to the outstanding wetlands and Lake Jasper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to hear a quote from the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, Mr McGinty, relating to the state government's proposal to mine in D'Entrecasteaux National Park. The government are doing it without knowing its environmental impact. They are rushing this through, and that is having a huge impact on the people who have been given glib assurances that mining will take place only with the highest levels of environmental assessment. Mr McGinty said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it were on the fringe of the park, without the possibility of an enormous environmental downside, we at the Labor Party would support it.</PARA>
<PARA>That goes along with the 1990 decision. However, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you are talking about the environmental jewel in the crown of the park, concerns related to mine tailings contaminating Lake Jasper, the bottom of the lake being disturbed and the effect on native plants and animals. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGinty said that the government's approach to mining in D'Entrecasteaux was at odds with its urban planning policy, which included up-front environmental reviews of planning proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems extraordinary in the light of this statement that this should be rushed through. We know that there are differing views within the Labor Party on mining and exploration in national parks. But I would like to think that even within the Labor Party there is a desire to make sure that those very important areas of Australia which have deep significance are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at some of the issues relating to this area. As I mentioned, the excision includes part of the catchment of Lake Jasper. It is the largest permanent freshwater lake in the south-west of Western Australia. The quality of the lake will be threatened even by mining operations only 300 metres from its edge. Silt, pollution, chemical spills and changes to the water table are all potential hazards for both wildlife and vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lake system is a biological reservoir for native freshwater fish, while the associated wetland habitat contains several rare plant and protected bird species. In return for mining in the existing national park, Cable Sands has offered to add to the park 1,000 hectares of degraded former farmland. The land would be classified only as C-class reserve, and Cable Sands would still retain the right of access to mining and related activities. So what will have been gained? This land swap would add nothing to the value of the national park. It is an insult to the Western Australia reserve system. In fact, all it is doing is providing a means to further degrade the amount of reserve for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lake Jasper is unique, being the only known underwater archaeological site in Australia. Sandmining activities which involve using large quantities of water will threaten the integrity of the site. The flora around Lake Jasper is at risk of infection by dieback. Mining and associated road building are known to spread dieback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3363"> D'Entrecasteaux ecological importance is recognised by the Australian Heritage Com mission, which has placed the park on the register of the National Estate for its high conservation values. This is the nub of the point: little value added processing is done in Australia and the royalties in general are only of the order of $12 million to $17 million. This is the raffle. This is what we are trading off&mdash;$12 million to $17 million in royalties. Allowing mining near Lake Jasper would set a precedent for mining D'Entrecasteaux and other national parks. Excising patches of this magnificent national park will degrade the very values for which it was set aside in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to a senior scientist, rehabilitation of an area of such diversity with over 1,000 plant species identified in the national park so far will be an obvious impossibility. I happen to know that the mining company commissioned a biological survey. I happen to know that the timing for this biological survey was two weeks&mdash;two weeks. It is a disgrace! If you want to do a proper biological survey, one year or two years would be minimum for an area of such significance. You have to go in the various seasons. You have to pit trap or you have to collect species in different seasons. Two weeks is a total farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">National parks are set aside for the enjoyment of the community and the conservation of our flora and fauna. Any mining activities are entirely inappropriate and will be met with strong community opposition in the metropolitan and south west communities. The people of Western Australia hold this area in trust not only for Western Australians and Australians but for the whole world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly do hope that for this tacky short-term deal there is deep thought. There have been examples in the past where a bad decision made in parliament has not gone through, that it is has not received royal assent. I certainly hope that that is the case in this particular instance. I know there is a lot more to say, and I hope there will be other people supporting this argument but that is the reality. It is an indefensible decision. It is an indefensible lack of process and it totally puts the lie to any statements that have been made by the Western Australia government in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relation to their respect for environmental values, their respect for any other values except the profitability of an overseas investor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned in my call for this to be debated in the first place, there were powers that could have been used by the previous governments and there are powers that can be used by this current government. Whether or not you wanted them, the powers exist. That is why we are debating this in the Senate today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Western Australian parliament last week the state opposition proposed a motion to halt the excision pending a report from the CSIRO on the hydrology of the Lake Jasper area and the likely impact of mining on this lake; an environmental assessment of the proposal to mine in this area at the level of an ERMP; the requirement that ministerial conditions arising from the ERMP include revegetation to acceptable native vegetation standards so that the locations may be incorporated in the park at a later date; and a statement by the proponent outlining its commitments to secondary processing of the mineral sands mined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, under any circumstances, these were reasonable requests of any government with an interest in applying appropriate environmental standards. Significantly, the former Liberal shadow environment minister, Mr Pendal, now turned Independent, supported the first clause and expressed his concern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about the importance of Lake Jasper. The real issue is what happens now that the Court government's bill to excise a portion of the park for sandmining has passed through the malapportioned Western Australian Legislative Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no public confidence in the ability of the state Environmental Protection Authority following the changes that were made to it by Premier Court and a string of appalling decisions. For example, in concert with the state environment minister, Mr Foss, the EPA made the extraordinary decision that there was no need to have a formal environmental assessment of a major road tunnel which is to cut from near the Swan River to the Mitchell freeway on the northern side of Perth&mdash;another grand plan of the Court government which is proceeding despite the objections of the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is beholden on the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, to advise the Western Australian government that he will not grant a mineral sands export licence until the most rigorous environmental assessments have been undertaken. In the interests of the environmental integrity of the area, he should resist his natural inclination to approve mining proposals before they even hit his desk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian community is looking to the Howard government to display higher environmental standards than those of the Court government. So far, the Howard government has cut the environment budget by 13 per cent, despite John Howard's explicit election promise not to cut it at all; increased the woodchip export licence ceiling and will now allow the clearing of native forests on private land for woodchipping; approved a 1,500 bed Oyster Point resort development adjacent to a world heritage area; failed to advance Australia's response to the greenhouse threat; supported the development of new uranium mines in Australia; and tried to abandon the Commonwealth's controls over the export of certain minerals, including mineral sands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this move by Senator Margetts to protect one of the most delightful places in Western Australia, and indeed Australia. It is as important to the national parliament as it is to the state parliament because the D'Entrecasteaux National Park is of national significance and is listed on the Australian Heritage Commission's list of the national heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I simply want to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from an archaeologist at the Western Australian Museum to underscore the archaeological significance of Lake Jasper, which is targeted by the sandmining imperative which has led to the Western Australian parliament rescinding part of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park. This comes from Mr Charlie Dortch, who is speaking as an individual but works at the Western Australian Museum. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lake Jasper is Western Australia's largest and most significant fresh-water lake, and is also the locale of an ancient and unique underwater cultural landscape. My aim here is to show how that over a few short years the lake's once pristine condition has deteriorated, and to confirm its great age and unique cultural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>He first went to Lake Jasper in 1988 when carrying out an archaeological survey. He found tree stumps and stone tool scatters in the lake's inshore zone that were partly exposed at low water levels. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time the lake and its environs unquestionably were in pristine natural condition. Over the next seven years, I directed WA Museum diving teams investigating the 4 km&sup2; lake floor. In six diving seasons, our team showed that the lake floor is a submerged ancient landscape that had been occupied by human beings, as shown by the presence of stone tools and tree stumps in growth position to depths of ten m. In 1994, we learned that Lake Jasper's deepest and still not fully sounded part, which is at a depth greater than 17 m, was a much smaller lake that long pre-dated the filling of the existing lake.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in ancient times there had been a smaller lake. The Aboriginal community of this region occupied an area which is now largely submerged. That was their life over thousands of years. He goes on to outline the serial incursions on the lake, not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> least the extension of motorised aquatic sports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He details how this lake does not have an outflow. It does not have a creek or river flowing from it. It simply is a natural sump and the water drainage from it is into the subterranean component of the lake. Rubbish going into the lake&mdash;the detergents, oil and so on from those water sports&mdash;has no way of escaping. It sinks to salify the lake and degrade the archaeological landscape as well as the natural values of the lake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, he confronts the prospect of this proposal for sandmining in the lake's near vicinity and the unknown outcome of that. I think most Australian citizens would be outraged too, if they were able to take part in this debate, at the potential impact of a venal approach to a vital component of Australia's national park system. What they are after is to make a few dollars and the state will get some paltry sum, like $12 million or $17 million in royalties overall, to degrade one of the most beautiful little places in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support totally Senator Margetts' imploring the Senate, as a national conscience, to act on behalf of those people fighting to protect this area. The Western Australian state parliament, no doubt lobbied by the mineral sands industry, has said, `We will put the natural values, the archaeological values, second to the quick dollar for this overseas sandmining interest.' It is the wrong way to go. This parliament in Canberra has the power to alter things, to protect an environment, when a maverick state government fails to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3366"> Senator Margetts has pointed to the use of the corporations power. Let me just say to the Senate that, if it is good enough to use the corporations power&mdash;as recent governments have done&mdash;to say to the Victorian government, `We'll move on you. If you don't legislate to allow banks to charge interest on credit cards, we'll use the corporations power,' then it is surely good enough to use that same power to protect something of inestimable and timeless value to this nation and to all future generations. Let's get our priorities right here. That corporations power is avail able. We have national responsibilities to the environment. Here we have the opportunity to make a stand in the Senate in defence of that environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I totally support this motion. I hope the Senate will support it. I hope that, as an outcome of that support, the Howard government will do the right thing, by using the powers it has available to it to protect this vital part of the national estate. The consequence of not acting is a continued deterioration of Australia's environment. The Howard government will take responsibility for that. When it comes to the subject of excision of national parks, we come to a pretty low ebb in terms of our national responsibilities to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we cannot make a stand in this national parliament on protecting national parks&mdash;which, by the way, are under threat in New South Wales at the moment from the woodchip industry, which wants to incise national parks so it can move in and raze some of the last great stands of forests in New South Wales&mdash;then nothing is sacrosanct. Nothing is inviolable. I again say: how come we can use inherent powers of the constitution to guarantee banks can charge interest on credit cards but we have failed so far to use those same powers to come to the protection of this great country's natural environment?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we have set pieces of legislation that we do have to abide by at the moment. They may be wobbly, they may be shaky and they may not work very well, but the reality is that the WA state parliament, whether we like it or not, has the legislative and constitutional control over the national park. They have passed a piece of legislation that it seems a majority of senators may not like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will then, I presume, receive a formal proposal to mine within that area. There will then be an environmental impact assessment process triggered at the state level. There may then be a proposal that comes before the federal government in relation to the export of those sands. We will then trigger the due processes under the Australian Heritage <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commission provisions, which Senator Collins has already outlined. The minister may then have some power to act. But what Senator Collins is proposing&mdash;and I do not even think he genuinely proposes this&mdash;is that somehow we sort of overturn that whole process and find some way for the minister to act in the meantime. The minister does not have that power to act. There is no head of power and, where there is a head of power, there is no legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth government puts those views. We suggest that the proposal, as set out in the motion, not only lacks any constitutional validity, but also it just overturns the whole process. If you want to propose, just to sum up, that here in Canberra we establish a system whereby we will be the judge and jury of every single proposal for economic development and environmental protection in Australia, then that is the serious proposal that is incorporated in this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure some people genuinely hold those views; they genuinely believe that perhaps the environment in Australia could be a bit better protected with a mega&hyphen;bureaucracy and mega&hyphen;power here in Canberra with the ultimate control of this parliament whereby none of us trust what any of the states do ever again. I suggest that that is not the practical approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government's approach is to cooperate with the states, to work with the states. The federal government is already in close consultation with the various authorities in Western Australia, and the Australian Heritage Commission has worked, as Senator Margetts knows, through the assessment processes in 1991 and 1992 in this area. We have listed these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is taking its responsibilities seriously. We do care about what happens in those national parks, but we can only act where we have the power and the legislation to do so. I think you assume that, because we have a corporations power or an external affairs power, we can just use that power by edict.

That conflict of interest really needs to be brought to the fore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats are extremely concerned about this matter of attacking national parks both in WA and nationally. We are deeply concerned by the recent movements of the Western Australian government to pave the way for sandmining activity within the park and adjacent to Lake Jasper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are deeply concerned by what appears to be a nationwide push by conservative governments in the main to open up our small, and it is small, national park and nature reserve estate to all types of development&mdash;D'Entrecasteaux National Park in general and the Lake Jasper area of the national park in particular. The senators who have spoken have already identified it as of enormous value and importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent research shows that the Lake Jasper wetland ecosystem, which would be irreversibly degraded and destroyed by any sandmining activity in the vicinity&mdash;and Senator Margetts has made the correct point that this kind of mining is exceptionally aggressive&mdash;is one of the most important freshwater wetland ecosystems remaining in the south&hyphen;west of WA with large numbers of water bird species, endemic freshwater fish species, frog species, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aquatic invertebrates and many other species and plant communities of great importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed mine will undoubtedly cause irreversible disruption to the hydrological system which underpins the Lake Jasper wetland ecosystem. As you know, our water systems overall throughout Western Australia are under enormous attack from salt problems, and this is just another problem to add to the hydrological problems we have. Any mineral sandmining in the Lake Jasper wetland system would result in the contamination of the water system by sediments and by radioactive products&mdash;and I emphasise that. We have had a problem in Western Australia with the radioactivity of mineral sands, both of which would cause irreversible damage to the wetland ecosystem. The area also has very high Aboriginal heritage values which have been increasingly well documented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In economic terms, the park and Lake Jasper already have established economic values for tourism. Tourism is the industry of the present and the future. We have large and growing numbers of nature based tourists visiting the area. This then has major flow-on effects for the local centres such as Walpole, Northcliffe, Pemberton and Augusta. The impacts of any mine in this area would cause major disruptions and impacts on local communities. It would have a negative effect on the burgeoning nature based tourism industry. It would cause a massive further impact in terms of transport by road of the mineral sands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The lower south-west is already reeling&mdash;and I mean that word `reeling'&mdash;under the effects of increasing road transport related to sandmining. Any new mine in this area would be extremely disturbing for local communities. Small business and small tourist businesses in particular have complained to us about the wrong emphasis of the state on mining and logging. The transport by heavy trucks over long distance and mineral sands will spread the impacts right through the lower south-west and up to Bunbury. This will all have consequences for the flourishing tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recent sandmine approvals at Jangardup and Benup, both in close proximity to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3369"> D'Entrecasteaux National Park, have provoked great fear and anger amongst local communities because the push for mineral sandmining across the south coast is so clearly at odds with the lifestyle and the best long-term economic and social interests of the south coast community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week's decision by the Western Australian government to fast&hyphen;track the passage of a national park excision bill through parliament was, and is, reprehensible. It is our view that the population of Western Australia would be strongly opposed to this, if asked. By its passage of this bill, the WA government is demonstrating its disregard for the environment, for national parks, for areas listed on the Register of the National Estate and for the principles of ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By passing this bill, the WA government is saying that it is prepared to subject the community of WA to all the anxiety and trauma and needless expenditure of time and energy that will be required to ensure that mineral sandmining does not proceed in this most remarkable of natural areas. We heard yesterday from Senator Eggleston what a wonderful outpouring of wealth we have in Western Australia. There is plenty enough mining going on; we do not need to wrack into yet another natural area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that this parliament discuss this matter at this time so that the federal government can act quickly to head off what will otherwise be a protracted conflict between the WA community and the mining industry, which will, in turn, bring discredit upon the mining industry and on the mining company involved&mdash;Nissho Iwai Corporation of Japan. I emphasise, incidentally, the word `corporation'. It is urgent that this government take action now and exhibit some political will. As the guns legislation proved, if their heart is in the right place, they have the ability to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government must immediately make it clear to the WA government and Nissho Iwai that it is serious about its express commitment to the environment. It must, therefore, inform the WA government immediately that it is prepared to intervene in any lawful way <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> possible to prevent any possibility that this crazy, incredibly destructive mining proposal will proceed. The Australian Democrats ask you, Senator Campbell, on behalf of the government, to please exercise some political will in this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those members of the Senate who have spoken and clarified the matter for me somewhat. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Campbell, raised the question as to the powers which the Commonwealth government has in respect of intervening. There are a number of powers, including the corporations power. As the parliamentary secretary has indicated, there is no legislation which would enable the Commonwealth to call on that power at the present moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am just a bit worried about the extension of the corporations power to some other areas, including, for example, industrial relations. We have suffered considerably as a result of governments utilising that power for the purposes of interfering, as it were, in industrial relations. There are other powers, as has been suggested here, including the export power, where there are laid down procedures which can be and have been exercised by the Commonwealth in respect of the preservation or the protection of the environment. What has been indicated here is quite correct&mdash;any lawful means&mdash;but as Senator Campbell has said, they are limited at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having heard what has been said, I just want to indicate that I am not prepared, at this stage, to vote for the proposal whilst it contains subparagraph (ii) and the words at the end of (b) say `or any other national park'. Nothing has been said in this debate which clarifies that for me. I understand that there are small mines in some national parks in various states to which there is no environmental objection. I may be wrong there. I am wondering whether the Senate would accept the following amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (a)(ii), omit the paragraph.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (b), omit ", or any other national park".</PARA>
<PARA>That would focus on the issue in hand, that is, the legislation of Western Australia which <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3370"> seeks to excise a large part of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia and facilitate the mining of mineral sands by Cable Sands, and paragraph (b) would stand intact with the exception of those four or five words at the end. I hope that is acceptable to the Senate. I feel it is probably in the interests of Senator Margetts and that it would focus on this particular issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To close the debate, I thank the speakers for their contributions today. I think it is true that any government which has the political will would be able to put forward legislation that would provide the axle, as Senator Campbell calls it. Let us look at a model. Perhaps we can. There are examples where there was, supposedly, a head of power, but where there is a will there is a way. The uniform national gun laws were one example where, whether or not there was a national power, there was a national result. In the case of such things, there is the ability to do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of the Commonwealth&hyphen;state regional agreements with regard to the environment is that the Commonwealth retains the role, if not the obligation, to intervene if proper standards are not met. How anyone in their wildest dreams could indicate that proper standards are being met by this proposal is beyond me. What we have here is a national park for sale. Any statements that are made about why anybody should want to look after other ecological values in Australia, when we have X amount of national park, obviously fall into tiny shattered pieces when you talk about the impact of a valued part of a valued park in Western Australia. People would have to be totally ignorant of the values, other than somebody's dollar values, if they could not see that this decision is short&hyphen;sighted and damaging for our future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Harradine's proposal, part (ii) was stated as a statement of fact&mdash;that there are currently 22 national parks in Western Australia that have exploration licences or temporary reserves applying to them, with many more applications being made for exploration licences in national <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parks. In relation to this debate, that statement of fact remains a statement of fact, but I can live with it being removed. Obviously, from the Greens' point of view, the D'Entrecasteaux National Park, like any national park, should not be an area where mining takes place. I understand that people have different views. If the majority of the Senate supports the motion by removing `or any other national park', we will revisit that further argument on another day. Once again, I commend the motion in total to the Senate and I hope there will be majority support for this very important motion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of amendments provide supplementation for price movements. This supplementation covers items such as superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals, special capital projects, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander support funds, 1996 expenditure for grants to open learning organisations and operating grants in respect of the years 1996, 1997 and 1998. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3371"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to providing flexible funding for research projects in higher education institutions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to section 20A of the act will create a facility for providing advances of operating grants for a wide range of purposes. This will increase the overall flexibility of funding arrangements for higher education institutions. Subject to parliamentary scrutiny, the Minister will be able to issue guidelines that will establish the overall amount to be paid as advances as well as the type of activities that will be funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the streamlining of administrative procedures of the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme. The concept of "semester" is replaced with "study periods" to reflect the structure of the open learning scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes amendments to subsection 106AA and subsection 106AB. Currently an open learning agency will process an application for the deferred payment scheme without the inclusion of the client's tax file number. The amendments will mean that clients will be ineligible for the deferred payment scheme if they do not provide a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment to section 106E broadens the current obligation of the agency to provide information to the minister to include statistical and other information relating to clients undertaking units of study. The amendment will result in the agency being subject to the same obligation as higher education institutions. These amendments will enhance the Commonwealth's ability to monitor the scheme's effectiveness and ensure proper accountability.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Further to the discussion that ensued on this bill yesterday, I advise that the government proposes to bring forward further amendments which have been circulated in the chamber. They are supplementary amendments that I propose to move on behalf of the government. They are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4 and they relate to clauses 4, 38, 47A and 47B of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has agreed to a special request from the Premier of Western Australia to extend the cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions to the Airports Bill to separate control of Perth airport from Sydney airport on the same basis as Melbourne and Brisbane airports. In supporting statements made in conjunction with the introduction of the legislation, such as in the second reading speech, the government indicated its continuing support for individual ownership of airports and encouraging diversity in lease ownership and management of federal airports, while having regard to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3372"> response from potential investors and other leasing objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recently reinstated cross&hyphen;ownership provisions which separate Sydney, with Sydney West, from Melbourne and Brisbane airports in the form included in the Airports Bill 1995, and did so in amendments moved at the beginning of these committee hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments which the government made by reinstatement of the cross&hyphen;ownership restrictions ensure the separate ownership and control of the airport lessee and any airport management companies of Sydney and Sydney West from Melbourne airport, and Sydney and Sydney West from Brisbane airport. The cross&hyphen;ownership limitations apply to both the airport lessee company and the airport management company. Separation is achieved by both a 15 per cent limit and a practical control test. The government has also already advised that it will make it a condition of the lease of the first stage airports that bidders must bid for Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports individually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has now given further consideration to the position and the treatment of Perth airport, which, along with Melbourne and Brisbane, is one of the major airports to be leased in the first phase of airport sales. Given that bids for Melbourne and Brisbane will be sought separately from each other and from Perth, it seems only logical that cross&hyphen;ownership provisions reflect this as well; thus all of the first phase airports will be kept separate from Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It now seems clear that there will be a stronger field of bidders for the phase 1 airports than originally expected. There has been an increase in the number of international operators and consortia interested in acquiring airport leases since cross-ownership rules were first proposed by the previous Labor government. There is also a greater appreciation of the airports being excellent investments for institutions and funds managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result, and in addition to support for the government's move to achieve diversity of ownership of phase 1 airports, market conditions are now quite strong; thus we see no commercial reason against the extension of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the cross-ownership restrictions to include Perth. However, I should say that this should not be seen as a precedent for other future airport lease sales. Therefore, I seek leave to move the amendments as tabled which ensure the separation of control of Sydney with Sydney West from Perth airport.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the questions that have been asked by both Senator Bob Collins and Senator Woodley with regard to these particular amendments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is certainly acknowledged that they are major issues and major assets, it is important to consider the views of the respective state governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the matter regarding the various airports that Senator Collins raised, it is important to note that we have reviewed the issues relating to capital cities. In this regard, both the Premier of Tasmania and the Acting Premier of South Australia have also been consulted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just make a very brief comment in relation to the questions that have been raised here in view of the fact that I was chair of the committee that dealt with this particular matter. It is fair to say that at those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3374"> hearings the issue was raised in the Western Australian government submission in terms of cross-ownership for Perth. I do not believe it was raised by the other state governments, although I would actually have to check the record absolutely precisely with regard to that particular point. I do not believe it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position the committee took as far as that was concerned was in relation to the answers that were given to us by the representatives of the government at that particular time. They were concerned that, if cross-ownership were applied to Perth, there would not be, or potentially would not be, sufficient competition in terms of the situation that exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then, it has evolved from the Perth situation that three major local Perth conglomerates have come forward who wish to compete for Perth, its particular position and what exists. As a result, representations were made, as has already been said, by the Minister for Transport in WA, by the Premier, by some of my federal colleagues, obviously, and by me with regard to the new information that has come forward. As a result of that particular information, I am satisfied, as are my other colleagues, that there is now sufficient competition available in terms of those three particular conglomerates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We expressed a number of other concerns, but I will not go into them at this particular time because it will only prolong this particular debate. The key point is that those three local conglomerates are very reputable companies, which operate in Western Australia. They are Western Australian companies. In particular they will provide that necessary competition that is required as far as Perth is concerned. I just wish to reinforce that particular point: there was no request made by either the South Australian government or the Tasmanian government with regard to this particular matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when we reported progress we had a response from the parliamentary secretary to a question that I had raised relating to the payment of local government charges and state government taxes. The parliamentary secretary gave a statement in response to that question of mine and also a response to the interventions by Senator Bob Collins and Senator Calvert as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that under the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 the corporation is subject to Commonwealth income and wholesale sales tax and state payroll tax. The FAC also makes ex gratia payments to local authorities in lieu of rates in respect of leasehold improvements on airports for which it rebills its clients. The FAC does not pay rates in respect of general airport land. While the Airports Bill does not address the issue, the operators of leased airports will be required to make payments in lieu of rates, as the FAC currently does. These obligations will be imposed by provisions in the airport leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">More generally, the application of state laws imposing taxation to the airports when operated under long-term leases from the Commonwealth is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3375"> unclear. The application of state taxation laws to the airports will be addressed shortly by the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA>That raises a number of questions. Firstly, are we to assume from that that in the leases there will be a requirement that the operators will be obliged to pay local government charges, including rates? Secondly, what about state laws which are not taxation laws&mdash;for example, state laws relating to what businesses could be operated and the times in which those businesses could be operated and, for example, licensing arrangements? Will the operators be required to observe all of those state laws? Will this be required of them in the leases?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that particular occasion there was the reference that I referred to last night of the federal government positions that had been previously enunciated by the former minister&mdash;the then Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;with regard to the standing position of the Commonwealth on the particular position, and I reinforced and restated that particular position. Similarly, the officers of the Department of Transport who appeared at the Senate committee on Tuesday, 6 August gave detailed answers referring to the leases. In particular, I refer to the response by Mr White on page 301 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate committee. In addressing this matter, Mr White said that, for legal reasons, it cannot go in the legislation, but that provisions can be put into the individual airport leases for each of the airports which would require airport operators to meet the government's requirements in that area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, of course, is absolutely correct in that in the space of the last 15 or 20 minutes, Senator Tambling, on behalf of the government, has told us nothing. The question of local laws in respect of shopping and gambling and all these sorts of things is not a new issue; this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3376"> issue came up again and again. Of course, it became a very prominent issue in respect of the Perth airport under the current arrangements with the FAC. That simply demonstrates the sensitivity of the issue and the importance of it in terms of all these changed arrangements. What I would like to know is: what is the government's general approach and general attitude toward this important question? Will the government have a predisposition to want to have the airports run by local state and territory laws or will the government have a predisposition to have control itself under Commonwealth regulations or laws? What is the predisposition of the government? What is the general approach it is going to take on these issues?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One example of why this might be important is the case of the Melbourne airport. What if, for example, Hudson Conway became the successful operator&mdash;as they certainly indicate they wish to be&mdash;of Tullamarine? Would the government then be minded to allow a casino and gaming on the premises? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Tambling) would be well aware that this certainly is not the first time this issue has been raised: such proposals have been raised before in terms of gaming machines in airport terminals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important question and we know nothing about it. In terms of what the government's requirements might be, it is a blank page. What will the predisposition of the government be on this issue? Will it, in general, be looking to have state and local laws running what will effectively be completely private operations no longer with a real Commonwealth involvement in terms of management. Senator Margetts pursued this matter in debate yesterday. It was finally clarified that the Commonwealth will have no further management role; you would not expect it to have one in these airports once they are privatised. What is the general position of the government in its approach on this? What will the situation be, for example, with Melbourne airport and gambling?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator TAMBLING</EMPHASIS> (Northern Territory&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (11.36 a.m.)&mdash;The issues in this particular area are being regurgitated again by Senator Collins. It is important to recognise that in the process of establishing what will flow from this legislation it was very important that these discussions did not pre&hyphen;empt the passage of the legislation itself. It was very important that the legislation and the fate of the legislation needed to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say firstly that there is an important principle with regard to the airports leasing legislation and its processing. Secondly, it is very obvious that the Commonwealth does not wish to be involved where, obviously, it does not need to be in many of these areas. Therefore, it is important that, subsequent to the passage of this legislation, there is extensive collaboration and consultation between the Commonwealth and the states .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw Senator Collins's attention to the evidence of the Senate committee when this matter was addressed on 6 August. In response to questions that were put, Mr White of the department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . final decisions have not yet been taken but I think it is the intention of the government to consult with the states and to give the states the opportunity to put their views as to whether state law should apply or not and then to take a final decision on those matters in the light of that advice. Today, the committee has heard the views from a number of states on those matters. Clearly, these views signal, from those states at least, what their response is likely to be. For example, the matter of gambling was raised, and perhaps that ought to be commented on explicitly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there are no regulations issued under this part of the bill, then state laws in relation to gambling would apply, and it would be open to the states to control matters of licences and so on, on airports&mdash;as they do in off&hyphen;airport locations in that state. If that were the outcome, there would be no concerns for the states or the parties that were involved with such licences that there could be any undermining of those licences in exclusivity clauses attached to them through action that the Commonwealth would take. Alternatively, if the Commonwealth were to take action to put in regs then, of course, those positions would be protected.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe these matters have been addressed on previous occasions. It certainly will be the intent of the government to work very closely with the states in these matters.</PARA>

Bear in mind that it has been a bit of a hotchpotch arrangement up to date as to what airports would pay what amounts to local government, and it has been the subject of discussions and negotiations where the government has had the whip hand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come, however, to another issue which relates to the future of the Hobart and Launceston airports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to respond to a number of the issues that have just been raised by Senator Harradine. I also met yesterday with representatives of the respective regional development organisations in Tasmania. They obviously left with me a very similar statement to the one that Senator Harradine has just incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard.</EMPHASIS>  They made patently clear to me&mdash;I can assure Senator Harradine&mdash;that, I think it was, some 87 per cent of the tourist visitation of Tasmania was dependent upon arrivals at Launceston and Hobart airports. Obviously, significant and major financial impacts flow to the entire Tasmanian economy from that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government is very mindful of and has had a number of discussions on this matter with the Tasmanian government. I know that a number of my colleagues, in particular Senator Calvert, have been vigilant and strong in regard to these issues. I draw Senator Harradine's attention to the policy of the Liberal and National parties that was outlined in the document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Tasmanian package</EMPHASIS> prior to the last election. That policy statement included the position on airports, which read: `A coalition government will support the separate and preferably local ownership and operation of Hobart and Launceston airports.' As Senator Harradine would know, that is still the very clear position of the government. Along with a number of the other initiatives, both financial and social, that were outlined with regard to Tasmania, the government has been very carefully implementing those issues both in the budget and through policy development.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3379">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the specific issues that Senator Harradine has just addressed, particularly the leasing of Hobart and Launceston airports, it is government policy to sell long-term leases over all FAC airports. Airports in phase 1 of the leasing exercise are to be sold by the end of the 1996-97 financial year. Hobart and Launceston are not in this group and will be considered later. As part of its commitment to local ownership and operation of airports, the government has announced its support for Hobart and Launceston airports to be leased separately. The government has said that if the two leading bids for one of the airports are tied it will grant the lease to the bid with the highest level of local participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth is aware of the importance of Hobart and Launceston airports to the Tasmanian economy. Careful consideration has been given to state and regional interests by the government in finalising its leasing and regulatory strategies for federal airports. I know that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, has written the Minister for Finance, John Fahey, requesting that he consider not only the early leasing of the two airports but also that the airports are leased separately. Mr Sharp and Mr Fahey, as the two ministers responsible for the leasing process, are dealing with the leasing issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine also addressed the issue of, and drew his own view to, the obvious relative merits of the ALOP as it has impacted upon other airports in Tasmania. It is the government's intention to seek investors in airport leases who have the long-term financial capacity to sustain and improve those airports. This must be consistent with the views of state governments and local authorities, who see airports as the key to regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we get bidders who are less than financially strong, or if we took the bid process towards subsidies at the outset, as would be the case with the ALOP style schemes, we will be condemning regional airports and people who have such high aspirations for them to a culture of dependency on Canberra. It is not our first preference to go the ALOP <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> route for Tasmania or other less prominent airports elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the committee stage, Senator Bob Collins raised this issue specifically with regard to Alice Springs and Townsville airports. If after having sought strong bidders we find none in fair and open contest, the government will have to look not only at what options are open to allow those airports to go into local hands but also at ensuring they are sound investments for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said just a few moments ago, I was very pleased with the interesting discussions held yesterday with the representatives of the regional Tasmanian organisations, who certainly stressed the involvement of the local authorities in the ownership proposals. Senator Calvert has repeatedly discussed these issues with me. I know that he has engaged in a series of discussions with local government authorities throughout Tasmania. I am pretty sure that I am not giving away his confidences when I say that he has encouraged them to look very carefully at either capital involvement or joint ventures, or other arrangements that might be appropriate and attractive to Tasmania.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine was raising the question of the airports in Tasmania in the very important role that senators have of raising concerns in the Senate that directly affect their state or territory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say `in an absolute sense' because, even though those of us who are proud to belong to the mainstream two parties in Australia continually raise issues of legitimate concern to our own parts of Australia from time to time, obviously we do not have the same flexibility that Independent senators have. The concern that Senator Harradine raised in respect of the two airports in Tasmania&mdash;and answered to some extent of detail by Senator Tambling&mdash;demonstrated the importance of that role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Chairman, I raise this issue, and this is an appropriate matter to raise it on, because I have seen some ignorant editorials in newspapers in my life from time to time&mdash;I have seen some fine editorials, too.

I have said it before: the most self&hyphen;indulgent job in Australia is to come into work of a morning, have your first four cups of coffee&mdash;I do&mdash;sit down in front of a keyboard and bash out any kind of idiocy on a screen and have it reprinted 150,000 times and distributed all over the country. It is a wonderful role to be an editor of a newspaper. I would love to be the editor of a newspaper. But I think that you first have to spend about 10 seconds on considering what you write.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw attention to this editorial in the Senate. The final paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In what is essentially a two&hyphen;party system of government, Independent Senators such as Harradine and Colston are anomalies.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Senator. He has been thrown in here by this `unintended quirk' since 1975 by election, after election, after election. The reason I thought this editorial was so profoundly ignorant was that it ignored these very issues that are of close concern to the areas of Australia that we represent which it is an important role for senators to canvass here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to take the opportunity to do so. I have restrained all of my remarks to this point of time in the debate, quite properly with the responsibility that I have got to get this through on behalf of the opposition. My final concern&mdash;I make no bones about it, whether it is a quirk that has put me here or otherwise&mdash;is raised as a senator for the Northern Territory. Senator Tambling is in a unique position to give me&mdash;I hope&mdash;an equally detailed response on Darwin and Alice Springs that he gave to Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically my concern, Senator Tambling&mdash;and I am sure it is shared by you&mdash;is this: I have already declared my heresy in this debate. I have said already that I personally did not want to sell these airports. I did not want to sell the FAC. It was a government decision taken at the time, and I was party to it, which I supported as a loyal member of that government. But the reason for my concern is very simple: the Federal Airports Corporation, unlike, I regret to say, some other publicly owned operations in Australia, is a highly successful publicly owned corporation. The measure of its success is as amply demonstrated in the Northern Territory as it is anywhere else in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine made the point that 100 per cent of visitors to Tasmania go by either sea or by air which, as far as I am concerned, was always one of those truths that I held to be self-evident, but that is certainly not the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3381"> case in the Northern Territory. But&mdash;and this is why it is important to make this point&mdash;in a lot of ways places like the territory do have parallels with Tasmania because of the extreme distances, and of course the top end of Western Australia has the same situation, that people have to drive therefore placing enormous importance on air travel. As Senator Tambling knows, that is certainly the case in the Northern Territory where the lion's share of our visitors also come by air as they do in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great successes of the Federal Airports Corporation has been to run in a truly entrepreneurial fashion&mdash;and it has&mdash;a number of airports around Australia that provide a national system of high quality terminals in this country. And don't tell me there is not a national interest in preserving that. In other words, it is not simply a nice terminal in Hobart or an efficient terminal in Darwin. There is, in my view, a real national interest to be protected in having in our major cities and gateways in Australia a national system of high quality airports. I do want to take the opportunity of commending what I think has been a superbly professional job by the Federal Airports Corporation in doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cold hard facts are, and Senator Tambling knows it, that if it had not been for the FAC negotiating with the then government to take on Darwin and Alice Springs those two world class facilities we now have there would never have been built. The point to make is that they were built off the budget. The FAC, I might also add, has had significant success in bringing what were then absolute economic basket cases back into profit or at least closer to the black line than they were before. They have done it at the same time as maintaining, to all of our benefits, some of the lowest landing charges anywhere in the world whilst building these high quality airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tambling knows exactly where I am coming from on this, and that is why I want him to respond in respect of Darwin and Alice Springs. You cannot overstate the benefit that those two first class facilities at Alice Springs and Darwin have had to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tourism industry in the Northern Territory. You cannot. When you consider the facilities that they replaced, the benefits we have had from them have been enormous and continue to be. We would want to see some restraint kept on landing charges under new operators who simply did not have the complete freedom to look simply to their bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not a natural marketplace operating with airports, as Senator Tambling knows. If you don't like the charges at Darwin, you can't just waltz 50 kilometres down the road and land at the other airport because there isn't one and there isn't one for 1,500 kilometres. It is simply not a marketplace situation that exists, and Senator Tambling knows it. We want an assurance that there will be reasonable charges after these airports are leased and that we will not have a situation where the charges are instantly hiked up or even hiked up over a progression of time because the charges all have to be borne by the people who want to come and visit us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want an assurance from Senator Tambling that in respect of the airport terminals at Darwin and Alice Springs there will be some consideration given to local ownership. In exactly the same way as Senator Harradine wants to see that situation in Tasmania, I want to see it in the Northern Territory because there is no question in my mind that the best interests of the local community then are served. If you have a local consortium they are far more tuned into the fact that they cannot simply regard the bottom line as being the only thing they are concerned about. They have to have regard to the flow&hyphen;on effects of any punitive charges that might be placed on airports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I basically want an assurance from Senator Tambling and some detail as to how the government will ensure that the current successful operations of the Darwin and Alice Springs airport will continue and that the sale of those airports will not change the current status quo. No&hyphen;one but a fool would want to change it because of the highly successful way it is currently operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator TAMBLING</EMPHASIS> (Northern Territory&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3382"> (12.06 p.m.)&mdash;I thank Senator Collins for the comments that he has made. Very obviously, we share many of the issues from a parochial and Northern Territory point of view. I acknowledge them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will say two things at the outset, firstly with regard to the comments that Senator Collins made about the roles of editors in Australian newspapers&mdash;people who are invited to be editorial commentators. I look forward to the day when Senator Collins retires and becomes an editorial writer. It will probably depend on whether he retires before me or not as to who will get the upper hand in comments that might flow subsequently through the Northern Territory news and whether we are commenting on each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I share his concerns that the attack on Senators Harradine and Colston were most inappropriate and unfair in the way they were elucidated. I think when you talk about the role of Independent senators it is important to acknowledge that Independent senators certainly do have a particular role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only comment I have made that I think the editor may have picked up is that Senators Harradine and Colston are very prudent, succinct and tactful in the particular issues they pursue in this place. I only wish Senator Margetts would learn something from their tactics, particularly with regard to the time taken for debate in this chamber, in order to achieve very effective results. If Senator Margetts perhaps understudies them a bit more, she will find that there can be a tactical improvement in many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Senator Bob Collins asked some very specific questions with regard to the issues of this legislation that do need to be addressed, particularly with regard to Darwin and Alice Springs airports. I think it is important to acknowledge that Minister Sharp has already instituted a number of reviews and inquiries that will have an important aspect of future operations of airports around Australia. In particular, I draw attention to Minister Sharp's reference to the House of Representatives standing committee of issues relating to the use of international freight and the use of regional airports and their particular involve ment. I think that is equally important to be acknowledged in this particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note Senator Collins' comments about how particular airports&mdash;similar to those raised by Senator Harradine with regard to Launceston&mdash;do have an impact in regard to other regions throughout Australia. Like Senator Collins, I share that feeling with regard to the Alice Springs airport about which the international debate arises from time to time because of its very important strategic link to central Australian tourism&mdash;in  fact, to all Australian tourism because so many tourists come through that particular airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins, I would be pleased to indicate that the way in which we would process and deal with regional interests, whether they be in Launceston or Alice Springs, will tax the government equally and will have the attention particularly of government in the leasing and regulatory strategies that we will put into place in dealing with all of those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it must be acknowledged that with regard to Darwin airport there is a peculiar situation. Like Canberra airport, Darwin's is a joint user airport that is shared with the Department of Defence. That produces challenges, problems and other issues that cannot be as easily identified as those at some of the other commercial airports around Australia. There has to be that third party, the Department of Defence, brought into any arrangements that may be made. Whilst there would certainly be an intent on the part of the government at this point in time to look at the opportunities that will arise with regard to the commercial activities at Darwin airport, they will have to be handled sensitively, having regard to the particular instances of those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bob Collins addressed the issue of relating to reasonable charges and ensuring that we could be assured that the government is very mindful of the impacts that do apply in those areas. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the government has determined that there will be price caps over the next five years and, in particular, pricing oversight arrangements to be very particularly <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3383"> addressed. If I can take Senator Collins back to our election commitment, the government developed proposals for pricing oversight of airports post-leasing, which I now summarise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A price cap will apply to all charges for aeronautical services as currently covered by the definition in the FAC Act. The ACCC will administer the price cap at major leased federal airports. There will be scope for operators to seek approval for charges for necessary new infrastructure investment, subject to support from principal users. The price caps at individual airports will be reviewed before the end of the first five-year period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I do find it somewhat galling to be patronised in the way that I was in the previous speech: if only I would sit and learn from other people I might be a well behaved senator. I have to say that a lot of people actually appreciate the hard work that we do. Many of the issues that have come out in this debate might not have come out at all unless we had done that hard work. I have to also remind  everybody that if this bill had gone through when the Labor Party were putting it through, many of these issues <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would not have been addressed at all. Last year we were saying, `We are rushing this through and there are a number of issues which really have not been addressed.' Quite clearly from this debate, that is the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday I canvassed some issues and we found out, as was again mentioned by Senator Bob Collins today, that in fact responsibility for management now lays in the hands of the lessee. If I was renting a house, which I currently am in Canberra, there would be some expectation that I be responsible, for instance, for keeping the garden neat and tidy, for mowing the lawn if there was a lawn, and for basic maintenance that was not the responsibility of the owner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considering that people will be making money out of buying leases of the FAC airports in Australia, one would like to think that, despite what we heard yesterday, there is some monitoring role&mdash;there would actually be some requirement to fund management. That means that if you purchase a lease in an area which has remnant bushland or wetlands or areas of important natural value, then you would actually include in the lease some requirement that management is funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am asking now, as a result of yesterday's statements, from the government is that there be in lease conditions of airports, particularly where there are areas of important remnant bushland or wetlands, biota, and Aboriginal lands obviously, that need to be looked after, a requirement for funding to be set aside for the management. This could include funding that could be made available to community groups if they wish to assist in the management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that is an unreasonable thing. I think, if we were to go into a situation where people can buy a lease and they can monitor it going down, they could perhaps allow rubbish, as in Perth airport, and car bodies and so on to continue. They could allow people to come in with four&hyphen;wheel drives and continue to rip up remnant bushland. What I would like to see today is perhaps some assurance from the minister that in lease conditions there will be a requirement for management to be adequately funded. I do not think this is unreasonable. I think it is a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3384"> proper expectation we should have if we are going this further step of privatising FAC airports.</PARA></SPEECH>

Similar to the previous comments we have made about assurances and non-assurances, under the Corporations Act, I believe that&mdash;if there is no actual requirement written into the lease conditions, if they are not required to do so&mdash;the company's purchasing airports may well not be able to set aside extra money to provide for management. It is my understanding that they may actually be sued by their shareholders if they use money other than for commercial reasons if they are not required to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Actually, I would not mind a situation whereby Independent senators are seen but not heard, provided that we were paid. I doubt whether we would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say this, since it has been raised, about the media: I feel that their focus should be more on government. I am quite firmly of the view that it ought be recognised that in our bicameral system the governments are made and broken in the House of Representatives. The more the focus is taken off the House of Representatives, the more they can get away with. I believe they should be more accountable to themselves in the House of Representatives. I believe the press does not do the system much good by focussing so much on the Senate. Having said that, I would just like to reiterate what we all know; that is, that the Senate is, essentially, a house of review. It is our obligation to undertake that task, and we all do it. It might take a bit of time, but we all do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other functions of the Senate, as have been mentioned by Senator Collins. The composition of the Senate is such that it does give acknowledgment to the smaller states and their need to have an adequate and equal voice in this particular <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3385"> chamber. We also have the role of protecting the rights of individuals. That has been a cherished role of this place over a long period of time. We have an audit role which requires us, of course, to thoroughly examine government expenditure. We will be doing that all next week at the estimates committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make it perfectly clear that none of us would have our position of influence&mdash;for good or otherwise&mdash;if there were not a situation in this chamber wherein each one of us has devolved upon us a very grave responsibility. That applies not only to Senator Colston and me but to every one of us here. I know that members of the major parties and also members of the Australian Democrats and Greens, within their party systems, recognise this. It should be borne in mind by the press that, if they focus on Independents in this place, they are certainly not seeing the whole picture or even 50 per cent of the picture but are merely seeing what may be 10 per cent of the picture. After all of the decisions have been made within the parties, it comes to certain votes being crucial in this chamber. The press does not focus on the developments that take place within the particular parties until the stage where the matter may become public in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise to the committee for making those comments. I would like the press to start focusing on somebody else apart from me for the practical reason that we are getting absolutely heaps of letters from everybody around Australia on every conceivable subject.

I address <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the question he raised which related to the process of the airport sales. It is acknowledged&mdash;and it is very important to recognise it&mdash;that when the Commonwealth is disposing of an asset which it in effect holds in trust on behalf of all Australian taxpayers, in the process of any disposal or change of arrangements such as leasing of airports, we must achieve an outcome which is normally best achieved by a competitive tender process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sought to indicate that it would be the government's intention in the first instance to test that market&mdash;very properly&mdash;and to ensure that it sees what interest there is. We often have to be careful not to talk down the interests of regional areas which are developing. Very often, we can tend to prop up and provide a special kiss and cuddle arrangement that tends to shield the development of very proper commercial activities in remote and regional areas. I think there is a very strong advantage in ensuring that commercial operators extend their ambit and their aim into looking away from the parochial capital city bases that so often preoccupy the funding or commercial operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Minister for Finance, Mr Fahey, indicated, we will go through the tender process to be applied.

<TIME.STAMP>(12.38 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (International Tax Agreements) Bill on behalf of my colleague Senator Sherry. The bill seeks to provide the legal authority for an international taxation agreement between the province of Taiwan and the nation state of Australia, an agreement which was signed on 29 May 1996. The agreement is in line with 36 other agreements currently in force with other countries. The purpose of concluding such agreements is to improve trade and investment flows by agreeing which nation has the right to tax certain types of income. In this manner, the threat of punitive double taxation is overcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In office, Labor presided over a major expansion in the number of agreements entered into. This agreement is consistent with that process and, as such, it will be supported by the opposition. As this is a non&hyphen;controversial piece of legislation, I will keep my comments on the bill brief. But it is well recognised that the government's legislative program is currently behind schedule and the Labor Party is concerned to ensure that there is no suggestion of undue delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, as this matter relates to taxation arrangements for business transactions, we do raise a concern about government policy, particularly for the export of uranium to the province of Taiwan. It is a funny way to engage Asia, this government's aspiration, by exporting uranium to Taiwan, knowing that not only will this actively antagonise the fastest growing market that Australia has in its region&mdash;the People's Republic of China&mdash;but also it is a market in which government to government relations impact heavily and crucially on trade and investment flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got concerns about the whole manner in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has discharged his responsibilities in this area. Before the election we said that one thing that could be guaranteed about the member for Mayo and also the present Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) was that if they took on responsibility for running Australia's diplomacy, they would be noticed in the region. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3387"> Given the way they have pursued this issue, that aspiration has been met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without taking up much more time on this bill, I reiterate the point I made earlier: investment flows between countries are critically important, given the degree of exports that Australia sends to countries in our immediate region. In government, we were very keen to ensure that these sorts of agreements were put in place as a way of facilitating, as a way of stepping out of the process of trade flows, as a way for the government basically to encourage more and more interaction, particularly within our region. This legislation embodies and gives effect to a taxation agreement totally in line with the sorts of agreements that we entered into. Because of that, we support the legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not oppose the legislation, but having been in Taiwan in the last two months, I want to make some comments. Firstly, it is high time that we reviewed Australian policy regarding the recognition of Taiwan as an independent entity in the community of nations. One of the drawbacks of not doing so is that Taiwan is forced to enter into de facto bilateral arrangements such as this. The shortcoming in that is that it is not party to many important international agreements. I want to concentrate on environmental and social justice agreements. It is not party to many of the world agreements which would put upon the Taiwanese authorities the obligation to look after their environment in a way which the rest of the world sees as essential in the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I saw in Taiwan was a dam building project for 14 dams on an island half the size of Tasmania to capture waters running off a mountain range up to 4,000 metres high which runs down the eastern side of the island. The island has 22 million people packed onto it. It is seen as one of the tigers as far as the fast growing economies of Asia are concerned. But the environmental conditions on the island, the environmental wherewithal of Taiwan, are simply horrendous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a southern city, I was taken to the largest river flowing to the ocean, where Taiwan has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what is called the great wall of garbage. For kilometres, there is garbage piled 30, 40, 50 metres high, being bulldozed into a U&hyphen;shaped valley, simply changing the course of the river. That is illegal. It has illegal operants in charge of it. I am talking here about gangster organisations which are able to undercut legitimate landfill operations on this island which is desperate for areas in which to dump its rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Meanwhile, in the river itself, other illegal operations are sandmining, to the extent where the major bridge across the river is being undercut and undermined, its foundations having been exposed for 3, 4, 5, up to 8 metres, by the effects of these illegal sandmining operations. And they are flaunting this in front of government. Nobody does anything about it, except a very brave, small band of environmentalists who end up with death threats and being threatened into silence as a result of their efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus spoke about the concern that Australian uranium ought not be finding its way into Taiwan. In earlier months of this year, the Taiwanese parliament, the Yuan, had a special vote on a fourth nuclear power station. It took three government members crossing the floor to vote down the prospect of another nuclear power station in a country where Tai Power, the huge power corporation, does not know what to do with its nuclear waste from the existing three power stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been looking at dumping that waste in the Marshall Islands. It has been looking at all sorts of non-domestic means. Its latest plan is to find a block of land on this highly populated island to dump its waste, at least as a temporary measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the way, that vote in the Yuan in Taiwan took one member being brought into the parliament on a stretcher. His problem was he had objected to the social and environmental effects of a construction operation in Taipei so the gangsters got him and cut the tendons in his arms and legs. He was in intensive care and had to be brought out of there on a stretcher to vote on that vital vote against the fourth nuclear power station.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think we should be too flippant about the very important message I am trying to bring to this Senate&mdash;that is, while we are making trading arrangements like this to benefit business with Taiwan, we ought to take some responsibility for the struggle of the Taiwanese people to protect their environment and to be able to exhibit their democratic rights, which they cannot do at the moment without fear of physical damage to themselves as well as suppression of the point of view they want to put forward. Taiwan is a democracy emerging from a dictatorship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was pleased to visit the nascent Greens Party, the newest Greens party in Asia. As I said two days ago in this place, it exhibited that sort of fearlessness which is attendant on environmental efforts in Taiwan by last year floating a boat out into the impact zone of the mainland Chinese government's rocket tests off Taiwan when China was trying to frighten voters in the lead-up to the presidential elections in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I visited the Bin Nan wetlands on the south&hyphen;west corner of Taiwan. Here we have some 3,000 hectares out of 80,000 hectares of wetlands left in this tiny island. These wetlands, amongst other things, are used by birds migrating from Siberia and Japan to Australia each year. They are disappearing at an awesome rate. This 3,000 hectares at Bin Nan is proposed as an industrial estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can cite a couple of impacts of that besides the loss of those important bird habitats. It will mean the damming of some of those rivers coming out of the mountainous eastern region of Taiwan, in particular the damming of the Yellow Butterfly River, which is famed around the world for the efflorescence of butterflies, 50 million of them, a couple of times a year in an amazing natural phenomenon which would be obliterated were the dam at Meinun to proceed in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The water table in the area of these wetlands is falling at a rate of up to eight metres as water is sucked out from underground to supply, in particular, the burgeoning industrial needs of this tiger economy. We have to accept here in this luckier country some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsibility in entering into taxation arrangements favouring trade with Taiwan to heed the calls of the Greens, the environmentalists and the average citizens of Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give one more example of the plight they find themselves in. On the day I left Taiwan, a headline in the English language newspaper was an injunction from the police commissioner in Ilun city&mdash;a million people or so in central Taiwan&mdash;that if residents continued to object to a landfill being gouged out of their suburb, he would send in 1,000 police and they would be arrested as trespassers and trouble makers. My heart goes out to those people on that tiny island who are trying to protect what little there is left of a decent living ambience, let alone the natural environment of what has been, and what remains in remnants, a magnificent, spectacular and particularly beautiful island in times gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the government to rethink its policy towards Taiwan's lack of recognition in international fora. That is going to become mightily important in the years ahead if we are going to see the Taiwan authorities take on their responsibilities for protecting their domestic environment not only for the improved livelihood of 22 million citizens but also because the Taiwanese environment is of global significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me end by saying that I would like to hear from the government that it is considering falling in with the sympathy of the majority representatives of the Taiwanese people who voted against that fourth nuclear power station by prohibiting the export of uranium from our shores into the nuclear power proposals of Tai Power and the consequential hazard they mean for the people of Taiwan, if not for all the people of the Pacific region.</PARA></SPEECH>

In the then opposition's pre-election statement there was some discussion about what the impact of cuts to the Law Reform Commission would mean and what the implications would be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were a number of questions I raised in my second reading contribution. I think Senator Vanstone undertook to give some answers to them. I note that at the moment she is trying to get some information from the officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While she is doing that, can I say that the Law Reform Commission in its some 20 years of existence has done a great deal to enhance and to promote law reform in this country. This body was set up by the previous Labor Attorney&hyphen;General Lionel Murphy in the term <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Whitlam government in the early 1970s. It is a body which, in the eyes of most observers, has continually worked over that 20&hyphen;year period in a very productive way to advance law reform within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has had some eminent chairpersons and some very competent staff over that period. It is a body which has ensured that the policy makers of this country will in the future ensure a continued vibrant existence for it. We have seen over the period of its existence, reports into a whole range of areas&mdash;reports which have led this parliament and governments to consider issues which have been quite important in the area of law reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say that the challenge of law reform is a continuing one&mdash;continuing because of not just changes within our own society but also changes in the general global context in which we operate. Reports focussing on the rights of children, on the rights of women and on the broader concepts of patents and designs have been quite critical. The continuing issue of law reform with a view to access to justice issues is one that I am sure the Law Reform Commission will also focus on in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Vanstone in her capacity as Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, I refer to your performance on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  last night in which you finally set a jobs target for the government. Asked whether unemployment would drop under your policies, you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gee, we won't get re&hyphen;elected if it doesn't.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, given that unemployment has now increased to 8.8 per cent, what target do you think you need to meet in order to guarantee your re&hyphen;election?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3391" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Faulkner for his question. I am pleased he is actively watching the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report </EMPHASIS> when I am appearing. Because he was actively watching it he will understand quite clearly what was said. The question that was put to me was: well, if you get your major structural changes through. As you would well understand, Madam President, if a government cannot get its major structural changes through, then not a lot is going to change. I responded with respect to that that I would not expect we would get much joy from the electorate if things do not improve. I would have thought that was axiomatic and simple and that anyone would understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the key point that you might like to bear in mind, Senator Faulkner, is that we went to the last election with clear policies that we wanted to implement&mdash;clear policies that indicated what structural change needed to be made. First and foremost amongst those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3392"> were changes to the industrial relations legislation. Month after month we see figures on the trend&mdash;which is, of course, the most important figure to look at; more than the seasonally adjusted figures that jump about on a month to month basis&mdash;that show we have a very stable and flat labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That should tell even the likes of yourself, Senator Faulkner, that something needs to be done to make a change. We had five years of growth under the previous government and still unacceptably highly levels of unemployment. That should tell you that policies needed to change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need this industrial relations legislation passed. We need the unfair unfair dismissal law wiped out, and we need to replace it with a fair unfair dismissal law. What you and your colleagues and the Democrats might like to bear in mind, Senator Faulkner, is that you can sit there in opposition as long as you want and be as difficult as you choose. You can collectively, if you want to, with a bit of other support, block these major structural changes that the economy desperately needs to bite into unemployment, but I give you this prediction as well: if you do not support the changes, if you block the changes that need to be made, the electorate will judge you just as harshly.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My supplementary question relates to part of the answer given by Senator Vanstone in relation to the industrial relations reform agenda of this government. I ask you, Minister: hasn't Professor Wooden, the author of the NILS report&mdash;which was commissioned by you&mdash;said that the workplace relations legislation will have no impact on jobs growth this century? Minister, is that why you will not specify a target?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. I did see those remarks attributed to Professor Wooden. I have not spoken to him myself, nor have I seen anything in writing from him. But let me tell you something else the Professor said. The Professor also said that the predictions made by the National Institute of Labour Studies were not on the basis of a continuation of Labor's policies. How, for the life of me, the Professor managed to come to that conclusion, I do not know, because, as you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> well know, when an economist makes a prediction they make a prediction on certain assumptions. I can assure you of this: the National Institute of Labour Studies predictions were not based on structural changes taking place in the economy. They were, therefore, based on the economy being structured as it is now and I thought the Professor's remarks in that respect were most out of place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was of a mind to ring him about it. I have not had the time yet, but I may do so. I just remind you that you can get one view from one professor and one from another. That, I gather, was an off the cuff view of the Professor, because he was not asked by us to comment on the consequence of industrial relations changes as we intend to implement them. He was not asked to comment on that, and I presume he therefore has not given it serious consideration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is directed to Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications. Minister, what were the main outcomes of the APEC ministerial meeting on the telecommunications and information industry that you hosted last week? How do you assess the benefits to Australia from the event?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3392" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The APEC ministerial meeting of telecommunications ministers last week was indeed a very significant event: 17 APEC economies were represented at the highest level and there was a very high degree of unanimity about some of the major issues. Almost all of the member economies were very much committed to proceeding down the trade liberalisation path as quickly as possible. Many of them have concerns to ensure that that progress is matched by economic development and human resources development. There was a general recognition that the old models of state owned monopolies were indeed in most instances already obsolete and that plurality and competition were going to be very important issues for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also stress the significance of consumer benefits being the paramount concern. Certainly, the ministers were very interested in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3393"> issues such as technical conformance and, in particular, the transparency of universal service obligations. I stress once again that there was a very clear understanding on the part of all representatives of the APEC economies that universal service obligations are part and parcel of the landscape, that all countries must have them, that there is a need for ongoing cross&hyphen;subsidisation. It is simply a matter of setting the rules of the game and the telecommunications carriers have to play by them. It was indeed a very significant conference and made considerable progress towards goals which we all aspire to in terms of greater competition leading to lower prices, better quality of service and more products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also true to say that there were a couple of other interesting developments. One was when the Mexican minister for telecommunications informed me that Mexico has significant interests in not one&mdash;as I had previously thought&mdash;but both Cuban telecommunications carriers: the fixed line carrier and the mobile carrier. When I asked him if this was a Fidel aberration, he told me that no, it was not. In fact, his discussions with Cuban ministers indicated that there was a very high level of understanding of the need for much greater competition in the utility field generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I suppose the most significant event was that several representatives of APEC economies came up to me during the conference and asked me why it was that the ALP in this country was now blocking the partial privatisation of Telstra when the ALP in government had privatised almost everything in sight. I made it clear that the logic of this position was quite beyond me. One of them told me that he had had discussions with people he described as leading members of the ALP frontbench, several of whom he said he had previously thought were quite intelligent people. It was a very short list and I have to regretfully advise Senator Schacht he was not on that list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said to me that what they had told him was very disturbing indeed. I think it has significant implications for the region because the answer was, `Look, you've got to understand this is political.' There it was, Madam <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> President. At a very significant international conference, I was being told that representatives of significant APEC economies simply could not understand why the ALP was being so opportunistic and not putting the national interest first when they recognised that there were enormous benefits to be gained from going down this path. I have to say that I found it very difficult to defend the position that was being taken. I made it clear that ultimately I was confident that logic and commonsense would prevail and the weight of public opinion would ensure that we ultimately got the right result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Labor Party's spokesman for superannuation scaremongering for that question. He will never be forgiven for the unsubstantiated, totally untrue assertions about superannuation that he made during the election campaign which deliberately caused unnecessary and huge fear for millions of Australians. He will never ever be forgiven and forgotten for that. I find it quite amazing that Labor has become so irrelevant in such a short time and devoid of so many thoughts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank Senator Sherry for his question because it does give me the opportunity to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3394"> welcome again the opposition's support for the introduction of the contribution surcharge on higher income earners. I also note in doing that that this government inherited from Labor an inequitable and complex superannuation system which was all its own doing. The surcharge introduces a greater fairness into the system than has been there at all during Labor's previous reign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now it is true that the proposal does provide a challenge in its implementation. But given the overall system benefits, it is a challenge worth taking on and the industry benefits significantly from the tax concessions applying to superannuation, and with those come regulations and costs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have made crystal clear, both the government and yesterday the tax commissioner in a speech in Sydney, is that if the salary repackaging does occur to a significant extent and in a way that could cause revenue loss and leakage through, in effect, a rorting of the system, then the government will consider the matter at that time and take whatever measures are necessary and appropriate to protect the revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer. Minister, everyone is aware of the gross <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> neglect of Australian families under 13 years of Labor and how much the gap between rich and poor widened during that time. In the light of this, could you please enlighten the Senate as to how much better off families will be as a result of the recent reduction in home loan interest rates and how much better off they will be as a result of the Howard government's family tax initiative.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="3394" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Troeth for that question, which enables me to point out the very stark contrast between what happened to Australian families, the lifeblood of our nation, many of whom are also small business people, under Labor's 13 years of misrule and what this government has already put in train to correct that situation. It is true, as Senator Troeth has acknowledged in her question, that Labor's policies when in office effectively ignored Australian families. Not only did they ignore Australian families; the impact of the policies that they did introduce caused enormous damage to Australian families. During that period, and as a result of Labor's incompetence, home mortgage rates rose to 17 per cent, which dashed many families' hopes of buying a home and even forced many families into extreme financial hardship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all remember the so-called recession we had to have, which was a recession we should never have had to have and which forced unemployment up to 11 per cent. Nor will we forget the savage increase on families in recent budgets in terms of sales tax increases and the like. Indeed, in the 1995 budget the sales tax burden on families increased by no less than $60 per week. So that is the former government's record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian people acknowledged that overwhelmingly on 12 March when they threw that lot out of office comprehensively and showed that Labor, by 2 March, had become as irrelevant then as it is now. That was acknowledged by the Secretary of the Labor Party, Gary Gray, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We couldn't campaign on a positive policy agenda because no-one believed us; they thought that we were liars. We couldn't campaign on our record because by and large the perception of our record was that it was stuffed. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3395"> </PARA>
<PARA>I think most Australians said amen to that. In stark contrast to Labor's neglect, under this government we have already seen welcome falls in home loan rates. Variable home loan rates offered by the major banks since earlier this year have fallen from 10.5 to 9.25 per cent. That is a fall in interest rates of 10 per cent and delivers a benefit of $88 a month on a $100,000, 25-year loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fixed home loan rates have already fallen since the budget, delivering a very substantial benefit to families taking out these loans. For example, five-year fixed home loan rates offered by the Commonwealth and NABS have fallen from 9.75 to 8.95 per cent. We are, therefore, helping Australian families to achieve their dream of home ownership. We also delivered on 20 August in the budget our electoral commitment to Australian families in the form of major assistance to families with young children, a tax initiative which was a $1 billion a year injection into the paypackets and pockets of Australian families. We have also assisted them in numerous other ways, for example with private health cover. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

Can you explain how these people will use their superannuation investments or, as your colleague Senator Short put it yesterday, `avail themselves of their superannuation' without drawing down and eroding that investment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget numbers are of course accurate. They are the estimates of what will be the event. The reason for giving numbers of some people who will be affected and some people who will lose entitlement&mdash;and over the totality of Australians with superannuation over 55 they are very small numbers&mdash;relates to the fact that they are people in positions where they can contribute to or totally support themselves in their early retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party is continuing to run a scare campaign which essentially means that they are trying to advocate on behalf of the most well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do elements of Australia. I had an example given to me just yesterday by Senator Calvert, for example, who said that a bank employee came to him complaining about this new measure. Why does he complain? Because next year when this measure comes into place he is going to have to be much more reliant upon his own resources instead of those of the taxpayer, which he is currently enjoying. He took early retirement from his bank and had $285,000 in superannuation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3398">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that that is the group of people the Labor Party is speaking for. If so, it is a pretty good example of what has happened to this country. Continually over the last few years special interest groups, particularly people at the higher end of town, have been advantaged by a Labor government. That is one of the reasons why the battlers of Australia decided they were going to tip Labor out. Those who were getting on in life and raising children were finding it extraordinarily difficult and they could see their taxes assisting people at the top end of town. The frustration that that led to was enough to tip Labor out of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying that people on low superannuation incomes in fact will not be affected or minimally affected, depending on their circumstances. We are doing nothing more than introducing the means test at 55 for people who have been out of work for nine months that they will have to face at 65. If they are effectively retired, there is no injustice in that whatsoever. The taxpayer should not be asked first to support them, only to top up the support that they may need if in fact their superannuation is in the middle levels. As I said earlier, I think it is extraordinary that Labor continues to argue that people who are on high incomes and with high assets should somehow still be entitled to support from the battlers.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Brown for his question. He did give me some advance notice of this question and I am in fact responding on behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services rather than the Treasurer because it falls into that area of responsibility. First&hyphen;class travel entitlements for parliamentarians derive from a determination of the remuneration tribunal. Records of public servant travel are held by individual agencies and a consolidated estimated cost reduction is not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is committed to reducing costs, and currently we have processes in train to cut the travel costs of federal parliamentarians and their staff. There have, outside of that, already been some savings achieved by a redesign of airline schedules. For example, commuter services between Canberra and Sydney are now all economy, I understand, as are most Canberra-Brisbane services. This is now true of most Canberra-Melbourne services as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what the government is putting in train to look at cutting travel costs, in part they involve the establishment of a preferred travel service provider contract. Tenders were invited on 31 August for such a preferred <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3399"> travel supplier arrangement covering domestic and international air travel by federal MPs and their staff. Lower fares, better discounts, reduced administration and potential use of frequent flyer points for additional discounts are being sought. Prospective tenderers were briefed this morning, I understand, and establishment of these new arrangements is expected by early November, initially covering a two-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has already implemented a new policy restricting the use of frequent flier points by parliamentarians and their staff to official travel only, thereby reducing the cost. Australian Public Service wide statistics are not readily available, as I said, but an example would be the Department of Administrative Services where, of an annual volume of some 15,000 trips, less than four per cent are first&hyphen;class travel and by personal choice business class is used in lieu of first class three times as often. Significant discounts are achieved by the Australian Public Service under the preferred travel service provider arrangements being adopted for parliamentarians, and additional savings are also achieved by a departmental policy of planning travel to take account of discount fares and best fare of the day arrangements under the preferred travel service provider contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to this comprehensive review of its travel policies, the government announced many measures in the budget to further streamline the operations of the Department of Administrative Services, including the sale of five government businesses and the corporatisation of one other, the sale or refinancing of Dasfleet's 18,000 vehicles, the sale of 11 commercial properties in the Commonwealth property portfolio, realising approximately $100 million this year, and a $20 million reduction in Commonwealth advertising for 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, of course, since coming to power in March the Howard government has cut the number of government portfolios from 30 to 28 and cut the number of ministerial staff from former Prime Minister Keating's 365 to 294&mdash;a cut of 20 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Eggleston for that question. Madam President, as you would no doubt be aware, earlier this week some Austudy regulations were disallowed by this chamber. I have no quibble, obviously, with the chamber's right to do that&mdash;it is a good and sensible procedure to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have&mdash;but what Australians need to recognise is that the regulations that were disallowed were not regulations put out initially by this government; they were regulations put out by the previous government, the people opposite. Those regulations were a reflection, in part, of the previous government's last budget&mdash;their 1995-96 budget families package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that means is that the decisions that were embodied in those regulations were decisions taken by the cabinet members, as they then were, now shadow cabinet members&mdash;at least some are&mdash;which they endorsed. They are decisions which were taken to the caucus and which were endorsed. These regulations were taken out to Government House and approved by the Governor-General, and the name on the bottom was `Hon. Ross Free'. When I mentioned that these were, in fact, the previous government's regulations, people opposite said, `Oh, well, he's lost his seat.'

<PARA>What we have had clearly exposed in this chamber over the last two days is a clear conflict between two ministers in this government&mdash;two inexperienced ministers in the government, two ministers who fumbled, bumbled and stumbled their way through on this issue, both desperately trying to protect their own ministerial interests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is, of course, it is not possible to do that because there is a clear conflict between them. On the one hand, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, proudly proclaimed&mdash;and I quote her words during question time yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the funding runs until the end of December this year, so it is for 3&half; years that we are honouring that commitment to that program. I am sorry if I misled the Senate in any way. It was quite inadvertent.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Newman tried to make political capital out of the point that the Commonwealth dental health program was to end in 1997. The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, desperately tried to wheedle his way out of the hole in which he had dug himself because the Howard government has tried to extract savings from a non&hyphen;existent program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the issue that has been exposed in question time today. Of course, they are embarrassed, because the Commonwealth dental health program represents nothing more than another broken promise of the Howard government. It has been exposed in here that this mob want their cake and want to eat it, too. Not only do they want to end the program, not only do they want to ensure that through the cessation of the Commonwealth dental health program any Commonwealth responsibility and support for the dental care of poor, disadvantaged and low income Australians ends, not only have they perpetrated a very cruel and mean budget measure, but they want to claim savings from a program that they say is non&hyphen;existent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot have it both ways. Senator Short and Senator Newman cannot both be right. If you go to the portfolio budget statements of the Health and Family Services portfolio, on page 149 we see part 7: `the cessation of the Commonwealth dental health program'. It outlines the savings over the forward estimates period: in 1996&hyphen;97, savings of $55.6 million; in 1997&hyphen;98, $112.8 million; in 1998&hyphen;99, $114.5 million; and in 1999&hyphen;2000, $116.5 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two Saturday nights ago, I went to a quiz night to raise funds for a local preschool. I say to honourable senators and anyone else who is listening to this debate, it was an interesting quiz night because it was actually multiple choice. It would have been a lot easier for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) to get the answer right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not have wanted Senator Faulkner on my table because he is the sort of guy who will look at the four alternatives and, because he cannot decide which one is right, say they are all wrong or one of the other ones might be wrong. So, Senator Faulkner, do not invite me to a fund raiser quiz night for the New South Wales Left faction of the ALP because I will not come to your table. I like winning; I do not like losing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This guy was a minister in the former government, a minister in the defeated and disgraced Keating Labor government. He knows what forward estimates are about. This bloke actually knows a lot about forward estimates, a lot more than most of the people on the other side of this place. He talks about <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> phantom savings. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is the phantom. He knows all about phantom savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his own environment portfolio budget when he was the minister, this caring and sharing sort of latter day Green former minister for the environment, Senator Faulkner, identified savings in the environment and environment related programs of $55.7 million.

I know that you ruled yesterday during taking note of answers to questions that it is reasonable for senators to range broadly across issues, but I put it to you that, on this particular occasion, it would not be unreasonable to call the senator to order to at least make some attempt to make his comments relevant to the motion that is before the chair.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

This is the man who came to the Australian public and said that in the environment portfolio, this crucial issue, he actually found $55.7 million worth of savings against a relatively meagre budget in the forward estimates for 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3407">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This previous minister also has experience in the sports budget. He has the great honour of going down in the history of Australia of having reduced the sports budget in the forward estimates by $34 million, a one-third reduction in the sports budget in an Olympic year&mdash;a brilliant performance. The previous minister and now Leader of the Opposition in the Senate seeks not to understand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting back to the quiz night, he cannot understand because he will not hear or he does not know. The fact of the matter is the dental program did have provision made in the forward estimates for a number of the outyears. The previous government had not made a decision to continue the dental health program by the time they so ignominiously lost the election in March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cared so little about the dental health program in November and December and in all of the cabinet and ministry discussions leading up to then that they chose not to make a decision about the dental health program. Six months down the track, we get this absolute false indignation. They are using language like heinous and disgraceful and disgusting. They are saying things like, `Poor people can't get their health treatments and the states won't pick up the tab.' They care now, six months later, but when they were in government in February, March, April, May, June, July and August, right through to Christmas last year, right through to March, as a cabinet and as a Labor government, they chose not to make a decision and not to replace the funding for the dental health program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fiscal reality, the reality that Senator Short had to deal with and dealt with&mdash;as did Senator Newman in an absolutely consistent way&mdash;was that provision had been made in the forward estimates. The previous cabinet had not made a decision, but there was provision in the forward estimates. This cabinet made a decision. They have made a lot of very good decisions. Where the previous government failed to make decisions, we actually took some hard decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took some hard decisions that will impact upon the services that a number of people across this country receive. We all <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know the reason is that we were left with something like an $8 billion come $10 billion black hole&mdash;we were spending $8 billion to $10 billion or more a year as a nation than we could afford. We were tabbing it up on the bankcard to the tune of $100 billion a year ensuring that future generations of Australians would have to pay higher interest rates and higher taxes than they need to so we made these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality, the nub, of this issue is that those forward estimates had been made. They were in the budget. We took a decision and they are savings against those outyear forward estimates. They are real savings. What Senator Short has said is absolutely accurate. What Senator Newman has said is absolutely accurate. There is no discrepancy or inconsistency in what they say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only discrepancy and inconsistency is between how the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories behaved when he was in government and how he talks now he is in opposition. He is talking about phantom savings. He is the expert when it comes to phantom savings. That is why he should now be called the phantom Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard from Senator Campbell&mdash;the new assistant Treasurer, one assumes, because Senator Short and Senator Newman fled the chamber when we started to highlight the amazing discrepancy in the budget papers. Aside from wandering around sports nights, quiz nights, the Left of the Labor Party and sports funding, after some three or four minutes Senator Campbell finally started to justify why the new government had abolished the Commonwealth dental program. The Commonwealth dental program, as everyone is aware, particularly the 55,000 people in my home state of Tasmania who have been beneficiaries of this program, is a very effective program. He attempted to justify that by talking about the government's approach to the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell failed to mention the fact that on the one hand Senator Newman has come in here and said publicly&mdash;indeed, I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3408"> have seen letters she has written to people explaining why the program had to be abolished&mdash;that Labor was not going to fund the program past its four&hyphen;year period. That was her initial explanation. She then came in here on the second day and corrected herself, saying that it was due for completion at the end of this year, in December. That is her claim; that is her justification for the apparent abolition of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the opposition, on checking the budget statements, notes on page 395 that it is listed as a saving not just up until the end of this calendar year but its effect on outlays&mdash;this is for a program that, according to Senator Newman, does not exist after this year&mdash;is a saving of $112.8 million in 1997-98, $114.5 million from 1998 to 1999 and $116.5 to the year 2000. That is a total of $343 million from a program that, according to Senator Newman, does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government makes a great deal about its so-called charter of budget honesty. It is an amazing approach to budget honesty to claim that you found the saving of $343 million from nothing. According to Senator Newman and Senator Short, who continues to assure us that Senator Newman is absolutely correct, this dental program apparently was not going to run past December this year but the new government has manufactured savings of $343 million over the next three years. That is an interesting practice of accounting procedures. If these are the new sort of accounting procedures that are to be practised under the so-called charter of budget honesty, absolutely no-one who was reputably audited in this country would get away with that sort of approach of claiming that there is a program that does not exist, and that is why it is not continuing, and saying you can save $343 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was Senator Short's response? He assured us that this new creative accounting is absolutely spot on and there isn't a problem. They have found $343 million in savings for a program that does not exist. Senator Short is the Assistant Treasurer. He will front up to estimates next week. It will be a long haul for him if thinks he can give this sort of explanation to the Labor opposition&mdash;this sort <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of creative accounting. Senator Short will have to front up next week and explain how you can manufacture $343 million in savings from a program that does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It goes to the heart of the integrity of Senator Short and Senator Newman to attempt to assure this Senate and the Australian people that they can manufacture $343 million from nothing. This is just a continuation, particularly from Senator Short, of a series of misleading answers to specific questions, or non-answers in Senator Short's case and in Senator Newman's case. They will not answer questions. When they do answer questions, they contradict each other. When they do go to industry associations and conferences, they do not answer questions. When they do attempt an answer to a question, they give the wrong answer.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to speak on the motion to take note of Senator Short's answer. Despite some of the frivolous remarks and the matters raised by members of the government in this debate, it is of great concern to the many members of the community who have taken advantage of the dental health scheme funded by the federal government to date that the government has seen fit to abolish the program in this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some time we have been trying to elicit some real information about what the effect of these budget cuts might be but, despite some of the personal abuse and irrelevant matters raised by those on the other side&mdash;both by Senator Newman and by Senator Short&mdash;we have been unable to elicit the information that the community would like to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3410"> know, that is, what the effect of abolishing the dental health scheme will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I originally asked Senator Newman what the effect of abolishing the program would be. She responded only by saying that the former Keating government introduced a four&hyphen;year program which was to come to an end this coming year. She then added a little bit to it the next day in response to a question from Senator Faulkner, when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the funding runs until the end of December this year, so it is for 3&half; years that we are honouring that commitment to that program.</PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty is that she has failed to appreciate that the people who have relied on this program to date are really concerned about what it is going to mean for them. What it means for the health card holders and the pensioners is that they will return to the situation that they were in before this Commonwealth program was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This program was introduced because access to dental care for those who are not very well off was very poor. People in the community who were less well off only had access to dental care when they were in severe pain or when they were having their teeth extracted. The federal Labor government, which believed in equity in access to health, thought it was appropriate that these funds should be provided. In fact, these funds were successful in that they reduced the waiting list from two years or more to, in most cases, about one month. That meant that health card holders and pensioners had real access to care: not just emergency care and not just extractions. The abuse of those people&mdash;those people who are less well off and who really require our assistance&mdash;has been exacerbated by the way this matter has been dealt with here in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that Senator Newman's only defence was that the program was to conclude at the end of the next financial year, the government has sought to make hay on the deprivations of that group of people by claiming to have made budget savings. They have claimed budget savings in years&mdash;according to Senator Newman&mdash;when the dental health program did not exist. It started off with savings of $112 million and $114 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million and then, in the year 1999, $116.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Not only has Senator Newman failed to provide for and to protect the people in our community who need assistance, not only has she deprived them of a service that they desperately need, not only has she relegated them to having no real dental care and to having extraction care rather than dental health treatment, she has also jumped on top of them and sought to gain political advantage by claiming these budget savings from them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the same matter, Mr Deputy President: the sanctity of the forward estimates has always been something that the Department of Finance has protected with immense zeal over the years, always to the regret of existing governments, I have to say. The moment you have a glimmer of an idea of expenditure, and you express it in a formalised way, they put that in the forward estimates. Therefore, the treatment of forward estimates documents has to be done very seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this matter, I suspect Senator Newman's view was correct up to a point: that limited programs are carried in the forward estimates. Unless and until the government makes another decision that they are not continued in forward estimates, it is always an option of government to put them in forward estimates the moment they make a formal decision. What we have here is a forward estimates program, going over this financial year and the following three years, that has savings from a program that was not previously in the forward estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was absolutely interesting today that the times when Senator Short was invited to answer this question he failed to answer the question. He always stays around for the noting of answers so he can debate these matters, but today he disappeared at the rate of knots. The reason why is that he cannot answer it. He would have been much better coming in here and saying, `I don't understand why the forward estimates show a saving of over $340 million in the outyears when my colleague has said that it was due to end.' He should have said, `I will go back <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3411"> to the Department of Finance and bring in an explanation here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All he could do was refer to Senator Newman's answer each time he was challenged and say that it was correct. He brought no intellectual ability or analysis or anything else to the answer other than the weak response, `Surely Senator Newman is right, and I agree with her.' Where is the intellectual rigour of the Assistant Treasurer? He has come into this chamber in the six months of this government and has failed to understand and comprehend questions. All he can do is go on with bumptious rhetoric, inept polemics and abuse based on his MPI speeches of the last 10 or 12 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see my Victorian colleague sitting over there. He was quite an energetic shadow minister but he is not in the ministry. How did he miss the ministry when Senator Short occupies that waste of space? It is absolutely incredible. I wonder what the Kemp brothers did wrong, I really do. Even Senator Kemp over there, from his previous incarnations, would understand the concept of outyears in the estimates, but Senator Short has no grasp of them. I say this: he can run today, but at the estimates next Wednesday he is going to have to answer those questions.</PARA>

They will be grouped strategically into Sectors, such as food processing or wool and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3412"> textiles, to focus on the needs of specific research users; and into Alliances, such as agribusiness, which will facilitate CSIRO's relationship with a group of sectors. The Institute structure remained in place alongside the new structure, during the transition period, to 30 June 1996. The Government will consider any recommendations made by the CSIRO Board as a consequence of the evaluation, which bear on its management and structure as specified in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the specific recommendations the Government's response is, in the order that they were made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.1<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Agreed:  CSIRO has been restructured to reduce layers of management, including eliminating the layer of administration associated with the Institutes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.2<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Agreed:  The new structure and arrangements enable direct communication with workplaces through participation of all Deputy Chief Executives in Board meetings and all Chiefs of Divisions in Executive Forums, so that they can inform and involve their staff in consideration of major issues</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.5<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Agreed. In addition to the new arrangements for better communication with workplaces, CSIRO has a Consultative Council which regularly considers, and reports to the Board on, matters affecting or of general interest to CSIRO staff members. The Council comprises persons nominated by the Board to represent the management of CSIRO and representatives of organisations of staff members. The Consultative Council through its Human Resource Policy Subcommittee has formed a Working Party on Industrial Participation and Best Practice. The Working Group has examined Industrial Participation across the Organisation and in other organisations and recently prepared a draft document to replace the 1989 Industrial Participation Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.6<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Agreed. Under the Act it is the responsibility of the Board to ensure the proper and efficient performance of CSIRO's functions; to determine the policy of the Organisation; and to give direction to the Chief Executive. The affairs of the Organisation are to be conducted by the Chief Executive in accordance with the Act and with any policies determined, and any direction given, by the Board. Both the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive, as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a member of the Board, report to the Minister. In the current Triennium Funding Agreement, CSIRO agreed to report to the Minister, in its annual report, on performance, including the use of performance indicators.</PARA>

It operates through and with the established extension agencies. The links between the people involved in extension activities and researchers are extremely important and CSIRO is committed to fostering such relationships. CSIRO is increasingly looking to work with private sector extension agencies, R&amp;D Corporations and with landholder groups, including Landcare, in information delivery, as well as promoting a more collaborative and iterative relationship with State Departments.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The publication of a synopsis of the types and volumes of derivatives being traded, together with details of regulatory developments, could provide an overview of  the operations of derivatives markets for the benefit of members of Parliament, regulators, market participants and other persons who have a need for information in this area. The ASC has itself drawn attention to the importance of having available comprehensive and up to date information on the operation of derivatives markets in general.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the same time, it must be appreciated that the Corporations Law currently confers only a limited jurisdiction over derivatives on the ASC. The ASC regulates derivatives only if they fall within the current definition of "securities" or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> "futures contract" in the Corporations Law. The great majority of products traded on over the counter ('OTC') markets, namely interest rate and foreign currency contracts, are specifically excluded from the Corporations Law and regulation by the ASC. Under current law the ASC could not require bodies which deal in products not subject to the Corporations Law to provide information about the trading of such products. If information about only those derivatives currently classified as "securities" or "futures contracts" and regulated by the ASC were to be included in the ASC's Annual Report, it may present a misleading picture of the Australian derivatives market. As the Committee notes, a comprehensive review of the regulation of derivatives in Australia, including the extent of the ASC's jurisdiction over derivatives trading, is currently being undertaken by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government also notes that information about the types and volumes of derivatives being traded in Australia is currently compiled and published by a number of bodies including industry associations such as the Australian Financial Markets Association (AFMA) and self regulatory organisations such as the SFE and the ASX.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> AFMA has conducted an annual statistical survey of derivatives markets since 1993. Its 1995 Report provides comprehensive data on all sections of Australian wholesale financial markets and includes data on exchange traded markets.</PARA>

It proposes to extend its data collections in association with the proposed introduction of a capital charge to cover banks' exposure to market risk. In 1995 the Reserve Bank conducted a survey of foreign exchange and derivatives markets in Australia (covering both bank and non&hyphen;bank institutions) as part of a global survey co&hyphen;ordinated by the Bank of International Settlements  The results were published in December, 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In addition, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has instituted a new Quarterly Survey of Superannuation which will collect information on direct derivatives usage by the largest 1,100 superannuation funds (essentially those with assets in excess of $10 million).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994 when officers of the Australian Public Service were compulsorily transferred to the ACT Government Service, the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Act 1994 were introduced to allow ACT officers to apply for selection on merit for positions advertised in the Gazette as vacancies in the Australian Public Service. Similar provisions are provided in ACT legislation for Australian Public Service officers to apply for ACT vacancies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the changes in the administration of the Australian child care system will dramatically increase the cost of child care for most Australian families;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have not got a personal interest, have you?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just about to declare before I started, as I have in all such debates, that my personal interest is not a pecuniary one. I am a father of two young children&mdash;at least, to the best of my knowledge only two&mdash;and both attend a child-care centre for a couple of days a week. That is to facilitate my partner also working, although unfortunately she has had to work only part-time in recent years because of my full-time employment. So that is my personal interest, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3423"> if you like, in the matter. Child care is a matter that a lot of Australians have an interest in as most of us belong to families and have relationships with children in one form or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion seeks to highlight the cost to families of the changes made in the budget, the failure of the family tax initiative to compensate for those increased costs and the impact this will have on women. I am sure my fellow Labor Party speakers will concentrate on some of those issues, as I hope to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for us to realise the changing nature of our society&mdash;the number of families that have two parents working has increased and the demand for child care in our society has risen dramatically in recent years. Since 1983 the number of places for child care in Australia has risen by 500 per cent. There has been an enormous growth in child&hyphen;care places. Over half a million children are in care. About 34 per cent of children under four are in some form of formal care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an enormous industry. It is an industry in which the Australian community must have a close interest because it is about the care and development of our very young children. As I said, it is no longer just a small sector but a large vitally important sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that position, the Liberal Party went to the last election promising to retain and improve the child&hyphen;care system that the Labor Party had built over its 13 years in government. The coalition promised that it had no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy. That promise was given by Mr Kemp&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TROETH" NAMEID="GX5">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sorry. It was given by Dr Kemp, who was the then shadow spokesperson. They also promised that a coalition government would maintain the non&hyphen;means tested child&hyphen;care cash rebate, and they generally argued that they would broaden child&hyphen;care options for the community. The Liberal Party went to the election promising to protect and improve the child&hyphen;care system that had been established by the Labor government.  </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly in this budget they totally reneged on those promises. Apart from the obvious breaking of their promises to maintain the operational subsidy and to not means test the child&hyphen;care rebate, they have chipped away at a number of the provisions that are at the centre of child&hyphen;care assistance and the child&hyphen;care system in this country. They have used child care from which to drag back a massive $504 million over the next four years. They have attacked the child&hyphen;care system to raise revenue for this budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of those attacks on child care is a massive dislocation to the system and an enormous increase in fees to parents. The recent EPAC report indicated that the removal of the operational subsidy from subsidised child&hyphen;care centres would represent a cost of $14 per week per child over three and a cost of $21 per week per child under three. So you can see that the removal of the subsidy is going to have an enormous impact on parents through increased fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget the government also removed $282 million from child&hyphen;care assistance through a series of measures that nicked and cut to restrict child&hyphen;care assistance and to restrict access to child&hyphen;care assistance. They were even so mean as to provide that there would be no indexation over the next two years, so that those currently receiving child&hyphen;care assistance would receive no compensation as fees increase in line with the CPI but would rather have their assistance reduced in relative terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Government have also walked away from the Labor Party's commitment to build more child&hyphen;care places, so the Labor program for 5,500 new places between now and the year 2000 has been abolished and those places will not be provided. The Liberal government is relying on the private centres to provide for the demand that is emerging for child&hyphen;care places in this country. So the budget represents a massive attack on child care and on parents' capacity to enrol their children in good quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to our estimates, more than 330,000 families will pay more for child care as a result of the various budget initiatives. These families will get no benefit from the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3424"> family tax initiative that was also contained in the budget. Whatever small amounts those families would have received by way of taxation relief will be completely eroded by the increased child&hyphen;care costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also represents, in my view, a thinly disguised attempt to close community based child&hyphen;care centres. The Liberal Party for a long time had difficulty accepting the role of community based centres in our system, and I think these changes are an attempt to close those centres, to drive them out of the market and to leave child care as a purely private, profit driven market with no community input into child care and child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, that is a great shame because the role that community based child&hyphen;care centres have played in developing quality child care and in improving the child care available to Australian children and Australian families has been excellent. I commend the community based child&hyphen;care centres and their staff for the role that they have played over the years. They have provided choice, quality and leadership on a range of issues and have provided assistance to disadvantaged children. They have helped meet special needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An obvious area where they have been involved in which private centres have not been keen to take a role is in the area of providing places for children under the age of two. It is very hard to find places for children under two in private centres because of the higher costs required in meeting the supervision needs of those children. But the community based centres have filled that need in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have also allowed for parental input into the control of their centres and the development of their children and have been a focus for a lot of community activities. So they have played a very useful role in building community spirit, in involving parents in the care of their children and in assisting parents learn how to be good parents and how to meet the development needs of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that I do not say that these needs are not met in part by private centres. My comments are not meant as an attack on private centres&mdash;I have visited a number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very good private centres. But there is a role for community based centres in our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that we should be moving to what is effectively a child&hyphen;care system solely dominated by the private sector and market forces, because I think that we would end up with a lesser system, a system without the same quality and without the same capacity to deliver as currently is provided. The community based centres have in many ways acted as a benchmark for the private centres and have forced standards to be applied that otherwise might not have been applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP will be opposing the child&hyphen;care cutbacks that were contained in the budget. We will be looking very closely at each of the bills as they come into this place. We will be seeking to defend what we can of the community based child&hyphen;care centres' role and to defend the rights of parents to good quality child care at an affordable price. We will highlight the fact that the Liberal Party promised these people that their child&hyphen;care places would be safe, that the system, the assistance and the rebates they had enjoyed under the previous administration would be maintained. We will be trying to hold you to what is obviously now considered to be a non&hyphen;core election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you from the experience I have had of talking to families around Perth&mdash;I attended a meeting the other night of 300 or so people at the University of Western Australia&mdash;that there are a lot of very angry people out there. Many of them believed the coalition when it said that it would maintain the current child&hyphen;care system, that it would maintain the community based system. They are becoming acutely aware of what Liberal Party promises mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the argument about increased costs, I think it is quite obvious there will be significant increased costs to parents of children who attend community based centres. As I said, the EPAC figures indicated that the costs per child were somewhere between $14 and $21 per week. The centres I have spoken to receive an operational subsidy of somewhere between $30,000 to $45,000 per annum. That is $30,000 to $45,000 per centre that will be removed from their budgets. For <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3425"> some of them, this represents 10 per cent or more of their total costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These centres do not have many options. They are not for profit. They do not have the ability to carry over losses and profits. Their only answers are to increase costs or to start doing things like cutting the amount of food or the quality of food they provide to the children, or reducing the number of staff employed to care for those children. There are not a lot of options. They run a very tight operation as it is and most of the centres I have spoken to&mdash;and I have spoken to at least a dozen so far&mdash;have indicated they will just have to pass most of the costs on to the parents. So those centres are looking at having to significantly increase the cost to the parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget, to be fair to the government, admits this is the case. The budget papers state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is potential for increased costs for some families using community based centres as the result of the removal of the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>Even the budget concedes that the subsidised centres will have to pass on these costs to families of children enrolled in these child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just the subsidised centres that will suffer&mdash;or the families who use subsidised centres. The costs for families whose children attend private centres will also rise. The cap on assistance to a maximum of 50 hours a week, the changes to child&hyphen;care assistance, and the freeze on the fee ceilings for the cash rebate and child&hyphen;care assistance will all force up the costs to every parent with a child in child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All will have to pay more. Well over 300,000 families will be paying more. Some of those families with two or three children in child care will be paying a great deal more for their child care. My estimates are that some will be paying anywhere between $40 and $90 a week extra as these costs are passed on. These are massive cost increases. These are costs that will force life changing decisions for a lot of people in terms of whether both partners work, whether they place their children in quality care or whether they seek informal and ad hoc arrangements.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are very important changes that the government has brought about&mdash;changes that will have a real impact on people's lives, and not just people at the top end of town. I know the government is very keen to have this sort of Robin Hood image perpetrated since the budget&mdash;how it is attacking the rich to protect the poor&mdash;but these changes will impact on ordinary working men and women in Australia. People who are earning less than $30,000 a year where both partners are working will be severely affected by these changes. Women who are studying and put their children in child care while they study will be affected. Some of them are on very low incomes. There is going to be real pain, real hurt, to low and middle income families as well as those on higher incomes who will be affected by the means testing of the cash rebate system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have at the centrepiece of this budget the family tax initiative. They have heralded the family tax initiative as being their attempt to protect the family to ensure that people raising children in our society have a better deal. On the one hand they give and on the other hand they take. Many of the benefits that come from the family tax initiative will be completely erased for families in our society. Many families will be $10, $20, $30 or $40 worse off as a result of the dual impact of the family tax initiative and their increased child&hyphen;care costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those people will not believe you when you say that they will be better off from the family tax initiative when they get a $7, $8, $9 or $10 a week increase in their take home pay as a result of the changes to taxation, yet they will have to fork out $20, $30, $40 or $50 a week extra in increased fees for child care. They will not thank you. They are very angry about it and they are beginning to realise what it is going to mean for their budgets, for their choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party campaigned on improving and broadening choice in child care. This makes a complete lie of that claim. You are restricting people's choices. You are removing choices by forcing them to pay more for their child care. As I say, for many Australian families the tax initiative will not result in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3426"> them being better off at all because the impact of the increase in child&hyphen;care fees will completely erase any benefits that there would have been from the family tax initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure Senator Crowley and others will speak more about this aspect of the motion&mdash;that is, the aspect that refers to the reduction in choices to women and the anti-family nature of these cuts. But I think it is very clear that what has occurred here reflects the Liberal Party's bias against two&hyphen;income families. It has been a cry of the Liberal Party for many years that we do not do enough to protect those who have a carer at home not in paid employment. But what we see in this budget is an attack on women who work, because it is largely women who will suffer as a result of these changes. The government has not broadened choice at all. It has reduced choices for these women. A number of women I have spoken to will have to make very hard decisions as a result of what will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a meeting I attended the other night, a young woman made a very strong speech. This young woman is studying and she said that as a result of the huge increases in HECS fees and the child&hyphen;care fee increases, she will have to give up study. She has done her maths. She will not be able to afford to continue her university course because the combined effects of HECS and increases in child&hyphen;care fees will mean it is just not economical for her to do it. She cannot manage, so she will have to give up her university course at the end of the year. She will not be able to continue studying next year under the new arrangements for HECS and the increased child&hyphen;care fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This woman is not atypical. A number of women at meetings I have attended have spoken about how this is really making them have to think again about whether they can continue to stay in the work force. The increase in costs of child care may make it uneconomical for many women to continue to work. They will be driven&mdash;not through choice but through the impact of these fees and other charges, like the HECS charges&mdash;back into the home to care for their own children when they would rather be doing <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some part-time employment, some study or some full-time employment. You are very much reducing the choices to women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of women I have spoken to are angry. They feel let down, they feel marginalised and they very much fear that their opportunities have been reduced by these changes. They are organising themselves to campaign against these changes. When a number of these measures come before the Senate in budget bills, I hope that the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents will combine with us to defeat a number of these measures because they are anti-family and they very much restrict the opportunities and choices for women in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to make a few remarks about a letter I received from a constituent. This constituent sent me a copy of a letter she forwarded to the Hon. Judi Moylan, the Minister for Family Services, in response to the budget cuts. This constituent lives in Derby in Western Australia, in the far north&hyphen;west of Western Australia. I am sure Senator Eggleston will be interested in what she has to say. She sends her only child to the one child-care centre in Derby, a subsidised centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This woman says that the impact of cuts in remote areas is tantamount to abolishing formal child&hyphen;care arrangements in the bush. She currently pays fees of $174.50 for a child in nappies, already far greater than those paid at comparable centres in the metropolitan area. Her centre will have to find an extra $40,000 next year to continue operating. That will result in this woman paying fees in excess of $200 per week for one child&mdash;$200 per week to have her child cared for while she attempts to earn a full-time income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She makes the point that the private sector will not step into this particular breach because they will have no interest in opening up an alternative centre in an isolated area like Derby because of the difficulties in attracting staff, higher costs, et cetera. Senators would be aware of the difficulties of operating in some of the far&hyphen;flung regional areas of northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This woman thinks that these child&hyphen;care cuts will have an enormous impact on her <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3427"> lifestyle. She cites that the minister has accepted that some centres are likely to close as a result of the removal of the subsidy. She believes her centre may well be one of those. Fifty-five families in Derby will have to deal with the consequences of that&mdash;to face job loss or income reduction. It will have an enormous impact on their lifestyles and their ability to stay and continue to work in areas such as Derby. As Senator O'Chee and others would know, it is sometimes very hard to attract people to these sorts of regions to do valuable jobs. This is going to have an enormous impact on the whole fabric of Derby and other communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure government speakers will say, `There is some money in the budget for adjustment,' and there is, but it is of the order of $10 million.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is an enormous range of issues here that are of concern. There is a growing resistance to the government's cuts to child care.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate Senator Chris Evans on his thoughtful speech. As he is a parent with young children, I do realise the interest he would take in this area. It is equally important to realise that the changes in administration of the Australian child-care system, which he referred to in the motion we have before us <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> today, are simply related to, more or less, the removal of the operational subsidy for community based, long day care centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the operational subsidy is retained for family day care, occasional day care, outside school hours care, multifunctional services and multifunctional Aboriginal services highlights the compassion and concern this government has for parents and children who use the child-care system that we have. It is regrettable that some of Senator Evans's comments could only be construed as scaremongering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no proof that charges to parents will increase as a result of the removal of the operational subsidies, and this government is all about providing a flexible service. Not all families, as I have indicated, who use child care will be affected by the removal of the operational subsidies. Let us get this in perspective. The figures in June 1996 indicate that community centre places comprise 20 per cent of all long day care places nationally. Certainly, there are many more children who attend child care and many parents who will simply not be affected by this change and who will, in the long run, be grateful for the attempt to provide a far more flexible service than what we have seen in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The operational subsidy has never been available to services owned by private operators, and private operators are a significant part of the market in the child-care industry. For instance, in South Australia I understand that community based centres cost, on average, $7 per week more than private centres. It is a known fact that community based centres have for a long time enjoyed a commercial advantage over private centres because they were obtaining operational subsidies. The removal of that operational subsidy simply redresses the imbalance in government subsidies. It removes a significant inequity for families using the private child-care sector, and it places both those sectors on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, while Senator Evans maintains that this will necessarily lead to an increase in child-care fees and/or a reduction in services, it would be a regrettable step if the community based centres took the decision to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3428"> increase fees or reduce their services without first attempting to achieve efficiencies through a restructure of their financial operations and management. To this end, the Commonwealth government will make $8.3 million available across Australia for centres to purchase financial and/or management advice and to help them manage the loss of that subsidy prior to its removal on 1 July 1997. The centres have almost 12 months, or certainly nine or ten months, to start making these changes. That $8.3 million is additional to the $11.5 million over three years, which is available to assist centres to upgrade and amalgamate in order to improve their efficiency and viability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley would be the first to admit that when she and I together, although on opposite sides of the table, looked at the way child-care centres were planned across the length and breadth of Australia, there were areas of oversupply and there were areas of undersupply. In that way, these centres will be encouraged in the public sector to look at the way in which they have planned their centre in relation to centres in the neighbouring area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, in relation to Senator Evans's comments on his disadvantaged constituent in Derby&mdash;and I would be the first to admit that in country areas parents may be disadvantaged through not having access to a choice in child-care centres&mdash;the government will provide supplementary funding totalling $12.5 million over four years to community centres in severely disadvantaged areas, where no other child care is available, to ensure that families in these areas do not lose their access to child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I suggest that, lamentable though the circumstances may be for Senator Evans's constituent, the government will be there to assist in this way and that his constituent may well be able to continue what she has been doing in the past. Information on eligibility criteria is being finalised at present, and I suggest that those parents who feel that they fall into that category should make inquiries about that. Not only that, $10.9 million in capital funds will also be made available to innovative services in rural and remote areas to ensure that families in these areas have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to flexible child care. Certainly I hope that the pilot program on farm child care, which is presently being trialled in Albury-Wodonga, will be able to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only that, up to $31 million will be spent by the government over four years to support children with high levels of additional needs, especially those with a disability who would not normally be able to access places in federal government child-care centres. This budget shows a significant and continuing commitment to child care. When we take into account measures in this budget, outlays in this year will exceed those in 1995-96 by $150 million, which is a 15 per cent growth in outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second clause in Senator Evans's notice of motion deals with the fact, as he puts it, or the supposition, that the increase in child-care fees will completely erase any benefit these families may receive from the Liberal Party's family tax initiative. The new family tax initiative will benefit over two million Australian families. These families will receive around $200 per child in disposable income, and single-income families with at least one child under five will receive an additional $500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes to child care in the budget substantially protect the benefit of low and middle income families. I think Senator Evans used the phrase `robbing the rich to pay the poor'. I would like to point out that it was Senator Evans who actually used this phrase; they are not my words. In actual fact, what we are asking is that those people and parents who can afford the payments in child care should be asked to make them so that the people who do benefit from the allocation in the budget will be low and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we can look at the reduction from 30 per cent to 20 per cent in the child-care cash rebate for families on incomes over $70,000. That only reduces benefits for high income families who are better able to meet their child-care costs, and those families are in the top 20 per cent of family incomes in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the decision to limit child-care assistance to a maximum of 50 hours per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3429"> week for families who are currently charged and pay for more than 50 hours per week, but who actually use less, is a responsible move by government. Open-ended government assistance should not be used to subsidise inefficient operations or excessive charging practices. Indeed, I should point out that no family receiving the new family tax initiative will be affected by the change in the child-care cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the abolition of the $30 per week for child-care assistance assessment purposes reflects the significant improvements since the mid-eighties in other forms of government assistance to families with children, and I include in there the enhanced family payments. Sixty-five per cent of families in child care are one&hyphen;child families, and other families currently receiving maximum child-care assistance will not be affected by this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the reduction in the cut&hyphen;offs for child&hyphen;care assistance will result in about 500 high income families no longer being eligible for part child&hyphen;care assistance and about nine per cent of all families receiving child&hyphen;care assistance receiving a slightly reduced level of assistance. I hope this lays to rest once and for all the sort of myths that were being perpetuated by Senator Evans in his remark. I would have also thought that people in the Labor Party, which continually proclaims its desire to assist low income families and to protect those families against the ravages of government, would have been the last to complain about the sort of measures about which I am speaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the decision not to index the child&hyphen;care assistance ceiling on 1 April 1997 or 1 April 1998 will require services to review their efficiency rather than simply increase their fees by the level of indexation. So low and middle income families will not lose the benefit of the family tax initiative as a result of these child&hyphen;care measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly, I would like to run through some of the budget measures spoken about by Senator Evans and the way in which these will help families rather than impede them. The cut to the operational subsidy, as I said, means that centres are simply put on an equal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> footing with the private sector. Where families do encounter increased fees, they may be eligible for increased child&hyphen;care cash rebate where they are not already receiving the maximum. This should mean that the whole fee increase is not passed on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a service is faced with closure&mdash;and this may well relate to Senator Evans's constituent in the far north&hyphen;west of Western Australia&mdash;and it is the only service for families to access work related care in that region, people may be eligible to apply for supplementary funding. Funding will be targeted to areas of disadvantage and to areas where alternative private or family day&hyphen;care services are not available. I would have thought that this would have completely fulfilled Senator Evans's example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there will be an allocation of money for the purchasing of financial management services by centres to enable them to work through the transition period. We have not walked away from our commitment to establish innovative child&hyphen;care services for families in rural and remote areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crowley, not only that, but also parents will now be able to choose how child&hyphen;care assistance and child&hyphen;care cash rebate is paid, rather than your system, which entailed, as you and I both know, an enormous amount of paperwork for both parents and centres. That assistance and the cash rebate can now be paid either as a direct payment into the family bank account&mdash;and what a boon that would be to busy parents&mdash;or to the service directly. That will be implemented by January 1998 and administered by the new Commonwealth government service delivery agency, which is to be under the auspices of the Department of Social Security. Changing those payment arrangements will give families more control over their benefit and it is expected to improve competition and encourage services to be far more responsive to the needs of families in relation to quality of care, flexible hours, extended hours care and charging practices&mdash;all of which help busy parents, many of whom are both in the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3430">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, as I said, Senator Evans's motion deals with the increase in fees reducing the choices available to Australian women and therefore they are anti&hyphen;family. How can the provision of extra child&hyphen;care money be anti&hyphen;family? These sorts of budget measures encourage choice. They streamline services for busy mothers and fathers. They are much better targeted to people who need the services, and people who use the services and can afford to make the payment are certainly being asked to do so. That is in line with our entire budget strategy of targeting services, and particularly government services, to families which need them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition, I know, will make great moment of the fact that, in their view, there is less money available for child care. If the policies of their government had not left this country in such parlous economic straits, there would be far more money to deal with child care and with the economically responsible budget measures that are being undertaken by my government. In the future, one would imagine that greater amounts of money will be available for areas such as child care. I, for one, would be the first to be pressing government for that, but it is only by responsible economic budgetary measures, such as these that I have outlined, that we will be able to do that in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad they sent you down, Senator Troeth. You have got a quieter voice, so you are probably less provocative. The point is that you went to the electorate promising absolutely no change to the operational subsidy. You promised absolutely no means testing on the child&hyphen;care cash rebate and you promised to retain the child&hyphen;care accreditation system. You have done none of these things: you have broken every one of those promises. Feeble complaints about the budget and those sorts of things simply will not do, particularly as Senator Troeth has just pointed out that, in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the child&hyphen;care area, the government will be expending more money, not less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you have done is to rearrange it in a way that is going to be very disadvantaging for families. You did it by finally coming clean on what you really mean in this area. You have not introduced a budget that restores, in covert ways, Fightback; you have actually introduced John Howard's initial proposals when he was the previous leader in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards the future</EMPHASIS>. There were four column inches on child care in that document; that is all. You did not know about it then and your policies were `All women should be at home; we will abolish child care and that will make the world and the families of Australia much happier.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since Mr Howard was last leader, the world has changed. Even he has recognised that he could not go to the electorate this time around saying what he really means about child care. The world has caught him up. It ran over him, but his intentions are still there under the changes. The most important thing that Mr Howard did in the run&hyphen;up to this budget was to promise no change to operational subsidy. He promised no means test on child&hyphen;care cash rebate. He promised no change to the accreditation system. They are distinctive and deliberate untruths which have been perpetrated on the people of this country. The noises coming from the child&hyphen;care industry mean that all those people in child care know and understand that the Howard government got elected by broken promises. It told terrible untruths to the people, particularly about child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very first thing they have done is to remove the operational subsidy from the long day care centres, and they have done much worse than that. Let me find the quote from a letter from Dr David Kemp on 28 February 1996. He was still trying to convince people that he was serious about child care. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>He also spoke of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our continuing support for the community based long day care sector. We regard the operational subsidy as one of the key supports of that sector.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind you again of his line:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3431">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>They had hardly crossed the threshold of government before they were removing it. They thought they could remove it from family day care and they thought they could remove it from outside school hours care until they discovered that, if you had no operational subsidy in those two areas, you would have no family day care and you would have no outside school hours care. They are slow learners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even they realised that you could not pull down family day care. Of course, although hours and hours were wasted by family day care families and providers in defending this absolutely outrageous proposal, in the end they did what we knew they would have to do: retain it. Their attack on the community based sector is overt, blatant and disgraceful. `We believe in the community based sector,' says Dr Kemp, but they have hacked away the operational subsidy and they have removed any further growth strategy. Five and a half thousand community based long day care places and employer sponsored community based places will not now be built. They say, `Leave it to the private sector,' which has been growing and filling the gaps very quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing they say is that we did not have much planning but they are going to have a national planning program. The only part of child care that was properly planned was the community based sector, on needs areas across the country delivering community based child care very fairly to low income areas, to rural areas, to regional and remote areas, to all the places that were difficult. The only part not planned was the private sector. What on earth do they think is now going to make the private sector become more thoughtful and planned than it has been to this point? Indeed, as I understood Senator Troeth, she was suggesting that community based sectors that might have some trouble need not worry because, after all, if they cannot be financially viable, then, no doubt, the private sector will take those places over and continue the provision of child care.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Families in this country have said for a long time that they like and support community based child care. It has been the standard set&hyphen;up. It certainly established levels of quality care and provision of longer hours, of more baby places, of care for children with disability, of regional and remote area provision and provision in low socioeconomic areas. All of those were provided by the community based sector&mdash;not the private sector&mdash;on a needs based delivery. This government has done away with the growth strategy; that is, 5,500 community based places will not now be built. It has taken away their operational subsidies and, while the equity of that may be arguable against the private sector places, they are not comparable deliveries of child care. They do not have the same population of children and they do not cover the same areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be one thing to say, `We will remove the operational subsidy,' but please do not say that this is not going to affect costs of child care. By any estimates, it will be something like $14 to $20 unless the child&hyphen;care centres cut services or quality. There is no doubt that that will have to happen. The government said it would not means test the child&hyphen;care cash rebate. It could not wait to get into government to do that, but it has done it in a picky, mean kind of way so that it appears it has only half done it and so that they have not really been seen to do it. Yes, they have. They have broken another promise. `We will not remove operational subsidy. We will not means test the child&hyphen;care cash rebate'&mdash;two broken promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They believe in the accreditation system. Having fought in this place in every possible, disgraceful and disgusting way to oppose it, they now say they are going to keep it. If you believe that, you believe anything. They have told dreadful porkies. They have said that they believe in child care and grudgingly they have had to admit it is here to stay. They have done their best, certainly, to break their promises and to attack the public sector delivery of child care in long day care centres. They could not do it in family day care; there are too many families to cut that public sector provision of services out.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3432">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the Senator Troeth wants to wish the farm based child&hyphen;care program in Albury&hyphen;Wodonga well. I am very pleased to say that that is one of the innovative things we were able to achieve. I am pleased that the opposition is now talking about innovation in child care. That means they are deliberately continuing the Labor policies, and well done. You should. It was a good policy and will continue to be a good policy. Senator Troeth hopes Albury&hyphen;Wodonga will continue. There is only one reason it will not: you will stop it. It is an excellent program. It follows the research done by the people in Albury&hyphen;Wodonga for farm based child care. It has the flexibility needed to meet the needs of those families in rural and remote areas. Make every effort to keep it. Don't worry whether it will survive, because, from here on in, when it does not survive it will be yet another thing that you will be responsible for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Troeth wanted to suggest there will not be too much change in the cost of child care and that the fees will not rise. Of course they will. They will rise in the community based sector because of the cuts in the operational subsidy, but they will also rise because of the reduction in the taper of family income for assessment of eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance. Senator Troeth says it will only be a teensy&hyphen;weensy bit extra cost for families in the middle income bracket, or below $70,000. It will be much more for families at the top end of the scale and a considerable number of families will lose any child&hyphen;care assistance or part child&hyphen;care assistance at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for families in the middle range, I do not believe the government is fully aware of the impact of its changes. First, they have frozen the amount for a place at $115 per week for the next two years, into 1998&mdash;no extra payment for any of the child&hyphen;care places. Secondly, they have reduced the taper for family income assessment. Thirdly, they have done away with the $30 child disability allowance for the second and subsequent children. All of these impact very significantly on the costs of fees and charges that centres will have to set for families to have to pay. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This notion that you get some of your tax assistance through the family tax package may seem good, but that dollar has completely gone because of the dramatic increase in the costs of child care. I say to Senator Patterson that, yes, they will go up, and you know they will go up. You are going to come in here shortly and tell us why. But please don't say they won't.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, you have. You are the women who have come in and seen these dramatic changes. You have not actually improved choices at all for families. You have restricted their choices. That is what you have done. Everything you asked them to believe on 1 March was not true. You broke your promises. Clearly, child care is not a core issue or a core promise for this Howard government. It is a pretty marginal issue. They want women out of the work force and back at home, enjoying their little tax assistance. That is what the Liberal government <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3433"> wants. Women and families of Australia are quite clear that they are not going to be fooled by that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you offer with one hand `x' amount of dollars and then take 2, 3 and 4 times `x' with the other, families are not going to be fooled by that. Their tax payments are already eaten up by the increased costs of child care. But they are also eaten up by the increased costs of dental care for the older people in their family. They are also dramatically eaten up by the rising costs of health. They are going to be eaten up by the costs of pharmaceuticals. Every time you go to the pharmacist or the chemist, that is going to whack away your tax increase in one go. So families of Australia will know very quickly, as they live through the next year or so, exactly what you have done for them. You have restricted choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your whole choice for this country depends on the economy somehow getting going. Somebody on the other side said the other day that small business is the engine room for jobs; suddenly, everybody in small business will start providing jobs; suddenly, everybody will be working and this will improve the lot of families. There is no doubt that the minister for giving out the number of unemployed is preparing to duck and twist rather than give us a number of how many unemployed people there are in this country and how your policies will not make the slightest difference to the number of unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those unemployed people will not be enjoying the tax benefits. They will have to pay more for any child care which they can access. They will have to pay more for their pharmaceuticals. They will have to pay more for any elderly relative in their family who needs dental care. They are some of the costs. If anybody should want to study or try to go to university, their costs will be further eroded. If they were previously enjoying some assistance through job assistance programs such as skillshare or jobstart, they will not get that anymore, either. So it is very tough on Australian families out there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said it before and I will say it again: this is a classic Tory Thatcher budget which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has abandoned the unemployed. If you do that, you are certainly not assisting the families of Australia. To use these changes in child care to suggest that you are assisting families with more choice is a matter of tortured and convoluted language for those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having opposed all the initiatives of the previous government, you then adopted the whole lot in the lead&hyphen;up to the election. Once you were across the barrier, you changed your mind and did what you really believed&mdash;means tested the cash rebate, did away with the operational subsidy and you have already cut the money for the accreditation system that ensures quality care in all the child&hyphen;care centres. You were true to form once you won the election. You were very untrue to form in the lead&hyphen;up to it. It will not take the community too long to find it out. You have done away with the industry council in child care&mdash;a council that I established to try to make sure that this very significant growth area was working as one, with the old divisions between the community based and the private sectors removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to find now that the majority of private child-care centres want the quality accreditation system to continue and want it to be tied to the eligibility for child-care assistance. They do not want to see the proposals that you are allowing to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also know, as I do from various polls that we have done in the past, that over 60 per cent of Australian families do not want to have access to the child-care money paid directly to them. They do not want that. They want it to go to the child-care centre so that it is one huge area that will not be of any worry to them. Senator Troeth says that you could reduce the paperwork and worry for people applying for child-care assistance. We considerably streamlined it. I will be interested to see if your proposals to amalgamate these payments will further streamline it. If it does, I will support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While you are streamlining on one hand, you are giving people more bills, more payment and more paperwork on the other by giving them the child&hyphen;care dollars in their own bank accounts, if that is what they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3434"> choose. That is more paperwork for them. So you cannot say that this is going to be streamlining it for families. You had better get clear what you are really on about in child care here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a grudging admission that child care will continue. You used to accuse the Labor government of allowing families to double dip, for example, but you have done the same. You are going to pay tax payments to families when a family member stays at home and you are going to allow those same families to have access to occasional care with the child-care costs now very significantly increased by the changes you have proposed under this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that you have actually introduced a 50&hyphen;hour limitation on child care. Now, Senator Patterson, you are not going to say this out loud, but we all know what that is. It is called 12 hours by another name. You opposed the 12 hours. You are now actually introducing a de facto 12 hours by another name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other problems you had to deal with&mdash;and certainly one Minister Moylan had to deal with&mdash;was that by opposing the 12 hours in this place you took $140 million off the bottom line. When anybody over the other side stands up and says, `You'll wreck the country if you don't deliver our budget,' we can just say, `Well you wouldn't deliver ours. You wouldn't deliver the savings that were proposed last time with the 12 hours.' It was $140 million. You had to find it this time and you have done it by calling it 50 hours. The centres are having a lot of trouble dealing with the consequences of that to their costs, to their fee structures and to their charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very big whammy that you have given families here. You have dramatically increased the cost of child care, particularly in the community based sector by removing the operational subsidy, but you have also reduced the taper for eligibility for child-care assistance payments on family income. You have taken away the $30 disallowance for second and subsequent children. You have frozen the amount of money that child-care assistance is calculated against.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for those very poor families, for families in the lower socioeconomic area, for the families that you claim to have assisted or will assist, you have just whacked them round the head with dramatic increased child-care costs. I hope that when you senators over there actually have a look at what your policies mean, particularly for the battling families and the low income families that you claim now to represent, you might want to rethink and modify your own government proposals in this area. They are unconscionably harsh. They are particularly harsh for families at that lower income end. You cannot say to families, `You'll be much better off if we give you $4 or $20,' and then give them $25 or $30 increased child-care costs. That is what you have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have also made a great claim in the past that families with one parent at home should also have access to child care. We utterly agree. We established that policy. We think it is a very reasonable thing indeed, but we certainly wanted to make sure that they could afford it. We also wanted to make sure that as many families as possible would have access to those child-care places.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, I would like to think that at least some benefit might come from the hard facts of your policies. Again, I remind you, there is no forward growth strategy; there is a cutback in growth strategy in the community based sector. This is going to enormously distort the contribution of long day care centres. Long day care in the community based sector, as I said, in the past has been the standard setter for quality. It is very depressing that you should be restricting that growth, indeed ceasing it altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have also called for a national planning strategy, but I remind you again that the only part of child care that has been planned has been the public sector. The private child-care <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3435"> centres have grown like topsy. There are gross oversupplies in areas like south-east Queensland and north&hyphen;east New South Wales. There is absolutely no indication that those child-care centres in the private sector have any better capacity to make decisions that will allow better distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very shocked to discover that one of the private providers of child care from Queensland has recently come into the state of South Australia, had an appointment with the state education minister and has approval to now go and talk to school councils about the sale of school land&mdash;that is, state government school land. If the council decides that the land can be sold, the child-care people will buy the land, half the money of the land's value will stay with the school and, on the corner of the school, a private child-care centre will be built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find this is a totally extraordinary proposal. So bad is it in South Australia that, in one area where the private as well as the community based child-care centres around a school heard that this was happening, they actually attended the meeting of the parents and the school council and protested rigorously against the school going this way because there is already sufficient child-care places within cooee or very close to that school. Another child-care centre built on the school grounds would have been an oversupply and would have put all the child-care centres in that region in jeopardy of becoming financially unviable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an appalling process. It is a process that takes the land from the citizens of South Australia. It is a process that restricts any comprehensive planning for the provision of child care by the private sector, contrary to what Senator Troeth and the government senators and members have been saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really believe that if you are going to have some kind of national planning strategy for the private sector, you must arrive at it very soon because, clearly, the financial advisers who are urging people to get into private child care are not giving them any more advice other than saying, `It's a good investment; get into it now.' There is already an enormous supply in south-east Queensland <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and north-east New South Wales. They are in difficulty now. Some of those private centres have to face the fact that they have invested very poorly and they may have to sell out and move on. That is not what is best for child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private sector would do very well to take up the option that we gave them when we were in government&mdash;to have a look at the high need area of planning that was used to provide the community based sector and start providing their child care along the lines of the planning model that was there for the public sector. It was delivering child care fairly and appropriately in every area of Australian society, particularly in rural and remote areas. Those are the sorts of places that the private sector has been very slow and loath to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are going to come up with some kind of planning, please do it quickly because, quite clearly, the private sector, which has not made too much use of what we provided for them in the past, does not seem to have learnt too much to this point. That is a tragedy. As you are now relying on the private sector to deliver the long day care child&hyphen;care places, I would like to know&mdash;and will certainly be asking you at estimates next week&mdash;what provision do you have for any kind of equity of access for families when they are reliant on private child-care centres only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually think that it is very important that we have the opportunity today to talk about the government's proposed changes in child care. They are, to reiterate, a complete litany of broken promises. They said, `We will not change operational subsidy. We will not change the quality and accreditation program and we will not means test the child&hyphen;care cash rebate.' Once in government they did all of those. But they have done much more and much worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have they stopped the forward growth of community based places&mdash;over 5,500 now lost to the people of Australia&mdash;but also they have also clearly made it impossible for centres not to raise their fees. Costs for families using child care will rise very significantly and that will disadvantage poorer families, middle of the range families and, in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3436"> particular, families where perhaps one parent is at  home and not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The child&hyphen;care arrangements by themselves will cut out all the benefits of the government's changes of payments to families. When you add that to their attack on education, the increased costs for education, the increased costs of pharmaceuticals and the increased costs for nursing home or home and community care assistants for elderly, frail, aged or disabled members of the family, we see that this is a government that is not delivering for families. This is a government that is very harshly increasing the costs for families much along the lines of the user&hyphen;pays principle. It is called, `We will give it to families'&mdash;some&mdash;`and let them try to meet the costs.' The amount that is being given to families through tax benefits will go nowhere near enough towards assisting families with all of these services. It is very anti-family and, in particular, in the child care area, it is particularly anti-choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that you have proposed will not increase flexibility. The 50 hours means, for example, that a lot of the centres that have been open up to 12 hours so as to assist families who have lots of travel time on top of their eight or 10&hyphen;hour working day will not have the assistance with the child&hyphen;care costs at either end of a long travel day unless they go to the bother of making application for exception. Will the individuals do it or will centres do it? Then there is all that paperwork and no guarantee that they will get any assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a policy that has dramatically increased costs of child care. It has done nothing to make the provision of child care fairer or wider. It has done nothing to guarantee assistance to the pockets of those people currently denied child care, particularly rural and remote areas and areas of disadvantage. It certainly has not done anything to see a much closer amalgamation between pre-school, kindergarten and child&hyphen;care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge senators opposite to read through the recently released report from the Senate References Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Childhood matters: report on the inquiry into early <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> childhood education </EMPHASIS>because it does address ways in which some of these problems can be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the last item that does bear making comment about, but only to breathe another depressed sign, is that following the routing of Treasurer Costello at the Premiers Conference, there is actually much less money now going to the states. The states, who have to pick up such a lot of pre-school education, will continue to do what Mr Kennett has already polished to an art form&mdash;slip the Victorian government out and cost shift on to the Commonwealth through child care, particularly the establishment of private child care. At a time when the fees are already expensive, these fees will only get higher. The amalgamation between pre-school and child care will be at an extra cost and a further disadvantage for people in all states and territories, particularly in Victoria, where we have already seen the harsh evidence of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Evans is absolutely right in bringing forward this motion because it does do damage and enormously increases the costs to Australian families. What looks to be a good thing on the one hand will turn out to be a series of extra charges and very harsh for Australian families. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crowley's feigned indignation did nothing for me and I am sure it would do nothing for the members of the public who have seen what they have done. She said that we have given a big whammy to Australian families. Let me tell you that the biggest whammy of all occurred two days after the last election when the Australian public discovered that the budget last year was $8 billion behind. It was Beazley's $8 billion black hole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3437"> That is the reason we have had to address some of the issues that maybe we would have preferred not to address. We have attempted to have a fair budget. The Australian public has agreed that it is a fair budget and everyone has had to take a bit of the pain so that we can fix up a problem which we did not make. It was not our problem; it was a prob lem generated by 13 years of Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at what has happened over the last six years, each year we have spent significantly more than we earned. Over the last five years we have gone from overspending $17 billion to overspending $96 billion. Each year we have chalked up more and more debt. We have spent more than we earned. We cannot keep doing that. Anyone who runs a family budget and anybody who runs their own personal budget knows that, if you keep putting stuff on the bankcard, the chickens come home to roost at some stage. At some point the bank manager will ring up and say, `There is no money left in your bank account. We cannot extend your credit any further.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of a nation, the International Monetary Fund comes in. You get no choice about what social security programs you have and you get no choice about whether you subsidise this child care or that child care. You are told by the IMF exactly what will happen and exactly where the cuts will be made. That was the crisis point we were reaching when Paul Keating said that we were about to become a banana republic. A lot of Australians did not realise that that meant we would have lost our sovereignty. We would not have had a say in policy: we would have been told that, if we were to continue being given money and credit, we would have to conform with what the IMF wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian public woke up to what the Labor government was doing: spending, spending, spending with its largesse to unions, to interest groups&mdash;to all sorts of groups. Australians realised that we could not continue to do that&mdash;that we were living beyond our means. I think the worst thing was that we were spending the money of the next generation. Senator Crowley can come in here and talk about there being changes to child care, but we would have had the next generation caring for an ageing population; that generation having spent the new generation's money. Our generation is spending money ahead of time.</PARA>

Let me repeat it again, because I do not think you understand what you did: in the last five years you chalked up $17 billion to $96 billion. Then you tried to pretend to the Australian public that your last budget was balanced when, in fact, it was $8 billion in deficit, so we added another $8 billion. You just cannot keep spending like that. As for Senator Crowley coming in here and saying that we delivered a whammy to families, that was the biggest whammy of all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only the $10 billion that we are paying in interest; it is also the $8 billion that we are behind when we were supposed to have a balanced budget last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley went on about broken promises. Broken promises! I can remember one when we are talking about families: one of their former Prime Ministers said that no child would live in poverty by 1990. What a promise! What happened during the time of the Labor government? The rich got richer and the poor got poorer.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When most of us were growing up&mdash;those of us in the chamber who are baby boom age; at the moment there are some in the chamber who are not baby boom age&mdash;there was a greater egalitarianism in Australia. In our country we had one of the lowest gaps between the rich and the poor. We had one of the most equal societies. Thirteen years of Labor has seen that whittled away. Now we really have a bimodal distribution of income. We have a high number of people on low incomes and a high number of people on very high incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of a platykurtic curve of distribution of wealth, we now have a bimodal curve showing a large number of people with low incomes and a large number of people with high incomes. That is another legacy of 13 years of Labor. Labor come in here and bleat about the terrible things that the coalition is doing to families. Let me say that Labor repeatedly had policies which were detrimental to families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had just forgotten for a moment&mdash;but I should never let the Australian public forget&mdash;that promise that we were going to have tax cuts: l&hyphen;a&hyphen;w tax cuts. They were going to be written into law. Yes, families would be better off because: `We won't just make a promise; we will write them into the law.' And then what did we see? Labor reneged and gave them in two tranches. Who is paying for the second tranche? Senator Cook is going out because he does not want to hear it. We are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley came in here and went on about low and middle income families. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3439"> Labor government would not bite the bullet with the Medicare levy. We found that a large number of people who can well afford to take out private health insurance do not. Former Prime Minister Keating and former health minister Lawrence have admitted that they do not have private health insurance. We found that people on high incomes have failed to take out private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they get sick and need care, instead of being able to go to one of the now very well equipped private hospitals that can deal with things like acute cardiac arrest and all sorts of major surgery that once upon a time these places were not able to deal with, we find people on high incomes filling up beds in public hospitals. Because many of them have acute needs for surgery, that has squashed out people who need elective surgery for total hip replacements, cataracts, bunions, or whatever else. We found that wealthy and young high income earners, who felt they were immune, did not require private health insurance and were not going to get sick, were making use of public hospital beds and increasing the length of waiting lists in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found out because former Senator Richardson has become very honest about what happened on the other side now that he is writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin.</EMPHASIS> When he was minister for health, he attempted to bring in an increased levy for high income earners if they did not have private health insurance. He admitted, `I could not get it through cabinet.' He could not get it through cabinet because these people on the other side were prepared to give benefits to high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have forgotten his exact words in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> but it was something like, `Heaven forbid. Here is a Liberal National government saying to high income earners, "If you don't take some responsibility for your own health, we will make you pay a higher Medicare levy."' You would have thought that Labor would have done it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was stunned and surprised and shocked and horrified&mdash;that is the only way to describe his article&mdash;that the Liberal National Party government has chosen to do that. We believe in targeting; we believe in a safety net <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for those who cannot afford it themselves. We do not believe in propping up those people who can do something for themselves. Our philosophy is that you should look after yourself first and, if you are incapable of doing that, then the state should step in. That leaves more resources for those people who are less well off&mdash;the very people they purport to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last election the public realised that Labor was not representing them. The battler that Senator Amanda Vanstone met down in Wollongong said to her, `I cannot make ends meet. I have a family. I have two children and a wife who is at home.' When he looked at some people on some benefits, they were getting more than he was as a single income earner. He said, `I cannot vote Labor anymore.' Senator Vanstone brought him up to have dinner in Parliament House on budget night because she had been so moved that he was expressing clearly to her the fact that he was working in a job on average weekly earnings or just above, with a wife and two children at home, and he was getting less than some people on benefits or other programs like Austudy. She thought that there was something wrong with the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone did not tell me that story. A journalist chose to write it in, I think, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> about a week ago. Somebody said to me, `Read this story. Isn't it amazing?' And I read it. I had not read it. That was what that person was saying: a battler who had voted Labor all his life had decided that Labor had neglected him and he changed his vote. That was the message that the Labor Party ought to have got and should have got out of the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just given the example of funding high income earners in health. But we saw it in child care with the child&hyphen; care cash rebate. I have two friends who are doctors and they were both getting a child&hyphen;care cash rebate. They were stunned. They could not believe they were eligible. They said to me, `Has the world gone cuckoo? We are both doctors.' One is an anaesthetist and one is running a quite successful general practice. They have two young daughters. They said to me, `Can you believe, Kay, that we are eligible for a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3440"> child&hyphen;care cash rebate?' They did not expect that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government did not choose to target the rebate. I suppose somebody else will fall out of the woodwork and write an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>.

You could not understand what they were saying when they answered the question but when you read it, it was just as bad. I want to give the Senate an example of a question about child-care that was asked in the middle of last year by Senator Troeth:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer to my question in Senate estimates in which I asked: how many of the child-care places in this year's budget were actually new child-care places and how many were part of your government's child-care strategy or election promises? The First Assistant Secretary of your department, Mr Barry Wight, replied&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this. This is classic:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . None of them is new. There is juggling of numbers, bringing forward of places. . . There is a different mix of places.</PARA>
<PARA>Then Senator Troeth went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given this clarification by an officer of your department, how can you then claim, as you do in this year's budget and in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agenda for Families</EMPHASIS> , that you have established and created new child-care places?  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read the answer&mdash;or maybe I will just read the beginning of the answer. This is Senator Crowley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a start, the ongoing commitment to see that those places foreshadowed are built is, in lots of people's minds, certainly a commitment to new places. As well as that, it shows you have not really argued this case before.</PARA>
<PARA>It did not answer the question. She goes on. I read the rest of the answer and it does not answer the question. Out of the mouth of one of her officers she was condemned in that they were juggling numbers. So how could she come in here today and criticise our child-care policies when a lot of the things we have had to do are because the former Labor government left this country in dire straits in terms of debt and deficit? She comes in here and says that we have broken promises. I have given a few examples of the broken promises of Labor. She also comes in here and says, virtually&mdash;I almost cannot believe it&mdash;that we should not target the child-care cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I thought I should point out, which I did not know, I discovered today when I was finding out more about child care. Senator Crowley is going on about the subsidies being taken off community based long day care programs. I was fascinated to read that community based long day care programs have a greater proportion of high income families in them than does the private sector. The private sector gets no subsidy. The community based long day care places do get subsidies but more of the families using them are from high income areas. In effect, there is no targeting. Senator Crowley needs to go and look at the facts and the figures because she is arguing for no targeting, not saying: `We need to make it fair'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy is creating greater flexibility. It is targeted to low and middle income families, something the former Labor government was not game enough to do. They did not do it with Medicare and they did not do it with child-care because it was too hard. So we kept on spending and running up debt. We have built into the program some safeguards in a number of areas. They will ensure, for example, that $195 million will be given over <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3441"> four years to retain operational subsidies for occasional care and out-of-school hours care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Money will also be given to the community based child-care programs to assist them with financial management and dealing with the loss of the subsidy. We have not left them high and dry. We have not withdrawn the subsidy and said: `You go on your own.' There is funding to assist them in managing. The private sector can manage without the subsidy. I think it is approximately $4 a day more in fees. I am sure some of these community based programs could compete if they were given assistance because they do not have some of the costs of the private sector. Some of them, especially those that are run out of churches and other non-profit organisations, have some tax advantages that the private sector does not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also providing $31 million over four years for children with special needs. So the government is particularly committed to families from rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, children from non-English speaking backgrounds and children with a disability. Also, there is an additional $12.5 million available over four years to ensure that families from severely disadvantaged areas will not lose access to child care. That is what we are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow minister for family services issued a press release titled `Howard's tax initiative rort: families with kids in care lose'. Jenny Macklin needs to get with it and get her facts straight. The figures that she released, and other information that she is sending around to centres, are extremely inaccurate, grossly exaggerated and misleading. When I was shadow minister I made as sure as anything&mdash;I know it is difficult because you do not have the resources&mdash;that I got the facts right. If I got a fact wrong it was not intentional but because I just did not have the information. I cannot believe that Ms Macklin has got so much wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be much more helpful to the majority of families using child care if Ms Macklin and others focused their concerns on the situation of the majority of families instead of on the extreme examples which create undue concern for most families. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the same thing for aged care; they are running around saying that everybody going into a nursing home will have to pay $26,000.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They forget to tell people that that $26,000 has a drawdown of $2,600 a year and you can pay for a maximum of five years, so it is only $13,000 plus the interest on the capital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning on the radio I heard Mr Free&mdash;who is going to be the candidate in the by-election&mdash;say that all people going into nursing homes will pay $26,000. So the Labor Party have started again on their scurrilous way in exactly the same way they did with the GST&mdash;you will pay 15 per cent on everything. They had ads with a cash register indicating the 15 per cent increase. In fact, there was a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on sheets. Had that gone up sheets would have cost less.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The calculations that Ms Macklin makes are misleading. Firstly, they are based on families using 50, 55 or 60 hours of care per week. Do you know how many low and middle income families are using 50 hours or more care a week? Two per cent of them are using more than 50 hours. The opposition are basing their figures on 50, 55 or 60 hours of care, so their figures apply to two per cent of low and middle income families. On the other hand, around 12 per cent, or 22,500, of low and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3442"> middle income families are currently charged for more than 50 hours of care but use less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the majority&mdash;86 per cent&mdash;of all low and</PARA>
<PARA>middle income families pay and use significantly less than 50 hours a week. Thirdly, none of the calculations used in the misleading releases even closely relate to the fact that the average family pays for about 26 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family scenarios that Ms Macklin uses are the least typical. That is exactly the same thing that they are doing in the nursing home situation. So we get the very worst scenario and we publicise it everywhere, and we scare the living daylights out of older people with regard to nursing homes and we scare the living daylights out of families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we do not say, `Guess what the government is doing!' We are actually targeting child care so that those on middle and low incomes get a better deal&mdash;with the limited amount of money we have after the disastrous management of the previous government. That is the goal: to increase flexibility, to target child care and to make sure that we are putting programs in place to ease that transition. As I outlined before, we are enabling various groups to be assisted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I analyse Ms Macklin's press release, I am stunned that it is so inaccurate, that it is so full of extreme examples. I hope that the Labor Party lifts its game and is more truthful and more honest and gives the average example rather than the extreme example.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to speak on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the issue of child care because it is emerging as a major item in my state of Tasmania, and I can speak only on Tasmania and the contact that I have had with child-care centres. Ever since the budget announcement about the withdrawal of the operational subsidy from community based child-care centres and the fiddling with child-care assistance, I have been in constant contact with the managers and users of community based child-care centres in the north-west of Tasmania, where I live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also spoken to and received correspondence on this matter from other centres in the state. The central theme arising from my many discussions and correspondence is incredulity. Many have questioned why there was no prior consultation with child&hyphen;care providers and parents in Tasmania about this matter. The response has been that not one director I have spoken to supports the statements contained in the audit commission report, and now Liberal policy, that child&hyphen;care centres should all be privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have said to me time and time again that taking away the subsidy may not rebound as drastically in the urban environment of Melbourne and Sydney but it will be disastrous for rural regions which contain small cities and townships that make up Tasmania. Many parents have said, `Why increase subsidies to family based day care while totally cutting subsidies to community based child&hyphen;care centres?' People tell me there are advantages in both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parents who have experienced both systems of child care have said that community child&hyphen;care centres provide that little bit extra in quality of care. The carers are usually well trained and innovative. They don't operate in isolation as do most family based day carers. That is what people have been telling me in the north&hyphen;west of Tasmania. I can vouch for the creativity of many of those directors and carers who work in community child&hyphen;care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not visited one centre in the region where I have not sensed the feeling of true community. Many of the centres have links with local councils, which I think is a worthwhile partnership. Time and time again when <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3443"> I have visited and walked around these centres I have observed heaps of community news. People when they are bringing their children to the centres and collecting them at night collect this matter, take it home and read it. So as well as providing care for the children it provides information from the community and, I might also add, from government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The centres not only provide the quality of care but also provide something extra that is intrinsic. It is difficult to describe and in many senses it cannot be touched upon physically. But I can honestly say that in all the community based child&hyphen;care centres that I have visited there is a sense of community, from the early morning bustle of parents dropping off their children to when the children are collected at night. There is a sense of camaraderie that I doubt would exist in a private child&hyphen;care centre of which conservatively at least 60 per cent of parents receive top fee relief in the north&hyphen;west of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The day after the budget I rang many community child&hyphen;care centres to see what they thought about the cuts. Many were unaware of the gravity of the Liberal Party's decision. Ever since that day, there has been an awakening to just how detrimental this withdrawal of subsidy will be for centres and for the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to relate some of the comments I have received from the diligent women who run these centres. I have been told, for example, that taking away the operational subsidy will lead to the possible withdrawal of the midday meal for children and of the in-house library service. This in-house library service is really important to some of the parents who receive subsidies because it is the only way they can afford to give their children some of the services the library provides. Further, existing full&hyphen;time staff will have to contemplate working part-time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another director said that fees would have to increase by at least $20. Another said, `We are still the leading child&hyphen;care centre in the town, irrespective of the recent establishment of a private centre. If we have to put up our fees, I can assure you that the private centre <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will do the same.' I quote from one of the many letters I have received. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our child&hyphen;care centre predicts that its fees will rise at least $20 to $25 per week if government funding is lost, assuming that all places at the centre continue to be filled. Obviously, parents on lower incomes will have to make alternative arrangements or leave work to look after their children, as increases in fees will be beyond their capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My husband and I strongly object to any increases in fees. The increases could actually be more than those predicted if all child&hyphen;care places cannot be filled. We believe the fees are high enough now. This type of budgetary measure is short-sighted, ill-conceived and discriminatory. Has the government realised how far reaching the effects will be? In our case, it soon will not be financially viable for myself to remain in the work force, as after paying substantial child&hyphen;care fees, my salary is significantly reduced.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an example of one letter I have had amongst many. Even after briefings from the department, the directors of child&hyphen;care centres in my area were jointly saying that the full story was not being told about the measures that were going to affect many parents, including single mums. Several directors came to my office for assistance in getting the message about the failure of the government to provide the full picture to parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that as well as services having to increase fees due to the loss of operational funding, family benefits will also be reduced. Entitlements to be reduced as listed by those within the industry are: $30 per dependent child,  currently deducted from the family income, when calculating eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance will go; fringe benefits will be considered in calculating eligibility; the ceiling rate of $115 per week will not increase for three years, thereby increasing the gap for parents; eligibility for child&hyphen;care assistance and cash rebate has decreased; and child&hyphen;care assistance will be available for only 50 hours per week, thereby reducing flexibility of centres for opening to meet family needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It cannot be challenged that the child-care profession has in the past five to 10 years come a long way in the provision of high quality child care. Systems in place, for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3444"> example accreditation for long day care, are attracting international recognition. We cannot afford to take a backward step at this crucial time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rhetoric from the government is that there is a commitment to increase flexibility and that opportunities will abound for families reliant on child care, but the budgetary strategies in place are to the contrary and will, according to the industry, in fact decrease family opportunities and choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These things that I have quoted have all come to me from the north-west coast of Tasmania&mdash;some from other areas of the state, but mainly my duty electorate of the north-west. I have visited child-care centre after child-care centre&mdash;Ms Macklin came down and visited child-care centres&mdash;and all these issues were drawn to my attention. That is where I draw these facts from. We must not lose sight of the fact that our children are our most precious resource.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to take part in this debate and debunk some of the myths that have been promoted by those opposite. First of all, in this debate we have been accused of breaking promises. Let us analyse that statement. A promise that is made in good faith and is not broken but for a supervening event which then makes it impossible to keep, is in fact not a broken promise. You see, we went to the last election believing the Labor Party's figures and the supervening event was that the Labor Party did not tell us the truth during the election campaign and we were left with an $8 billion deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party very glibly and cynically refused to accept that fact. That was the supervening event that did not allow us as an incoming government to be able to meet all the commitments we made. But whose fault is that? The Liberal Party? Or is it because the Labor Party had the cupboard bare because of their extravagance and overspending in their desperate attempt to try to remain in office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each time the Labor Party denies that budget truth of the $8 billion deficit, they reinforce within the public's mind that they have learnt nothing from their shattering <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> defeat on 2 March, which was of such humiliating proportions. The community feedback overall has been that this is a fair and reasonable budget given the circumstances which confronted us as an incoming government. Overwhelmingly, it has been accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a realisation within the community that there is no benefit in bankrupting our children's future for cheap political point scoring and to try to keep ourselves popular with the electorate. If we spend money today that we do not have, we are mortgaging the future of our children. There is no social justice, from whatever angle you may wish to look at it, in spending money that we do not have today on the basis that a future generation will have to pay it back. So let us put this whole debate and the budget into context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia now realise that we do have to bring in the budget deficit. We cannot keep going as we have been. The Labor Party just refuse to acknowledge that they left us with this problem. Sure, they do not have to acknowledge it, but the people of Australia realise there is this problem. They realise that we did not create it, but they do realise that we are going to fix it up. We will and we are committed to doing so because of our commitment to the families and children of this country not to leave them with a legacy of debt but rather an inheritance. We want to leave them with something good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did not create the problems and until the Labor Party can come up with an alternative budget strategy which says how they would cover the $8 billion that they left by way of a deficit, they should not get up in this chamber at all and seek to make a contribution to the way the government is arranging the fiscal affairs of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that our policies are anti-family. I have to say that that would come as a surprise for the overwhelming number of people who voted for us at the last election. It would come as a great surprise for those lower income families, with combined incomes of less than $70,000 per annum, who are now going to be saved $1 billion in tax payments. It will come as a real surprise that somehow that measure is anti-family. It will also come as a bit of a surprise to them that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3445"> $7.70 a fortnight for each dependent child for low income families is also somehow anti-family. I  would be interested to hear from those opposite in their next contributions how those sorts of measures are anti-family. It would be really interesting to see how their cerebral processes work in trying to justify that sort of statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a $51.90 a fortnight tax break for families on less than $70,000 a year, with two dependent children, who take out private health insurance. Somehow that is anti-family. Because of our measures, interest rates are already coming down. That saves the average family a lot of money each month on the mortgage payments. Yet again, Labor would say to us that that as well is somehow anti-family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that we are committed to the family unit. In fact, during the campaign we were ridiculed for wanting to go back to the 1950s and 1960s. That was the catchcry of the Labor Party&mdash;that somehow we wanted to go back and really talk about the family unit, and that assistance for the family was nothing really. Of course, the people of Australia said, `It is something, we are concerned and we are going to vote for the government that is committed to the family unit.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noted in recent days that Senator Crowley seems to have got her courage back after her confidence-shattering performance as a minister. She is a minister whose record on child care is best summarised by her refusal to allow Christmas carols to be sung at a child-care centre.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley quotes from John Howard's previous statements as well. Let me tell you this: if you want to try to embarrass us because of our support for the family unit, go right ahead, because we unashamedly support the family unit. The problem is that those people within the Labor Party are in a real conflict. There are some who really do genuinely support the family unit, but then there are those others like Senator Crowley who are really motivated by the extreme ideological stance of the sisterhood. That is the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the sisterhood has been let down by the Liberal Party. We have let them down, but we have not let down the other 99 per <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3446"> cent of women in Australia who so overwhelmingly voted for us. The women of Australia recognise how good our policies are, and that is why they voted for them. Of course, it is the Labor Party that have this patronising policy of saying, `Thirty-five per cent of our candidates have to be women. We are not going to choose them on merit or anything else. It just has to be 35 per cent.' Then they could not even live up to that expectation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we did in the Liberal Party was to say, `Anybody can run for endorsement. If you are good enough, you'll win.' We have a record number of women in this parliament, not because we had patronising quotas and said, `Oh, these poor little women darlings. We need to help them into parliament, as the Labor Party does.' We say, `The women in our party are equal. They will contest preselections with us as equals.' They have won preselections; they have done very well. Of course, we see them on our front benches now in such excellent performers as Senator Newman and Judi Moylan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party's record is one where the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. That was recognised by former Prime Minister Mr Hawke. So, in a desperate bid to try to regain the initiative, do you know what he promised? He promised that no child would live in poverty by 1990. What a great promise! Senator Crowley has the audacity to come in here and say, `You people break promises.' My goodness! She has the audacity to come in here and say that. It really is disingenuous of you people opposite to try to make something out of this motion and our child-care policies.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to the matters raised by Senator Denman in her speech. I must say that, out of the speeches from the other side, at least Senator Denman's was a sincere speech&mdash;albeit misguided but, nevertheless, it was genuinely sincere. I take it on that basis&mdash;unlike the contributions of the other people from the other side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community based long&hyphen;day&hyphen;care sector has played an important part in delivering and improving the quality of child care to Australians over the last 24 years. Guess when the operational subsidies were, in fact, introduced? They were introduced under a Liberal McMahon government in 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since that time, the child&hyphen;care industry has changed dramatically. Private centres have never been eligible for operational subsidies even though they currently provide care for about 70 per cent of all children in long day care centres. What is fair about that? Why is it that the private sector should not be given an operational subsidy but others should, so that parents who happen to have to send their kids to a private centre have to pay more for their child care whereas those who are in the community long day care centres get a subsidy from the taxpayer? I do not think you can argue that proposition and say that that is fair and reasonable, especially when 70 per cent of the children who are the users of the child care get no benefit whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to remove operational subsidies from 1 July next year places parents and services on an equal footing. What is more, because we realise that those changes will mean some dislocation within the community and within the industry, we have provided for a lengthy changeover period and set aside substantial funding to assist centres to manage the loss of this subsidy and to ensure that families in disadvantaged areas do not lose access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite withdrawing that operational subsidy, we are still directing our funding to ensure that there is no undue hiatus during the changeover period. Operational subsidies will be retained in family day care, outside school hours care, multifunctional services and multifunctional Aboriginal services&mdash;services which, I would submit to the Senate, are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3447"> crucial to meeting the diverse needs of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to our child&hyphen;care policy generally, I believe that it is important to note a few very important matters. The package of measures in this budget is clear evidence of this government's ongoing commitment to child care, amounting to $5 billion over the estimates period, and provides the foundations for a coherent national framework for the long-term sustainability of the child&hyphen;care sector. Child&hyphen;care payments will be made through the new service delivery agency, with parents being given the choice to receive benefits directly or to have them paid to their approved service. It looks as though the lights have gone out on the other side, but I am still with you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be no dilution of existing quality requirements for services. The link between child&hyphen;care assistance and accreditation will be maintained, and parents and industry will be consulted about implementation. That was one of the matters that Senator Denman raised, saying that there had not been consultation up to this time. I would suggest to her that, to a certain extent, there has. But, because of the transitional period, which is going to be of some duration, and the assistance of extra funding to assist during that transitional period, there will be a lot of consultation. As a result, the matter which Senator Denman quite properly raised as a matter of concern has been thought of and will be addressed, and, therefore, her concerns in that area will be appropriately relieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of this government's very short term so far, of only six months, has been one which is unashamedly focused on the lower and middle income earners of this country, one which is focused on the family and the proper care for children. Funding has been allocated to assist services, as I have said <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> before, in making the transition to target specific gaps in supply. It is appropriate just to read out a few of those amounts. Some $8.3 million has been set aside over two years to enable community based long day care centres to purchase financial management services to assist them in restructuring their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did we not hear any of that from those opposite? Because they are embarrassed about the sensitive way in which we are dealing with the budgetary constraints imposed upon us by their mismanagement over the past 13 years. There will be an extra $12.5 million available over four years to ensure that families in severely disadvantaged areas do not lose access to child care. Undoubtedly, that is another cause of embarrassment to the Labor Party&mdash;that we have deliberately focused and sought to look after those in severely disadvantaged areas. The Australian Labor Party deliberately does not talk about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a $10.9 million payment over four years to develop services in remote and rural areas where the private sector will not locate. The area that Senator Denman talked about, the north&hyphen;west coast, could well fit into that category and there could be those sorts of concerns addressed. Let me say to her that $10.9 million has been provided for those areas and that $31 million over four years has been provided to enhance access to services for children with high levels of additional needs. Additional funding has been provided to both the community and private services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unlike the former minister, Senator Crowley, whose departmental officers gave the game away during estimates, we are not in the business of juggling figures. We are not in the business of saying that there are underlying budget surpluses when clearly there were not. And, of course, we have committed ourselves to be as open as the Australian people have ever had government administration. We make no apology for targeting those in the low income and middle income areas for special attention and special assistance because they were so terribly neglected under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken about the changes in child care and, for some reason, Senator Evans <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3448"> would want us to note those changes with concern. The only matter that we ought to note with great concern is the $8 billion budget deficit with which we were confronted when we came into government. That is a matter of real concern and is the one thing that the Australian Labor Party will never acknowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say, I am quite happy if they do not acknowledge it because the longer they deny that reality the longer they will remain in opposition. The Labor Party know what the people think of them. Gary Grey said it, and Senator Sue Mackay ably assisted him in that report which said the Labor Party stank. What has happened is that we, as a government, are looking after the child&hyphen;care industry in a way that is fair to all and, in particular, looks after the 70 per cent who do not get the subsidies that the Labor Party seems to be promoting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I must commend Senator Evans on is his reference to the Liberal Party's family tax initiative which is specifically targeted at the family. It is now acknowledged, finally, by the Labor Party that the Liberal Party's family tax initiative does exist and does provide benefits. We are told that we ought be noting with concern the reduced choices available to Australians. In fact, they will be given extra choice. The Labor Party have never been in favour of choice. They want to tell everybody how to live their lives and what they should believe in through their political correctness and things like that, but that has been overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian people. They ought to get back into the real world, realise the heyday of the past 13 years is over and that we are now getting on with the job of providing real assistance to the people and families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us conclude on this note. We, as a government, are committed unashamedly to the family, to the future of our country and to our children. There is no social justice in spending big money today and letting the children pay it off tomorrow. We want to provide our children with an inheritance, not a legacy of debt. Once the Australian Labor Party realise that that is the basis on which we are attacking the problems of government <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and budgetary responsibility, we might be able to have more constructive debates on a whole range of measures. But whilst they deny the mess that they left and try to say that it does not exist and that we ought to keep spending as though there is no tomorrow and no deficit, we will not be able to have a rational debate on issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that fortifies me is that the Australian people do not believe what the Australian Labor Party are saying to them about this budget and about the deficit. They realise there is a problem which needs to be fixed. They realise we did not create the problem and they realise that we have set about to fix it. That is the important thing that the people of Australia are going to find out, have already found out and will continue to find out over the next 2&half; years of this current term of government and I look forward to many further terms of a Howard&hyphen;Costello government which will deliver true social justice to the people of Australia without mortgaging the future of our children.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I don't think they do. Anyway, I do not have to deal with that; that is his problem. There are people not only coming to my office but, as I said, also jamming up my fax machine sending submissions. All of them are saying that this government has betrayed them in terms of child care. I want to say one thing that I believe everyone in this chamber would agree with; that is, families are important. I would also add that any other statement about families beyond this is bound to open up vigorous debate. This is especially so when governments try to define what a family should look like. Mind you, they do not have to do that in words. They do not necessarily have to legislate a definition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ideological views about family can be promoted by shifting government assistance through budgets. The Democrats would argue that the coalition has determined its preferred family in measures it has taken in the 1996 budget. The Democrats believe that governments ought not to do that. They ought not to try to define nor confine families in this way. Surely, the role of government in regard to Australian families ought to be to set a framework within which all of our families, whatever shape they might take, will be encouraged to reach their full potential. A very important part of that framework is what governments do with child care. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, the Democrats are concerned about the negative impact which many of the government's proposed changes to child care will have on families. There is little doubt that many of these changes&mdash;the abolition of operational subsidies to community based centres, the 50&hyphen;hour cap on child&hyphen;care assistance per child per week, the abolition of the additional income allowed for additional dependent children and the two&hyphen;year freeze on child&hyphen;care assistance and the child&hyphen;care cash rebate&mdash;will impact significantly on the cost and accessibility of child care for many families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats recognise the tremendous pressure many families face in juggling work and family commitments. We recognise that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for many families the financial benefit of working now only just outweighs the cost of child care. The Democrats are now deeply concerned that any significant increase in the cost of child care will force at least some parents to take their children out of formal care altogether. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will leave many families with two choices. One is that one parent will have to give up work to care for the children full&hyphen;time; or they will have to look for alternative, less formal, and therefore also less regulated, forms of child care&mdash;backyard child care, if you like. We do not believe that forcing parents out of the work force or forcing parents to place their children in forms of child care which are not subject to quality control is an acceptable or desirable choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So much for the government's pledge to make things better for families through the new family tax initiative. Many families will now need this new payment just to meet the increased cost of child care, the increased cost of medicines, the probable increase in the cost of going to the doctor, the increased cost of going to the dentist, increased higher education repayments, the increased cost of nursing home expenses, and the increased cost of home and community care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are still considering what their response to many of these changes will be. But I can give you this guarantee: in determining our position, we believe it is very important to take time to listen to those who are going to be most affected by these changes. The Democrats have been consulting widely with parents, child&hyphen;care providers and peak bodies. I can assure you that our final position on the child&hyphen; care budget will be very much in line with our long&hyphen;held commitment to quality, affordable and accessible child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that all parents should have a real choice when it comes to combining work and family responsibilities. We believe all families should have a real choice about the type of care they want for their children. We support a mixture of family day care and community based, work based and private child&hyphen;care centres as the most practical and equitable way of providing the range of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3450"> services required. Because of that, we do not believe that ideologically driven definitions of what an acceptable family should be, dressed up as changes in a budget, are acceptable either to us or to the majority of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the faxes which seem to amuse the government so much. It seems as though they are prepared to laugh at the agony of people as they struggle to understand their future. Let me read a few excerpts from some of the correspondence I have received on these issues. I believe this will give senators an insight into what Australian families understand they are facing. This person says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I searched a long time for child care that would ensure that my son &amp; daughter would thrive and be loved and cared for and would allow me to return to the workforce and my chosen career with some peace of mind. I found that at a community based centre, which created a happy, safe &amp; secure environment, had highly trained staff, an excellent developmental program and most of all, one where the staff became part of an "extended" family for us, because of the care they provided for my children. . . Our children are a precious resource in our community and I resent the fact that their care is being treated like a saleable commodity and financial bargaining point&mdash;all in the interests of PRO&hyphen;FAMILY CUTS.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume they mean tax cuts. The person continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If family is so important then surely its time to stand up for the rights of families and support them in providing affordable and quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA>Another person&mdash;again, someone whom the coalition seems to want to dismiss by laughing at the fact that they have contacted my office&mdash;says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My four year old daughter attends a community day care centre in the Northern suburbs of Perth. . . The impact this Budget cut will have on me personally is that I may have to reconsider whether or not to remain in the workforce . . . My husband is not on a high salary. We have a mortgage, a car loan and very little disposable income once our bills have been paid. However, we want to continue to pay our way and work towards financial security for the future.</PARA>
<PARA>Another person&mdash;again, someone whom the coalition apparently would dismiss by their laughter&mdash;wrote to me as follows:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to express our dissatisfaction with the new guidelines laid down in the 1996 Budget. With the new fees in force, we will have no option other than to reconsider the viability of a second income and therefore will have to reconsider day care altogether as trying to squeeze a further $50 or so a week in addition to our fees will be near to impossible.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Another parent wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am a single parent and if the fees are increased I will have to take my child out of the centre. I will have to stop studying which will be really disappointing as I want to create a better future for my child.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, another parent wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cuts to community long day care centres will result in the closure of community based centres as parents will be hard hit by the ensuing fee increases. At the centre that my 3 year old son attends, I have been told to expect increases in the vicinity of $26.00 per week. As a full time student, I will not be able to absorb these costs and, as a result, will have to withdraw my son from the centre.</PARA>
<PARA>While there are some positives for families in the budget, let me acknowledge that, for many other families the pain will outweigh the gain. This is despite the claim that the budget is fair because all are supposed to share the pain. Let me point out that it is quite obvious that the equal treatment of unequals leads to gross injustice. In this budget, the rich have been slapped with a feather while the poor have been bashed with a mallet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this government is engaged in the most radical experiment in social engineering this country has seen in a generation. It seems to be almost a kind of religious crusade. I abhor what is being done to families. I, as do the Democrats, support very strongly this motion.</PARA>

We met at locations throughout Australia, not just in capital cities and major regional centres, where one would expect the bulk of Commonwealth public works proposals to be constructed. We ranged far and wide, going to remote locations such as Christmas Island, Maralinga, Ceduna, Puckapunyal and Canungra, to name just a few of the places we had to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We presented 29 reports on projects estimated to cost in excess of $1.5 billion. It was certainly a very busy year compared to others. In 1994 we presented 14 reports on $320 million worth of projects. In 1993 we presented only nine reports on works costing something like $252 million. In 1992 we presented 21 reports on works costing $1.4 billion. By any criteria, this was one of the busiest and most productive years in the committee's long history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parliament and the people of Australia were very well served by the committee, whose role is essentially that of a watchdog of Commonwealth public works. The committee examined projects wide-ranging in purpose and cost. In terms of their stated purposes, they ranged from defence projects to office accommodation, law courts, CSIRO laboratories, overseas works, soil decontamination and defence housing. In terms of costs, these ranged from $6.8 million for a Defence Housing Authority project at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3452"></EMPHASIS>to a massive $264 million project in the Northern Territory on stage 2 of the Army presence in the north project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Defence housing projects costing more than $232 million were examined during the year. They involved housing developments at Canungra, Westernport, Darwin and Townsville. I think my colleagues from the Public Works Committee would agree that the standard of housing that is being erected for our defence personnel at present is of excellent quality and certainly is long overdue for our defence personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also reported an overseas public works estimated to cost something like $74 million, although we do not have the opportunity to visit those projects and peruse them at first hand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Senator Foreman was the chairman of this committee, I believe he had the same problem. Every time we present a report we make the same comment. It is also interesting to note that of all the projects we have during the year, no matter how big the budget is, the ones we have the most problems with and the ones that tend to cause us the most concern are the overseas projects. A good example of that was the Australia House refurbishment this year. After having approved the project for some $7 million, there was a blow-out in the cost for no explained reason. When we carried out some investigations we found that they had omitted certain things, including the cabling for the computers, costing half a million dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present the Overseas Property Group provides us with videos of the new sites or of existing conditions and a model of what is supposed to be constructed. I think our committee has been highly critical of some of the standards of the buildings that have been built overseas, particularly given the fact that they are supposed to reflect Australian culture and heritage. Unfortunately, the ones I have seen over the years are not the sort of buildings that I would think stand up under any standards. Tokyo is a good example. We attempted to get around these unsatisfactory arrangements by the chairman and the deputy chair, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in particular, using the opportunity when they were overseas on other business to look at some of these projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's concerns over the year have resulted in a review of energy standards, which is quite significant. The committee also continued to insist that solar hot water heaters be provided in houses being constructed by the Defence Housing Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a number of instances environmental clearances were not obtained before projects were referred to the committee. In one instance this resulted in a proposed site here in Canberra being declared unsuitable for development due to the presence of an endangered species of earless dragon lizard. The result was that a new site had to be found and additional expenditure of $650,000 was incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One area of concern involves soil or site contamination: the rehabilitation of the former British nuclear test site at Maralinga in South Australia is a case in point. We were very privileged to see the new technology being used there. Using high voltage they are going to fuse the soil so that any plutonium that is still there will be held in suspension to reduce the risk of any contamination of the local Aboriginal people. The cost of this particular project was $104 million, but I am happy to say that about half of the cost was borne by the British taxpayers. As is our practice we spent a day at Maralinga, during which the Commonwealth experts in nuclear test site remediation showed us the extent of the problem and the ways in which contaminated soil and test detritus will be made safe. The technique is called in situ vitrification, I believe. As I said, it is where the two electrodes in the soil melt the soil into a glass&hyphen;like substance and it holds all the nasties in suspension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other projects involving remediation or uncertainty were the sites selected for a housing development in Darwin and the need for the site of the Australian Embassy complex in Hanoi and the new high commission in Port Moresby to be declared free of unexploded ordnance. The cost of projects continued to be a matter of concern, especially professional fees for consultants and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3453"> considerable sums of money set aside for contingencies, particularly in the UK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report gives well&hyphen;deserved credit to the untiring efforts of two former members of the committee: Ray Braithwaite and Ben Humphreys. Throughout the past year and previous years they continued to question sponsors and designers about mechanisms designed to deter collusive tendering, and guaranteed the payment of subcontractors. In fact, as a result of Mr Braithwaite's concerns, I think the Braithwaite amendment, as we call it, will be coming through to ensure that in the future subcontractors are always catered for and will not lose out if the contractor goes broke. The latter is now covered by Australian Standard 2124, which should serve as the basis of any tender documents the Commonwealth is involved in. On the question of collusive tendering&mdash;otherwise known as anti&hyphen;competitive conduct&mdash;we know that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found evidence of it in the Brisbane concrete market and has imposed heavy fines. I hope this serves as a lesson to the construction industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report acknowledges the leadership of the former chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) during 1995, which marks the tenth year of his appointment to the committee and his eighth year as chairman. I am sure that the chamber recognises that under his leadership the Public Works Committee has earned a very enviable reputation as a watchdog.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last evening we had a dinner to farewell the secretary, Peter Roberts, and Denise Denahy, who are both very good servants of the Public Works Committee. It was interesting to see that Ray Braithwaite, Ewen Cameron, and Bert James&mdash;a former Labor Party chairman of the Public Works Committee&mdash;were in attendance. I would like to take the opportunity to wish Peter Roberts&mdash;the long serving secretary of the committee&mdash;and Denise Denahy all the very best in their retirement.

Peter Roberts and Denise Denahy certainly deserve congratulations. Michael Fetter and, of course, the other staff of the committee made it run it as efficiently as it did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee had 23 references in one year and reported on 20 of them. I think it is a fairly reasonable effort, particularly when you consider the amounts of money and the projects that the Public Works Committee deals with. One thing I have found somewhat concerning is how often departments come forward with projects that seem to have a fixed price. It is never a fixed price and it blows out quite substantially. In fact, so much so in some cases that it is almost unbelievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three in particular that I would like to make reference to: the proposed decontamination of the former explosives factory at Albion in Victoria, the refurbishment of Australia House in London, and one&mdash;yet to be reported on and a decision taken&mdash;which relates to the rock fall defence on Christmas Island. That was rather interesting. The department had spent some $12 million or thereabouts refurbishing some buildings below a cliff. Within 12 months they had decided that somehow some rocks might fall down, so they had to shift the population out of those buildings which had been refurbished. They wanted to spend another $22 million building new buildings somewhere else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was rather curious about it in terms of the rock fall: when the last rock fell and what the percentages of opportunity might be for people actually being killed or creating some liability for Commonwealth. Of course, most of the people who lived in that area in those buildings actually thought it was some big con job to get them out so as to make it into <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3454"> tourist accommodation. It was rather interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More recently, we had the Federal Police, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, and the Department of Industrial Relations put up proposals to us here in Canberra for building new accommodation buildings within the Barton centre. This is another very important aspect of this committee's work as it relates to the ACT and the development and management of it, and also the Commonwealth's responsibilities that continue within the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There seems to be very little cooperation or discussion that takes place between the various bodies that have some responsibility for the planning of the ACT at an ACT government level. Recently, when the public works committees met in the ACT Assembly, I actually put a question to the chairman of that meeting about why it is that there seems to be very little communication between the three bodies that actually have some responsibility for planning within&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, two planning bodies that do not seem to talk one another. When we were actually dealing with the applications of the various departments for new buildings within the Barton centre&mdash;or the Golden Triangle as it is known here&mdash;the ACT Assembly opposed them, as did a number of other local interests and local government groups. Because Canberra is basically a bunch of satellite type cities, the planning was given no consideration as to where these things ought to be located in terms of the best interests, the other resources and also the services that need to be provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the 59th report we dealt with some very important issues: the decontamination at Maralinga, Defence housing and the planning for Defence housing. Clearly, some departments have their act together but, in so far as many of them go, the issue of cost overruns is an unacceptable practice. Hopefully, as time goes by, we will see a greater ability on their part to bring proposals before the committee ultimately responsible for making recommendations to the government, or to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister responsible for the expenditure of funds, in a more efficient and exacting way because it will be the only way that we will allow for a more exact expenditure process&mdash;in terms of the budget process&mdash;overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the very short period that I have been on the committee, I was quite amazed at just how often departments would come back for very sizeable increases in expenditure. Quite often, it was for things that you would have thought ought to have been staring them in the face in the first place. Even though the departments were quite often questioned about these matters by the committee in the first instance, we were quite regularly given assurances that it would not be the case that they would be back for another bucketful of money. The reality was quite different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Calvert, I commend the report. I would also like to commend the former chairman, Mr Colin Hollis, who, I have to say, ran the committee in a very efficient way. We always had to be on time. If we were not on time, we always got a kick up the backside. The now chairman, Neil Andrew, who was the deputy chairman, is also doing an admirable job of chairing the committee. The committee provided me with the opportunity to see a great number of places, many of them very interesting. I commend this report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>First of all, in speaking to this report, I would like to thank the secretariat and the support staff who had a particularly difficult job in the preparation of this report. That was made more difficult as a result of the shoddiness of so many of the government departments and agencies which were so late in their responses <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3455"> to questions. It was made so much more difficult as a result of the evasion of so many of the Telstra officials who appeared before the committee; they were making answers to questions as remote as possible from the questions that they were actually asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that so many other particulars of the questions were not responded to adequately&mdash;this is particularly the case with regard to the revelations that this committee uncovered about project Mercury, and the details of the scoping study&mdash;demonstrated beyond any possible doubt that this government has embarked upon a program of destroying Telstra as part of its drive for privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear, as Mercury documents have revealed, that this government is set upon a course of action to destroy Telstra by the removal of one&hyphen;third of the employees of Telstra as part of its program to minimise its costs effectiveness and therefore produce a better result as part of the scoping study and as part of the prospectus. That means that the real question about the cost of privatisation of Telstra is very much being borne by the 24,000 Australian workers and their families who have been identified under project Mercury to go as a result of this government's privatisation drive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As far as I am concerned, this report and inquiry demonstrated my long held view that the selling of Telstra to private shareholders is not in the public's interest. If we put ideology and rhetoric aside, we will find that there is no substantive argument for the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 650 submissions received, and the 135 witnesses who appeared before the committee, the only real supporters for the privatisation of Telstra were the government departments&mdash;under the direction of the Minister for Communications and the Arts&mdash;and the officials of Telstra. I might add that the Telstra officials would enjoy quite considerable benefits as they moved to privatisation as a result of the movement to private salaries and all the bonus shares that come with that, as we have seen with all other privatisations that have occurred in so many other government departments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria we saw the most obscene of this, where the chief executive managed to pick up a salary package of some $8 million. In that case Jeff Kennett had sold off TABcorps and introduced a whole new regime which saw public benefits being stripped away and private benefits being accorded to the shareholders. Nothing could be further from the public interest, particularly in the case of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen a purely illusionary economic justification for this sale. Telstra has set a record profit in its return to this parliament through the public purse and has produced a magnificent result in so many areas of world's best practice. In so many areas of its financial performance it is way above world's best practice. You will not hear that from this government, which is determined to talk down the performance of Telstra in an effort to find some reasons as to why it should try to get its hands on $8 billion. This is part of its program of bribes to the Australian people and political blackmail involved with this program of privatisation to fund its so-called environment programs&mdash;programs which ought to be funded properly out of its budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The use of international studies by government agents has been cited to try to demonstrate some sort of international respectability. The World Bank study, in particular, looked at some 6,800 cases of privatisation. Some 6,100 of them were in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and 4,500 of them were in the former German Democratic Republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The officials were brought before the committee and asked: `Can you demonstrate an occasion where privatisation has worked well and for the benefit of the public in circumstances similar to those of Australia's economy, its social structure, its demography and its geography?' `No,' was the answer right across the board. In fact, there is no example relating to the privatisation of a company with the same profit levels and the same regulatory authority as Telstra&mdash;none whatsoever. It is quite clear. This government has sought&mdash;for rhetorical, not empirical reasons&mdash;a politically engineered, ideologically driven program aimed at ensuring the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3456"> destruction of one of Australia's great companies, possibly one of the world's great companies.</PARA>

I have to say that Senator Carr's contribution today has been as breathtaking as the contribution of the opposition parties throughout the whole inquiry. I found the inquiry to be absolutely the most unrealistic waste of money that I have ever seen in my almost 12 years in this place. For the opposition parties&mdash;the Democrats and the Labor Party&mdash;to wilfully spend taxpayers' money to the degree that they did on an inquiry about which they had already made up their minds prior to the first hearing date is scandalous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, they went to your fine town of Townsville, which is a beautiful town. But they spent $3.34 per second to go up there and listen to two witnesses whose evidence at best could be called questionable and at worst could be called, in one particular case, outrageous. There was absolutely no point at all to be made in this exercise other than to turn the whole question of the partial privatisation of Telstra into a farce, with the Labor Party engineering witness after witness after witness to talk about a whole lot of unrelated issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We saw submission after submission being completely and utterly repetitive of the issues that had been raised by the Labor Party in the hearings and just coincidentally appearing in the submissions of many of those who gave evidence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at the statements of the Labor Party about the unemployment impact in the context of their record. We have a party on the opposition benches now which was in government for 13 years and which privatised completely Australian Airlines, a la Qantas, and which privatised completely the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories without a blink of an eye in spite of the fact that it gave an assurance prior to a number of elections that it would do the reverse.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one had listened completely to the credible evidence given by individuals who were not primed up like those unions and so forth who came before the committee, one would find that there were guarantees of service obligations and that there would not have been what was alleged there would be&mdash;timed local calls. That was a Labor Party suggestion many years ago. Because of the electoral damage that that caused them in the federal seat of Adelaide&mdash;they lost the federal seat of Adelaide&mdash;they are trying to turn that into a ramification of this bill. It is absolutely and utterly untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have tried to imply that there will be ramifications in rural and regional parts of Australia. Why is it then that those people who actually live in and represent those areas came before the committee and gave contrary evidence? Why is it that the National Farmers Federation, who would have a far better idea about what is going on in the bush than any of the people sitting opposite, came before us and said that over 60 per cent of their membership agreed with the partial privatisation of Telstra?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3458">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that Western Australian rural women came before the committee and vociferously defended the position that they believed that the partial privatisation of Telstra would give them a better deal, would stop Telstra charging outrageously for repairs and installations at various times? It is absolutely and utterly absurd. This is a situation where the key and fundamental issues that were brought out in evidence at this committee have been totally and utterly overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a list here of all the Commonwealth asset sales conducted by the former Labor government since 1987. So this list is not even a comprehensive list; it is only a partial list. Let me give you some classic examples. We do not have any excuse as to why the Labor Party has opposed the partial privatisation of Telstra when they have sold things like the lease of Chifley Square in Sydney, the Commonwealth phosphate rock stockpile, the Commonwealth Government Centre in Melbourne, the Paris head of mission residence, the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Service, the Commonwealth equity in the Primary Industries Bank of Australia, the National Materials Handling Bureau and Williamstown dockyard&mdash;a further $1.2 million in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list goes on and on. There was also the Tokyo embassy sale redevelopment project, the defence service homes scheme, Australia House in Sydney, the sale of property to Film Australia, the ACT housing loans assistance scheme and the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The list is endless. That is only the first two pages, and there are many more pages to go.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, unfortunately it has not, Senator Campbell. This is not even a comprehensive list in terms of 13 years of Labor administration of the Commonwealth assets that were just simply flogged off for no good reason. Here we are talking about a partial privatisation&mdash;a partial privatisation&mdash;and it has been so badly misrepresented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this Labor Party were really desperate to get it right, it would not be misrepresenting things the way it is. Once again, we were told <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that 700 people would lose their jobs in Townsville. Witnesses were repeatedly asked: on what basis would 700 people in Townsville lose their jobs in Telstra? At the end of the day we found out by a circuitous route that in fact the number was arrived at because that was the total number of Telstra employees in Townsville so they must all lose their jobs because Telstra was going to be partially privatised&mdash;the most illogical nonsense that one could possibly dream up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet one of the their own witnesses&mdash;in fact, a couple of their own witnesses, but one in particular&mdash;whom they thought they had primed up so well spilt the beans. I will quote from the report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr McLean, Queensland branch secretary, communications division, CEPU, had this exchange with Senator Tierney:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tierney:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those job losses (in Telstra) are primarily driven by technology?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">McLean:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yes. The major driver is technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tierney:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> You would agree that these technological changes will continue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">McLean:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yes, and the union recognises that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tierney:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Given that you have said that job losses are basically technologically driven, that will go on regardless of whether Telstra stays in full private ownership or is partly privatised, will it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">McLean:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For jobs that are technically driven it does not matter about ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>One of their own mates admitted that the scare campaign that had been run on the unemployment issue was not as a consequence of this. Mind you, the other thing Labor did not mention was that its policies had seen 19,000 people lose their jobs in Telstra under Labor administration. Did Labor mention that? No way. We cannot muddy the waters with the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this whole inquiry was that it was so skewed right from the word go. The report could have been written before the first hearing and there was absolutely no consideration of the evidence that was given in a substantial fashion. That is how we have ended up with a majority report&mdash;a majority report that has not been based on the evidence that was provided to the committee about the benefits of partial privatisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking tonight in relation to the tabled document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telstra: To sell or not to sell?</EMPHASIS>  In the last few years there has been what I believe to be a dangerous trend in legislation. This trend is to pass hastily drafted legislation which provides a basis for action but which contains insufficient safeguards or guidelines about how things are to be done or even what is to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had another example today in debating the Airports Bill. In putting it together the community consequences were not looked at and many of those are still coming out now. We have seen the World Trade Organisation bills and the competition policy bill which fit that model. These cases were brought together by the previous government. Both major parties agreed, but I can tell you many of the consequences will not come out for years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inadequate public provisions, inadequate attention or even comprehension of the implications is what we are seeing. Bills are rushed through with instruction from cabinet and shadow cabinet that no amendments or delays be allowed. Issues raised by the community, the Greens and Democrats receive virtually no response from government or opposition. We have seen those bills, like the World Trade Organisation bills and the competition policy bill, where a great deal of information was provided to committees and the recommendation was that the bills be passed unamended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report examines the bill to sell Telstra and concludes that selling Telstra is a bad idea. It recognises that the current dual carrier situation is not good. It points out that the current exemption from state or local laws and regulations by telecommunication companies is not good. It points out that the situation that will pertain after 1997, when any company is supposed to be allowed to compete with Telstra and Optus, is unclear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out that many of the problems which I see related to this&mdash;and I will explain a little more in relation to Austel&mdash;are in fact related to the fact that the bill on competition policy, which both parties put through last year, was also rushed through. It basically provides the basis for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> future operation of any telecommunication carriers in Australia. This report points out that the situation for service providers is also unclear. The whole issue of the implication for non&hyphen;telephone communications is unclear. We have just seen suggestions that there would be a separate rate for local calls involved in electronic transfers. Will these calls remain untimed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, we have an inquiry currently going on to examine the definition of standard telephone service, which will not report for some time. We are being asked to pass this bill and then to view the report on whether passing this bill in its present form is a good idea and what it actually means in terms of universal service obligations. If the standard telephone service changes, then our universal service obligations change in a large way&mdash;lots of money and there is obvious in&hyphen;built conflicts of interest in terms of sale price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the calibre of the legislation. It is obviously not being informed by real thought or investigation. The decisions on which this legislation is based are obviously not being informed by ordinary economics which, in the evidence given by Professor Quiggin, shows that it is economically more beneficial to retain Telstra and receive the profit flow than to sell it. There is a guarantee that there should be phone services to rural users. They are already disadvantaged by a huge range of cuts and transfers, the institution of user pays, and the elimination of cross-subsidies that results in higher costs for everyone not living in a major metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the report notes, there is little recognition of the quality of the service or the non&hyphen;telephonic telecommunications costs and availability of the services. This bill might as well have been written in the 1960s. There is little or no recognition that computer networking can provide a low&hyphen;cost option that allows, for example, children in rural schools access to cultural and informational resources they cannot duplicate or access in their towns. I particularly support the consumer protection recommendations in this report, such as Nos 15 through 17 and Nos 19 through 23. I also support recommendations Nos 23 to 36 on cabling. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3460">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to point out that there is a problem with reality here. Even if you have a recommendation which looks at strengthening Austel, there is no mention in this report that Austel will not be there after next year. The functions of Austel will be absorbed into the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. What does that mean? It means that already, as I mentioned before, the decisions that were taken in parliament in relation to rushing through the competition bill will in fact override many of these concerns. Public interest in its real sense will be in fact equated with profitability and corporate interest via the Competition and Consumer Commission. It is ironic that evidence from the consumers association seemed to show concern that the consumers themselves will benefit from this outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also support the major recommendations that Telstra remain in public hands and that the bill be split into two bills, one for the sale and one concerning the consumer service guarantee. That would obviously depend on how the bills would look, if that were the case. I do wish to make a suggestion, however. I think there is an assumption that the Senate might defeat the sale bill but the customer service guarantee bill might pass. It is what many of us might prefer to see. The reality is that a deal may be done that would allow the sale bill through while a customer service bill, especially if amended by the Senate, may languish in the House where government has control. My suggestion is that the Senate assure that the sale bill, if passed in some form, include in its commencement a requirement for the customer service guarantee bill to be passed before the sale bill comes into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make one particular comment in relation to words from Senator Knowles that evidence in Townsville was questionable and outrageous. I listened in where I could, sometimes by teleconference, to the evidence of this inquiry. The most outrageous thing I heard through all the inquiry was the way the witnesses were treated, the way the witnesses were denigrated and the way witnesses were often harassed. I listened with shame.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had people contacting me who were concerned&mdash;I have mentioned this in the chamber before&mdash;about appearing before the committee because they had heard how other witnesses were treated. This is disgraceful. Ironically, some of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that has been repeated in the government senators' minority report highlights some of their responses, such as to Stephanie Mayman in Western Australia as to whether or not she knew every word of the bill. The words of the inquiry were carefully chosen. It was quite acceptable, in my view, that people talk to a term of reference and not be harassed by the senators at that inquiry.</PARA>

He said that there were a number of economists who have a similar view and he outlined quite a substantial list of them. Senator O'Chee's response was that he did not think he had heard of any of those and did any of them have any standing. Professor Quiggin said, `One of them is a Nobel prize winner.' That was the standard of denigration of witnesses at this inquiry&mdash;a person giving a view, which in this case was supported by a Nobel prize winning economist, was denigrated for the value of his contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a very sorry way to conduct an inquiry, which basically was the only means by which the community would really have a chance to have some view and some say.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments with regard to this report in respect of its consideration of the dilution of public ownership of Telstra. Of course, as has been said many times, the situation regarding Telstra <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3461"> really is the issue of what is fundamental to nation building in this country and the provision of services, services that can be provided to all Australians equally. I think that is one of the very important factors that Telstra has been able to achieve. The fact that we have one of the world's highest percentages of access to telephones&mdash;some 97 per cent of Australians have that&mdash;clearly demonstrates the real community value of having Telstra kept in public ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is simply no way, in terms of any future situation with partial or indeed, as Senator Alston said, complete privatisation of Telstra, you would ever be able to deliver that in future, particularly as it relates to new technology. I think more and more it would be the case that people who may well purchase part or all of Telstra simply would not&mdash;no government could expect them to&mdash;provide the sort of funding that would be required to meet the community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very important aspect of this is the way the government has sought to link the sale of Telstra to the $1 billion `best ever' environment package. Of course, the government would like us and the Australian public to believe that their environment package was the best ever and that they are the real environmentalists of the Australian political scene.

So I would suggest to you that I am quite relevant to this report with regard to the sale of Telstra by mentioning the land fund and the relevance of it. It is the government that put it on the agenda. The government is the one that said that to the Australian public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I said to Senator Campbell, in terms of records on the environment&mdash;and this is directly linked to this particular report because this particular report does deal with the sale of Telstra, which is going to provide the money, according to the government and the Prime Minister, for a land fund that will do certain other things&mdash;this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3462"> has been claimed by the now government as being the best environment policy that has ever been. That is fully relevant to the sale and to this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to point out for Senator Campbell's benefit the government's real record in terms of environmental matters which, I think, demonstrates the big con that the government has effectively pulled over the Australian public's eyes in terms of what its previous record was. I think it is important to remind Senator Campbell at least that, had the coalition been in government for the last 13 years, the mining of Coronation Hill would have gone ahead. Uluru and Kakadu would have been handed back to the Northern Territory government&mdash;because that was the position that you took&mdash;instead of the indigenous people. Wet tropics would have been logged. More recently we have seen the Port Hinchinbrook situation and, of course, there was also the woodchip issue. Senator Campbell, you really ought to take a look at your record. Do not try to pull some con with regard to promising $1 billion for some ridiculous land fund which will come out of the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, in terms of Telstra's value to the Australian public per se, you just cannot go past the amount of money that it expends in this country purchasing both services and goods. There are huge amounts of money. In 1992 it had a five-year expenditure program which was in excess of $40 billion. It expended in 1994-95 some $3 billion. I think some 50 companies were awarded contracts over $10 million. Over $200 million has been invested in research. All of those things will be affected with the privatisation of Telstra, if it should proceed, either in part or in whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know. At the moment, we have Senator Alston at odds with the Prime Minister. He is saying that you lot are going to sell it all. We know you are. We know you want to. But, hopefully&mdash;with the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens and the two Independent senators&mdash;you will not be allowed to proceed with the sale.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on an issue raised yesterday in the other place by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) relating to the Communications Workers Union 1994 ballot. The minister raised the findings of Justice Moore on the issue of electoral fraud during this ballot. I also note from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) participated in the discussion. I will return to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been poorly advised on this matter. If he had read the complete judgment, he would have been less inclined to grandstand on this matter. I would like to read from page 18 of Justice Moore's findings, dated 14 August 1996. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . As this is likely to be the last judgement given in the inquiry it is appropriate that I refer to one other matter. It is not relevant to the issues I have dealt with but it is, in my opinion, a matter that should not go unrecorded. Following the orders of the 21 June 1996 further examination of ballot material was undertaken by Mr Westwood. He has given evidence about that further examination. What was revealed was a matter that I had not appreciated to that point, namely that in his original examination there were a limited number of fraudulently completed ballot papers favouring candidates who were not part of the Natour/Jarman team. Those numbers were increased by his later examination. Thus, it would appear, electoral fraud was not the province only of those supporting the Natour/Jarman team but it was perpetrated by others involved in the 1994 election as well.</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Moore has exposed that supporters of the Cook&hyphen;Battese team were involved in electoral fraud. Was there any indication of who might have been involved in this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to read to senators from a submission to Justice Moore from Edward Mason, dated 15 July 1996. Mr Mason was a candidate in the 1994 elections and a member of the Cook&hyphen;Battese team. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I do not believe that Noel Battese is fit and proper to hold office as a caretaker before the new <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3463"> elections. I have formed this opinion because of my knowledge of his actions during the 1994 elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the 1994 elections I attended a series of meetings that were held at Noel Battese's house. At these meetings I tried unsuccessfully to raise issues of campaign organisation but all Noel Battese was interested in discussing was vote collecting and how many ballot papers various people could collect for him. Joe Kanan was at all of these meetings and this was the only subject he wished to discuss. Noel Battese was constantly asking me throughout the campaign how many votes I could get "in the hand". I told Noel that I believed that vote collecting was illegal and that I would not be doing it. I believe that Noel Battese was heavily involved in the frauding of the ballot in the overturned 1994 elections and that this should disqualify him from holding office before the new elections. There are several witnesses who I believe could verify my claims.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>So there you have it. A member of the Cook&hyphen;Battese team has pointed directly at who is responsible. Yet Battese is the instigator of the challenge to the election on the grounds of electoral fraud. One of his own team has given him up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Mr Paul Westwood, the court appointed handwriting expert, in his report of 10 July 1996, points out that a number of individuals have completed ballot papers and voted for both tickets. So what the court has found is that supporters of the Cook&hyphen;Battese ticket have also filled out ballot papers voting for their opponents. Then they have demanded an electoral inquiry into fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like now to return to the role of the Prime Minister in this affair. Why, senators may ask. Well, I will tell you. In 1994, Prime Minister Howard took a direct role in this union election. He wrote a letter, using Commonwealth parliamentary funds, to members of the CWU. The question that Mr Howard's office has never answered is: how did his office gain access to the union voting roll? But the critical issue is that John Howard endorsed the Cook&hyphen;Battese team in a union how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote card mailed to all members of the union. An extract from the how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote card titled `For a strong honest leadership', which was included with John Howard's letter of endorsement for Cook and Battese, read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This time, a Liberal team is presenting itself with the full backing of the Liberal Party of Australia&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The how&hyphen;to&hyphen;vote card then lists Cook and Battese as the preferred candidates to support. Clearly, the Prime Minister is a supporter of this team. I ask: how did Mr Howard's office gain access to the CWU voting roll? Can the Prime Minister assure the Senate that his office was not involved, as a supporter, in collecting and filling out ballot papers during this ballot? Is the Prime Minister willing to cooperate with the federal police in their inquiries? I look forward to the inquiry into electoral matters.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

It is interesting to note the origins of this particular garden festival. The festivals started in Europe after World War II and often they were used to develop or redevelop degraded and bombed out land in Europe. But now they are run right across the world, particularly in Europe, because they represent good business. The Dutch flower industry, for example, is worth $10 billion annually.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Australia Day 1994, the city of Gosford won the right to host this A1 Expo International Garden Festival. To give the Senate some idea of the scale of it, it is not just, as some people often say, a flower show. It is actually on the scale of Expo 88 in Brisbane in terms of the size of the event and the amount of economic activity that it will generate. The total investment for the project has been estimated to be about $230 million. Because it is being staged in the year 2000 through to 2001, it will ideally complement the Olympic Games. People will be able to come out to Australia in the last part of the year 2000, go to the Olympic Games and then move on and see this brilliant expo of horticultural products on the central coast of New South Wales.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The event is to be run under the auspices of the Bureau of International Expositions in Paris and the AIPH in Brussels. It is being run in Australia by the Nursery Industry Association of Australia. It has the rights to the event and the site is the magnificent Mount Penang site above Gosford in New South Wales, which overlooks, from a high elevation, the beautiful Brisbane Waters. The people who have come out to Australia from Europe have concluded that this is truly a magnificent site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, John Howard, announced federal support last week in a letter released to Jim Lloyd, the new Liberal member for Robertson. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government supports the concept of a commercially viable international garden festival and is willing to consider an appropriate Commonwealth contribution consistent with national responsibilities for such an event.</PARA>
<PARA>And $300,000 has now been provided by the Commonwealth government as seed funding for the next stage of the development of this exciting exposition. The Prime Minister has agreed to the seed funding to assist in the further development of the concept and scope of this project and to assist in getting it through to its main stage, which will involve private investment. When the private investors get involved&mdash;and this is projected to start next year&mdash;the massive task of horticultural planting on the site will begin. There will be a private sector underwriter&hyphen;developer consortium which will be taking this project through to its completion. In the end, it is believed that the value, the profit, to the consortium could be in the order of $40 million to $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once private sector funding is in place, other government assistance will follow, including the construction of an Australian pavilion which will be a cultural asset to the Central Coast long after the floral exhibition has finished. Despite the value of this project&mdash;its value in so many ways&mdash;it was almost lost by the bungling of the ALP. Local member, Michael Lee, the man who was formally Minister for Communications, hesitated, did not give it support and did not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> take it to cabinet last year, and the event was almost lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately the new Liberal member for Robertson, Jim Lloyd, picked up the bundle and has run with it, with the assistance of the Hon. Barry Cohen who is a former minister in this place. They have worked hard together to get this project on track, including visiting 16 cabinet ministers to explain its benefits. I have never seen any one project get so much push and support in this place. For this reason, it finally paid off. In very tight budgetary conditions, they got the seed funding they required. The importance of this can be seen when you consider the economic and social benefits of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated by Traceys, a consultant group, that it will actually create $1&half; billion in economic activity. It will bring to the event 5.7 million visitors. It will create 18,000, one&hyphen;year full&hyphen;time equivalent jobs and the after&hyphen;value use of the improvements is estimated at $40 million. It will create a wonderful environmental and entertainment infrastructure right on the edge of Sydney which will be left permanently for the citizens of the Central Coast and for the whole of the New South Wales community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is much more than a flower show. It is a project of vision and great excitement and the government is now facilitating the private sector investment to generate real jobs and create real employment in the area. It is an opportunity for Australia to establish another very large international event right on the millennium which will focus the attention of the world on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Planet earth 2000 exhibition, as it is called, has other dimensions, apart from what I have mentioned. It creates trade, research and development opportunities. It will showcase Australia as an innovative leader in horticulture, primary industries, care and management of the environment and new technologies in water management and communications, and it will boost our exports, especially to Asia. The Senate should welcome this very bold initiative and, in particular, the support of the Howard government to help make it happen.</PARA>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, this is the first occasion on which I have had an opportunity to congratulate you on your recent election to this position. Tonight I rise to speak about this government's disgraceful decision to inflict upon the residents living near the Holsworthy base fear, panic and despair as a result of their decision to include Holsworthy as a potential site for Sydney's second airport. As I have said on previous occasions&mdash;and I will go on saying because this is an issue that is going to become bigger and bigger as the residents to be affected come to understand what is in store for them&mdash;it was this government that, prior to the election, failed to outline to the people their plan to make Holsworthy Sydney's second airport. After the election, with the announcement, hundreds of thousands of residents who thought they were living safe in the knowledge that the site had been rejected as long as 12 years ago were suddenly faced with the prospect of a 24&hyphen;hour, full domestic and international airport being built in their backyard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that has made a lot of noise about its promises and how they would keep them. We have seen their track record so far. When the government announced that it would include Holsworthy as a potential site, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, waxed lyrical about how the process of the EIS would be inclusive and would enable full community consultation and input to the decision. On 28 May, in the other place, the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, asked the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the government guarantee the people of Hughes that the environmental impact assessment conducted into the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy sites will be fully comprehensive on both sites?</PARA>
<PARA>In his answer the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study will follow the guidelines established by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, which involves full public consultation, full industry consultation and its being a transparent process. The honourable member for Hughes is concerned to ensure that residents of her electorate will have their views considered in this process. I assure the honourable member for Hughes that that will be the case: their views will be considered and given great <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weight in the process of determining the environmental impact study.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise was that an independent auditor would be appointed to oversee the EIS process, but no such independent auditor has yet been appointed, notwithstanding that the draft EIS guidelines have been prepared and released and the period for public comment has now closed. So a fundamental promise of this government regarding the EIS process has simply been discarded. The people have been treated with contempt because that committee found that, to protect the community's interests, it was vitally important that an independent auditor be appointed to run parallel with the EIS process being conducted by the proponent and the consultants involved. Again, on 27 June, the member for Hughes, Mrs Danna Vale, asked the minister this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the minister assure the House that the constituents of Hughes will be given the opportunity of making submissions on the draft guidelines so as to ensure that all relevant matters are canvassed by the environmental impact statement itself?</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that Mrs Vale is the Liberal member for Hughes. The response from the minister was&mdash;and I quote in part from his answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Submissions will be invited from interested persons in the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the last aspect of the question of the honourable member for Hughes&mdash;that is, whether members of her electorate will be able to make comments and submissions in regard to the EIS process&mdash;the answer is yes. They will be welcomed, we will expect them and we will treat them with due regard and great importance.</PARA>
<PARA>This was from the minister, after having broken a fundamental commitment to follow the guidelines laid down by the Senate select committee by not appointing, as that committee recommended, an independent auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3466"> What has been the reaction since the minister's comments on 27 June welcoming the involvement of the community? Over 52,000 submissions were made to the Environment Protection Agency by residents in and around the Holsworthy site&mdash;an incredible response, indicating the outrage and the concern of those people. What was the re sponse by the Minister for the Environment and Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill? His response to the agency under his administration having received 52,000 submissions was contained in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 3 September, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environment Minister Robert Hill questioned the intentions of the alliance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the community alliance representing the residents in the area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in sending a deluge of submissions on the environmental impact statement guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It appeared to be an attempt to clog up the system," Senator Hill's spokesman said.</PARA>
<PARA>What a disgraceful, despicable remark from a spokesman for the minister. At no stage has the minister disowned that statement. The attitude of this government, after welcoming and calling for comments and submissions and promising the community that they would have the opportunity to be fully involved, to have their submissions treated with great respect, has been to say, `All you're trying to do is clog up the system because you happen to put in excess of 50,000 submissions to the Environment Protection Agency.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That sort of contemptible attitude has been further demonstrated this week when, despite numerous attempts by representatives of the South&hyphen;West Sydney Community Alliance, the group formed to fight this airport proposal in south&hyphen;west Sydney, to meet with the minister, Mr Sharp, he has declined to do so. They have been to his office in Goulburn, they have been down here this week, but he will not meet with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government and a minister who say, `We welcome the community being involved.' This is a government that attacked the former Labor government over the EIS process for the third runway at Mascot. This government said they would be judged by how they opened themselves up to community involvement and community input. They have been found sadly wanting. In fact, more than that, their attitude is clearly one where they have no regard at all for the interests of the residents of south&hyphen;west Sydney. They have no regard at all for the interests of the residents, the electors, of the seat of Hughes. Not only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> did they inflict this decision upon them after the election&mdash;a clear breach of a commitment given at the election&mdash;but when the people put in their submissions in accordance with the procedures laid down, they were abused and criticised, and there were allegations that their submissions were nothing more than an attempt to clog up the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue is not going to go away. A lot of questions still need to be answered by the government. I am going to continue to stand up in this place on behalf of the residents of south&hyphen;west Sydney because, unfortunately, the member for Hughes elected at the recent election is really doing nothing at all for the residents of her electorate. Those of us on this side are going to stand up for those residents and their legitimate concerns.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be fairly brief tonight. I want to finish a contribution I was making in this place yesterday on the matter of telephone towers, which is of enormous concern in the community in which I live, which is the City of Wanneroo. Before people think I am going to talk about Wanneroo and start to panic, I say to them that I am actually confining my remarks tonight to telephone towers within the boundaries of the municipality of the City of Wanneroo. As I said, it is not only of concern within Wanneroo; it is of concern right throughout Australia, certainly in the built&hyphen;up areas of Australia at this stage. But it is of particular concern where I live and where some local action has been taken on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of a national perspective, I note that the National President of the Local Government Association, who is also the Mayor of Concord in Sydney, is also concerned about the matter. He tipped somewhat of a bucket on Austel, the regulatory authority. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Austel is just a pathetic organisation which is not performing its function. They are useless,". . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That shows you why the people are so concerned about this matter. At a state local government level, there is huge concern within the WA municipal authority and its <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3467"> membership. They have expressed the community's fears about health, aesthetics and property values as the national program of installing telecommunications towers and infrastructure facilities proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a more local level, one of my local councillors in Wanneroo, Graeme Major, said in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 5 August that the Wanneroo City Council was considering the approval for the erection of 14 telecommunications towers within the boundaries of the municipality. Councillor Major said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . people were worried by the proximity of towers to residential areas and the lack of research into their long-term effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is a lack of evidence on the effects of microwave radiation and the carriers have not communicated to communities very well . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By 2006 there is expected to be one tower for every street.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not something that we should be looking forward to. We are taking action about this on a local level directly into this parliament. The local Labor Party candidate for the seat of Joondalup, Dianne Guise, who is also President of the WA Council of State Schools Organisations, has produced a petition which calls on the Senate to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> immediately commence a moratorium on the erection of mobile phone towers;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> institute, as a matter of urgency, a Senate inquiry into health and environmental risks that may be associated with mobile phone towers;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> enact, in liaison with State and Territory Governments, appropriate legislation that shall prevent the erection of any future mobile phone towers in the immediate vicinity of any school, kindergarten, child care centre, recreation centre or playground.</PARA>
<PARA>Some of those petitions have already been lodged in the Senate by me, and I personally agree with the sentiments as contained in the petitions. I note also for the record that the local members of parliament, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and the member for Moore (Mr Filing), have also taken action in the other place in regard to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I commend the work of Ms Guise in enacting, on behalf of the local community, these petitions. Hopefully, the matter will be lis tened to by the regulatory authorities and by the relevant minister, who can in fact do something about it. Hopefully, Austel, who is subject to some degree of criticism, which I have repeated here tonight in this place, will listen again to the criticism. If it does not, there will be further pressure from within this chamber and, I have no doubt, from within the other chamber to get action in regard to the safety of the residents in municipalities right around Australia to prevent the damage that is being done to people by the erection of these facilities.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not initially planning to speak on the adjournment debate this evening, but I was drawn to it because of some inaccuracies put forward by Senator Tierney in relation to what has become known as Planet Earth 2000&mdash;originally, the international garden festival&mdash;which is proposed for Mount Penang just outside Gosford. I did not catch all of what Senator Tierney said, but certainly he was attempting to suggest, firstly, that the previous federal Labor government had not been fully supportive of that garden festival and, secondly, that in fact this coalition federal government has made some sort of commitment to it, which in fact it has not at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to give you a brief history of the situation, in 1994 Barry Cohen, the ex-member for Robertson and former Labor member, in conjunction with the Nursery Association of New South Wales and the Nursery Association of Australia, began to promote a garden festival for the central coast area. Some examination was done of various sites available and it was decided that it should be a site located at Mount Penang, which is presently owned by the state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Barry Cohen, in conjunction with the nursery association, put forward an application that theirs should be the preferable site. They narrowly succeeded despite a very clever bid put in by Wollongong. The idea was promoted in the next year or so and a large amount of community support was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3468"> gathered and a proposition was put to Michael Lee, the then minister for tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said that in some way Michael Lee's support was lacking or that he was not as supportive as he could have been. I say that in fact the position was quite contrary to that. He expressed very strong in principle support. He supported the application of the nursery association to the Bureau of International Expositions to hold the garden festival in Australia at Mount Penang. He, along with cabinet, approved a payment by the federal government&mdash;a deposit for that application. He then went on to ask proponents of the garden festival to inquire into and advise him how that proposition could be furthered and how they proposed to bring it about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, there was some lack of direction in what took place. Maybe things did not progress on the part of that community group as quickly as it could have. At that stage, in 1995, I became involved and decided that a little bit more direction would be helpful. So we formed a committee for the garden festival. The committee was comprised of Tony Sansom, the Labor mayor of Gosford; Grant McBride, the state member for the Entrance; Les Eastcott, the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the university at Ourimbah; representatives from the nursery association; and Barry Cohen, who, as I said, has had a very long and abiding interest in and enthusiasm for this project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was a great success. The local government body, Gosford council, donated sufficient moneys for consultants to be employed to prepare quite a substantial report of some several hundred pages. This was presented in turn to the Premier of New South Wales, head of the Labor government, who greeted it with some enthusiasm. In August last year, he suggested that he would support the project. There has been further discussion and investigation since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In August of this year the Premier made a formal announcement that they would financially support the project. He has indicated that they will hand over the land at Mount Penang, valued at approximately $20 million, for the purposes of conducting the garden festival and also, if necessary, will seed it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> completely in order that it can be used as security to raise the necessary funds. At the same time, he has also provided a grant of $300,000 towards setting up the office, and appointed a CEO, Keith Dedden&mdash;a person of some repute in the area; he is presently employed by Landcom and was formerly the general manager of the Gosford City Council&mdash;to ensure that this project comes about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In spite of all that has happened and the letter that the Premier has sent to John Howard, nothing has occurred by way of real support by this federal coalition government. A letter was sent by Bob Carr to John Howard indicating what contribution he was making to the festival and asking the federal government to make a formal commitment. The letter was sent with sufficient time to allow provision to be made in the budget but, disappointingly for those supporters of the festival and for the community on the central coast, he  failed to make any provision. In fact, it is only just recently&mdash;last week&mdash;that he has responded at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have received from John Howard and his coalition government, despite two years of coalition members saying that they are supporting the project, is a very carefully worded and negative letter which spends three or four paragraphs pointing out all the negatives of conducting an international garden festival. It eventually says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taking all these factors into account, the Commonwealth would be prepared to consider limited financial assistance to facilitate further development of the IDF concept, including examination of the scope for private sector investment to underpin the viability of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, `We'll think about it.' After two years of saying, `If we were in government, we would be right behind it', all we get is them saying that they will consider it. This is after the state government has spent in excess of $1 million investigating reports and has now committed $20 million in land plus a further $300,000 in funds for the organising committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real situation is that unless the federal government and the Prime Minister, John Howard, make a real commitment&mdash;not just consider making a commitment&mdash;this garden festival will not go ahead. The consequences <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3469"> of this garden festival not going ahead are dire for those people on the central coast. This project is a major employment creating project for the central coast for the next three years. The garden festival and exposition, as it will now be, will be held at the same time as the Olympics. We would hope that those international visitors who are attending the Olympics will also attend the garden festival, as well as the large number of people who are solely interested in the garden festival itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the Senate that the possible failure of this garden festival is entirely on the head of this federal coalition government. I ask the Prime Minister to consider well his actions and to change his mind and actually make a real financial commitment.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One could only have drawn a conclusion from Mrs Bowden's reply that in fact NO conference, state or federal, had been consulted (as she originally claimed was the case on this Bill).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any Senator can only go on what a witness says. In this case, Mrs Bowden inferred on thing but when asked specifics, said another. I can hardly be blamed for that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I wanted to put on the record the fact that my questions to Mrs Bowden were very simple questions based on her assertion that their league had surveyed their membership. One of my questions was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could I just clarify whether you have run any survey of your membership on this bill as opposed to general policy. You say that you have had a policy position on privatisation for a considerable length of time. I am respectfully asking you now: have you surveyed your membership on this bill and its ramifications? <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly what I would consider badgering a witness. My next question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which conference has decided your position on this bill? From where was that representation drawn?</PARA>
<PARA>They are hardly questions that are badgering a witness. Mrs Bowden refused to answer my question. Therefore, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The answer to my question is no, you have not consulted your membership; is that right?</PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly a question that could be considered badgering a witness. Therefore, I decided not to ask her any more questions because Mrs Bowden refused to answer the question. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have not done it, therefore we will move on.</PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly a position that is badgering the witness. Most people would be complimented on the appearance that they had served things competently.

<ANSWER PAGE="3473" SPEAKER="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEID="BE4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Social Security" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) United States (US)  Navy ships will be conducting port visits to Australian cities both before and after Exercise Tandem Thrust. US forces coordinate their visiting activities with appropriate Australian authorities. Working with representatives from the US Embassy or Consulate, US forces and Australian officials (Commonwealth and State) will address such issues as shore patrol, police liaison, professional exchanges, social and athletic activities. Of the approximately 17 000 US personnel participating in the exercise, only 4&hyphen;5 000 personnel will come ashore. The majority will be in Shoalwater Bay Training Area, but some US personnel will be involved in supporting the exercise at other locations such as airfields. Once ashore, because of safety and environmental considerations, their activities will be carefully managed. No rest and recreation (R and R) leave will be granted in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian and US military personnel have conducted discussions to plan the R and R of service personnel involved in Tandem Thrust. The Australian Defence Force (ADF), cognisant of the number of personnel attending, has provided the US with advice on the preferred way to minimise social impact. Ship visits to a number of ports for R and R, staggered over the course of the pre and post exercise periods, have been recommended and adopted by the US in their planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Eleven ships are currently planned to participate in the exercise. US ships deployed away from their homeport are typically divided into three duty sections. At any given time in port, up to two&hyphen;thirds of a ship's crew could be permitted liberty. The largest concentration of libertymen will be associated with the aircraft carrier USS Independence, which may have a daily liberty party of up to 2 000 members. Less than 500 US Air Force personnel will participate in Tandem Thrust. Since US Air Force personnel will be scheduled on official airlift in and out of the exercise locations, few will take leave in conjunction with their temporary duty assignments in Australia. US Army personnel will also be ashore in various locations, but in much smaller numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only two major Australian ships will be conducting post exercise visits, with one ship visiting Townsville, the other Mackay. The remainder of the ships will return to their home port, Sydney, on completion of the exercise. The majority of Aust&hyphen; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ralian Army and Air Force personnel will redeploy direct to their home locations at the conclusion of the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Leave duration will depend upon the number of days a ship is visiting a specific port. Usually, leave expires on board a ship on the morning of the day after it is granted. The longest period that Australian ships will be in port will be four days. As the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ships carry 430 personnel in total, and the visits are not concurrent with visiting US ships, RAN leave is not expected to have a noticeable social impact in either Townsville or Mackay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The schedule for US ship visits is still being developed, but Cairns and Brisbane are two Queensland cities being considered. The Australian ship visit program is also still being developed, however, the Australian ships will visit either Townsville or Mackay, after the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Sydney and Melbourne are likely destinations for US visits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) No social impact assessment has been undertaken, as the degree of potential impact has been significantly reduced by early planning with US authorities. Measures taken to reduce impact have been to utilise a number of alternative locations for port visits and to limit the number of ships visiting at any one time. The largest port visit will be conducted by up to four US ships to Sydney, a city well used to, and capable of, hosting such visits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) US military personnel have enjoyed a long and successful history of visiting Australia for both work and pleasure. There are no records from the Vietnam war period the US would refer to in planning ship visits. ADF planning staff do not have ready access to leave plans from the period of the Vietnam war. The majority of these files/records have either been archived or destroyed. Furthermore, noting the significant social changes which have occurred in the intervening years, it is considered that these records would not provide useful planning data for 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) State and local governments have not been officially informed by the ADF of plans for US personnel to visit during the exercise, as the planning is still formative. Staff discussions have commenced with a number of government organisations, including The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Townsville and Gladstone Port</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(19) All members of visiting forces, including US forces, are subject to Australian law while they are in Australia. Specifically, the SOFA contains detailed provision for the exercise of jurisdiction by both Australian and US authorities over criminal offences committed in Australia by US military personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(20) The SOFA has proved to be effective in ensuring that visiting US personnel are subject to a clear legal framework and are appropriately dealt with for any offences which they may commit. The SOFA also addresses claims procedures for individuals who sustain damage as a result of activities by US forces in the performance of official duty or arising from circumstances for which US forces are otherwise responsible.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
