<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Has the minister received a high level tutorial from her department on today's ANZ figures for job ads? Does the minister acknowledge that job ads are now at their lowest level since January 1994, that job ads have now fallen for four consecutive months and this is the first such sequence since the four months ended December 1991? Given the government's back&hyphen;pedalling on the purported employment benefits of the workplace relations bill, how is the government going to reverse this disastrous trend? Where are the jobs going to come from and when will they materialise?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4973" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senator for his question. His reference to a high class tutorial comes from my using that remark in a Senate estimates committee on Friday. Simply to make the point: every month when the labour force statistics come out some of the most talented people, the people most equipped to discuss unemployment trends and statistics, come up to the office with an embargoed copy of those statistics and we discuss the pros and cons of what is happening in the labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has that happened today with respect to the release of some ANZ material? No, so I cannot give you any further information on that matter. But, more importantly, Senator Bishop, you go to one of the most important questions facing this country; that is, where are the jobs going to come from and how are we going to generate them? There are two things to tell you with respect to that. First, they are certainly not going to come through a continuation of the make work schemes that the previous government&mdash;of which I accept you were not a member&mdash;wasted so much money on. That government spent something <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like $700 million or $800 million in the last financial year on the three least effective brokered programs, programs with effectiveness outcome levels varying between the low 20s and low 30s. If you average that out at a 30 per cent effectiveness rate, you chucked 70 per cent of that $700 million to $800 million down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the first thing we are going to do is we are going to put the money that we have available for labour market programs and training into a new scheme, taking the best of Working Nation&mdash;the bit we think did work, the one on one case management&mdash;and building on it very substantially; and discarding the worst of Working Nation. So we will spend the labour market program money that we have far more effectively than your colleagues' previous government did, with a view to making sure, as best as possible, that when people get the benefit of labour market assistance they end up in a real job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the question of the creation of real jobs, as you probably realise, Senator&mdash;although I know some of your colleagues do not&mdash;is an across government concern. In fact, it is an across the nation concern. You asked me how we are going to generate the real jobs into which people will go. Even given that we are revamping and improving the efficiency of the labour market programs, the jobs have to be there to put them into. I see you nodding and you understand that&mdash;I know that some of your colleagues do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you, Senator Bishop, that you say that we have walked away from the contribution that we believe a more flexible market will make, but nobody says it is not going to make any contribution and we think it will make a contribution at least. I do not think even you deny that. More importantly, one of the best things we can do to create real jobs is get the budget back into black, clean up Beazley's bankcard, the $8 billion deficit that you left us with, and give confidence to the business community to generate real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the business community and the financial markets can see that this government is prepared to make the hard decisions to clean up the mess that you made, we have a really good chance of doing things like keeping <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest rates down, building business confidence and generating real jobs. That is the first thing we want to do: get the budget back into black. You have an opportunity, Senator Bishop, in your caucus to convince your colleagues that they should do exactly as the Prime Minister says; and, that is, after the by&hyphen;election, get out of the way and let us do the job. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bishop, it might be of some surprise to you to understand that this government, unlike the previous government, works as a team. I have tried to explain it to you and I will take the opportunity to do it again. I speak to my department regularly, at least every month, in a fairly detailed way on unemployment issues and trends. That is what I just told you in the first answer. I do not need to ring up and say, `Please, could I have it in writing?' I speak to these people regularly and focus quite specifically on these issues when the labour force survey is released every month. I do not think you can necessarily put any great spin on that, which you are trying to do&mdash;I think it absolutely falls on deaf ears. This is unlike the previous government where then Minister Faulkner could not work with then Minister Beddall to such a degree that the cabinet was torn to shreds and someone else had to be given the job. Treasury looks after forecasts for this government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK></QWN>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. I refer to yesterday's release of the Commonwealth Bank HIA affordability index for the September quarter which indicated that buying the family home is at its most affordable level for two years, and notably in Victoria, since the index's inception in 1984. Could the minister please confirm whether this is in fact the case, and whether similar affordability figures to that in Victoria were recorded in other states? Could the minister also outline the factors which have lead to this good news for home buyers?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4974" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferguson for that important question which is of considerable interest to all first home buyers. You will be aware, Madam President, that home affordability figures released yesterday by the HIA were indeed welcome news for home buyers and families, especially first home buyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the HIA housing report, in the September quarter of 1996 housing became nearly 10 per cent more affordable for the average Australian first home buyer. The loan repayment needed on a typical first home mortgage fell from 20.7 per cent of household income in the June quarter of 1996 to 18.9 per cent in the September quarter. This has contributed to the figures which show that housing is now more affordable than at any time since mid&hyphen;1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For Victoria, as Senator Ferguson said, the index shows that housing is indeed now more affordable than at any time since the index was first introduced in 1984. Lower interest rates and higher family incomes helped increase housing affordability by 10 per cent in Melbourne and by 13.5 per cent in the rest of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia and in the ACT record affordability was also achieved. Affordability for Brisbane is the best it has been for a long <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time and housing in New South Wales is now more affordable than at any time in the last two years. A major contributing factor to these figures is the lowering of interest rates which has occurred since the March election and the coalition's victory.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this government came to office, Senator Sherry, you might be interested to record, the standard variable home mortgage rate charged by the big banks was 10.5 per cent. This has now fallen to 9.25 per cent, a fall of 1&frac14; percentage points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now seeing, partly as a result of competition and partly because of the economic strategy developed by the government and particularly as outlined in the budget, some major lenders offering the lowest home mortgage rates since the mid&hyphen;1970s. These reductions, which occurred after the September quarter, should help to make housing even more affordable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the comments coming from the other side, we may reflect on how this compares with Labor's woeful record. The current mortgage rate charged by the big four banks is 9.25 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under Labor, Senator Collins, seeing you are calling out, the average was 12.75 per cent, more than one&hyphen;third higher than at present. Under Labor, home mortgage rates peaked at a whopping 17 per cent. As I said last week, over the last two and a half years under Labor, the only way that mortgage rates went was up and up. This is not surprising because over this time official interest rates went up as well. In fact, official interest rates went up to 7.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is the high interest rate party. It is a high interest rate party because you like big deficits, you like building up debt&mdash;and that amounts to a lot of pressure on interest rates. We are the low interest rate side of politics. We take the pressure off interest rates by tackling the deficit that we inherited. We want to give families and small business a long awaited break for the better.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Is it a fact that the government is proposing to cut up to $177 million in tied funding for government schools over the next four years based on the claimed savings to state and territory governments when a child moves from the government to the non&hyphen;government sector? Will this not inevitably lead to a deterioration in the quality of the public education system?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4975" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer is that it will not but let me expand on that answer for you. You will be aware of the new schools policy instituted by the previous Labor government&mdash;your party. You might not agree, as I would put to you, that it was unfair and discriminatory. That policy restricted the ability of parents to choose non&hyphen;government education, and it discriminated against parents whose children were in schools that had their funding limited regardless of the needs of that school. We thought that was an unfair policy and that was why we said we would get rid of it and why we will get rid of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy did not succeed, however, in preventing parent choice because the proportion of students in non&hyphen;government schools nonetheless increased from 26.4 per cent in 1986 to 29 per cent in 1995.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, for your benefit, in case you could not hear over the people in front of you yelling, the proportion of students in non&hyphen;government schools increased from 26.4 per cent in 1986 to 29 per cent in 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policy of the government&mdash;and I answered a question on this the other day&mdash;is to allow parents to choose the appropriate school for their child. We think that is the appropriate way to go&mdash;whether that school is a government or a non&hyphen;government school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In view of the Commonwealth's national leadership role in school education, the government has rejected the recommendations of the Commission of Audit that schools funding be handed back to the states and territories&mdash;and I think they recommended at the same time that it be reduced by 10 per cent. The government is instead working with the states and territories to improve the quality of education provided to all students and to allow parents choice in education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not favour one sector over the other. Commonwealth funding will follow the student, as I explained in the Senate last week. The budget provided for the enrolment benchmark adjustment that would reduce the incentive of the states and territories to shift students to non&hyphen;government schools. It is a perfectly simple matter for people to try to get across&mdash;perhaps it is not as simple as one might imagine in the beginning but it is, in the end, pretty simple: what the states are trying to do is shift the share of students over to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are they trying to do that? They are trying to do that because the Commonwealth funds to a larger extent the students in non&hyphen;government schools, and that is why the states are interested in shifting the share of students over that way. That is absolutely why they are interested in doing that, and that is why we are keen to put a stop to that. It is estimated that since 1983 the shift of students to non-government schools has saved the states and territories more than $3 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an important commitment to government schools and we believe that, if you take into account the specific purpose payments and the FAGS, students in  government schools will actually get a per capita increase. They are calculations done on estimations, I accept that, but that is what we believe will happen. Australia's 10,000 schools will receive an estimated increase in funding of $1.5 billion over the next four <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4976"> years. We are determined to see that the states accept their responsibility and to remove an incentive for them to off&hyphen;load students out of their schools into non&hyphen;government schools for the simple reason that the Commonwealth will then foot the bill. We think that is inappropriate.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for his question. This is an important matter and good news for small business after the long drought of Labor. Last Friday the Small Business Deregulation Task Force did present its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for business</EMPHASIS>  to the Prime Minister in Sydney. That task force, senators will remember, was established on 2 May, which delivered on a commitment made by the government in its policy, a new deal for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is the result of six months of intensive research and consultation, including talks with 250 small business operators, industry associations and government officials, as well as receiving the analysis of some 366 submissions. The release of the report demonstrates the depth of the government's commitment to Australian small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report contains 62 recommendations addressing a wide range of small business concerns and makes some practical recommendations to reduce paperwork and the compliance burden, which will allow small business to get on and grow and to employ. Issues identified in the report include taxation, employment regulations, statistics, housing, chemicals, food, environment, provision of information, reducing government focus, government purchasing, monitoring and reporting arrangements as well as others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be considering the task force recommendations carefully over the next few months. The Prime Minister indicated on Friday that the government will outline a comprehensive response to the report by no later than the middle of February. He is also announcing today some immediate measures to assist small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pleasing to see the reaction to the report by business groups and commentators. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4977"> I remind you of that by the comments of the Housing Industry Association Ltd, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Small Business Taskforce is to be applauded on its Report to the Commonwealth Government. The Taskforce consulted widely and as a result, the report captures the real regulatory concerns facing small business in their day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day operation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report by the Small Business Deregulation Taskforce is a victory for common sense and will provide real gains for small business if the recommendations are adopted . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACCI strongly supports the thrust of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force's recommendations for action to reduce the burden of compliance on small business . . .

<PARA>This is an example of government working for the benefit of small business&mdash;small business which is so critical to the economic and employment future of Australia.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator, for that question. I do not know whether you were paying attention on the last sitting day when I took the opportunity during the adjournment debate to indicate that I had looked at the table from which the department drew the figures that were used in the budget statement. I agreed that that was not the best basis on which to make international comparisons. I made that perfectly clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you perhaps get wrong, if I may suggest it, by the inference in your question, is that these figures were used in some way to justify the proposed changes to HECS in Australia, as if somehow the ERC and cabinet sat around and said, `What does everyone else do? Hell, let's go along that line.' If that is the suggestion you are putting, it is an incorrect suggestion. Those figures were used merely to fill in the picture and give an indication of what charges were elsewhere. So <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4978"> the figures were not used as a basis for the decisions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you what was the basis for the decision to increase the HECS contribution, and I have probably got enough time to outline why we thought we would shift to a differentiated HECS as well, why we think that is fairer and more equitable. The first thing to consider is: why have an increase in the HECS contribution in any event? Students get an enormous private benefit from graduating from university. You know that, I know that and all of your party knows that. That is why your party introduced the higher education contribution scheme. It is a recognition that universities have a private benefit and a public benefit. The HECS charge is meant to be an acknowledgment of the private benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the private benefit is not adequately recognised in the HECS contribution paid thus far. Senator, you might like to look at the World Bank report which was very kindly drawn to my attention by Senator Stott&hyphen;Despoja, which points out that, with the quantity of people going to university from higher socioeconomic groups, the subsidy of tuition fees by the Commonwealth is redistributing funds to the wealthier in the community. You might like to take that into account as well, although that was not in my mind or drawn to my attention when we were making the decision to increase the contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does bear repeating and understanding that roughly 15 per cent of Australians in the work force have been to university; 25 per cent of school leavers now go to university. When I attended a speech day for one of Adelaide's best private schools on Saturday, I was told that the percentage from that school who go to university is 85 per cent. That was the percentage from a wealthier private school. So if you want to maintain a situation where we should continue to subsidise the tuition fees of children of wealthy people and you do not think we should ask for a greater contribution from those students, then you run out and argue that case. But I am going to run out and argue the other case&mdash;that these people get an enormous private benefit. They are very substantially <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> subsidised by the taxpayer and it is fair to ask for a higher contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the differentiated HECS, we have picked up the recommendations of former Labor premier Neville Wran, who recognised that it is completely unfair and inequitable to charge the same per annum contribution of a teacher with a low cost course at a lower income later in life, as it is to ask of a doctor with a high cost course and a higher income later in life. Senator, if you want to tell teachers they should pay the same as doctors, you go to it. But you won't find me with you. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Schools. Does the Minister for Schools stand by his repeated assertions that 30 per cent of Australian 14-year-olds lack basic literacy skills? I refer the minister to the report by Mr Brian Toohey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>  newspaper at the weekend and on the ABC Radio National program this morning that Mr Martin Flanagan, author of one of the passages used in the comprehension test from which the minister draws his data, failed 40 per cent of the questions asked in the test about his own piece of writing. Will the minister explain why such a test of comprehension was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4979"> so inappropriately used to draw conclusions on literacy? In the light of the latest in a long line of criticisms, will the minister now withdraw his remarks and stop his baseless scare campaign about literacy standards in Australian schools?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had the remarks of Mr Toohey drawn to my attention, although I have not yet had the opportunity to read them completely. When it comes to expertise on educational testing, you, Senator, may choose to go with Mr Toohey and ignore the judgment of the Australian Council for Educational Research. That will be a decision for you. Nonetheless, the Australian Council for Educational Research stands by the validity of its test results. If Mr Toohey had bothered to read the notes on the literacy tests handed out with the minister's press statement, he would understand our test of basic reading comprehension. They do not pretend to be tests of functional literacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible to compare student performance over time because of the presence of common items. You can give any school a base test to any adult, and they will probably get some of the items wrong. This does not invalidate the test. The basic point&mdash;which all Mr Toohey's commentary nonetheless does not obscure&mdash;is that since 1975 there has been no basic improvement in basic reading comprehension skills for a significant number of year 9 students and the performance of boys has worsened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Literacy is too important an issue to be the subject of this sort of political carping, and the schools and the community know it. The government's legislation for the years 1997 to 2000 includes an additional $45 million to help schools with the basic literacy and numeracy needs of students. I presume that is something that you endorse.</PARA></ANSWER>

Your spokesperson was quoted in the press last Friday as saying that Austudy was intended `to help the needy and not the greedy' in response to inquiries about cuts in Austudy. Those cuts, your department has confirmed, will mean that 125,000 students across Australia will lose all or part of their Austudy. Does that mean that those 125,000 young Australians are not `needy' and just `greedy'?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The levels at which people can gain Austudy I do not assume you had planned on changing. I do not assume for one minute that you had planned on increasing the amount that you can earn or have as assets and still get Austudy. In other words, I do not think there is much disagreement amongst either of the major parties and perhaps even the Democrats&mdash;although I am not so sure in that respect&mdash;about the level at which one ought to be able to gain access to Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your government, the former government, introduced a means test designed to get at those people who can so structure their affairs as to have a very small taxable income and to hide assets. We support you on that. We think you did the right thing to get at those sorts of people. We are changing the means test in the sense of changing the way we ascertain the means of a person, but not essentially the levels. So, frankly, I do not think there is an argument here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government has set a level at which a benefit can be gained&mdash;whether it is Austudy or any other benefit&mdash;and someone by, unfortunately, legal means nonetheless seeks a way to get around that and get the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4980"> benefits even though in reality they have more, then I think they are greedy. The Commonwealth sets the limits at which benefits can be accessed and people should not try to go around that and get those benefits even if they have income and assets over and above those levels. People who try to do that are greedy. I think that is why you introduced the means test.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read the article and it seems to be somewhat a figment of somebody's imagination from information I am not quite sure from what source. The situation is that some weeks ago Mr Laurie Ferguson wrote to the Presiding Officers asking for permission, asking for an opportunity, to display some photographs of World War II in relation to that area. That has been agreed to. The time for the exhibition has not yet been agreed. Initially, they wanted it, I think, on 11 November. That was not possible within the structure of exhibitions because there are exhibitions booked in the Presiding Officers' area up until some time in 1998.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Subsequently, I had a telephone call from Senator Reynolds, I think more than two weeks ago now, when she raised the same issue you are now raising of photographs of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Dili&mdash;as to whether or not they had been excluded from the exhibition. I told her that there had been no exclusion, that the letter from Mr Ferguson had asked for an exhibition of photographs of World War II. That was approved by the acting Presiding Officers when the Speaker and I were both away.

Mr Moore did not say, as you asserted he had in your answer, that the company is no longer trading.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is also to Senator Hill, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to recent comments by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4984"> the Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer, that Australia would encourage an improved human rights situation in Burma. I ask: if this is the case, why has Australia already ruled out support for any co&hyphen;ordinated economic sanctions against Burma, even though those sanctions have been requested by the Burmese democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and what steps does the government intend to take to help improve the execrable and deteriorating human rights situation in Burma at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4984" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The continuing trend in Burma is disturbing and, although I notice that NLD deputy, Kyi Maung, has been released, there are still many hundreds of others who are held in political detention in Burma. The laws that have been passed barring Aung San Suu Kyi from holding public meetings are an equally disturbing trend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue for countries such as ours&mdash;which obviously wants to encourage democracy and better human rights in Burma&mdash;is to determine, as you say, what policies might be adopted that could effectively bring that about. This is an issue with which we have been wrestling for a long period of time, and so has the developed world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The honourable senator will recall that the United States, some years ago, unilaterally introduced certain trade sanctions&mdash;as I recall, in relation to textiles. But, because they were unilateral, even though the United States is the most powerful nation on earth, they were ineffective. We have not seen any evidence that there is any suggestion of a broad&hyphen;based economic sanction that would have any effect at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, unfortunately, much of the unsatisfactory human rights record of the Burmese regime has been built up through the isolation of Burma. There is an argument that, by isolating Burma, all you will do is strengthen the hand of the SLORC. So each of these initiatives has to be examined carefully as to whether they might bring about an effective result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think that there is any suggestion that our Asian neighbours, particularly in ASEAN, are prepared to go down this path. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I notice that there was a non&hyphen;binding resolution of the European Parliament but I do not know of any suggestion that the European governments will join with it. I certainly do not think you will get a mandatory resolution out of the General Assembly.

But beyond the diplomatic pressures, unfortunately, at the moment, we do not have the magic answer.</PARA></ANSWER>

But I ask the minister to go to the foreign minister and bring back to the Senate whether the following two responses are being considered by Australia. The first is to close the Austrade office in Rangoon. Considering how many officers of Austrade are being retrenched, I think that closing the Austrade office in Rangoon would be a very good move. The second is agreeing to restrict the provision of visas for family members of the SLORC, which, I understand, is also being considered by other countries.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Social Security.

What implications does this have for the reform of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Tierney for his question because it is an important issue for all Australians. Senator Kemp has already at question time today made clear the government's satisfaction at the improvement in housing affordability, because it is a vindication of our budget strategy and the need for a competitive banking sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Housing affordability is now at a two-year high. In some cities the index is the highest that it has ever been and, of course, that is welcome news for home buyers. But home buyers are not the only beneficiaries, Senator Tierney; low income renters are also going to be beneficiaries of it. Of the 1.2 million low income renters in Australia, over 900,000 are in the private sector. For them, the level of housing affordability is going to have a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bearing both on their rent and on the availability of housing for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns which are motivating reform of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is that we need to involve the private sector more in the provision of low cost housing. The public sector is just not doing its job. For example, in 1988-89 the various state housing authorities built 14,000 new homes but by 1995 that number was down to 5,000, despite the fact that funding levels had not changed. If nothing changes in coming years, no new homes will be built and the Commonwealth's funding will just be chewed up in maintenance and administration, as has increasingly been happening over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution is to involve the private sector more, both in the capital funding of public housing and in the provision in the private sector. Lower interest rates can help that process&mdash;something which the Housing Industry Association, I am glad to see, has also recognised. If we can get more landlords providing cheaper accommodation to low income renters and also providing greater rental assistance to low income people, we can alleviate one of the great causes of poverty in this country&mdash;excessive housing costs. To keep housing costs down and to encourage this process, it is vital that the government's budget comes through this chamber intact. Every extra cent taken from the public purse puts pressure on interest rates. It would be a terrible shame if this did not happen because cheaper housing for both home buyers and renters would go a long way to relieving poverty for the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the chattering classes on the opposite side of the chamber, it is clear that, despite their time in government, they have not recognised that the Social Security Department's research makes it very clear that the people who are receiving rent assistance through the Department of Social Security, who are on low incomes, are renting right across the geographical areas of Australian cities and towns, and right across the rental levels. In other words, people are sometimes sacrificing their standard of living in order to be able to afford a standard of housing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4986">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That has been the choice for a number of years of people renting in the private market, even though they are on low income. We say that that is right and proper, that they have that choice. But at the moment there is an inadequate rent assistance for those people. What we want to do is make sure that there are sufficient people investing in the private system and that there be quality accommodation for low income earners to rent.</PARA>

<PARA>This Senate has heard a number of boneheaded answers from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), but this would surely have to be one of the most boneheaded of all.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had a very simple case where the minister was called upon to read out the propaganda statements of her junior minister. She was confronted with the obvious contradictions of statements which are, of course, in contrast with the statements made by her own officials. At the estimates committee, in answer to questions from me, there was a situation whereby, instead of the $1.5 billion worth of extra funding that they are claiming, according to their own officials the figure is only $128 million over a four&hyphen;year period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was asked to explain this. She simply cannot, because what she has engaged in is a whole issue of myth making. It is not about fact; it is not about understanding. It is about myth making. It is about spreading propaganda porkies in such a way as to present to the public a position which is in quite sharp contrast to the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget estimates in particular seem to be most flexible. We have seen a situation where, within a two&hyphen;month period, this government has presented to the Senate a figure for the cost of its new schools policy, which has then changed, in terms of a submission presented to the Senate legislation committee last Friday&mdash;an increase of some $50 million dollars within a period of only two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite an extraordinary flexibility. Last Friday we saw this exercise in myth&hyphen;making taken a step further with Minister Kemp indicating that he was seeking to pre&hyphen;empt the states grants bill inquiry by the Senate legislation committee with a claim that this government was seeking to increase expenditure for school education by $1.5 billion. Nothing could be further from the truth in terms of the statements already given to this parliament through the budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reality of this story is simple: such an attempt to repackage this budget will, of course, fail because it is predicated on a total myth. That myth is very simply this: rather than increasing money for schools, particularly for public education, this budget is about reducing money for public education. What we see is that this figure of $177 million in tied grants has been taken from government schools while there is, in fact, an increase in the non&hyphen;government school sector of $150 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Now, of course, what these calculations are based upon is that undermining, false claim that somehow or other we can add together the monies provided by the commonwealth to the states for financial assistance grants&mdash;the FAGs. We can add together special purpose grants and then we can divide by the number of students in this country and then somehow you get an improved number for spending on schools overall. And, of course, the minister <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4987"> has failed to take away from his calculations the $1.5 billion that this Commonwealth government has already deducted from the states at the June premiers' conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is abundantly clear what these lies are. Instead, around 24 per cent of FAGs actually end up being spent on government schools, but only two per cent will be spent on non&hyphen;government schools. Now, of course, it is wrong to rely upon those states like Victoria, which has set out over the last four years to undermine the public education system. To rely upon those same states to replace the moneys that the Commonwealth is taking out of the education system, of course, is to fly in the face of all reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, Minister Vanstone has sought to repeat these myths in such a way as to try to give the impression that this government is actually spending money&mdash;which it is not. Under their new, proposed, deregulated schools policy, the enrolment adjustment benchmarking program that they have undertaken will see $177 million actually taken away from the public sector. And, of course, rather than working with the states as this minister states, governments&mdash;such as those of Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales&mdash;have all categorically condemned this government for its unilateral action in undermining public education and from taking money away from the states rather than adding money to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So we are talking about cost shifting, as this minister did today. What we see is a situation where the Commonwealth is seeking to shift costs to the states in such a manner as to fundamentally undermine the public education system. For the first time in the history of this country, the Commonwealth government is actually turning its back on its obligations to public education and the children of this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

It says it is committed to public schools; it says it is committed to continuing school funding but, as Senator Carr points out, indeed it has not done so.

<STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, David Kemp, announced an unbelievable proposition to Australia; that was, that this government had actually increased funding to the government school area. That reminded me of the events that occurred in the televised world series wrestling. In this case, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, was on the ropes and ready to go down for the third of the best of three falls. Minister Kemp has jumped into the ring to try to save her from that third fall. This is an unbelievable proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have just heard from Senator Carr, when the budget was announced cuts to the government school sector totalled $128 million; they are now almost $177 million. That is according to the most recent answers that we have been given by Minister Vanstone and her departmental staff in relation to the impact of the abolition of the new schools policy and the application of the enrolment benchmark measure to the funding of the schools sector in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There clearly is a case of cost shifting to the states in this area, and a big question mark hangs over what is going to happen to the funding of both the government and the non&hyphen;government school sectors arising from this policy. The minister and departmental staff have consistently said that what happens with the funding of schools in the states is going to be left to the states, that they are going to be freed up to make their decisions. When you look at the regulation of the non-government schools that applies in the various states, it is pretty clear that they have relied upon the Labor new schools policy as a de facto means of regulating the education sector. There is no doubt it is on the public <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4989"> record and that there are very few tests in relation to the viability of schools, to the establishment of schools which directly compete with other funded educational entities in the same sector, other than Labor's new schools policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor had announced and established a review of that policy to finetune it. This government is simply saying, `We will sweep all of this away and, as we do so, we are going to make some massive changes to the funding of the sector.' We have been told that we will now see at least $177 million go from the state sector. We have been told that the non&hyphen;government sector will get an additional $150 million from the enrolment benchmark measure. But if that figure is as rubbery as the figure that relates to the reduction in funding in the government sector, perhaps we can expect that there will be an even greater increase in funding to the non-government sector. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the private school areas are able to give us any real estimate of the effect of these measures in terms of the additional funds they will be receiving from the Commonwealth. Some would have us believe that there will be a small impact. Some would have us believe that there will be no impact at all, which makes a deception of the figures announced by this government. There are others who say that the impact of this measure will be to greatly increase the funding of the non-government sector and to reduce the funding of the government sector, perhaps to the effect of doubling the funding of the non-government sector and reducing the funding of the government sector by as much as 20 per cent over a five&hyphen; to 10&hyphen;year period. So we have had a variety of answers on this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answers that the minister has given today and earlier are demonstrative of the fact that even the minister does not know just how much of an impact these measures are going to have. Nor does her department and, from the evidence we have had, nor does the private school sector. It is a disgraceful policy approach by this government, an approach that can only destabilise the government education sector.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister ought to have a closer look at the figures and this government ought to reconsider its policies and decide to make some real impact on the government sector in this country, because we can see&mdash;and all my constituents are telling me&mdash;that it is about time some stability were introduced into the government sector, and this policy is not going to achieve that. It is going to destabilise it; it is going to destroy schools. It will see the educational opportunities for 70 per cent of Australians reduced on the basis of choice, a choice which is going to be exercised against the interests of the majority.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to rise and speak in this debate, but I cannot let the nonsense we have heard from the preceding three speakers just lie. What we are talking about here is the balance between the funding for private schools and state schools. The most sensible thing previous speakers mentioned was choice, and that is really what this is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do live in a liberal democracy. We do have choices in all areas of life. There is public and private provision in many areas of life. Listening to the evidence in the hearings we are having on the schools bill, one would think that there should not be any choice, that parents do not have a right to spend their own money on sending their children to private schools. It is as though we were back in the old Russia or the old eastern Europe. For some reason people think it is a terrible thing that parents are putting in money for their children's private school education and that the state should in some way support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of myths have flown around in this debate today and a lot flew around during the hearing. The biggest myth of all is that in some way it is the people in the public schools that are supporting those in the private schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put to the Senate that if we did have a totally public education system and no private education system, which some of these people opposite seem to want, we would have to find $1&half; billion extra to support the schooling system. Where would it come from? It would not come from the roads and the hospitals and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4990"> social welfare. It would come from the other schools. So the provision of education across the country would be at a lower level if that occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country, by rough measure, two&hyphen;thirds of the children go to public schools and one&hyphen;third go to private schools. There are natural barriers to increasing that number&mdash;something which people opposite do not seem to understand. Even though it has been stated in surveys that 95 per cent of parents would like to send their child to a private school, obviously they are not going to do it because of the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the figure for private schools is one&hyphen;third&mdash;not even up to one&hyphen;third. As a matter of fact, with the schools policy that we have now introduced, on estimates that figure is going to move up about 1&half; per cent over the next four years. A dramatic change is not going to occur in the balance between private and public schools, but this new policy will give parents who want to send their children to a private school the opportunity to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard in the debate today, and also in the hearings, that there is a cost shift between the two sectors. For some reason, the opposition feel that state schools are going to be disadvantaged and private schools advantaged. But what they use in terms of figures is just propaganda because, of the $3,400 involved, half of that money leaves with the pupil if he moves from a public to a private school, but half the money stays in the school, with no movement at all and without the child to support because he has moved off to the private sector. People get up here and say the state schools are being disadvantaged. In reality they are left with the money even though the pupil has left. What is the disadvantage in that? We have had quite a number of people outside the parliament spreading propaganda on this matter. The head of the Teachers Federation had her name on a document which has gone around a whole series of schools and spread a whole series of untruths about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In reality, we in this government have created a proper schools policy which does give parents real choice and does not put handicaps on and create barriers for parents <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be able to set up a different sort of education that they want. Such barriers did exist under the previous Labor government. They do not exist under this new policy. Parents do have a choice. This is a democracy. They do have that right.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same sort of thing occurs at secondary level, not just at primary level. There is jockeying for an opportunity to go to Melbourne High School, University High School and MacRobertson Girls School. They are within the state system. Even within that system there is not the choice available to the students that there ought to be. That is what we on this side of the chamber are talking about. That is what Senator Carr is on about, not choice between one system and another but a proper choice within each system and across both systems so that everybody, no matter whether they come from Glenroy or Balwyn, has an opportunity to get the sort of education everybody is entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we are on about choice. That is what we are on about everywhere but we want a real choice; and you do not get a real choice unless all schools are of such a quality that they can stand up against each other.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, together with the existence of a private sector system of education&mdash;in the main the Catholic school system but also with the existence of a range of other private schools. I also thought there was a recognition that government accepted a responsibility to contribute to the maintenance of both those systems and to ensure equity and quality within both those systems. Yet Senator Tierney started talking about Russia, as if people on this side were harking back to the old days of saying that there should be no private school education in this country. That is a total distortion of the position and a total distortion of the needs policy that the former Labor government had in place and, indeed,  the policy that the Labor Party has followed for many years&mdash;a policy of ensuring that funding first and foremost is directed on a needs basis so that you can bring about and guarantee equity and quality in both the government and non&hyphen;government school systems. The Commonwealth has had the primary responsibility for funding in the non&hyphen;government school sector directly but has also put billions of dollars, as we know, through the states into state government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has always followed a policy of ensuring that adequate funding is available. You have only to look at our record. The fact that high school retention rates doubled in the years we were in government from 1983 to 1996 is proof of that. We raised by 100 per cent the standard in terms of people staying at high school. What we now have is a policy which harks back to the old approach of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4992"> liberal governments in the past; that is, education directed at ensuring that the wealthy get the best end of the deal. That means, under this proposed new policy&mdash;because the caps are taken off and it will be open for schools to be built without a needs basis being shown&mdash;that students in both the government school sector and the private school sector in this country will suffer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the honourable the President and Members of the Senate in parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we are opposed to any moves to cut funding to universities. We believe that the funding cuts to our universities can only have a negative impact on the development of our Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These proposed cuts will impact especially upon equity sectors&mdash;women will suffer particularly as these cuts will further restrict women's access to education, force universities to cut back on students' child care options, and minimise security on campus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These proposed cuts will also impact upon non-profit generating courses&mdash;such as performing arts. Universities will be forced to prioritise courses in relation to economic viability, allowing university administration to make financial cuts and cuts to entry positions in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, we are opposed to any increases to the annual amount payable by students via the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). We believe that increases to HECS will discourage individuals from enrolling in universities, especially women, and will further discourage individuals from enrolling in courses deemed as non-profit generating courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that university entry should be based on relative merit, not relative wealth, and we believe that the proposed university cuts and increased HECS fees will only promote education as a user-pays commodity and not as a right accorded to all individuals in society.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a student at a tertiary institution in Australia, I would like to express my strongest objection to any moves to change Austudy and Abstudy into a compulsory loans scheme after one year as a grant for undergraduates.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 contains non-Budget amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 (the Social Security Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to agreement by the opposition parties, this bill could be dealt with as a non-controversial bill to be passed in the current sittings period. The measures in this bill and the benefits of securing its early passage are explained below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 makes payments of financial assistance from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust to persons with medically acquired HIV infection and AIDS (and payments to the dependants and carers of such persons) exempt assets for the purposes of the assets test consistent with an undertaking given by a former Minister for Social Security, the Hon Peter Baldwin. Such payments are already exempt income for the purposes of the income test. Since the Schedule 1 amendments commence on the date of Royal Assent, an earlier passage of the legislation would financially benefit persons for whom it is often critical to receive financial assistance as early as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 2 allows the continuation of automatic transfer of mature age partner allowees to wife pension when their mature age allowance partners transfer to age pension after 30 June 1995. Mature age partner allowees in that situation lost access to wife pension as an unintended consequence of the decision to phase out wife pension from 1 July 1995. Currently, they are paid an equivalent to wife pension by way of ex-gratia payments. These amendments commence on the date of Royal Assent. An earlier passage of the legislation would provide earlier legislative authority for payment of wife pensions to the affected women that would remove the necessity of relying in this respect on ex-gratia payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 3 contains two measures. The first measure corrects a technical fault in the Method Statement in point 1210-A1 of the Social Security Act to ensure that the Method statement provides a mechanism for the correct calculation of a `notional family payment rate'. The second measure amends saving provisions in clause 54 of Schedule 1A of the Social Security Act to continue the effect of this clause and so ensure that the results of the application of the Method Statement are correct. Customers affected by the operation of this clause are currently being paid correct amounts from funds advanced for that purpose by the Minister for Finance for the period that ends on 1 January 1997. The amendments made by the second measure commence on the day of Royal Assent. An earlier passage of the legislation would provide earlier <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4996"> legislative authority for the payment of correct amounts to affected customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 4 corrects an unintended error made by the Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Act 1992 to Pension Rate Calculator A in the Social Security Act. This will ensure that the pre-1 January 1993 position for the treatment of reduction of ordinary income of a person who is a member of a couple and whose partner is receiving a social security or service pension, is re-instated.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. When I saw the wording of Senator Cooney's notice of motion No. 293, I felt a level of concern and discomfort. The reason for that is that it is in three parts: it notes the beatification of Edmund Rice as the founder of the Christian Brothers in Ireland&mdash;and that is obviously a statement of a matter of fact; it remembers the coming to Australia of the Christian Brothers and says that from that time `they have given unceasing service to education initiative this country. . . '; and in part (c) it expresses its appreciation of the dedication of the Christian Brothers in Australia and says that it hopes they will go on to serve the community well in the years ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that there is an ongoing level of community concern as well about the incidents that have occurred, certainly in the past, in relation to children in the charge of Christian Brothers in schools and in other establishments. I certainly acknowledge that there are a great many people in Australia who owe their entire education to the Christian Brothers. I am quite happy to acknowledge that there are many people who are very grateful for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not be opposing the formality of this motion, but I will be voting against the motion. I think it is reasonable, if the majority of the Senate wish to vote for it, for me not to stand in the way of that and not to force a full debate. I contacted the group called Voices in Western Australia to see if my concerns were founded and I read through the wording of the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked whether or not those people who were still struggling for recognition of their concerns by the church would feel hurt if everyone in the Senate approved the wording <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this motion. They indicated that they would. In some ways, there are some parallels in relation to `the stolen generation'; the very first thing that must happen before real healing can occur is that there is proper recognition. If nothing else within my time in the Senate, I want to provide some voice for the voiceless, as that is necessary. As I say, it is not a comment on the general nature of Christian Brothers education, but it is a statement for those people who are still struggling for recognition and have not yet got the recognition or the acceptance of liability that I believe they deserve.</PARA></SPEECH>

I want to make it clear that from the government's perspective the motion should be strongly supported. I commend Senator Cooney for bringing it. It is wrong, I believe, to in any way colour the order with the misbehaviour of a few.

This process of a return to order by the Senate in the event of anything that is politically controversial has become something of a farce. Practically not a day goes by without the opposition coming in here and attempting to tie up the administration of government in this country by a spurious return to order. We did not adopt this practice. Occasionally, when there was a serious matter to which this mechanism was appropriate, that is, requiring documents pursuant to an order to be tabled, we utilised the process. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5002"> But you have just turned it into a matter of form.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We get used to working as a minority in this place, but we will battle on. You pass a resolution with little purpose other than to clog up the business of government, and that is what you are seeking here again. You are seeking documents from me on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), documents from the Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) and documents from the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull)&mdash;all records. You have not even sought to specify the records that you want. Presumably you are arguing that there was some sort of irregularity in relation to this tendering process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought you would have at least shown some effort by seeking to identify the documents that you want. But no, you are not interested in that. It is simply `all documents', which therefore demonstrates that this is purely a fishing exercise. Why you did not go down the usual path of seeking these documents through the estimates committee and debating it at the estimates committee, I do not know. That is what normal Senate procedure would have warranted. But instead you complete your task in the estimates committee, then you come back here and you require the production of all documents that are imaginable&mdash;all documents, whether they are legal advices, commercial-in-confidence or whatever. There is no effort to distinguish those that it would be improper for us to table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, you want a resolution of the Senate today that you know we will not be able to comply with if we are to maintain longstanding practices. I can assure the opposition that, even if they have the numbers on this, we will be sticking by the previous accepted rules. I have already indicated to Senator Bolkus that we would be prepared to provide certain documents in confidence that relate to the tendering process, in confidence because they are the commercial documents of those who tendered.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of explanation, we are seeking documents here. We have not taken this position lightly. It is a critical issue that we are talking about here. We are talking about the implementation of the gun buy-back scheme. We are talking about the application of money raised from the taxpayer to ensure that the scheme is implemented properly and extensively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had taken the approach that Senator Hill suggests that we were taking, that approach being of frustration, then we could have very easily moved the process of suspending standing orders and embarking upon a debate. It was I who offered to Senator Hill a fast&hyphen;track proposal for this, one that he was very keen to pursue. In terms of our discussion I acknowledge that where things are commercial-in-confidence there will be a fair degree of acceptance of those documents having their commercial-in-confidence aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5003"> So Senator Hill, we are not being destructive or frustrating you here. What we are saying is that there are some important documents, some important issues, some important information that needs to be seen by the public and by the Senate. For instance, during the estimates process the opposition tackled these issues through both the finance and public administration and legal and constitu tional affairs legislation committees. We are awaiting further information that we have not got through that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons that we want to pursue the reopening of this committee in the same way as the other committee is being reopened is to ensure that the information that we are given can be tested. You cannot test one side of the argument without testing the other. The government has accepted that they will reconvene the finance and public administration estimates process. It is important to reconvene this one as well. We are talking here about the agency that purchased the contract&mdash;Attorney-General's. They are the agency with responsibility for the funding, for spending the funding and for running the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the last estimates hearings, some three weeks ago, we have seen corrections by the government of evidence provided at that estimates proceeding by Mr Smeaton and by Senator Kemp, correcting a very critical piece of information as to whether Mr Morris's intervention ensured the listing of DDB Needham on the short list, on the list to be considered, or whether that had already taken place beforehand. In the estimates process we were told that Mr Morris's intervention had nothing do with the company being listed. Senator Kemp had to come in here and embarrassingly apologise for the fact that the evidence was wrong and that it was Mr Morris's letter which ensured that this company, this tender, got into the ballpark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are inconsistencies between AG's and DAS in the information provided to us. So we need to clear it up at both ends. We need to clear up a whole range of questions that have been left unanswered. For instance, we know that three documents of advice have gone to the government in respect of DDB Needham. Elliott and Shanahan declared it to be a pretty poor tender and claimed that in no sense of the word was it up to scratch. OGIA, the government information agency, also advised the government that it should steer clear of and not touch DDB Needham with a barge pole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The one document we do not have is the advice from the Attorney-General's Depart ment to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). We need to get that to address questions such as: why did the Attorney-General not take a position on this particular campaign when it was so critical to the implementation of the government's buy-back program? We need to find out on whose advice the focus of the campaign was changed. There is a whole range of issues that need to be addressed&mdash;issues of inconsistency and issues which go to tackling parts of the problem and not just concentrating on the perspective of the finance and government operation, Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign has not started and it is five weeks late already. The campaign was supposed to start in October this year. We have not as yet seen the creative work. We do not know, and we should know by now, to what extent integration with the states&mdash;a critical part of the campaign&mdash;has proceeded. All these issues need to be addressed and this is why we have moved for a re-opening of the estimates process in the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in the same way that the process has been reopened in the finance and public administration committee. As I have said, documents are critical. We are not being `frustrative'; we are being constructive, and to that extent we are taking this approach with the government. Otherwise, Senator Hill, you know quite well we could be here all afternoon dragging this out, and that is not what we want to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This is the second half of this attempt to frustrate the government's program by recalling this committee unnecessarily&mdash;a committee that had finished its business for this session&mdash;in the hope that something might be dragged out of it that could be  politically damaging in some way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there was any case for this, if there was an argument that something had been missed before or at the last hearing, then it might be a different matter, but no attempt has been made to develop a case for it other than that the opposition wants another go at it. In other words, it wants to drag the committee members out, and all the public servants, to run through it again just in case the opposition had forgotten a question on the last occasion and out of that fishing trip it might gain something for which it thinks it can get some political mileage. This turns the process into a farce, I would suggest. For that reason, this should be opposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another question asked at the administrative services committee that dealt with the same matter and an answer was given that was subsequently found to be incorrect. When that came to our attention and the opposition wanted to re-open the inquiry to pursue matters arising out of the incorrect answer, our response was that it was <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proper for them to do so and we agreed, without having to come in here and fight the numbers, to that committee being re-opened to explore that matter. That did not seem to us to be unreasonable. A mistake had been made; it had been corrected, but nevertheless that does in our view give the opposition a legitimate opportunity to come back and say it wants to explore the consequences of the now correct answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that does not apply to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. There has been no suggestion that any answer that was given to this committee was either inadequate or wrong, that there were matters that were suppressed or that there was any reason at all for this committee to be re-opened. It seems to us to be another waste of time, a further frustration of the government's business, and for that reason we will vote against it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In moving this motion today, I make it very clear that we are talking about an incident which involves two departments&mdash;the Department of Administrative Services and the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. The money for this campaign run by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department comes from the Medicare levy which was extended and paid for in good faith by Australian taxpayers. That department has had to come back to the Senate to correct one answer, as Senator Hill indicated in respect of DAS. We have had the same situation in respect of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board&mdash;their chief executive officer had to also correct an answer. On that basis, Senator Hill, I think you would be inclined to change your mind and accept that there has been a correction of evidence here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also talking about answers provided since the last hearing and answers not provided. It is a very critical issue for the Australian government and Australian governments to know when this campaign is going to start.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various provisions of the bill should be seen in the context of the government's commitment to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5006"> quality, diversity and innovative change in the higher education sector. This bill meets the government's savings tasks in the fairest way, while advancing key objectives for the higher education sector. It also sets the framework on which the sector can build for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of amendments in the bill provide supplementation for price movements. This supplementation covers items such as superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals, special capital projects, grants to open learning organisations and certain grants in respect of the year 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is committed to strengthening Australia's research and training capacity. To achieve this objective, the bill provides for increased research funding for Australian postgraduate awards and collaborative research of over $39 million and a further $90 million for increases in research infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through this bill, the government is further encouraging the participation of equity groups in higher education by introducing up to 4,000 merit equity scholarships between 1997 and 2000. The scholarships will provide a Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) exemption to recipients, and will be awarded by universities on the basis of merit, consistent with guidelines. The scholarships may only be accessed by members of a nominated equity group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This initiative is in addition to maintenance of the existing higher education equity program at an annual cost of $5.8 million, providing incentive funding to institutions to achieve improved outcomes for students from equity groups. Further, the government will also maintain the regional disability liaison officer initiative for another year at a cost of $750,000, to co&hyphen;ordinate the provision of services for students with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill introduces additional opportunities and choice for Australian students by removing the prohibitions on offering fee&hyphen;paying places to Australian undergraduate students. This will remove the existing anomaly in the treatment of Australian and overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will enable Australian students to have a greater chance of obtaining the higher education course of their first preference, freeing up government funded places they would have otherwise accepted with their second or third preference. It will also generate additional income for the universities and will provide an extra incentive for diversity among institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overwhelming majority of students will continue to contribute to the costs of their education through the HECS alone. The government will not allow institutions to substitute fee&hyphen;paying places for HECS&hyphen;only places, nor will they be able to move whole undergraduate courses on to a fee&hyphen;paying basis. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of fee&hyphen;paying places available to Australian undergraduate students will be limited to twenty five per cent of domestic undergraduate students in any course. If an institution offers fee&hyphen;paying places while at the same time failing to fill its undergraduate target with HECS&hyphen;liable students, a financial penalty of $9,000 will apply for each place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current funding arrangements, if universities enrol more than the target number of Australian students, they receive no extra funding even though the Commonwealth receives HECS payments from the students. The government is removing this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1998, universities will be paid the equivalent of the minimum up&hyphen;front HECS payment for each HECS&hyphen;liable undergraduate student enrolled above the target level. This provides some recognition of the costs incurred by institutions which over&hyphen;enrol. It will also present an opportunity for institutions with low marginal costs to offer additional places to undergraduate students without charging fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill introduces differential HECS contributions from 1997. This measure strikes a better balance between the public and private funding of higher education. Students will now be required to make a contribution to the cost of their education which is more closely linked to both the actual cost of the course undertaken and the likely future benefits to the individual in terms of increased life&hyphen;time earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the new HECS charges will apply in three bands: $3,300, $4,700 and $5,500. Each unit of study will be allocated to one of the bands. A student commencing a course in 1997 will have their HECS debt calculated according to the distribution of their units between each of the three bands. The student will be charged at the appropriate band amount for each unit, rather than being charged at the same band for all units.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing the new differential HECS arrangements, the amendments ensure that no existing student will have an unanticipated increase in the cost of their current course. The government will not be increasing the HECS charge or debt levels for existing debtors or for HECS&hyphen;liable students in their current courses. The new charges will only apply to students commencing a new course after 1 January 1997. The arrangements retain the essential features of HECS and ensure that no qualified student is prevented from entering higher education because of an inability to pay at the time of enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with this measure, the bill also enables the open learning agency of Australia to set its fees at a level it considers appropriate. At present, the agency is constrained by its agreement with the Commonwealth to charge for undergraduate units at a fixed price. If this constraint is not lifted, the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5007"> agency will be required to charge at a level that is below the new differential HECS level, and lower than the level of fees institutions may charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligible open learning students will continue to be able to defer their charge under the open learning deferred payment scheme. The amount the Commonwealth will lend to the student under the scheme will remain at the level of the current basic charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides new HECS repayment thresholds, which will mean that individual HECS debtors repay their debt more quickly. The provisions retain seven repayment levels, but set them at lower levels. No student will be required to make HECS repayments until their income reaches the minimum threshold set out in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lowering of the minimum threshold to $20,701 means that the current discount for voluntary payment at this income level will be discontinued. The repayment required at this income level will be less than $12 per week. The existing discounts of twenty five per cent for up&hyphen;front payments and fifteen per cent for voluntary payments of $500 at any time, will remain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new section 20a of the act will clarify that advances of operating grants may be made for a broad range of purposes, consistent with ministerial guidelines. Those guidelines will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and enable advances to be made for redundancy expenses and to assist institutions with the costs associated with restructuring. This amendment is required to clarify an ambiguity with the provisions contained in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes a consequential amendment to the act of the Australian Maritime Council to enable it to charge undergraduate fees on the same basis as other higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill reflects the government's commitment to a relevant, high quality education system which is striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill serves to make various non&hyphen;Budget amendments to social security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to rectify an inequity with the mature age partner provisions. From 1 July 1995, wife pension and mature age partner allowance were phased out. However, those people who had claimed these payments and were qualified for them before that date were "saved" from the effect of the changes. The savings provision did not operate as intended for the mature age partner allowance. For example, when a disability pensioner turns 65 years of age and is automatically transferred to age pension, it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was intended that his wife pension partner continue to qualify for wife pension. The Social Security Act did not allow, however, for "saved" mature age partner allowance recipients to continue to receive the mature age partner allowance when their mature age allowance partners are automatically transferred to age pension. This bill makes amendments to rectify this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also makes amendments to continue the effect of savings provisions in clause 54 of Schedule 1A. Clause 54 provides a series of savings provisions which applied to maintain the status quo of various groups of family allowance recipients who were overseas when the family payment regime commenced operation on 1 January 1993. If not for these savings provisions, these people, who formerly received an add&hyphen;on for dependent children as a component of their pension, would not have been qualified for the new family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, clause 54 makes reference to "additional family payment", which ceased to exist on 1 January 1996. In the absence of the amendments made by this bill, clause 54 would not operate to provide the correct rate of payment for these people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Social Security Act, a person's assets may affect payment of their social security pension, benefit or allowance. This bill amends the Social Security Act to ensure that payments of financial assistance from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust to persons with medically acquired HIV infection and AIDS (and payments to the dependents and carers of such persons) are not taken into account for the purposes of the social security assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally the bill amends the Social Security Act to rectify a technical problem with a provision in Pension Rate Calculator A. When the Social Security Act was amended in 1992 to integrate family allowance and family allowance supplement into a new payment (family payment), some inappropriate consequential amendments were made to a provision dealing with how a person's reduction for ordinary income is to be worked out in the situation of a person who is a member of a couple and has a partner receiving a social security or service pension</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned until the first day of sitting in 1997, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that the bills be listed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> as separate orders of the day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the consideration of this bill was interrupted last Thursday for the adjournment, Senator Campbell, the parliamentary secretary, was saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised, just to reinforce that point, Senator Margetts, that the government is considering delegating and contracting advice given to the community groups. That means resources. Maybe you will change your mind and vote for the schedule now.</PARA>
<PARA>We were asking for resources to be guaranteed for the community groups. Perhaps we could check whether that was a fault in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  or not. But I would also like to clarify that it was a case of between the devil <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the deep blue sea in this regard. We do not see that the Employment Advocate is a great boon for employees in the workplace system; that is, in the brave new world of the post workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my opinion, there will be a great need for good, reliable and independent advice. I do not see that the way the government and the Australian Democrats have set things up will guarantee that. Therefore, the current arrangements, inadequate as they are, even with the Department of Industrial Relations, might be better than the situation, with its implied conflict of interest, that would exist with what the government proposes for the Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To clarify the situation: no, it is not a matter of our saying, `Na, na, na, you didn't support our amendments.' I gather that there will be further proposals with the recommittal of that proposed section. We will be looking at those very carefully, and hopefully so will the rest of the Senate, to make sure that this provision will do, at least partly, what it is supposed to do&mdash;assist workers in dealing with the very many problems that they will be encountering with individual contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just thought I would clarify that. We are not saying that it was nearly good enough. We are saying, `What a dreadful situation you have put workers in. How on earth can we create a better situation to make sure there is some redress for them?'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats took the clear view that it was right and proper that the government should have the opportunity to introduce a new institution to add to the existing industrial relations institutions if they felt that that was an appropriate innovation. With the introduction of any new institution, there are, inevitably, areas of some lack of clarity&mdash;whether the budget will be sufficient, whether the organisational structure is sufficient, whether the tasks, roles and responsibilities are appropriate, and whether the officers to run the institution have a clear understanding of their role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You quite rightly point out that we regarded, as a result of the evidence given to us, that the employee ombudsman model, as shown in South Australia, was a very admirable model and one which seemed to work very well. It remains our preferred model. But the essence is that the government did not agree at this stage to introducing our preference and wished to take the development of this institution along the lines they originally envisaged. As a consequence, there may be areas of some conflict which could develop, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such as those outlined by Professor Ron McCallum and others; there may be some problems as a result of a dualistic role, and some conflicts may arise out of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own belief is that we should give the government the opportunity to experiment and to live with this for a while. We should give the unions the opportunity to deal with and interact with that institution. We should give employer organisations the opportunities to deal with and interact with that organisation so that, in due course, after some months of experimentation and understanding as to how it is to work, they can make the appropriate recommendations for its further development. It is, in my view&mdash;and obviously yours&mdash;not going to be perfect, as it is envisaged. But the government badly want it to work, so I am quite sure that, if it does not work as effectively as they might want it to, they are likely to look favourably at changes.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to the response of the parliamentary secretary on this matter. Senator Evans, the evidence before the Senate inquiry clearly indicated&mdash;in fact proved&mdash;that there are groups of employees and, indeed, groups of employers, and individual employees and employers, who have relative advantages and disadvantages in the bargaining process. Coming from a side of the chamber which is well represented in union negotiation, you would understand that to be a truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our intention, which I think I spelt out in earlier remarks made last week, was that the standard even&hyphen;handed arbitration and conciliation process of the AIRC should, wherever possible, be supplemented in this legislation by a bias towards those who are disadvantaged. It is quite plain that, in the early days of the establishment of this new institution, the way in which that is to be implemented is still up in the air, and you quite rightly point out that that is not yet spelt out finitely. But I think the parliamentary secretary is correct in wanting to leave that open ended and let <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Employment Advocate develop some of the strengths of his or her own institution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should make the point that amongst a number of  consequences of the amendment process will be requirements that all AWAs include appropriate provisions on discrimination, that an AWA is offered to all comparable employees, that the employer explain the effect of an AWA to the employee, and that the employee genuinely consented to making an AWA. If the employer is explaining the effect of an AWA to a non-English speaking person, plainly that person is potentially at a disadvantage unless it has been properly presented. We would expect the Employment Advocate to have consideration for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that these considerations will be most important in the development of the information statement prepared by the Employment Advocate, which all employers will be required to give to employees prior to signing an AWA. Whilst you may wish to categorise these statements about disadvantaged employees as somewhat motherhood, we are hopeful that they can be developed into a proper protection which does not currently exist.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator Murray's intervention and that of the parliamentary secretary. I will, however, make a couple of points, because I do not seem to be able to get the answers I want as to how this operates in practice. The first thing is that, from reading the report of the committee looking into the bill, I understood that those concerns that were raised in evidence were the very concerns that led Senator Murray to recommend the separation of the offices to an advocate and an ombudsman's role to deal with that very conflict. I do not want to labour the point but, again, we do not see that contained in the legislation or the agreed amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second aspect is that one of the reasons these workers are at a disadvantage is that they are being discouraged and prevented, in some instances, from collectively bargaining. We are not giving any encouragement to collective bargaining, so in many cases they <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5014"> will be negotiating these agreements individually and relying on the employer to explain to them their rights. Anyone with any modicum of experience in industrial relations knows that there is potential for abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I make is that, from my experience of the Western Australian system, there are allegedly protections in terms of people having agreements explained to them, along with the workplace commissioner allegedly protecting people's rights. The reality of the experience is quite different from that. The commissioner merely seeks some acknowledgment from the workers that they have some idea of what they are signing, then does no more. A number of documented cases were presented in evidence to the committee about how unsuccessful that has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason for my cynicism is that the last time the coalition had a go at industrial relations legislation at the federal level, they introduced a similar clause in the charter of the Industrial Relations Bureau which called for a particular focal point on non-English speaking workers. That, quite frankly, was an unmitigated failure. They never achieved any of their objectives in looking after those people disadvantaged by an inability to speak English. It really is, in my view, a sop. We have not had any proper explanation of how someone can advise an employer and, at the same time, take some proactive role in trying to redress the disadvantaged bargaining position that the legislation recognises. It is a nonsense. There is no explanation, and that is why one has not been presented.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that in jest, I do want to make a couple of serious points. The first is that it is self&hyphen;evident to everyone in this chamber and listening that the government definitely gave up what they did not want to give up and the Australian Democrats definitely did not get everything we wanted to get. Quite <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5015"> plainly, what you have before you is the result of negotiation and compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we are dealing with the amendments 1 to 12 reviewing the whole area of the Employment Advocate, I really do want to respond to the question of limbo. It is my view that the government have very properly said, `We have to deal with an area of individual agreements between employees and employers which, at this point in time, are informal. They are out there but they are in some sort of legal limbo.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You and I both know that two&hyphen;thirds of employees are not unionised. You and I both know&mdash;and I use the collective `you', not the disrespectful `you'&mdash;that large numbers of employees are presently on verbal contracts. It is my belief&mdash;and has been my belief consistently&mdash;that the introduction of Australian workplace agreements, provided that the protections are there, will contribute to a better legal relationship between employees and employers than presently exists. That is one of the reasons that we are prepared to give the government&mdash;to use a colloquialism&mdash;a fair go in the development of this institution and in the Australian workplace agreements area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see you are dying to hop onto your feet to debate this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a few comments before we conclude this schedule. That last <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> comment of Senator Murray was about these contractual agreements that are verbal and not in writing. I think Senator Murray&mdash;through you, Mr Chairman&mdash;you really are showing your lack of knowledge of the industrial area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, there have always been many hundreds, and probably millions, of agreements that are verbal&mdash;so&hyphen;called over&hyphen;award agreements that are usually verbal, sometimes in writing. These agreements&mdash;in limbo, as you refer to them&mdash;will always exist. If you believe what you have just said, the Office of Employment Advocate, as we understand very clearly in this bill, is not to try to take some sort of control of or act as some sort of imprimatur on currently verbal agreements. I am sure that is not what the government has in mind.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current verbal agreements that exist will continue. There might be some&mdash;I suspect very few&mdash;that are put down in writing, but that is not the role of an Employment Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We question the whole reasoning for the creation of the Employment Advocate. As we pointed out earlier, the Department of Industrial Relations provides advice and assistance about awards and AWAs at the moment. We have investigations into breaches or contraventions. The commission also has a role in respect of the filing of AWAs. Why create another organisation to oversee these jurisdictions where this work is already being carried out? It is a duplication. I thought this government was all about cutting away duplication, not adding to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other contradiction, Senator Murray, that you admit&mdash;through you, Mr Chairman&mdash;is the contradiction between the representational role for employees and employers. If an employee who has a complaint complains to the Employment Advocate and then the Employment Advocate interviews the employer, who is the Employment Advocate to represent? They have to make a choice. There is a clear conflict there. This government does not recognise the clear conflict of interest about shares and they certainly cannot recognise it here. Senator Murray, you recognise it, yet you are supporting the government's position and you are not supporting an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5016"> amendment that we moved that reflects your position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a ridiculous situation you are in. You refer to our amendments that reflect your position as being your preferred model. Why aren't you supporting it here today? You say you anticipate some problems, so why aren't you supporting our amendments here today? You say that this is an experiment. Well, we are going to experiment with conflict, knowing there is going to be conflict of interest. You say that this is not going to be perfect.

They will provide a particular level of protection for employees in a weak bargaining position who might otherwise be unable to prevent an employer imposing a harsh or unjust outcome on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of regular part&hyphen;time employee is also important. This definition is based <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the wording of the AIRC itself in the personal carer's leave case. In particular, the AIRC will be required under proposed section 143(1)(caa) to ensure that awards, where appropriate, contain part&hyphen;time employment provisions. This should accelerate the acceptance of part&hyphen;time work across awards, combined with a ban introduced by this bill on quotas and maximum hours for part&hyphen;time employees.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose this amendment, amendment 17, with respect to objects and, indeed, we obviously oppose the original provision in the bill. With respect to the Labor proposal that we will be dealing with shortly, the bill deletes the existing section providing for the objects of part 6, prevention and settlement of disputes, and inserts new objects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment amends these new objects in the following ways&mdash;and this encapsulates our opposition to the proposals the government has in this bill and with respect to its amendment 17. Firstly, we say that minimum wages and conditions must be protected and maintained at relevant and fair levels by the award system. Secondly, we say that awards must provide relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions. Thirdly&mdash;and this is a key point that I hope Senator Murray will have some regard to&mdash;whilst accepting that awards must be suited to the efficient performance of work, we add that the interests of employees must also be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Frankly, it is a surprise to me that the Democrats did not deal with this matter in their negotiations with the government. Fourthly, whilst accepting that the commission's award making powers should encourage the making of workplace agreements, we add that they must also encourage <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5019"> the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. In this objects section, we do not have the encouragement of the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. That is a fundamental change in industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 100 years&mdash;Senator Murray may not be aware of this&mdash;one of the objects of the act since Federation has been the settlement of industrial disputes. It seems to us that that is still a fundamental&mdash;a core, if we want to use current parlance in respect of promises&mdash;commitment or object that should be included in this section. What is more fundamental than encouraging the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes? Why doesn't it appear here, Senator Murray? It should do. We would argue strongly, Senator Murray, that you should support the inclusion of this in this section. My colleagues intend to make some further observations about these provisions. But that is the overview of our concern in respect of this part of the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

But paragraph (b) still encounters the kind of problems we talked about when we were talking about the object of the bill&mdash;that is, we have got the words `awards act as a safety net of fair minimum wages'. We never did find what was meant by `fair'. We discovered it could mean anything from a fairground carousel to moderately good. If that is what stands between something reasonable for workers and potential exploitation, I am not very hopeful, I am afraid. With regard to `awards are simplified', that is one way of putting it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amendment 17 states that `wages and conditions of employment are protected by a system of enforceable awards'. You then say that the `awards act as a safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment'. But it says that the awards are to be `established and maintained by the commission'. Is it contemplated that the commission will somehow be a self&hyphen;starter on this, that you will not need a log of claims? If that is what is meant, how can the commission do that? I am just wondering what the additional words in the amendment envisage.

Again, I wonder what real effect that change will have. When it says `confined in their scope to a safety net', that means it cannot be any more than that, but when you use the words `act as a safety net' it cannot mean any more than being a safety net.

Minimum rates awards provide more than the mere safety net, for `safety net' implies an absolute minimum of conditions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just follow on from Senator Cooney's very valid point. We are actually dealing with the very fundamental question of the commission's jurisdiction. The amended bill radically changes the nature of the commission's jurisdiction with respect to, firstly, making findings of industrial disputes and, secondly, resolving them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Campbell, I give you this illustration which might help you to understand the question more, and I would also appreciate Senator Murray's response. We have awards of the commission at the moment. There are quite clearly awards where there are provisions that will not fit into the 18 allowable matters. They may not also be incidental to the 18 allowable matters. I am sure senators on this side of the chamber can give you numerous examples, and you are probably aware of some; I gave one in a speech not so long ago. The question then is: can they be brought in under the head of `exceptional'? That is a test it would appear you are putting forward as something that the commission can determine. You would look at concepts of harsh and unjust and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems I see here is that there can be a provision in the award at the moment that unless there is some agreement reached as to reflecting that provision by another method&mdash;such as an agreement outside the award&mdash;it would disappear out of awards in the prescribed period of 18 months. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5022"> You then have a position where a union may have to lodge a claim either prior to or after that period to try to get the commission back into the equation to rule upon whether or not this should be an exceptional matter that should be included in the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission will be faced with the dilemma of saying, `We cannot make a finding of a dispute on that particular issue because it is not an allowable matter.' You have yourself in a real catch&hyphen;22 situation. I can tell you that the commission and the High Court have spent a lot of time in the past dealing with the question of what an industrial dispute is for the purposes of exercising not only the powers of the act but the constitutional powers upon which this legislation is based&mdash;which you have conveniently left out of the objects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am asking you to explain how your proposal will work in matters that you say are exceptional. We want a definition of them; give us some examples. I am putting to you that the commission will find itself in the position of being unable to make a finding of dispute on a particular matter in the first place, thereby enabling it to utilise its conciliation and arbitral powers. Do not respond by saying, as you did, Senator Campbell, that the commission can conciliate. Any industrial relations practitioner will tell you that the commission's powers to conciliate in situations where they do not have specific jurisdiction are only ever exercised if both parties to the industrial situation agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will find, as we often found, that employers will call into question the jurisdiction of the commission. They will go to the act, they will go to this section and they will say, `Hang on! You cannot even get to step one, in terms of determining whether this is exceptional or not, because you cannot even make a valid finding of an industrial dispute under this section in the first place.' That is the problem you are creating. Yet the commission will be dealing with a whole lot of provisions which currently exist in awards and which have been held to be within the meaning of an industrial dispute time and time again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell, I think you have just illustrated very well the dilemma that this legislation will create. Fist of all, the word `maintained' has been put in as if it is designed to fix a problem that was seen in this area&mdash;which we have been pointing out to you for some time&mdash;that comes about because of the reduction to 18 allowable matters. Sure, I do not like it. The primary reason I do not like it is that there are people out there who have entitlements that have been ruled upon by industrial tribunals and, in many cases, may have been upheld by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5023"> courts of this land, but this legislation just takes those rights away from them without any real recourse. To suggest that the putting in of the word `maintained' can deal with that position is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, to suggest, as the Democrats will suggest, that we will create this catch-all subclause so that these matters can all come within the definition of `exceptional' does not advance us any further. The position I am trying to explain to you is that it is said here that this is all about simplification of awards. The primary purpose of section 89A, which we will come to deal with later but which is related, is to simplify awards. Surely, the end result of this is an incredible amount of litigation in the commission and in the courts over what can and what cannot get in because of the restriction on the number of allowable matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be debates about what is legally meant by the term `exceptional', what is meant by the phrase `harsh and unjust', and what is meant by the word `incidental'. It will not necessarily be the case that you can call on existing precedent to look at those issues, because what we have here is a fundamental change to the definition of an industrial dispute. That is the problem that I am putting to you, and you are saying to us that this is a simplification. How can it be a simplification when what you are really setting up is a regime for a massive amount of litigation from the very first day that this act comes into force?</PARA></SPEECH>

I think Senator Cooney was making the point that, without an interstate dispute, an individual employer would not have the basis for varying the awards nor would they have the ability to create an interstate dispute binding a variety of employers. So what Senator Murray is suggesting has to be taken to the next step; that is, if there were a selective group of employers who were organised across states then perhaps that could happen. But I would suggest that that is perhaps rather a fanciful view of how the world would operate under this environment, given the history of the maintenance of awards. There have been very few cases where the award system, as it currently stands, has been maintained on application of any employer organisation or individual employer. To suggest that something like this bill will change that is drawing a rather a long bow.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are several points I would like to follow up but, firstly, I want to correct Senator Campbell about my earlier interjection, which was that the level of disputation would be incomparable. Some of the issues touched on to date I feel would be better <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addressed as we get into the more detailed provisions of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that we are removing from the objects provision a requirement for the commission to encourage prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. The emphasis is obvious. The consequence of this bill is that we will see a significant rise in the level of disputation, reflected not only in the amount of argument that will occur in the Industrial Relations Commission over the meaning of an `allowable matter', an `incidental matter' or an `exceptional matter', but in argument over many other issues as well. For example, what will be regarded as an `industrial dispute'? That is a matter I will follow up later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To address Senator Murray's comments, I want to go back to the point I made about the objects of this bill. There seems to be a comprehensive misunderstanding or delusion about what our award system is. Senator Murray referred to comments made in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> about awards, but nowhere in those comments was there reference to the fact that an award system that deals with more than just minimum safety nets would not continue. The Labor Party never said that and would never have supported that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a feeling for the evolution of the type of industrial system we now have. It deals with more than just 20 minimum standards and the things that might be incidental or exceptional to them. We have worked with the system and we understand how the system works to benefit the nation as a whole in preventing and settling industrial disputes. Now we will have tremendous arguments about what constitutes an industrial dispute. I will come to that later when I deal with the definition of `exceptional matters', because that really highlights the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I would like to raise at this stage goes back to what Senator Sherry said earlier: we have removed the requirement for the commission to take into account the interests of employees. Why have we done that here? Elsewhere we include the fact that we are supposed to take into account the interests and wishes of employees in relation to union representation. But on the fundamental matter of what goes into an award and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5025"> what award conditions are, we remove reference to the interests of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does that not explain the government's agenda with this bill? Does Senator Murray not see that quite clearly? Does he not see how he has been deluded about some of these things when the government is not prepared to insert a fundamental object in relation to the awards and the award system to take into account the interests of employees? I hope Senator Campbell will answer the specific and clear question: why has the government taken out the provision that refers to the interests of employees?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that we need to give careful thought to&mdash;this was raised a few moments ago&mdash;is the way the bill changes the nature of how the system treats representative organisations. What will happen to maintain awards? The notion that the government and the Australian Democrats seem to have about trade unions is that they will be just bargaining agents. That is not the role that unions have played in our industrial relations system to date. How will we maintain this uniform award&mdash;I am reluctant to call it an award system&mdash;if we do not have representative organisations doing it? That is my second question.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have one question following what Senator O'Brien and Senator Jacinta Collins have said in regard to the concept of the part the unions will play and the part that the commission will play in the system. The part that the commission seems to be playing in the scheme, as suggested through the amendments we are talking about, and the use of the word `maintained', is that somehow the commission <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5026"> itself, without the unions, will be able to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray has said that that could be initiated by small business, and I think Senator Collins and Senator O'Brien dealt with that. What adds some weight to the way this side of the chamber looks at how the commission is to work under the new system is the deletion of the present section 90AA in the act, which uses similar words to those used in 88A and 88B. The present 90AA(2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In performing these functions, the commission must:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) ensure, so far as it can, that the system of awards provides for a secure, relevant and consistent wages and conditions of employment: and</PARA>
<PARA>Under the present act, what that would seem to mean is that, when the commission has the opportunity, as it would if there was a dispute, it ought to do these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words `so far as it can' limit what the commission can do. They limit it, I would suggest, to the present constitutional limits that are put on it. For some reason, when you go to 88B&mdash;I know we have not come to that yet but it is related to 88A, and how you read 88A&mdash;the words `so far as it can' have dropped out and you use the expression `must ensure'. When you move from one piece of legislation to another and you purposely leave out certain words, then I would have thought a court and a commission ought to take note of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was wondering how a court would treat the leaving out of the words `so far as it can' that are in the present act. I would have thought that what they would say is that the whole thrust of 88A, taken with 88B and the fact that 99A(2) is repealed, means that this particular piece of legislation is set up on the basis that the commission itself has somehow the constitutional ability to set minimum wages and standards on its own, which would be a very interesting development in constitutional law.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to go back to my earlier point, which was the reference to workplaces or enterprises rather than to the interest of the employees.

I do not see that reflected in this objects provision with respect to awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to what precisely the reference is. The reference is `to the efficient performance of work, according to the needs of particular workplaces or enterprises'. We are talking about the efficient performance of work, not the interest of employees&mdash;just the efficient performance of work. I ask the parliamentary secretary once again: where is the reference to the needs of the work force when you make great claims with respect to inserting the interests or desires of employees in provisions relating to section 118A?</PARA></SPEECH>

That is fundamental, Senator Murray. And why did your grubby deal not include that in the clause 88A objects? Here is your chance. Go on the record; tell us why you did not include that in this particular proposed section of the bill. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point&mdash;you talk about evolution, Senator Murray&mdash;is that there has always been in the act for 100 years an encouragement to prevent and settle industrial disputes.

<PARA>Senator Woodley, I am confident that you are listening and that you would have great sympathy with these amendments. Just convince Senator Murray. Our amendments make a number of significant changes. First, we provide that the commission must perform its function to provide `relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions', not just a safety net of minimum wages and conditions, as provided in the bill. In (a) we state that the commission must have regard to `the need to provide fair and reasonable living standards for employees', not just fair minimum standards as provided in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In (c) we state that the commission must have regard to `the needs of the low paid and those without the ability to bargain collectively'. In (e) where there is reference to training arrangements we insert a reference to the relevant commission decision. In (f) where there is reference to a supported wage system for disabled people we insert a reference to the relevant commission decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In (g)&mdash;and we have not touched on this in the debate yet, and I hope Senator Campbell does not accuse us of filibustering; this is a point some of my colleagues will certainly want to be asking you questions about&mdash;we state that the commission must provide the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value. That does not just mean equal pay for work of equal value, as provided in the bill. In subclause (i) we add a requirement for the commission to have regard to the need <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to prevent and settle industrial disputes. We have had some discussion about that. In (j) we add a requirement for the commission to have regard to the interests of the parties immediately concerned and of the Australian community as a whole. That deals with amendments 1 to 7. My colleagues will be making some contributions with respect to these matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

Equal pay is a term long understood and used by the AIRC, and the reference to equal pay in this principle reflects that this division deals only with awards which, by virtue of section 89A(2), are minimum rate awards.

In a lot of industries a practice had developed where females were not a dominant sector of the work force for overtime, lower classifications and things of that nature, which led to their total wage package being allocated solely to the males and none to the females, for whatever reasons. That gave rise to the equal pay for equal remuneration debate. In this context, pursuing Senator Collins's line of questioning, with the prevention and elimination of discrimination in paragraph (e) on the grounds of sex, is it therefore fair to conclude that any wages or <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conditions relating to discrimination are hence outlawed by paragraph (e) even though it is not expressly identified in paragraph (d)?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to advise the Senate of the outcomes of my recent visit as Parliamentary Secretary for Trade to Russia and central Europe and to table my report, which I have called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Emerging markets and opportunities for Australia</EMPHASIS> . I believe the outcomes from the visit will complement the forthcoming report by the parliamentary delegation to Hungary and Poland led by you, Madam President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been striking changes since my 1993 visit to central Europe. My report at that time was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North, south, east, west</EMPHASIS>. The aim of my recent visit was to register the government's commitment to expanding trade and investment links with their countries and to finalise government agreements which will help our business people to expand their commercial activities in the region. I am pleased to say that the visit was fruitful on both counts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is clearly a strong desire to expand their international links and to diversify sources of investment and imports. The strength of this interest in diversification is a potential asset for Australian companies. In my ministerial meetings, I was told that Australia would need to increase its political investment over the next several years if it aims to take advantage of their emerging commercial opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In central Europe governments play a major role in shaping the framework for business, particularly for foreign firms. I believe that Australian companies have the relevant skills and products to be able to benefit from this region's growth in the next three to five years. A small number of innovative Australian investors are already demonstrating their capacity to become major players in specific niche markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5041"> Apart from their diverse histories, the size of the economies of Russia and central Europe differ so much that the two categories cannot usefully be grouped under one head ing. The combined economy of the Commonwealth of Independent States, of which Russia is the largest member, is approximately the same size as that of all the central European economies combined. Its population of 148 million compares with 60 million in Poland. Russia's global two&hyphen;way trade was $US124 billion in 1995. Poland, the largest of the central European economies, recorded $US52 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I wish to stress that Russia is a composite of many regions. A number of its regions have achieved rapid growth and also established a reputation as being stable and predictable in the application of their rules and regulations. Therefore, potential Australian investors and exporters need to be acutely aware of the political, legal and commercial environment in the regions before entering the markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian investors whom I met in the three central European countries stressed the formative stage of these markets and the particular opportunities that the region can present to smaller Australian firms. Their point was that many of the larger European and North American firms can be expected to develop a dominance in their specific market segments as these economies move to a more mature stage. Many of the business people said that the next three to five years offered opportunities to enter a high growth market before the major players became entrenched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is realistic to expect sustained economic growth in most central European markets. Poland and the Czech Republic are projected to average five per cent growth in the next five years. Romania achieved seven per cent GDP growth in 1995. The currently strong foreign investor sentiment can be expected to continue. Inflow of foreign direct investment, FDI, has risen significantly in the last two years. FDI into the five countries of the central European free trade area, CEFTA, more than doubled in 1995 to $US9 billion, and Poland surpassed Hungary as the main recipient of regional FDI.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Russia has yet to attract a significant inflow of FDI because potential investors remain concerned about unpredictability in the application of rules, in the level of nationalistic <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sentiment, and in the role of extra&hyphen;legal organisations. However, a number of regions are attracting a considerable investor interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and business people, especially in Poland and the Czech Republic, had a strong international outlook. There is a good framework for growth in our trade and investment with this region. We have a good set of double tax and investment protection agreements with most countries. The Australian investors whom I met in the region also stressed some of the advantages of the region for them&mdash;a strong industrial skills base in their work forces, especially in engineering and related fields; and the generally good physical infrastructure&mdash;as advantages in comparison with most developing country locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joint ventures and service industries have good prospects. Many of the foreign countries establishing operations in central Europe use it as a strategic location for access to an expanded European Union market, once these countries become members. Poland and the Czech Republic already have association agreements with the EU, and membership applications to NATO are under consideration. Those two countries and Hungary are expected to become EU members in the near term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In each country I sought improved market access for Australian products. In the case of agricultural products, import policy reform is especially sensitive in Russia, Poland and Romania. There are serious political constraints on rapid liberalisation given the large proportion of their populations remaining in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I received a more positive response on issues of concern to foreign business. The main ones are the unpredictability in the application of laws and regulations, the legal framework, uncertainty about property rights, delays in processing applications, and the role of either state&hyphen;owned countries or their privatised equivalents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the Australian companies I contacted have a strategic plan for expansion into the regional markets. For example, Mincom and Brambles are going into the Czech Republic&mdash;for Brambles, it is their biggest <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5042"> overseas contract&mdash;and Easycall into Poland. In the food and beverages sector, Australia's Coca&hyphen;Cola Amatil identified Romania as one of its 20 top growth markets and has invested over $US131 million in plant and distribution. ADI and Pioneer International have done well in the area of environmental clean&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The privatisation of large numbers of public sector organisations has generated special demands for market relevant skills because many of these organisations are being weaned off government. Business opportunities are flowing from the market liberalisation, the growth of consumer spending, their own skills gap and the international orientation of many local business houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet Australian companies are, regrettably, scarce on the ground. I believe that a more concerted effort is needed to ensure that Australia does not miss the central European economic take&hyphen;off. The low awareness level in Australia about market opportunities in the region appears to be a key weakness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The central European desire to diversify the sources of investment and imports is an asset for Australia. So is the presence of significant migrant communities in Australia from those countries, which means that we have a pool of relevant linguistic skills and cultural awareness on which business can draw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government will continue to contribute to improving the level of business awareness of the region through the programs carried out by Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I believe that a concerted Team Australia approach will be needed in the next several years, involving government agencies working closely with major industry associations to ensure that Australia does not miss out on the commercial opportunities which are emerging as these countries achieve sustained economic growth.

In recent times we have seen once again interference in the judicial <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system, this time through interference with the CJC. It really is quite sad that Queensland has gone back to the days which existed pre&hyphen;Fitzgerald. I had hoped that we would have had a maturing of the government in Queensland, after they had been out of office for some six years. Instead, when the going got too hot, the CJC and the inquiry conducted by Ken Carruthers were interfered with. I do not say that lightly. I have here a statement by Ken Carruthers, a former Supreme Court judge, and I quote from part of it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On October the 24th, I received a letter from Mr Hanger, Senior Counsel Assisting the Connolly Ryan inquiry, which said, `There exists the distinct possibility that the conduct of your inquiries will be a matter to be considered by this commission of inquiry.'</PARA>
<PARA>I will just depart from that statement. That is the commission of inquiry established by the Borbidge government in Queensland. The statement of Carruthers goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regarded these approaches as an assertion of control over the conduct of my inquiry by Mr Hanger and Mr Simon Cooper on behalf of the commission which they were assisting. Salient points of a legal opinion include: although it is part of my duty to recommend whether criminal charges should be brought against the Premier, Mr Borbidge and the Minister for Police, Mr Cooper, among others, both are members of the government which established the Connolly Ryan commission.</PARA>
<PARA>The next dot point in his statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, two people, into whose conduct and possible misconduct I am inquiring, have participated in the setting up of an inquiry into my inquiry into them.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague has just interjected, it is shameful. One would have thought that the Carruthers inquiry would have been allowed to go to its natural conclusion and then we would have had unfolded before us whether there were people culpable as a result of that inquiry and subject to charges under the laws of the state of Queensland. But not so. We found that the honourable person conducting the inquiry, a respected person, found himself in the position <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5043"> where he had no choice in his mind but to resign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to also then look at some of the follow&hyphen;up material that has come out as a result of the fracas that has taken place in the state of Queensland. A letter to the editor on the day following sums up the whole position very well. This letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resignation of Mr Carruthers QC should be the cause for great alarm in our community. Whether or not the CJC is deserving of an inquiry into its own operation&mdash;and many would say it is&mdash;the timing of that inquiry certainly leads one to question the motivation for it at this time. One irresistible view is that it was established in an attempt to cast doubt on the findings made by Mr Carruthers and thus protect or seek to protect the premier, his police minister and others, from criminal prosecution. These latest revelations, which place Mr Carruthers in such an extraordinary dilemma, are to be deplored.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While both these men are highly regarded for their ability and integrity</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;that is, Messrs Connolly and Ryan, who are conducting the inquiry into the inquiry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is surely cause for some surprise that Mr Connolly accepted the position as joint head of the inquiry given his previous professional involvement with the police minister&mdash;not a wise decision.</PARA>
<PARA>It is with regret that I stand here before you and this honourable Senate to contemplate what is happening in the state of Queensland. Where has fairness gone? Where has objectivity gone? If one is guilty, if one has to face the music, then surely one must have the courage to do so. If&mdash;and I say if&mdash;the Carruthers inquiry was allowed to proceed, one does not know what the outcome would have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would equally have been responsible for the government in Queensland, if the CJC is worthy of some form of rigorous inquiry, if the CJC has in some way stepped beyond its charter, stepped beyond the realms of what is reasonable in a society, to have postponed the inquiry into the CJC until after the Carruthers inquiry had finished. But no, what we saw was a return to the good old days&mdash;the return to save mates and the return to protect their friends. This, of course, has led to a lack of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> confidence by the Queensland people in the state government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the lengthy period that was spent in dealing with corruption in the state of Queensland, it is surely a sad day when we see what is emerging today. Obviously, people have not learnt from these lessons. There will be other occasions on which I will make further reference to this matter. I wanted to draw to the attention of senators, this Senate and those listening this evening, that over the weekend the people in Queensland, in my view, expressed their dissatisfaction at the way this whole activity has proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there are moves in the state of Queensland today, the outcome of which I am not aware, one would hope that, in the end, sanity will prevail, that people will see that justice is done&mdash;not only that it has to be done&mdash;and that it will be delivered in a fair, equitable and reasonable manner having due regard to the needs of the people in the state of Queensland.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue a debate that I have been having with the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone. In fact, last week in this place, I raised the issue of figures that were used in the 1996 higher education budget statement to justify HECS increases by the coalition government. The coalition presented a higher education budget which, according to the estimates committee hearings of the Senate, demands that students contribute up to as much as 60 per cent&mdash;potentially 80 per cent in some cases&mdash;of their course costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Examples from the government's higher education statement actually can include courses such as law and medicine&mdash;those courses in the highest band. So, contrary to evidence presented by the minister, we actually have the potential for course costs for individual student contributions in this country to be among the highest in the world&mdash;certainly the highest in the Western World, if not the highest in the world after Korea. I presented that evidence last week.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5044">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that we seem to have been embroiled in&mdash;both in question time today and last week and on the adjournment debate last Thursday&mdash;is the OECD figures that I used to demonstrate that the minister had been using rubbery figures. She had been using incorrect statistics to prove her case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senate question time today, the minister actually conceded that the position the Australian Democrats put to the chamber last week was in fact correct and that the OECD statistics she used in the 1996 higher education budget statement were wrong. The figures in question were actually used in section 2 of the budget statement, entitled `Fair balance between public and private funding'. Page 8 of the budget statement claimed that the average proportion of 23 per cent&mdash;that is, 23 per cent of individual course contributions&mdash;is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . substantially lower than the rate of private contribution to higher education in a number of comparable countries. For example, recent OECD statistics show that on average students in the United States contribute around half of the cost of their course, while Japanese students around 60 per cent and students in Denmark contribute 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>So an OECD table claiming that Danish students contributed 40 per cent of the cost of their education was used to justify this government's decision to increase course costs. The OECD report in question, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education at a Glance</EMPHASIS> , actually states on page 108:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The private shares of final education expenditures are higher than the initial shares because the former reflect funds that are transferred to as well as generated in the private sector; the former are found mainly in the forms of scholarships and other subsidies for students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The private shares of expenditures (for all levels of education combined) after transfers range from 7.0 per cent in Canada to 8.8 per cent in France to over 24% in both the United States and Japan. The Nordic Countries, the Netherlands and Australia have very small initial private shares, but substantial private shares after transfers.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final private shares of tertiary spending are sharply higher than initial private shares in most cases. For example, the initial and final private shares in Denmark are 1.2% and 37.9%, respectively. The differences are accounted for by public subsidies to students or households. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>Those figures are 1.2 per cent and 37.9 per cent respectively. Yet the coalition and the minister in their budget statement chose only to quote the 40 per cent figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since my question last week in this place, and after the OECD actually informed the minister's department that they are not even going to use this table in future publications, the minister has admitted both in an adjournment debate last week and in question time today that her higher education budget statement relied on `messy statistics'. Today in Senate question time, Minister Vanstone conceded that the figures for Denmark, Japan and the United States were all invalid. So this issue has now been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But one issue remains. These figures were used by the government, contrary to the minister's claims in here today, to justify the government's policy changes in relation to higher education&mdash;in particular, the increase in HECS and other fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw on the relevant section of the government's budget statement, `Fair balance between public and private funding', which I previously referred to&mdash;that is, section 2. On the same page as the OECD figures I previously quoted, the statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is clear that the private benefits of university graduation are substantially greater than the notional level implied by . . . HECS.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the minister said today in this place that the OECD figures were not used to justify the HECS increases. This quote indicates that the coalition believed the current levels to be notional&mdash;an assertion that many potential students would, I suspect, agree with, especially those students who have decided not to continue or enter higher education as a result of this government's prohibitive course cost changes. I am sure those people would dispute the idea that they are notional charges, despite the minister's claim today in this place. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government therefore believes that a higher level of HECS charge is justified.</PARA>
<PARA>The second quote from there states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also believes that, in setting the level of the HECS charge, consideration should be given to both the actual cost of the course under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5045"> taken and the likely future benefits to the individual in terms of increased life&hyphen;time earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from page 8 of the budget statement. It clearly refers to the OECD statistics as being a justification for course cost increases. The coalition has indeed used rubbery figures as a basis to turn Australia into the most expensive place to undertake public university and higher education. The fact that they used messy statistics is of little comfort to those many university aspirants and students at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats did not accept the minister's figures at the time. We did not accept her figures in the budget. We did not accept her explanation or justification last week. Nor do we accept this government's policy change to increase HECS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that the minister and this government&mdash;and in fact the OECD&mdash;seem to have discarded these figures, we are arguing that the HECS charges and the other regressive budget policy measures in relation to higher education should similarly be discarded. I look forward to the minister's response on this evidence that I think is pretty irrefutable.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to speak regarding two matters&mdash;one is a celebration; the other one, unfortunately, could well be an impending devastation. I want to speak about the community of Helensburgh, a town situated south of Sydney in the Royal National Park. Helensburgh has been a very close&hyphen;knit community for well over 100 years. It has the distinction of being one of the few areas within the Royal National Park where persons are permitted to live. As I said, it has been a very close&hyphen;knit community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 9 November this year, the Helensburgh Workmen's Club will celebrate its 100th anniversary. The workers club was first formed at a meeting of a group of miners back in November 1896. The miners met to establish the club because they resented the attitude of the publicans who ran the local hotels at the time. As a result of that meeting they resolved to establish the Helensburgh and Lilyvale Workmen's Club and Mutual <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> School of Arts. I am advised that in present day currency, the entrance fee was 25c, with a quarterly subscription of 12c. Obviously, if you paid by the year you got a discount. In its early days, the club struggled to compete against the local publicans. The miners, in the great tradition of mining workers of this country, banded together and kept the club going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also understand that the motto of the club in the early days of its existence was `Taste and try before you buy'. Apparently this was a reasonably cheap means of increasing the rather meagre revenue for the club. Within a 14&hyphen;month period in 1903&hyphen;1904, the committee of the workers club had written for and sampled, free of charge, no fewer than 11 different wines as well as a range of beers. If nothing else, the committee of the club at the time showed a great sense of ingenuity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The club was not only a place for a quiet drink and a chat with your mates but also a place where one could listen to lectures given by prominent members of the labour movement. I am reading from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Worker's Journal</EMPHASIS>. I am also advised that the great Australian poet and balladeer Henry Lawson was a regular visitor to and speaker at the club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The club has gone on to bigger and better things. Last Saturday extensions to the workers club at Helensburgh were opened by Gough Whitlam. When Gough Whitlam first entered parliament he was the member for Werriwa. In those days the seat of Werriwa stretched from about Wollongong in the south, from Cabramatta and the Liverpool area in the west, through to Cronulla on the coast. Helensburgh was one of the many areas in the electorate that had a strong Labor and union presence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was great to go down to Helensburgh on Saturday and see the people of the town taking pride in their history and in the important role that the workers club plays&mdash;like many other clubs in New South Wales and other states&mdash;in its local community. I was certainly very privileged to be there, not specifically as an official guest but rather as a person who has often visited that quiet lovely area within the national park. Sadly, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5046"> after the celebrations on Saturday, I paid a visit to a picket line at a Helensburgh colliery called the Metropolitan Colliery, which is run by the company Denehurst. The picket line was established by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union because of the impending closure of the colliery. It was sadly ironic that on the same day that we were celebrating the establishment of that club which was created by the miners, we also had this impending devastation facing the workers at the colliery and, indeed, the community. The colliery still employs about 150 workers and is an integral part of the work force of the township and, indeed, of the great history and tradition of this town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company Denehurst has placed the colliery into voluntary administration. I understand that a meeting will be held as early as tomorrow to determine the fate of the mine. Unfortunately, there is every prospect that the mine will be closed. I hope that does not happen. The community and, of course, the workers do not want that to happen. It will have some devastating consequences, not only on these workers' employment but also on a lot of other families and on the community that depends very much on the existence of this colliery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was appropriate that just before the adjournment debate we were debating the provisions of the workplace relations bill. The attitude adopted by the company on this issue has been nothing short of disgraceful. They had entered into an agreement with the miners federation not so long ago with respect to a continuation of the wages and working conditions, et cetera that applied at this site. As I understand it, they had also signed an agreement with respect to bonuses. Only a couple of weeks ago the union went in to negotiate with the mine management about the level of bonuses for the ensuing period. The response they got was, `There is no point talking to us now because we have just placed the mine in the hands of an administrator.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that it has been due to the very bad financial and planning management of the company that the colliery has reached this stage. The workers at Metropolitan Colliery have proved themselves amongst the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> best, if not the best, in terms of producing record tonnages of coal far exceeding the expectations of the colliery management and what those workers were told at the time was required in tonnages to ensure that the pit would remain profitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The workers have done their part to keep this colliery operating. There are still substantial recoverable resources of coal in the colliery. But, unfortunately, because of bad management, the company has got itself into a situation of debt and it appears that the ultimate losers will be the workers. If the mine is closed, 150 workers will be retrenched. Also it appears that there is no money available to pay out the retrenchment pay as well as long service leave, holiday pay and other considerations. Somewhere in the vicinity of $2.4 million would be owed to these workers if that sad situation were to eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just finish by saying that here we have an example of bad management and also an arrogant disregard by a company for the fate of its workers; workers who have not only worked in one of the most strenuous industries in this country but have also put a heck of a lot into a local community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to again draw the attention of the Senate to the matter of literacy in Australian schools and to the ongoing remarks of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to the effect that 30 per cent of Australian 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds lack basic literacy skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Senate will know, the data on which the minister so irresponsibly based his claims was not a literacy test at all. It was a small part of a 20&hyphen;year longitudinal study of the transition from school to work of a group of young Australians. Not only was the test irrelevant to the minister's claims, but the study is not due to be finished until next year. Even after this had been pointed out to the minister, he continued to accuse schools of hiding the data. He said parents were entitled to know their children did not have basic literacy skills. In short, he continued to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5047"> scaremonger, to put fear into the hearts of every parent with children in school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning we heard more of the story on Radio National. Commentator and journalist Brian Toohey was asked how he thought the minister would have handled the test himself. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The test is incredibly difficult and it is totally misleading to suggest that what most people would regard as lacking in basic literacy skills, was actually being tested here. For example, I think there's a strong suggestion that people can't get a job. Maybe when they're a storeman and packer they're told to go and get 12 boxes of Kelloggs and they come back with 12 boxes of Uncle Toby's or whatever. It's not testing that sort of thing, it's testing some very difficult questions about, in one case, a passage of writing about war which is really an extended metaphor.</PARA>
<PARA>Brian Toohey put the test to its author, Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  journalist Martin Flanagan. The test said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The story the writer tells us suggests the causes of war are often complex, invisible, justifiable or insignificant.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the question. Mr Flanagan answered with the word `complex'. That is what he meant to suggest when he wrote that piece. But the examiner, in this case, came up with quite a different answer. To get 100 per cent on this part of the test, the student had to say that the causes of war are often insignificant. Martin Flanagan says that is the last thing that he intended. But the very question and the use of the word `suggests' gives the game away. As Brian Toohey says, `It is not a matter of what the author said; it is a matter of what he was suggesting.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing unusual about this kind of test of comprehension. Such a test is meant to be difficult and to make students think. You might well argue that the examiner's interpretation was incorrect, but who knows? In tests of comprehension, the answers are very often not black and white. It is not like finding out if a student can read, where you can say he or she can recognise and read that word or sentence. Comprehension is an entirely different matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comprehension test, which the minister deliberately chooses to pass off as a test of literacy, is in fact a concept called mastery. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Back in 1975, when I understand the test was started, you had to get 80 per cent to pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will the minister now attempt to blame his advisers for this debacle? Mr Toohey offers the view&mdash;and I am very much inclined to agree&mdash;that the minister, who has a PhD from Yale University, should have known better. He says the minister has the gall to talk about 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old students failing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has been the instigator of a beat&hyphen;up of the most appalling sort: `shock findings', `alarming' and `a major cause of Australia's high youth unemployment'. As Mr Toohey points out, shock findings are not the cause of anything and they are certainly not the cause of youth unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the problem of literacy that schools and teachers in this country are dealing with? I do not say it is not a problem. But I think it is extremely unlikely that the problem is worse now than it has been in the past, and there is plenty of evidence to show that literacy levels have improved over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister were not in such a hurry to make these alarmist pronouncements, we might be in a better position, if we have a problem, to understand its extent and how it might be addressed. The minister is well aware that we are now in the middle of the national survey of literacy. This survey was designed to provide the minister with just the sort of information that he says he needs to form policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning Senator Vanstone changed the government's tack somewhat. She now claims that there have been no improvements in literacy skills over the past 30 years. This leads me to wonder what sort of research the minister now draws upon to reach this latest conclusion. It falls a long way short of an apology and it certainly does not repair the damage that has been already done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us return to the government's commitment to literacy in this country. The Senate will have seen the budget papers and seen that $45 million is to be provided by the federal government for a literacy program. The government is making much of this commitment. I need to point out, however, that this $45 million works out to be about $5 per student per annum. I sincerely hope that this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5048"> amount will be useful but I suggest that we should not hold out too much hope. There is one truth about literacy; that is, that there is no simple answer to the question of how children best learn to read and write. In any case, it is not all that we expect them to be able to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Undoubtedly there are students who are not literate when they leave primary school. I have taught some of these children. There are very complex reasons for their failure to grasp what their peers do with some ease. If the answer was as simple as to reschedule more English classes, doesn't the minister think that schools would simply do this? Why some children do not learn to read as well as others is a complex question&mdash;and so is the remedy. You cannot force children to learn and you cannot force them to value knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that some parents read to their children from infancy and provide them with books&mdash;and others do not? Why is it that even this is not an absolute indicator of literacy levels in school? It would make much more sense for the government to stop making these wild pronouncements, to stop bashing teachers and schools, to stop alarming parents with such outrageous claims and to work towards the common goal of improving educational opportunities and improving outcomes for our students.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) A number of logging history maps have been used during the RFA and CRA processes. The primary information used has been that published by Woodgate et al (1994) in the report on the survey of Old&hyphen;growth forests East Gippsland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Department of Health and Family Services has received reports of four overhead tobacco advertising signs remaining after the event. Although the signs had been covered with a thin layer of whitewash, the signs were still visible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption period which was specified in the gazette notice of 21 September 1995, permitted signs to remain in place for seven days after the event. In effect, the signs were visible only for three days past the exemption date.</PARA>
