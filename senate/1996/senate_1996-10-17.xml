<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Saturday, 12 October 1996, of the Hon. Rendle McNeilage (Mac) Holten CMG, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Indi, Victoria, from 1958 to 1977; Minister for Repatriation from 1969 to 1972; and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry from 1971 to 1972; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Mac Holten was born on 29 March 1922 and was educated at Scotch College in Melbourne. At the age of 19 Mac enlisted in the RAAF, serving as a flying instructor and test pilot until 1946, when he left the air force with the rank of Flight Lieutenant. Mac was a retail grocer before entering federal politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1958 when he won the Victorian seat of Indi for the Country Party. In his maiden speech to the parliament he reflected on his wide-ranging concerns, from education and the importance of research, to assistance for home ownership, to the difficulties faced by primary producers and industries, to foreign policy where he perceived that Australia's traditional ties with Britain and the United States must be juxtaposed with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its geographical location in Asia&mdash;issues that are as relevant today as they were then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During his 19 years in this parliament, Mac contributed actively to the work of a number of parliamentary committees. He served on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1962 to 1966, the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works from 1967 to 1969, and the House Committee from 1974 to 1977. He was Minister for Repatriation from 1969 to 1972, and from 1971 to 1972 was also Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac's public service did not cease after his departure from federal politics. In 1980 he was appointed Administrator of the Territory of Christmas Island. In that same year, he was appointed a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George, CMG, for his parliamentary and community service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be sadly missed by those of us who knew him as a colleague and as a friend and, I should say, from my own experience of him, as a very good footballer and as a very good representative of the north-east of Victoria. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Shirley, and his children, Diana, Carolyn and Debbie, and their families our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition and opposition senators, I support the condolence motion that has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Alston). We express our regret at the death of Mac Holten, a former Country Party minister in the House of Representatives. The opposition offers its sincere condolences to Mac Holten's family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Alston has indicated, Mac Holten was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Indi, in Victoria, in 1958 and he held that seat for nearly 20 years. He had a parliamentary career that was very meritorious indeed. He really did devote those two decades of his life to serving the people of Indi, to representing them very effectively here in the parliament and making sure that Canberra heard of their concerns.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> During his time in government, he served as the Minister for Repatriation from 1969 until 1972, and as Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry from 1971 until 1972. He also served the parliament well and effectively in a significant number of parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In 1980, as we have heard, he was appointed as the Administrator of Christmas Island and served in that role for a couple of years. He played a major role in encouraging local participation in island affairs. During my time as Minister for Sport and Territories, I heard of the contribution that he made while he undertook those important responsibilities at Christmas Island. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, I offer our most sincere sympathy and condolences to Mac Holten's family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.37 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the National Party in the Senate, I rise to support the condolence motion moved by Senator Alston on behalf of the government for the former Country Party House of Representatives member, the Hon. Rendle Holten, who passed away last week after suffering a severe illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Mac Holten epitomised the all-round Australian achiever: great sportsman, successful small business operator, World War II test pilot, federal parliamentarian and minister, and respected community leader. The National Party is very proud to claim him as one of our most successful and effective representatives during his 19 years in federal parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac Holten was born on 29 March 1922 and was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne. He was an immensely talented footballer. I know Senator Alston would be interested in this. He had an 80&hyphen;game career with Collingwood and went on to coach the Magpies to a record four consecutive premierships. He was also a talented cricketer, playing at district level with the Melbourne Cricket Club and was heavily involved in local cricket, focusing on junior development. Mac's sporting career was interrupted by the outset of the Second World War, which saw <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4346"> him serve as a flying instructor and test pilot from 1941 to 1946.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After relocating to Wangaratta in 1949 he ran a successful retail grocery business. His business expertise was soon recognised by his peers when he served as President of the Wangaratta Chamber of Commerce until entering parliament in 1958, winning the seat of Indi for the then Australian Country Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his first speech he foreshadowed some of the policy areas that he intended to pursue: primary industry, decentralisation, trade and education. He highlighted the great necessity of higher and technical education for all school leavers, the need for the government to facilitate the development of inland centres and the difficulties that were being faced by the dairy and wool industries at that time. He spoke prophetically of the need for stimulating reciprocal trade activities with the South East Asian nations, particularly the large market of Indonesia, an approach that he was later to pursue in his role of Assistant Trade Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac Holten was an extremely hardworking and effective repatriation minister during the Gorton government. He was a staunch advocate for the veteran community and endeavoured to introduce constructive measures to improve their lives and those of their families. Key legislative initiatives he oversaw included removing the remaining discriminatory limitation for compensation benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, providing guide dogs for blind veterans as part of their rehabilitation treatment, increasing living allowances under the soldiers' children education scheme, which provided education assistance for children of deceased, blinded or disabled servicemen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Assistant Trade Minister from 1971 to 1972, Mac Holten diligently pursued trade opportunities in South East Asia on behalf of Australian business. His parliamentary committee work included serving on the Joint Foreign Affairs Committee from 1962 to 1966, the Joint Public Works Committee from 1967 to 1969 and the House of Representatives Standing Committee from 1974 to 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After an unexpected defeat in the 1977 election, Mac Holten was called on to make <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a further public contribution to serve as the administrator of Christmas Island from 1980 to 1982. He was highly praised for his role in facilitating the move toward increased local participation in island affairs during the time of his administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac Holten was an outstanding Australian who made a huge contribution to Australian public life both in times of war and peace, from the elevated heights of a federal minister to the grassroots community level. I know that he will be sadly missed by all who knew him, particularly by his former colleagues in the National Party. On behalf of the National Party in the Senate I extend to his wife Shirley and his three daughters our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell, my colleague, is quite right to say that Mr Holten made an immense contribution to this nation both in times of peace and in times of war. But it is sometimes too easy for us just to look at the bare facts of a person's parliamentary career without ever looking at the character of the person in question, especially those of us who have not shared parliamentary service with the person in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking to one of the late Mr Holten's parliamentary colleagues from the other place this morning. He told me about the time he attended his first question time as a minister, immensely fearful that he was going to get asked a question which he would not be able to answer. He was sitting next to Mac Holten. Mac Holten, to keep him calm and relaxed during question time, proceeded to tell him jokes because apparently Mac was a great yarner in the country tradition and a great joke teller.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mac had just finished telling this tale about dad and Dave when the minister was asked a question by somebody on the other side. So he went up to the dispatch box and said: `Mr Speaker, I was wondering if the honourable member opposite could repeat the question because I did not hear it. Mr Holten had just told me a dirty joke.' The Speaker said: `Look, you are not here to tell jokes or listen to them; you are here to answer questions. So get on with it.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4347">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that was the nature of Mac Holten. He was a great character, a great yarner and a great story teller. But, more than that, he was the epitome of a great Australian. He was a great sportsman, captain coach for Collingwood and a fearless, brave and dedicated Hurricane pilot in the Second World War. It is sobering for us to think of men like Mac Holten and others who have helped forge the character of our nation and to ask whether we who are here today can contribute as much or are as deserving of the legacy that they leave. I think that is the most important thing we consider today&mdash;that we make ourselves worthy of the legacy of those who have gone before.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be agreeing with this motion. I think we need to state a few matters so that they are clearly on the record. When this matter was presented to the Selection of Bills Committee, a report came back to this chamber concerning the reporting date. It was originally proposed by me, in terms of the reference of this very important bill, that the reporting date be 28 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received assurances from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that the committee ought to be able to extend the amended date if it could be found that that reporting date could not be accommodated within the program of the committee or the program of the chamber. It was clear to me at that time that the proposal could not and would not work because it would not be possible to do justice to the issues involved in the inquiry in that time and, given the sitting patterns established by this chamber, that it would not be possible to report within that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to emphasise just how important this inquiry is. It will involve the expenditure of some $14 billion. It goes to a matter whereby the government will be introducing probably the most radical change in education policy in 30 years&mdash;that is, its plan to abolish the new schools policy. It will see an extraordinarily radical shift in the allocation of resources between the public and private education sectors in this country. It will involve very significant changes to targeted education programs. It will quite adversely affect a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> number of states, particularly my own, where in recent times we have seen substantial attacks upon the education system by the Kennett government, which to some extent have been alleviated by the actions of the federal Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under these proposals that protection will be lifted. We will see a dramatic movement in funds from the state education system to the private education system and, in particular, a shift of funds to Queensland where it just so happens that there are a very large number of marginal seats. We will see the introduction of a new allocation mechanism for the distribution of public moneys to the private sector on a basis which I believe has not been subjected to proper scrutiny by this parliament or by the education community at large. In the estimates process we have already seen revealed the fact that the department has not given adequate consideration to the technical issues involved in the distribution of moneys from the targeted educational programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just state systems that will be adversely affected in my state as a result of these changes; the Catholic education system will be affected as well. It is not just public schools but Catholic schools as well which will see a dramatic shift in resources to private schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we put that on top of the proposed changes to this government's deregulated new schools policy where we will see significant changes introduced which will mean the removal of minimum requirements for enrolments, a shift in the categories that can be used for the allocation of moneys and the removal of any commitment to proper planning in the allocation of schools in any particular district, we can see that all those elements combined produce an emerging pattern which we have already seen in other areas of the education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee proposes to speak with some very important witnesses and it will be calling for public submissions; the advertisements will appear in the press this weekend. Therefore, to suggest that this matter could have been dealt with as originally presented to this chamber by the Selection of Bills Committee, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4357"> and which has now obviously had to be amended by Senator Tierney's motion, demonstrates to me yet again that this government ought to be managing its affairs a lot better than it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will not even be in this chamber until early November at the very best of reckonings. Frankly, I wonder whether it will be here then. The proposition that the reporting date be 14 November is totally inappropriate in the circumstances. As a consequence, the opposition welcomes Senator Tierney's motion today for an extension of time for the committee to report on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill. For the future, I would ask that proper consideration be given to these matters beforehand, that there be adequate consultation with the opposition and that our advice, when it is sought, be acted upon.</PARA>

<ROLE>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE>
<TIME.STAMP>(10.13 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition has indicated to the government that it will be supporting the government's proposals in relation to sitting days. It is an unusual circumstance to have the parliament sit for four straight weeks. The opposition have waited until this week, until the government finalised its proposals to the Senate on what sitting weeks were appropriate for this calendar year. The opposition, in order to assist the government with the facilitation of its legislative program, has proposed that two sitting Fridays be added to the government's announced program, and that a further two Fridays&mdash;29 November and 13 December&mdash;also be agreed to as a result of this particular motion standing in the name of Senator Campbell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also indicate that the opposition proposed to the government, and the government accepted, that, because of the number of speakers on the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Senate sit through to midnight on the Tuesday of the past sitting week. The government agreed that that was a sensible course of action, given the interest in the workplace relations bill second reading debate&mdash;a debate which concluded yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that, for the opposition's part, we did indicate that we would support the government's proposal. Originally the government had suggested three sitting weeks to conclude our sittings for this year. I think it is fair to say that the government wanted to review this situation, given that the visit of the President of the United States has been confirmed and there is a proposal for a joint sitting of the houses of parliament on 20 November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has come back with this proposition that the parliament sit from Monday, 18 November right through to Friday, 13 December. The opposition does not oppose this. I am pleased to see that Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4359"> Hill, in his brief contribution, acknowledged that that was the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on record that it is rather a unique situation in recent years in this parliament to have an opposition agreeing to such lengthy parliamentary sittings. I think this does reflect the fact that this opposition always accepts that we are not only an opposition but also an alternative government. We do understand that there are significant responsibilities in the Senate to allow a government's reasonable legislative program to be presented and dealt with by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unusual to see the opposition in the Senate take this course of action, because over the last few years the coalition, in opposition, at every turn tried to stymie and obstruct the former Labor administration in its attempts to see its legislative program dealt with in a proper way. I do appreciate that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, has acknowledged that the opposition has been very cooperative in this regard. We will continue to ensure that we fulfil our responsibilities to the parliament while we are progressing issues of ministerial accountability and other issues of great importance in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also be ensuring that the government does have an opportunity to see its legislative program dealt with. To that end, the Leader of the Government in the Senate has indicated that the government will be taking a more realistic approach to those bills that are on the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I acknowledge that sensible efforts have been made to try and reduce the Senate's workload for this calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said in a meeting that was convened by Senator Hill earlier in the week that I thought that the government's latest proposals were far more realistic. We argue in the Labor Party that one of the real values of motions like this is to give all senators some certainty about what the sitting times of the Senate are going to be. While this is going to be a long, hard road&mdash;particularly the four straight sitting weeks&mdash;at least we now have a situation where senators can plan outside those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sitting weeks and do have an understanding of what the constraints are going to be on their time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am looking forward to all the question times that this involves. As I add them up, there is a total of 15 question times over that four&hyphen;week period. On the rate of ministerial and parliamentary secretary resignations we have had in question time this week, that means that there will probably be a further eight scalps hanging off the opposition's belt.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Margetts moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 245.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as I was aware, the Australian Labor Party was going to support this motion. It is only now that I have discovered that Labor are not supporting it. The government indicated that they would support the motion being declared formal but would vote against the motion. This is the first time I have heard that Labor are not supporting the motion. So it is unfortunate that the indications now being given are different to those given in the whips' meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The urgency today of the motion is Australia's international reputation involving general maritime safety in the transportation of live sheep&mdash;an issue the general community feel should be addressed urgently. The world would not fall apart if this motion were agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion states that there was to be a march to coincide with a London based protest by the group Compassion in World Farming and a statement regarding the number of sheep annually exported. There was nothing particularly controversial about the second call for action involving an investigation. This matter is urgent because we cannot allow these kinds of incidents to continue. There is nothing terribly controversial in these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am merely disappointed about the way things have happened today. I understood that there would be objection to the motion being declared formal, but I also understood that the Senate would support the motion. Unfortunately, Labor have sent me mixed signals in this regard. However, in a last ditch attempt to have the motion agreed to, I would ask the Senate to support this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The world will not end if we find out why this incident involving the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> happened. The world will not end if we instigate measures to try to prevent such an incident happening again involving large numbers of sheep and personnel in such marine disasters of ships sinking in and around Australia or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4361"> anywhere else. I think it is urgent that we deal with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to think that the decisions made during the whips' meetings are not reversed at the last minute. It may be that I have a mistaken belief concerning the agreements reached. This matter was raised several days ago and I was under the impression that we had been given assurances by Labor that there were no problems with this motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the world will not fall apart if it is supported. It is not an anti&hyphen;farmers move. It is not an anti&hyphen;agriculture move. It is aimed at ensuring that Australia's reputation is what it should be. That is why it is urgent that the motion get support in the Senate to ensure that a reasonable attitude is adopted both now and in the future on this issue.

If I recollect correctly, unlike New Zealand, we do not have rules in place to ensure surveillance by professional veterinary officers over the conditions of the animals aboard these ships. Whatever the case, even without this disaster, we know that some 50,000 to 100,000 live sheep die in transit on the oceans out of this country every year, and that is a matter of very serious concern.

In fact, we will be supporting the opposition to this motion by the government. But it is important, particularly as recent events have indicated, that the position of the opposition on this issue not be misconstrued. I am not suggesting that Senator Brown would be crass enough to do this, but I thought there was some danger, when we do support the government on this issue, as we will, that a press statement might be issued saying that the opposition has got absolutely no concern about animal welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I am not going to delay the chamber for any longer than is necessary. This issue obviously concerns a great many people in the community. It is one of those issues where people who see you walking along the street or people you meet who know you are a Green will ask you, `What are you doing about the live sheep trade?' There is a lot of concern about it. It is not an anti&hyphen;employment issue. As Senator Woodley has indicated, there is an issue of value adding in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The latest thing I heard on the media the other day was that, although it is obvious that sheep can be killed in an approved manner in Australia with proper ceremonies, there is preference for freshness. One might say that that is a preference, and it is a market preference, but there are perhaps other good reasons why Australian value adding ought to be looked at in a different way. Why is Australian killed meat not considered acceptable? Perhaps we ought to look at that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many issues here. Calling on the government to investigate sinking would not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4364"> seem to me to be such an odd thing to do. If there has been an investigation into the sinking, perhaps the government could alleviate our concerns and present to us the outcome of that investigation. If an aircraft, a passenger ship or a ferry went down with a loss of lives, there would obviously be an investigation. So instigating an investigation or providing a report to the Senate as to what happened and why does not actually seem to me to be an unreasonable thing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about implementing measures to prevent a similar disaster from occurring again? It could be a case of, `Oh, well, these things happen; we have done the best we can.' But if it could be suggested that the standard of the ship was such that it was an accident waiting to happen, it is something for all of us to be concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had debates in this House on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report and what we ought to be doing and what standards are reached. If standards are not being reached and if one of the outcomes is that the live sheep trade is a result of part of this kind of shameful shipping standard system, maybe in crews, in standards, or in the safety of the ships, then perhaps it is something we ought to be talking about, instead of pretending it is not happening or that it is simply an issue of protecting the agricultural industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have stood up here on many occasions talking about appropriate regional development and what we can be doing to meet the employment and other needs in regional areas. I am certainly in favour of making sure that regions do remain viable and have the means to remain viable. However, I do not think we are protecting anybody if we refuse to look at these issues. If we assume that everything that can possibly be done is being done, I do not think we are being serious about this. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if asking a simple question to get a report on an incident is considered to be outlandish, perhaps in the future we might ask for a review, which will obviously take more time. However, parliamentary inquiries&mdash;especially Senate inquiries&mdash;are very cost effective. Perhaps we could look at that option. For the government to suggest that what we are asking for is unreasonable is a bit difficult, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> considering that during the debate, I said to the government, `Come back to us with a form of wording. Say what you think is reasonable and we will listen to it.' But we have heard nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had this kind of response today: `The problem does not exist. Everything is terrific. There is no problem with the safety of ships carrying sheep. There is no problem with the amount of deaths occurring. There is no problem with the way sheep are carried.' That is putting your head in the sand. It is time to start looking at these issues more carefully and to at least start admitting that there is a responsibility for governments to keep up their international reputation on these issues. Therefore I would seek support on the substantive motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

I want to just mention a couple of points that Senator Margetts has brought up about the animal welfare aspects of the trade. Yes, everyone is very concerned about animal welfare, wherever they happen to be. It was the previous government that established the National Consultative Committee on Animal Welfare. That committee is still in operation and will continue to be in operation. So that looks after those aspects of animal welfare.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just make a couple of statements about the motion. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> is a live sheep vessel that sunk in the Indian Ocean at the end of August. The ship was carrying 67,500 sheep, destined for Aqaba in Jordan. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> had passed an Australian safety inspection and was inspected for animal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4365"> welfare conditions immediately before its last voyage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> was registered in Panama and owned by an Italian group. Under the International Convention for the Safety of Ships at Sea, the authority and responsibility for undertaking investigations into the sinking of vessels lies with the country of the flag registry. Australia has no rights under the international convention either to participate in that investigation or, if we were to initiate our own investigation, to require the cooperation of the flag registry, the underwriters or the owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, has undertaken that, should the report of the Panamanian investigation point to any failures on the part of the Australian shippers or any others, the matter will be thoroughly investigated and appropriate action taken. The minister has met with both the RSPCA and the Australian and New Zealand Federation of Animal Societies to discuss the incident and also ways and means of improving animal welfare conditions on livestock export vessels. Both the RSPCA and ANZFAS have agreed to work with the minister in addressing issues of concern. Both groups have prepared submissions which are under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one could be unmoved by the suffering involved in the death of the ship's engineer, as well as so many thousands of animals. Nonetheless, we do not believe it is a productive use of the Senate's time to debate the motion which we are now debating. I seek leave to have two documents incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. One is about the live sheep trade and the other gives full details of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> incident. I think they have been incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> during another debate in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The documents read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LIVE SHEEP CARRIER `UNICEB'&mdash;INDIAN OCEAN INCIDENT</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fire broke out on Saturday 31 August in the engine room of the Italian owned (Sistren Services), Panama flagged, live sheep vessel `Uniceb' which is chartered to exporters Wellards. The vessel left Fremantle on 23 August carrying 67,500 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sheep bound for the Red Sea port of Aqaba in Jordan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most reports indicate that the fire broke out on either Saturday 31 August or Sunday 1 September, but this is yet to be verified. It is most likely the ship was 900&hyphen;1000 miles north&hyphen;east of Seychelles when the fire broke out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears the fire commenced in the engine room and spread rapidly to accommodation areas above causing the crew to abandon ship. The ship's engineer was lost overboard during this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The crew later reboarded the ship and endeavoured to fight the fire, but were driven off by heat and smoke. They then drifted in life rafts for 20 hours or more until picked up by a passing ship the `Mineral Century' on Monday 2 September. (This vessel arrived in Suez on Tuesday 10 September.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not aware of any radio, phone or beacon contact during the fire. Upon hearing of the fire by radio from the rescue vessel on the Monday, the Italian owners dispatched on Tuesday a fire fighting tug from Djibouti to the vessel in salvage/rescue attempt. The owners also on Tuesday diverted the `Cormo Express' to the scene. This vessel had just completed unloading sheep in Karachi.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the salvage tug and the `Cormo Express' arrived at the point of last sighting on  Friday 6 September. A US military aircraft also participated in the search on either the Friday afternoon or Saturday covering approximately 200 sq miles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the Tuesday 10 September reports confirmed that debris consistent with the sinking of the `Uniceb' had been sighted floating in the vicinity and it was concluded that the ship had sunk. The search mission was then called off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ship's charterers, Wellard Rural Exports, believed the ship sank soon after the fire began. This is based on the fact that two explosions were heard by the crew drifting in lifeboats after they were forced to abandon the ship and that, in the period between the ship being abandoned and the sighting of the debris, there were no reports of a ship on fire in a major shipping lane into Suez and the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the International Convention of Safety of Life at Sea, the flag registry, in this case Panama, is required to undertake an inquiry. This is now being conducted by the Panama representative in Bombay and is expected to take some months. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has contacted the Panamanian authorities noting the implications for Australia and requesting a copy of the report of the inquiry into the incident. Further action by Australian authorities will be decided in the light of the report of the Panamanian inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  (6/9/96), the Maritime Union of Australia alleged that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4366"> Uniceb had left port hurriedly before the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) could investigate International Transport Workers' Federation concerns about conditions for the crew and stock on board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA has confirmed that allegations were made about unsatisfactory conditions on the vessel. These related to operation of the crew accommodation air conditioning system, incorrectly flushing toilets and suspect drinking water quality. AMSA has confirmed it investigated the claims and in relation to the toilets and drinking water found them to be without substance. AMSA also was satisfied with the outcome of discussions with the ship's engineer regarding air conditioning in the crew's accommodation. AMSA reported there were no problems with the animal accommodation and that the ship had passed inspection in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control and the Marine Orders. The `Uniceb' had a track record as a good, reliable vessel meeting all AMSA standards.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THE TRADE</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trade to the Middle East began in the 1960s and, with the advent of larger and more technically advanced vessels, expanded rapidly to meet strong growth in demand in the region for freshly killed meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Last year Australia exported some 5.5 million sheep worth around $207 million. Figures to end June 1996 are currently running at the same levels as last year. The Middle East is the primary destination for shipments (99%) with the UAE and Jordan the single largest importing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. There are currently 25 licensed livestock exporters and 63 importers in 29 countries of Australian sheep. The majority of animals used in the trade are sourced from producers in WA, SA, VIC, and southern NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. While there was an increase in the carcass trade following the halting of live exports to Saudi Arabia in 1991, it should be noted that there was a corresponding significant increase in live exports to neighbouring countries in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The AMLC estimates that, at a minimum, 800,000 Australian live sheep are exported each year to other Middle Eastern countries, particularly UAE and Qatar, and then slaughtered and exported to Saudi Arabia as sheep meat. The UAE has undergone sustained growth since 1990, becoming Australia's second largest market for live sheep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. This points to the fact that a number of countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, retain a strong preference for freshly killed meat which can only be met by the live animal trade. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The AMLC maintains a regular promotional program to encourage increased consumption of chilled and frozen sheep meat. Through its overseas offices in key markets the ALMA promotes the trade through a comprehensive program of consumer and trade advertising and sales promotion backed up by a technical support service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The advertising strategy focuses on newspapers and magazines portraying Australian sheep meat as high quality and produced by a professional industry. General merchandising and point&hyphen;of&hyphen;sale material is also provided to stores carrying Australian sheep meat to differentiate the product from competitors. The AMLC technical officers advise retailers and consumers on the characteristics and specifications of Australian meat and conducts butcher training programs on handling, preparation and presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The AMLC's efforts to promote sheep meat consumption also extend to regularly contacting government officials, importers and agents to maintain Australia's reputation as a supplier of high quality and safe product and reassure them, where appropriate, of the integrity of our export certification system.</PARA>
<PARA>Everything has been done that can be done by the government of this country. I was also a part of the live sheep export inquiry undertaken by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. I believe that everything which was put in place by that inquiry has been adhered to. We are wasting a lot of time in the Senate debating something that was discussed in a previous agenda item last Thursday in this very place.</PARA></SPEECH>

The other reason it is important to put some things on the record in this debate is that animal welfare issues are not the only issue of controversy attached to the live animal trade. Indeed, Senator Margetts herself has raised the second of those issues in the debate here this morning, and that is the important question of value adding&mdash;in other words, the benefit to Australia of having all of the processing of these animals here in this country and exporting chilled or frozen meat rather than live animals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. That is something again that I want to put on the record&mdash;I am sure the government would have this position as well&mdash;as an important consideration. We would want to see that happen to the maximum extent possible. For that reason, it is important that the particular trades involved be constantly examined for that value adding aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The third point that needs to be made is that we are debating this morning a motion that is about the live sheep trade but, as we all know, the debate at large is about the trade in live animals. It extends to live cattle as well, because that group of people who want to shut down this trade also want to shut down the trade in live cattle. That is a matter of public record and, of course, they are entitled to that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Margetts correctly referred to this morning, live cattle exports are important for regional Australia. That is why it is important for me, not simply as the shadow minister for primary industries but as a Northern Territory senator, to again put our view on this issue on the record. Some $160 million in trade might not be huge bickies for Australia in the global economic picture but it is absolutely crucial in terms of the regional economy that generates that trade. I am talking about the live cattle trade from northern Australia into principally countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three or four years that trade has grown from $20 million or $30 million a year to currently $130 million or $140 million a year and it is going up. The animal welfare nature of that trade is excellent. I say that because I have personally been on board the ships and inspected the conditions under which those cattle are exported. I can say categorically from personal experience that, in welfare terms, conditions on board the ships are significantly better than the conditions in the paddocks from which a lot of these animals come. There is ample space, scrupulously clean conditions, plenty of room for each individual animal&mdash;</PARA>

It is ingenuous in the extreme to suggest that the debate proper is only about live sheep. As you know, it is not. I have said that you are entitled to support that view. The people who want to see this trade ceased are not simply concerned about live sheep; they are concerned&mdash;and I am sorry that I have to say this again in response to the interjection&mdash;about live cattle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. It is important that that particularly relevant issue is also canvassed in this debate. The point about value adding which Senator Margetts made this morning also applies to the live cattle trade. The AMLC is, along with the industry itself, doing a great deal to continually improve the acceptability and market demand for our chilled and frozen mutton, lamb and beef. It has been a mark of the live trade that those countries that are taking our live exports are also taking a continually increasing amount of our chilled and frozen product as the ability to buy continually improves and as the tastes of people in those countries changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4368">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also a number of aspects of the trade&mdash;which Senator Margetts might find interesting if she is not familiar with them; and she may be&mdash;that make it very unique. Senator Margetts mentioned this morning the requirement in some of these countries for fresh meat. There is no question about that. In other words, for cultural and all sorts of other reasons there is a preference on the part of the customers to not have chilled or frozen meat. The customers may prefer meat that has been freshly prepared rather than slaughtered and dressed out weeks or even months before and chilled or frozen.It is a fact that that is changing and there is a growing demand for chilled and frozen product. This is growing at the same time as our live export trade is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another matter that has to be raised in this regard. In some of the countries into which we are exporting live product there is a substantial lack of transport infrastructure and chiller infrastructure. In other words, the infrastructure that allows chilled and frozen product to be moved in that condition from the wharf to a central facility and then to the consumer does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point because a lot of people even in the Northern Territory are not aware that, with respect to that live trade, other important services are provided to the rural communities in those countries to which we export the live product. A lot of people who are aware that the trade exists do not realise this happens. Cattle are exported from the port of Darwin to our near neighbours and are bought by a central agency. The cattle are then farmed out in small lots&mdash;two or three animals&mdash;to villages and individual families. It was when I saw this happening that I realised the important structural implications and why I am confident that trade has a long future ahead of it&mdash;and I note Senator Crane is nodding his head.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Correct. Individual families look after these animals and fatten them up for six months or, in some cases, 12 months. The grandparents and children feed them from the smallholdings on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which they are raised. They have an arrangement with the central supplier that allows them to participate in the profit when the animal is sold after it has been freshly slaughtered. There is a great lack of chiller infrastructure for frozen or chilled product to go overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason I labour this point, and it is an important point from our point of view, is that it is true that there is a lot of union concern, and quite understandable union concern.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know you are supporting me, Senator. A very legitimate concern is that we are exporting jobs with that trade and that the animals should be slaughtered here with Australian meatworks doing it. If that was actually happening to any great degree, I would be as concerned about that as everybody else, but when you see the kind of trade we are talking about you realise there are aspects of the trade which means that this is not happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The encouraging thing is&mdash;I am pleased Senator Crane supported me in this contention just a few minutes ago&mdash;that whilst we are continuing to put a live product into these markets, at the same time there is a clearly measurable increase in the amount of chilled and frozen products that are going into the same market. The Australian product generally has a reputation for quality, and the tastes of those markets are changing. People are buying Australian chilled and frozen products rather than somebody else's. The live trade helps that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is important to put on the record, as Senator Margetts has properly raised it, that this is not, in real terms, a market that is robbing Australia of jobs. It is a vitally important market for regional Australia. In the case of the live cattle trade from the Northern Territory, I have to say to Senator Margetts that over the last three or four years, with desperately bad drought conditions and a collapse in the price, it has been a market that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4369"> has essentially saved the cattle industry in northern Australia&mdash;I might add, not only in the Northern Territory but particularly in Queensland, where many of the cattle for this live trade come from.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Crane, for making that point. That is a fact. This trade has already grown to $160 million a year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, to move to what is currently happening&mdash;Senator Brownhill has canvassed this&mdash;there are an important number of things about this particular incident that need to be put on the record. There is an investigation taking place into the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS>. AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, has already indicated formally Australia's interest in this investigation and I know, from my own experience with AMSA, that that is something they will follow through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the report on the sinking is available and has been finalised&mdash;I have had this assurance from the minister&mdash;if there are defects or aspects that the investigation raises that are of continuing concern in an animal welfare sense or any other sense, then Australia will reserve the right to continue that investigation under its own auspices. But it is important to make the point that, because of the area where this sad event occurred, we have no rights to involve ourselves in that investigation or legally to demand the cooperation of any of the parties involved in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the appropriate investigation where these matters can be raised is being made now. We have formally indicated our desire to be a party to it. But we have no rights under the international maritime conventions to which we are signatories to compel, in any investigation this Senate might initiate, the cooperation of anybody. The investigation that does have those rights is under way now.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are further&mdash;this is also important&mdash;investigations being conducted by the Bureau of Resource Sciences, which is undertaking research into the occurrence of disease among livestock exports with a view to being able to recommend to government actions that might be taken to further improve this situation. A study is currently under way in the bureau to determine what, if anything, needs to be done to improve ventilation, for example, on livestock vessels, especially to cope with the high Middle East temperatures that are experienced during the summer months. AMSA has also been asked to review the design pens and loading densities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude on the question of vets, which is included in the motion. It has certainly been my experience, in the investigations that have been conducted into this trade, that there are very few occasions where having veterinary surgeons on board ships would have made any material difference to the problems that commonly occur on those ships in respect of the animals. There is a requirement&mdash;I think a proper requirement&mdash;for mandating a minimum standard of experience for the people who actually look after the stock on board and there is a requirement for those people to be experienced in the handling and care of that stock.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="TAMBLING" NAMEID="6E4">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Senator Calvert, it is in the report. There is a further protection&mdash;I think a proper one&mdash;that has been introduced in terms of the continuing attention that has been paid to the question of animal welfare, and that is that under AQIS's arrangements there is now a requirement for the clearance of stock by a qualified veterinary surgeon prior to their departure. AMSA are required to certify, from an animal welfare perspective, that the ship is in a proper condition to carry animals. A veterinary inspection and certification are required that the animals themselves are in a healthy condition prior to departure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is not a toothless tiger. It is important to make the point that any stock found by AQIS that do not comply with this condition can lead to the prosecution of both the veterinarian concerned and the shipper of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4370"> animals if there has been a failure to carry out this vitally important animal welfare matter prior to inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I make these points is to prove that Australia has nothing at all to fear or to be concerned about in respect of the strictness with which these trades are supervised. Everyone acknowledges that there can be further improvements with these trades. I might add in respect of the Northern Territory that there has been a dramatic improvement in the standard of the vessels that are being used now to carry cattle to the point where in animal welfare terms they represent five star accommodation. I have seen that myself with forced draft ventilation and high quality food for the animals carried on board and so on. It is a very high standard indeed. The Bureau of Animal Resource Sciences is continuing to carry out research as to how the situation can be further improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see the value in another investigation being mounted here in Australia, when we are already party to the investigation that is being conducted and that has legal standing&mdash;which any investigation we mounted at this point would not have. If there are any deficiencies found with that report when it is finally produced it is open to us to take further action at that point.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read most of what Senator Collins has given us in a briefing that was sent to my office. But that does not reassure me. I must say to Senator Collins that I acknowledge that there are many improvements being forced on this trade in terms of welfare but the motion calls on the government, not the Senate, to initiate an inquiry and investigate. It sounds as though the government is doing that. So I do not see any harm in that motion, and certainly no reason for the kind of reaction that it has had here this morning. The motion calls on the government, not the Senate, to implement measures to prevent a similar disaster happening again. That is a terribly reasonable proposition as far as I am concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally support&mdash;and I want it on the record&mdash;the live sheep and cattle trade, but the best way to prejudice that trade is to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ignore issues. I know that this debate is not ignoring the issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not necessarily a lot of wild-eyed people running down the street. The live sheep trade is opposed by the RSPCA, for example. I am not opposed to it, but I am concerned about the impression given when a very innocuous motion is put. I am not saying that in a pejorative way. I am not trying to put Senator Margetts down; I think she was trying to be helpful by moving a motion which I think should have been accepted by everybody without debate, but is not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. I want to underline that I believe that what we are doing by not passing this motion is not reassuring the people who are concerned about the cruelty which is involved from time to time in this trade. The Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare tabled a report about live sheep export 10 years ago. For the students of history, the committee was chaired by former Senator George Georges from Queensland, a friend of mine. It included my Democrat colleague from Western Australia, former Senator Jack Evans, and former National Party Senate leader Senator Scott from New South Wales. It was a very good report. The report came to this conclusion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a decision were to be made on the future of the trade purely on animal welfare grounds, there is enough evidence to stop the trade. The trade is, in many respects, inimical to good animal welfare, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4371"> and it is not in the interests of the animal to be transported to the Middle East for slaughter.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee went on to acknowledge that the animal welfare aspects of the trade could not be divorced from economic and other considerations. I am very aware of that. The live cattle trade and the live export sheep trade has been the only thing that has kept our wool industry and our cattle industry afloat. The rest of it has been bad news, but the live animal trade has enabled them to survive. So I am aware of those economic and other considerations. The committee recommended a range of reforms aimed at alleviating at least some of the suffering of the sheep. More importantly, the committee recognised the need to develop a long term solution. It recognised that the substitution of the refrigerated sheep meat trade offers such a solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to Senator Collins this morning. I acknowledge that for at least part of this trade the customers do not accept frozen carcasses. I understand that. Nevertheless, one still has a question in one's mind about whether or not the frozen carcass trade has really been promoted as I think it should have been. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal government should promote and encourage the expansion of the refrigerated sheepmeat trade to the Middle East and other countries, with the aim of eventually substituting it for the live sheep trade.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a report of 10 years ago, and I know we have moved on. But I wanted to put on the record that these concerns have been raised for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to an interjection from Senator O'Chee before: I do not know about the figures but, having had conversations with the AMIEU in Townsville and in other places and having watched the closure of meatworks in many towns in my state of Queensland, I am afraid that I take seriously what the meatworkers union tells me about the loss of jobs. I believe we are losing jobs in that industry, we are closing down meatworks, and I cannot agree that there is no connection between that and the live sheep trade.</PARA>

So it may be that we will need to consult later on. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation advised my office&mdash;I hope Senator Collins is listening&mdash;that the frozen carcass trade actually declined by nearly half last financial year due to the product simply not being available during the peak supply period. That is an interesting statistic. I do not know whose information is correct; I am simply giving you what the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Corporation advised my office. We will have to compare our sources, I think, and find out what the true situation is. But that certainly would seem to indicate that priority in supply is being given to the live sheep trade over the carcass trade.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My problem with this motion&mdash;and on the surface it looks perfectly all right&mdash;is that, firstly, it cannot be implemented with any force whatsoever or with any effectiveness and, secondly, what it is actually seeking to have done is being done or has already been done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are couple of matters I want to deal with on the issues that have been raised here. You cannot deal with this resolution in isolation from the total sheep industry&mdash;including the woolgrowing industry&mdash;from mutton production in this country and from what occurs when we see changes in how live sheep are received or imported into various countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are realities we have to face with regard to the economics of this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can too. I make the point that you cannot deal with this in isolation. I recognise that this economic argument that it costs jobs in Australia has been argued many times. But I want to refer people to the Geoff Miller report that was done in the early 1980s. I am not sure if it was at the end of the Fraser government or the beginning of the Hawke government, but that goes into the whole economic structure of what occurs in the live sheep trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particular point is that, when the live sheep trade out of this country drops off, substitution comes in and those live sheep then go into the meatworks. The amount of mutton that was being processed through the meatworks from other sheep that were not suitable for live shipment then drops off, and the net result is that the vast majority of those sheep that were previously going through the abattoirs get shot. It is as simple as that. In practice, that is what happens. There is a direct substitution, as you go down the line, when live sheep trade drops off. That is very important. When looking at the economics of this particular trade, we must take into account the production stage, the abattoir stage, the live sheep trade stage and the production of sheep foodstuff that goes onto the ships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make another point while referring to these two reports&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export of live sheep from Australia</EMPHASIS>, a report from the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare in 1985, which has already been mentioned, and the update <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4373"> of that in 1991. Senator Calvert and Senator Brownhill were on that committee, and I believe Senator Burns was chairman at that particular time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney&mdash;good, well done. I do not believe there is any other industry in Australia that has been so thoroughly researched and worked through. One has to acknowledge that. Back in the 1970s I went on board ships and had a look at what happened then. It is a very different scenario today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that it was very sad, very disappointing, when this ship burnt and sank. It is worth pointing out that&mdash;and I do not know what else could have been done in Australia in that circumstance&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> was subjected to an AMSA safety inspection in May 1996 and was passed as fit for operation in Australian waters. It was again inspected for animal welfare conditions prior to its loading in Fremantle, immediately before its last voyage. So, in debating this issue, we cannot say that the processes that have been put in place were not adequate. The reason I referred to the past is that there have been, are and will continue to be improvements in this particular trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to also emphasise the point, having been on the modern ships, that the sheep go through pre&hyphen;feeding and other processes before they go on the ship&mdash;they do not go directly onto the ship&mdash;and in fact in many instances the sheep live in better conditions than they actually do out in the paddock. The improvement that has occurred there is very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to now re&hyphen;emphasise a point Senator Bob Collins made earlier. With the development of the live sheep trade into many of these countries, the consumption of processed meats has been gradually going up and will continue to go up. That is part of the process. There may come a time when the economics will indicate that most, if not all, of the meat will be processed. I doubt whether it will ever be all because there are other issues, such as <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> religious ceremonies and lack of transport, involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that is very important to the people in the Middle East is the fact that those animals can actually walk around the place. That is how they take them and utilise many of them. When we do not supply them, they come from countries north of them or from South America, potentially from South Africa or from other countries. So there is a direct substitution for the live sheep trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One must also acknowledge&mdash;with the sadness of this particular event I mentioned&mdash;that sheep get burnt when fires get away from national parks. Do we legislate against that? I have also seen situations where floods have occurred and sheep have been drowned. It is all very sad, but these things, unfortunately, are realities of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to acknowledge and congratulate all those people who over the last 20 to 25 years have been involved in the process of gradually improving the conditions in the live sheep trade. In mentioning that, I must also include in that the road transport sector, which is a very important part of it. If we look at the trucks that carry the stock today compared to those that existed 10, 15, 20 or 25 years ago, you really do see the Rolls Royce of invention, of modification, of application. There has been an enormous improvement in the training that is given to the people who drive those trucks by the various operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my remarks by re-emphasising that it is indeed an unfortunate incident that occurred. We have to work to improve the situation. I look forward to the outcome of the international report. If I am not satisfied with that report when it comes before us, I will, as I am sure other senators in this place will, proceed or endeavour to have additional work done on this issue. In the meantime, I believe it is pointless for this place to pass a motion which cannot implement anything more. In fact, it would not go as far as the action that has already been taken.</PARA></SPEECH>

The debate has been about trying to see to the economy and, at the same time, see to the proper treatment of animals. They are issues that cannot be resolved at one time. I agree with the thrust of what Senator Margetts has said: this ought to be an ongoing issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could go to plenty of people to get some material about this. Senator Woodley spoke about the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union in Queensland. Certainly that is a body to which we should pay great heed.</PARA>

As an example, I mention the Victorian secretary of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, and perhaps as well the deputy secretary, Mr Graham Bird, who is also an outstanding figure in this area. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, all I can say to Senator Margetts is that now is not the time for this motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In closing the debate today, I would like to agree with Senator Cooney that this is an important and timely debate. In my opinion, it is not wasting the Senate's time to ensure that the right and proper platform is used for these important debates. Sometimes it is assumed that only the government's agenda is important. But that is not the case; the community agenda is also important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need to take up one point that I have mentioned privately to Senator Brownhill. Senator Brownhill gave an indication, presumably from a briefing note that he has, that the Greens did not take up an offer to change the wording of the motion or to defer it. We did defer the motion; in fact we have deferred it a couple of times. I believe the briefing is out of date. So I believe it is necessary for Senator Brownhill at the first available time to correct the inference that was given because, quite late last night, the office of Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy, contacted my office saying, in effect, that all bets were off and that the motion would be opposed. It is fine for the motion to be opposed, but it is simply not true that the Greens were not interested in changing the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4375"> wording. We offered that to the minister. In the end, the minister said he was not interested in changing the wording. So I would like to invite Senator Brownhill to correct that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An Australian cargo was involved. The indication is that Australia has no rights to conduct an investigation. It is true that Australia has no rights under the international convention to either participate in an investigation or to insist on access from the flag registry, the underwriters or the owners. That does not mean to say that Australia has no rights to an investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be noted here that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS>, the ship involved, is registered in Panama. Often ships registered in Panama are considered to have flags of convenience. Panama has had many problems with its standard of shipping. On many occasions we have had debates as to the adequacy of what we in Australia can do in relation to the standard of shipping. I do not think it is sufficient&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame </EMPHASIS> report, as Senator Woodley interjects. It is not sufficient to say that Australia can do nothing. We have had debates here about the ability of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to undertake adequate inspections. I am on record as saying that the resources that are available to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority simply do not give it the ability to make full and adequate safety inspections. In the past we have had very damning reports from the Auditor&hyphen;General indicating similar things, that there have been problems. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority inspection in May 1996 passed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Uniceb</EMPHASIS> as fit for operation in Australian waters needs to be taken further. Perhaps we need to know what was the nature of the inspection, how long it took, and how adequate it was. What did AMSA inspect, and what was the basis of its being able to say it was fit for operation? If it is as a result of a lack of resources that AMSA was not alerted to potential problems, or if it is something that was nothing whatever to do with adequate inspection, we are entitled to know these things. If we see what is an AMSA report, that is fine, but perhaps there needs to be some scrutiny as to whether AMSA simply has a lack of resources or whether something different is the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that there is some interest. A number of people have been alerted to the issue and will be watching carefully for, firstly, the outcome of the international investigation and, secondly, the AMSA response. You can be sure that we will revisit this debate when we hear that response. If it be a matter of AMSA resourcing, the Australian government has a responsibility to address the matter. If AMSA does not have proper resources&mdash;I am just surmising that&mdash;it has to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to deal briefly with comments that Senator Bob Collins made in relation to the cattle trade. Senator Collins made an assumption which, I believe, was unwarranted. The assumption was that if I move a motion in relation to the standards of the shipping of live sheep, I am associated automatically with an attack on the live cattle export trade.</PARA>

There are a number of reasons for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those reasons include the fact that there is a great deal of concern about the level of overstocking and land degradation in pastoral areas of Western Australia. One way of getting cattle growers to look after their land better and not overstock it is by convincing them to produce higher value breeding stock. That is an issue which we, as well as other people in the community, are considering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, there is no single opinion on the farming of native animals. There are people in the environment movement who believe that emus and kangaroos should not be considered for farming. There are other people in the environment movement who believe it is more beneficial to the environment to farm animals appropriate to our environment and climate. That debate still occurs and it is very healthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is wrong to assume that there is one view in the environment movement, and it is wrong to assume that there is one view among the Greens in relation to these issues. It is right to assume that these debates should occur. The problem is suggesting that the issue is about animal exports in general. That detracts from the fact that because sheep exports are, on a unit by unit basis, a much lower value product, the pressures, understandably, are much greater on growers not to create a requirement for improved conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand these issues. We should not look at them and simply say that we know that standards could be considerably better for cattle exports. But that does not mean that as a community and a parliament we should not be looking at the standard of shipping, the standard of crewing and the health and humane standards of live sheep exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that this debate has occurred. I still call on the Senate to support the motion, but I can count. I look forward to the outcome of any inquiry that takes place on this matter.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report is timely. It comes at a time when a major Pay TV operator is advertising a service which will consist mainly of showing R&hyphen;rated material on Pay TV. The Committee is not satisfied that the concerns which it has previously expressed on this matter have been addressed before such a service is made available on subscription or pay television.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In previous reports on this issue, the Committee indicated its belief that the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) should complete extensive Australia&hyphen;wide qualitative and quantitative research on community standards of taste and decency in relation to classifications for pay television, and on what levels of violence and depiction of sex should be allowed. The Parliament also indicated its support for such research in the Schedule to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Schedule 2, Part 6). The Committee reported to the Senate in 1995 that the ABA's research was flawed and recommended that the OFLC recast the R category. In their latest report on this matter the OFLC has undertaken some minor adjustments to R but not carried out the comprehensive recast of R required by the Community Standards Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So in this report, the Committee's first major recommendation is for the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to be amended to prevent the broadcast of R&hyphen;rated and X&hyphen;rated material on pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also expresses its concern in this report at the lack of accountability in the decision&hyphen;making process adopted by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Censorship Ministers when making decisions in relation to the Classification Act and to the guidelines. The Committee believes that amendments to the National Code under section 6 of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1996 and determinations or amendments of the classification guidelines under section 12 should be disallowable instruments by the Commonwealth Parliament. It is recommending that the Classification Act be amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is repeating its call for a restructuring of the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC). It is important that the community should perceive the OFLC to be truly reflective of community standards. One way for this to be achieved would be for the OFLC to work closely with a community committee which represents major interest groups such as parents, teachers, churches, academics, women, young people, aboriginal and ethnic groups. The Committee is recommending that such a community committee be set up and that the positions of Director and deputy Director of the Classification Board be drawn from such community representatives. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4378"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Film and Video Guidelines were last revised in 1988 and the Committee had recommended in Part 1 of its report tabled in February 1995, that a review of those guidelines should be undertaken. The OFLC undertook such a review last year in 1995 and the revised Guidelines were gazetted in September this year. It is those guidelines that the Committee has reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that the new guidelines are intended to be more strict in relation to depictions of violence and sexual violence but it is concerned that there is still a lack of precision about the criteria which is to be applied when making classification decisions. The Committee is particularly concerned to see to it that video material which enters the home environment should have lower levels of intensity in relation to depiction of violence and sexual violence. Accordingly, the Committee is recommending that separate guidelines be introduced for the classification of videotapes to ensure that higher standards are applied than for equivalent categories of film for cinema release.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of great concern to the Committee was the fact that video material which has been given a particular classification prior to the introduction of the system of consumer advice in 1989 and those rated M prior to the introduction of the MA classification in 1993 are still available in the community under the old classifications. The Committee believes that such material should be recalled and reclassified in the light of the newly issued stricter guidelines and it has made a recommendation to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OFLC has foreshadowed a review of the publications and computer games classification guidelines. The Committee believes that these reviews should be conducted with greater accountability and transparency and the Committee looks forward to being involved in the review process. I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.57 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was interrupted by a move to other business last night, I was speaking on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill and expressing considerable surprise, having sat through the same set of hearings as members of the opposition, that they could come to such radically different conclusions based on the evidence. Government senators who participated in this inquiry strongly recommended at the end of the evidence that the bill be passed in its present form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We rejected the key recommendations of the opposition parties that Telstra remain in full public ownership. Importantly, in light of the motion foreshadowed this morning, we also rejected that the bill be split. We rejected that the $1 billion national heritage environment package be funded from other sources. We did this because we had expert witnesses appear before the committee. We had witnesses from the Department of Communications and the Arts who detailed the provisions of this bill and raised very convincing arguments that it would deliver world&hyphen;class consumer protection guarantees prior to the part&hyphen;privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence that we were given completely demolished the opposition parties' attempts to make wild scaremongering claims about the loss of consumer protection when we move to the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra. They began this scare campaign during the 1996 election and they refined this further in the debate. The universal service obligation&mdash;the USO&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4380">and consumer service guarantees are firmly entrenched in the Telecommunications Act of 1992. They are not diminished or affected in any way by the passage of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra's obligations to the consumers are not diluted by part&hyphen;privatisation, and whether ownership of Telstra will be 100 per cent public or one&hyphen;third privatised has no bearing at all on the government's commitment to the USO. The bill, in fact, provides new benefits to business and a guarantee of no timed local calls for business users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill in no way affects the existing legislative or other protections of directory assistance, untimed local calls and the provision of public telephone call boxes across Australia. For example, the USO expenditure by Telstra in the rural electorate of Grey&mdash;which would be close to your heart, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, because it is in your area and you will be heartened to know this&mdash;is $21 million and that will be retained under this legislation. Additional evidence provided to the Senate inquiry highlights how improved efficiencies in a partly privatised Telstra would flow through to the communications sector and to the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Potential gains in living standards are estimated to be $2 billion. Reductions in the price of communications services are estimated to be in the order of 12 per cent. The long run gain economy wide to the GDP will be $1.7 billion and the economy wide gain in wages is estimated to be $3 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Stimulation of the development of telecommunications services and equipment industries will be another beneficial outcome of a growing and robust Telstra. Service delivery to all Australians will improve considerably, as it has in a similar exercise undertaken in New Zealand. Over there, waiting time for new phone line connections is down from six weeks to three days. That is the sort of benefit you get when you bring in some of the disciplines of the marketplace. The company actually becomes responsive to what consumers want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a bonus in all this as well in that what we are proposing keeps Telstra almost totally Australian owned. At least 88.3 per <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent will be off limits to foreign ownership and the maximum individual holding for any one investor in Telstra will be 1.7 per cent, accumulating to a total of 11.7 per cent for all overseas ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn finally to the enormous benefits for rural and regional Australia of the part privatisation of Telstra. As communications costs are reduced in regional Australia, new jobs will be created. One of the great things about new technology in communications is that it does not really matter where you are located if you are on the information superhighway. It gives the nation a real opportunity to decentralise industries that do not really have to be in the centre of the major cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduced communications costs and new services provided will disproportionately, we believe, benefit rural and regional Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost disadvantage of living and doing work outside metropolitan areas will come down substantially, making regions more attractive for establishing new businesses. Telephone inquiry centres for banks, company service centres, catalogue sales&mdash;these are all the sorts of things that can be located in country areas. Tele industries for airline and hotel reservations, insurance and car rental firms will also have inducements to go to rural areas, as has occurred in the United States. In places like Nebraska those sorts of industries have moved out of the big cities to rural areas because of lower costs, to the great benefit of rural employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to Labor's scare campaign, the part privatisation of Telstra will have positive effects on employment in the overall telecommunications sector and supplier industries. The sector is growing at 18 per cent per annum. Job cuts in Telstra will be offset by new opportunities in this sector and in the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan Horsley from the Australian Telecommunications Users Group told the Senate inquiry that members of his industry group face a desperate shortage of qualified staff. Telstra staff are qualified and will be snapped up by new players in the communications sector. Many of these new companies will be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4381"> operating and offering employment in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition in this debate and during the Senate inquiry have peddled so&hyphen;called employment `nasties' to frighten the community. Specifically, Labor has charged that massive job reductions will occur in Telstra across regional and rural Australia. These allegations are not true. Qualified Telstra technicians will win new, interesting jobs on the payroll of new telcos and communications companies. In 1996&hyphen;97, 70 to 80 per cent of Telstra redundancies will occur in metropolitan areas, not rural areas. Tasmania, for example, will be affected by less than one per cent of the redundancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Failure by Telstra to become efficient and cost effective post&hyphen;1997 as a 100 per cent publicly owned company will only see Telstra lose more market share to those new, eager competitors we will be getting after the middle of next year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment levels and job opportunities will really be eroded if this is allowed to happen. Telstra could become like another publicly owned dinosaur&mdash;maybe like the ANL or the National Rail Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor, in government, oversaw a very large downsizing of employment at Telstra. In 1985, Telecom employed over 90,000 people. Under the Labor government, the Telstra work force fell to 76,000 people. That had nothing to do with part privatisation. That was driven by changes in technology. All of that downsizing, I remind the Senate, occurred under full public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Technological change and progressive digitisation of the network is the thing that drives the trend. Digitisation of networks means lower operating costs for access lines and reduced employment. After a slow start, Telstra is starting to match the overseas telcos, but it is 25 per cent off the pace. The pace needs to be accelerated. It will be accelerated with the part privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) on Telstra's timetable for upgrading the phone network. This development is a sign of the efficiencies that we can expect under part privatisation. Telstra will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> brought up to world standard by the passage of this bill. The open communications market post&hyphen; 1997 demands that Telstra be allowed to compete effectively with new players. To oppose this bill is not to save Telstra; rather, it will sow the seeds of Telstra's decline. I support the bill and commend its passage to the Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's proposal to sell off Telstra is, like the workplace relations bill, another disastrous piece of legislation&mdash;a piece of legislation that will do irreparable harm to the economic and social infrastructure of Australia. I deliberately use the words `to sell off Telstra' because that is what this government has in mind. Notwithstanding that the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill currently before the Senate proposes the one&hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra, we know that the real agenda of the government is the total privatisation, the total sale of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been confirmed by Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, that that is the government's real agenda. Once we proceed down the path of the partial sale of Telstra, the inevitable result will be its complete sale. What we are really debating is the future of Telstra as, firstly, a fully publicly owned corporation and, secondly, as the major corporate government asset that the people of Australia have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is the country's largest owned government asset. It is the people's greatest and most valuable corporate asset. The government has said that they have a mandate for this legislation. They seek to rely upon the fact that they put to the people at the last election that, if elected, they would proceed to sell one-third of Telstra and set up this phoney environment fund, which I will come back to later. They seek to rely upon the fact that because they won government&mdash;and I concede that; they won government significantly in terms of the number of seats they obtained in the House of Representatives&mdash;they somehow have a mandate from the people. I refute that. The results of the federal elections put the lie to that claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The one big issue that the people were made fully aware of at this most recent <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4382"> election in March 1996 was that, on the one hand, the Liberal&hyphen;National Party said that they would proceed to sell Telstra and, on the other hand, the Australian Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens made it abundantly clear that they would not support the legislation and that they would proceed in the Senate to reject it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures from the recent elections show that a majority of people, both in the House of Representatives elections and in the Senate, voted for the parties that were on the record as opposing the sale of Telstra. In the House of Representatives, 47.2 per cent of people voted for the Liberal and National parties. Some 38.8 per cent of people voted for the Australian Labor Party, 6.8 per cent of people voted for the Democrats and 2.9 per cent of people voted for the Greens. A total of 48.5 per cent of the Australian electorate in respect of the House of Representatives voted for the parties that were completely opposed to the sale of Telstra on the record and had put that policy to the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So a majority of people voted against this proposal, voted for the parties that were opposed to the sale of Telstra, notwithstanding the fact that the Liberal and National parties won the majority of seats. When you come to the Senate, the figures are even more conclusive. In the Senate the Liberal&hyphen;National Party's vote dropped to 43.47 per cent of the vote. The Australian Labor Party obtained 36.15 per cent. The Democrats increased, as one would have expected, to 10.82 per cent and the Greens increased to 3.17 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Senate vote, 50.14 per cent of the Australian electorate voted for the parties that were on the record as opposing the sale of Telstra and making very clear to the Australian people that when the legislation came before the Senate they would oppose it. That compares with only approximately 43.5 per cent of people who supported the government's proposal. So let us not have any of this nonsense that somehow the government has a mandate from the people on this issue; an issue that was widely debated and fully before the public mind when it cast its votes on March 2.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the Australian people knew that, even though they were disposed to vote to remove the Labor Party after a quite lengthy period in office&mdash;not an unnatural thing, notwithstanding my great disappointment at their decision&mdash;when this legislation and some of the other policies of this government were before the Senate they could be voted down by the Australian Labor Party and the other  parties. Let me quickly turn to Telstra itself, which as I have said is the people's greatest corporate asset.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to deal with Qantas later, but we are dealing with Telstra at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tierney referred to the fact that job reductions have occurred, and that is conceded. But what the Labor Party did was corporatise Telstra and make it competitive. We have seen dramatic improvements in their position in recent years. The asset value of Telstra alone is in the vicinity of $24 billion and probably greater. The last recorded figures from 1994-95 show an annual revenue in the vicinity of $14 billion, a pre&hyphen;tax profit of $2.4 billion and an after tax profit of $1.75 billion. In 1994-95 Telstra paid a dividend to the government of some $944 million for the year. In total, Telstra was making payments to governments of around $2.7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, that performance has improved in more recent times. In the six months up to the end of 1995, the dividend paid to the government was in the vicinity of $686 million, an increase of some 66 per cent on the previous recorded figure for the relevant period. Revenue has grown by around nine per cent. Telstra has a return to equity rate of around 20.2 per cent. That is a very healthy figure. But what do we hear from the government? We hear this line that Telstra is some sort of crippled corporation that is about to fall over. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would accept that, unlike the performance of some previous government&hyphen;run corporations or institutions, Telstra is a fantastic success. Its debt ratio has reduced to some 28 per cent and it has seen a substantial boost in its capital expenditure to around 45 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4383">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is Telstra still a major employer but it is also one of the major investors in capital infrastructure in this country, particularly in information technology. Telstra is not some lumbering corporation in need of massive efficiency reform and change. It has already been through that process. Telstra is at the leading edge in telecommunications in the world; that is, in its delivery, research and development, and investment in telecommunications. All of this happens when it is 100 per cent publicly owned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept that not all publicly owned companies, either in the past or today, need necessarily remain in government ownership. The previous Labor government recognised that in respect of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas because the nature of the industry had changed so much. Qantas had about a 50 per cent share of the market and the Commonwealth Bank had around a 20 per cent share of the market. There was no point, notwithstanding the historical commitment of the Labor Party to that position. I for one regret it in many ways but I recognise the reality that the move had to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not to say that, when you look at a corporation like Telstra that is successful, viable, efficient and at the world's leading edge in terms of service delivery, you automatically have to privatise it because you have privatised some other government institutions. That is the sort of nonsense, follow&hyphen;the&hyphen;leader argument that we get from the government when it suits them. The sort of argument we get from the government is that, because they happen to be privatising Telecom in Albania or because Fidel Castro is going to privatise his Telecom in Cuba, Australia should do the same. That is, we should sit back and say to the Australian people, `We're going to sell off Telstra. Why? Because Albania is doing it and because Cuba is doing it.' The day we have to follow the lead of Albania and Cuba is the day we should give this business away. One could argue with a far greater degree of logic&mdash;it is a minor point but it shows the stupidity of the arguments that you get from Senator Alston, the minister&mdash;that if that is what Albania and Cuba are doing, then it is a damn good reason <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> why we should be heading in the opposite direction and retaining our Telstra in full public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Telstra is the great shining example of how a publicly owned corporation can succeed: how it can be the world's best performer; how it can demonstrate world best practice in the whole range of its operations; and, at the same time, how it can make such a great economic and social contribution to Australia's welfare. Let me turn to some of those contributions to the welfare of the Australian people that will be affected if this bill happened to, unfortunately, pass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that Telstra provides substantial benefits to rural and regional Australia. Senator Panizza should recognise this more than most, given the state from which he comes. It is trite but it needs to be said: Australia is a huge continent with a very small population. It is a continent that is larger than the size of most European countries put together but with a population of only some 18 million people, compared with the hundreds of millions of people living in Europe. Equally, the same comparison can be made with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4384"> Australia is a sparsely populated continent, as we know. Nevertheless, out of our total population of 18 million, some 6.2 million people live outside the major urban areas of the country; that is, around 37.5 per cent of Australians live outside major urban areas. We have geographic difficulties in terms of delivering basic telecommunications services, such as telephones, to all Australians&mdash;without even considering the more sophisticated services. But, because we have always believed that Australia is a fair and equitable society and that all Australians should have access to these services, we have ensured, through the combination of full public ownership and the community service obligations, that all Australians can have access to those services at an affordable price. Just like with the ABC, another fully owned public corporation, it is important to retain Telstra in full public ownership to ensure that those people will continue to have equitable treatment when it comes to the delivery of telecom munications and the various services in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at the level of cross&hyphen;subsidisation that occurs to ensure that people in rural and regional Australia are able to avail themselves of these services. I know that some of these figures have been referred to in previous speeches, but I will just run through a few of them. In a town like Bordertown in South Australia, the cross&hyphen;subsidisation level is of the order of $1,480 and in Naracoorte the level is $1,650. If you happen to live on Kangaroo Island, the cross&hyphen;subsidisation is valued at some $2,360. If you live on Flinders Island off the coast of Tasmania, $4,930 is the current value of the cross&hyphen;subsidisation that occurs in order to ensure that these services are delivered. If you live on King Island it is $2,220. Cross&hyphen;subsidisation levels in New South Wales include $880 in Bathurst and $1,500 in Deniliquin. In Rockhampton, Queensland, it is $1,020; in Albany&mdash;back to Western Australia, Senator Panizza's home state&mdash;it is $1,780; and in Ceduna, South Australia, it is some $6,800.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These massive subsidies are available to ensure that people in outlying areas can have access to affordable telecommunications. What will be the inevitable result if you privatise Telstra? You will place at risk those levels of subsidies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza says that they have some obligations in the bill with respect to community services and subsidisation. You know that in a couple of years time they will be mere words on a piece of paper. Eventually, the pressure will be on to cut costs in order to maximise profits for the shareholders whether they be Australian owned companies or foreign owned companies. In many cases, one would assume they would be foreign owned companies because of the massive size of the privatisation. The pressure will be on for the removal of those subsidies. Those subsidies will go by the board. Inevitably, there will be higher prices for telephone calls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite give overseas examples. I have already referred to your reliance on Albania and Cuba as examples. You only <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have to look at the United Kingdom and the United States and see what has happened there. Try making a phone call in those countries that are supposed to be at the leading edge of telecommunications and you will see some of the difficulties you face. Those opposite have the hide to say that our service does not measure up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who has been on a parliamentary delegation in the last couple of years knows that one of the great things you can do when overseas is tap into Telstra's Australia direct or world direct services. The service is there because Telstra is out there promoting a successful Australian corporation. It is out there investing in Asia and other expanding markets. It is showing the world what we can provide in terms of the development of infrastructure and the delivery of telecommunications services. All we hear from those opposite is this constant undermining of its performance and its success. If you ever did try to sell it you would probably get a far less price than it is worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my remaining time I want to touch on the outrageous bribe that the coalition put to the people at the last election&mdash;that is, if we can sell Telstra we can improve the environment. What an absolutely outrageous and disgraceful policy to put to the Australian people. A number of years back the Australian Labor Party took steps to protect the Australian environment in Tasmania's forests, in North Queensland, in the Great Barrier Reef and other areas. We took those steps because we believed the environment was a mainstream issue and needed to be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the Liberal and National parties to go to the people and say that the only way that this government will look towards protecting the environment, improving the environment and dealing with some of those issues is if we can sell the one great corporate asset that this country has, then that is a total abrogation of political integrity and honesty. Frankly, the people who cast their votes on the last occasion want Telstra to remain in public ownership and I am confident that the Senate will equally decide that.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today as the first Democrat <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4385"> senator to speak in this important debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. At the outset, I should state that we will be opposing the partial sale of Telstra. Senator Kernot led the opposition to this sale throughout the recent election campaign. No Australian will be unaware of my party's opposition to this matter. Later Senator Lees chaired the Senate inquiry into the issue&mdash;the majority report of which clearly opposes the sale. Both Senator Kernot and Senator Lees will be contributors in this debate and will once again be making the case against the part sale of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill does not solely deal with the part sale, despite its title. To quote Senator Lees in today's press:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston has crudely welded together two separate ideas within the Telstra Bill to try and force non-Government Senators to support the part sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>We will be seeking to break that weld. Earlier today Senator Lees gave notice of our intention to move for the division of this bill into its two constituent parts&mdash;one dealing with the part sale and one dealing with improved customer services. Regardless of whether we will be debating one bill or two tomorrow, I will be moving a series of amendments to enhance consumer protection if we reach the committee stage of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has attempted to bribe the Australian people by promising a world class consumer framework if one-third of Telstra is sold. We say that this is simply a way of holding the populace to ransom. The Australian Democrats will ensure that Australians are given a world case consumer framework irrespective of who owns Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that task will be made more difficult in a privatised environment. Although the government has promised to retain Telstra's universal service obligation, we know that it will be quite a task to ensure that it is retained, in the long run, on a privatised carrier operating in a competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The claim repeated ad nauseam by this government that public enterprises are more inefficient than private enterprises usually <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overlooks one simple fact. Government enterprises are often charged with social objectives providing a measure of equity. These are, we think, just as important as profit making but are portrayed so often as sources of economic inefficiency and loss making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While such objectives may impede the aim of profit making, their importance for furthering national goals or for promoting the national interest should not be underestimated. I acknowledge that the provision of the universal service obligation is not directly related to the privatisation. Provision of the universal service obligation can be continued under direction of legislation, irrespective of whether or not Telstra is publicly or privately owned. What I am concerned about is that privatisation will inevitably place the ongoing provision of the USO under tremendous pressure along with other regulations, such as those on pricing, which are presently imposed on Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Furthermore, there is presently much debate about the optimal means for delivering the universal service obligation. A number of industry commentators have called for the removal of cross&hyphen;subsidies as the means of financing community service obligations. Instead, they advocate funding them out of budget revenue&mdash;in other words, a welfare approach. The danger with this is that, as soon as you transfer payment for the USO to the budget, it will make it far more vulnerable for elimination or reduction than if it is paid for directly by carriers. As soon as governments start looking for somewhere to save a few extra dollars, you can be sure the USO will come up for review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I have no doubt that private owners of a commercially focused company whose sole objective is to maximise profits would wholeheartedly agree that this is a good thing. The fact is it is quite legitimate for private shareholders to expect management and the board to seek to maximise profits and to lobby the government to remove any regulatory impediments to this aim. The government is kidding itself if it thinks a privatised Telstra is not going to be working very hard to get rid of cross subsidisation and the USO.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4386">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is equally legitimate for the community to expect the government to pursue social objectives in the provision of telecommunication services. This inherent tension cannot be easily dismissed or willed away and will only be exacerbated by privatisation. A privatised Telstra would be governed by a board of directors acting not in the national interest, or in the interests of rural and remote communities, but in the interest of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We should not be fooled into believing that what is best for the company will coincide with what is best for the nation. Let us not forget that it will end up being owned by a select group of domestic elite and foreign shareholders. This company would be one of Australia's largest and would wield tremendous economic and political clout, and Australian governments have not exactly proved themselves resistant to corporate lobbying from that big end of town. It is not hard to see a government&mdash;particularly one determined to portray itself as friendly to business&mdash;caving in to lobbying by a powerful, private Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this adds up to is that, if we go down the privatisation track, we run the high risk of ultimately losing our ability to set, maintain and deliver community service obligations in the national interest. It is not merely the existing universal service obligation which needs to be safeguarded. The universal service obligation is out of date. Reaffirming the existing USO, as the government has promised, will not provide a world class consumer framework; nor will it ensure that they have access to vital communication services, which are essential for actively participating in today's society. It needs to be upgraded if we are to avoid creating a new apartheid&mdash;an apartheid of the information rich and the information poor. I<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> will be looking for ways to upgrade the universal service obligation to ensure a fair, equitable and, most importantly, affordable outcome for all Australians, regardless of where they live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The bill also promises a customer service guarantee to establish mandatory service levels in a number of areas. This is a fairly obvious admission that privatisation, of itself, is not going to deliver the right sorts of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outcomes and that some level of regulation is necessary to ensure improved customer outcomes. But these sorts of guarantees and service obligations are not dependent on ownership. The Democrats are keen to see the government implement a mandatory set of appropriate customer service guarantees, irrespective of who owns Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Telstra inquiry revealed that major consumer groups in Australia have concerns with the customer service guarantee. They say, and with good reason, that they have not been adequately consulted in their development. The Australian Consumers Association, the Consumers Telecommunications Network, the Communications Law Centre and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman all highlighted ways in which the guarantee could be improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government also promised to address issues of widespread community concern such as aerial cabling and the siting of mobile phone towers. Consumers have voiced their concern about the cost implications of unnecessary infrastructure duplication. Residents have complained and indeed have taken to the streets in protest over the health implications of telephone towers and the visual impacts of aerial cabling. But, as yet, as we know, the government has done nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats asked for the Senate Telstra inquiry to consider these matters and it was flooded with submissions. All opposed aerial cabling and the degradation of the environment. The government has dismissed these concerns as being irrelevant. From a government that claims they want to privatise Telstra to benefit consumers, we think this is the height of hypocrisy. It does not require much wisdom to see that appropriate environment and planning regulations are liable to be traded off by the government in pursuit of a higher sale price. These concerns need to be addressed immediately&mdash;not some day long away in the future&mdash;and I will do all in my power to see that they are addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In summary, the Australian Democrats will be voting against the sale. The crunch will come if the government is called upon to provide consumers with a world class consumer framework in the absence of a change <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4387"> of ownership. We will be look to other parties to support us in this. Any reluctance to take that step will show these proposed guarantees for what they really are&mdash;a bribe through which to garner public support for an unpopular privatisation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the sale of Telstra, and for very good reason. This has been done over many times and the government has always tried to convince not only the senators in here but the public generally that its partial sale of Telstra will have no effect. The government says that it will put in place mechanisms to protect the consumers and users of telecommunications in this country, but the reality will be something different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to look back in history to the sale of other public assets to realise that at the end of the day the government will have no capacity or any legal right to deny the new private shareholders in Telstra their opportunity to maximise their investments. Sooner or later the argument will come up about their rights. There will be arguments from the government, whoever the government may be at that time, that the universal service obligations and requirements on Telstra to install ongoing services and provide new services as part of a cross-subsidised or part subsidised process should come to an end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One has to question the coalition government's stand on providing for rural and regional Australia the maintenance and improvement of services when it then turns around and proceeds down the track of privatising one of the most fundamentally important service providers in the country. Clearly, the people do not want this to happen. They have demonstrated that through various polls that have been conducted. Also, they do not want any funding for environment policies attached to the sale of Telstra. The government over a very short space of time has been dealing the funding cards off the bottom of the deck as far as the environment is concerned, taking more and more of the funding dollars away very quietly and secretly in an effort to place greater emphasis on, and put <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more pressure on conservation groups to support, the partial sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conservation groups must be really smarting over the way this government has dealt with environmental matters in the six months or so that it has been in office. We have  plenty of examples. The most recent was yesterday with the regulations for the export woodchip licences. Clearly, all conservation groups and a great number of other people concerned about the environment were duped by the coalition prior to the election. They voted in the belief that they would see the maintenance of at least existing funding limits for the environment and that, if there were to be any additional funding from the sale of a public asset, it would have been additional. But that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect you have to consider&mdash;I know it has been said many times before&mdash;is why you would sell a public asset like Telstra that has such a great capacity to provide funds for the government. It had record earnings in its last financial year and has paid huge dividends to the government. And not only that. With regard to the provision of services throughout the country, and I refer back to the cross-subsidisation issue, in my state alone it is in excess of $9 million. Yet we still do not have the level of services that we might like to have in Tasmania with regard to mobile phone services and other services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Telstra is going to be the main player in the game, then it will be important that any government have the capacity to direct it at some point in time to maintain equity in the provision of services to communities throughout Australia. It is fairly evident, even with the current circumstances as they relate to pay TV and other services that are being provided in some areas of the country at the moment, that those companies doing that, even Telstra, do not have any real plans to go to areas that will be deemed to be not profitable. That is a good indicator if, at the end of the day, you sell part of Telstra. We should not forget that the coalition has always had a policy of the complete sale of Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of those two major components of the bill, the first relates to a minor amendment to the Defence Services Homes Act 1918 which will ensure that borrowers will have their rights protected when all the states and territories adopt a common consumer code. We are talking here about Westpac Banking taking up the services of lending in this respect. We wanted to ensure that Westpac, in terms of its legal obligations under the Defence Services Home Act 1918, will comply with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Code. We support this because of the enhanced rights that it gives to those who are in a contractual arrangement with Westpac.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second component relates to an amendment to the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. This amendment was once again foreshadowed whilst we were in government. It is an amendment which ensures that, when a veteran dies of a previously established war caused disability, the veteran's dependant will be automatically eligible for a pension without having to re&hyphen;establish the relationship between the death and the war service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to support the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1996. The previous Labor government took steps to combat the decline in participation in childhood immunisation and vaccination. An initiative of Labor was the establishment of an Australian childhood immunisation register.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Levels of childhood immunisation have been declining for some years. The proportion of immunised children decreased from 54.1 per cent in 1989&hyphen;90 to 52.1 per cent in 1990&hyphen;91, and this has been the continuing trend for some years. That drop occurred in just one year. There is some debate about what the cause of this decline has been, but there is some view in the community that the inconvenience and possible side effects of immunisation may no longer outweigh the risk that is avoided by that immunisation. Also, there tends to be a continuing view in the community that the less medical intervention there is the better it is for individuals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this trend has been a major problem for the community. As a result, the incidence of childhood diseases such as measles, whooping cough and rubella have been on the increase. The sad thing is that, even though these diseases are generally a minor inconvenience and are generally thought of as such in the community, over the ten&hyphen;year period between 1983 and 1993 41 deaths occurred as a result of measles, a fact that I do not think many people would appreciate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of this problem, the previous Labor government put in place a twofold strategy in order to combat it. The first was an education campaign to ensure that parents were aware of the necessity to vaccinate and the second was the introduction of the register that this legislation is now putting into place. Originally the 18&hyphen;month trial was put in place by regulation but in light of the success of this program, it is now seen as appropriate to put it into primary legislation and I am completely in accord with that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that in the six months between 1 January 1996 and 30 June 1996 there were over one million notifications of vaccines that had been administered recorded on the register and there are over 11,000 doctors and medical practices and 256 councils now providing data. I fully endorse this amendment and urge the Senate to support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to see that there is a great deal of bipartisan support on this issue. It is a vital issue. There is no doubt that, as Senator Neal has pointed out, there has been an unnecessary increase in the incidence of, particularly, rubella, measles and whooping cough. As she points out, there have been deaths. As she did not mention, but I am sure implied, there have also been a number of children suffering long-term brain damage from those particular diseases, in particular from measles&mdash;far more than have ever been accounted for as caused by the immunisation process itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4390"> There is a bit of folklore around the community at present which says that immunisation is harmful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance. Yesterday, in reference to Tunboa Pty Ltd, did the Minister for Finance say that he had `transferred my interest in that company to my former partner in 1986'? Why then did Mr Fahey on nine occasions declare in his declaration of pecuniary interests to the New South Wales parliament that he was a shareholder in this company? Is it true that at a doorstop earlier today Mr Fahey blamed a personal staff member for continuing to lodge Tunboa Pty Ltd as a pecuniary interest? Did Mr Fahey sign these declaration forms, or has he requested the police to investigate the possible forgery of his signature on these forms?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry, I think there was a touch of drama at the end of your question which I do not think was merited. I have a brief here on the particular issue raised by Senator Sherry. I am advised that Mr Fahey divested his interest in Tunboa in 1986, a decade ago, and well before he entered the federal parliament. Tunboa was a service <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> company which was, and is, worth next to nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fahey's business partner failed to amend the Australian Securities Commission entry; hence, the entry incorrectly states that Mr Fahey has an interest in the company. Mr Fahey's business partner has written to Mr Fahey confirming this. He also confirms that Mr Fahey has received no benefit from Tunboa since 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fahey inadvertently forgot to remove the entry from the New South Wales parliament's registry of interests. Mr Fahey regrets that he overlooked removing the entry from the New South Wales registry of interests. Everything Mr Fahey said in his letter to the PM yesterday stands today.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. What is the government's position regarding the provision of funding for arts related activities to trade union bodies? How does this compare to the position of the previous Labor administration?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4390" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Calvert for that very important question. No doubt everyone in the community would accept that there is a responsibility for governments to provide funding to various arts bodies in order to ensure that people have every opportunity to give expression to their creative endeavours. There are a number of situations in which the marketplace does not fulfil the need, and therefore governments have a role. But what is of great concern is when a party as ideological as the Labor Party thinks a legitimate vehicle for funding arts is the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4391">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Short put a question on notice to the previous minister for the arts, Mr Lee, to ascertain to what extent the trade union movement had been used as a vehicle for arts funding. The question was put on notice on 25 September last year. Not only did Senator Short not get an answer within the required 30 days; he actually did not get an answer at all before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask yourself, `Why did Mr Lee wait for five months?' Or, in fact, `Why would he have waited forever?' The answer is that Mr Lee simply was not game to tell the public the disgraceful facts of the matter, because the facts are that, between 1994-95 and 1995-96, nearly $800,000 in arts funding was supplied to the ALP's main funding source&mdash;the trade union movement.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PATTERSON" NAMEID="LI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator Patterson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was $772,000, in fact. You can understand why Mr Lee was very reluctant to disclose this sort of information. He knew that the ALP would be judged guilty by the court of public opinion. In other words, the facts could not stand the light of day. This is simply another arts rort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give examples of where these funds were spent. There was $28,700 given to the Queensland branch of the ACTU for a poster competition and exhibition. The Tasmanian TLC got nearly $200,000&mdash;$199,925, in fact&mdash;for a variety of projects, ranging from a celebration of pulping in Burnie to a photographic exhibition connecting time through sight. As part of the overall total, the Tasmanian TLC got two grants of $48,000 each to employ a community cultural development organiser. The ACT Trades and Labour Council&mdash;and no doubt Senator Lundy was very grateful for this&mdash;also did exceptionally well. It got grants totalling $122,420 during the same period for two exhibitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is typical of a party that does not believe in free creative endeavour. It believes in manipulating artists by requiring them to express their cultural aspirations through the prism of the ALP's ideology. What it was doing was no doubt encouraging those who wanted to perpetuate myths about heroic worker struggles, anti-capitalist propaganda <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and all the sorts of slogans that can pass for art if you are in the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We regard this as totally unacceptable. Our view is that the arts ought to flourish in an environment where government is not pulling the strings and simply saying, `If you toe the line, we'll give you money.' We all know why the Labor Party does it. They do it so that the trade union movement can pay them back in spades at election time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach is quite different to that. We are not Sydneycentric like Mr Keating. We did not take the view that it was okay to spend $150 million if you did not like the view of the Cahill Expressway. We would rather put that money into regional arts funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the ALP to dissociate itself from its failed leader. The captain might be off the team but the rest of the side is well and truly still out there. If it has not dissociated itself from his approach, we can assume that Labor still thinks that it is legitimate to use those sorts of rorts, to use that sort of government control of the arts and any other area it can get its hands on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It simply is not good enough. Once again, it is a fundamental conflict of interest. The sooner you recognise it, the better chance you have of getting back into the political game.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CX5">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy. There is encouraging evidence that Australia's minerals and energy sector is playing a pivotal role in the accelerating economic growth in the East Asia and South Pacific regions. Can the minister indicate whether this assessment is solidly based and what contribution the minerals and energy sector will make to Australia's growth and prosperity in both the short and long term.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4397" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Sandy Macdonald for his question. I think it indicates the seriousness with which we are treating the economic mess bequeathed to us and the Australian people after 13 years of Labor mismanagement. There can be no doubt that the minerals and energy sector will continue to be one of the main drivers of growth and prosperity for all Australians into the future. Without the wealth created by the minerals and energy sector, there would be considerably less funds available for the broad range of state and Commonwealth programs, including those directed towards environmental protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mineral and energy resources are our largest single export earner, accounting for 60 per cent of all commodity exports and 35 per cent of all exports of goods and services. Total earnings from minerals and energy exports are expected to rise to a record $37 billion in 1996&hyphen;97. In addition to company and PAYE tax, the minerals and energy sector contributes about $2.2 billion a year in royalties to the states, as well as, in most instances, providing their own infrastructure at no cost to the taxpayer. It employs over 400,000 people directly and indirectly in the economy and contributes six per cent to gross domestic product.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sector is a major driver of investment, accounting for over 30 per cent of total new investment last year. I know from my discussions with investors and buyers overseas that there is great potential for more investment, more jobs, more income and more growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve these outcomes, however, Australia must create a climate of greater stability and predictability in areas such as land access, and improve coordination of environmental and other policies by all levels of government. Continued micro&hyphen;economic reform, including the ready availability of competitively priced energy, is necessary to promote greater investment in downstream value adding projects. These are all priority areas for reform by the Howard coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is worth noting that in today's world investment is very competitive. From an investment perspective, there are no international boundaries. Investment is very similar to electricity: it will always flow to the lowest point of resistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are currently 25 major minerals processing projects&mdash;value adding, I might add&mdash;in Australia at advanced stages of planning and development, involving a potential capital expenditure of over $20 billion. If these value adding projects are to proceed, they have the potential to generate an additional $7 billion a year in export income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, there are another 90 mining projects at various stages of development. For example, BHP's $450 million Cannington base metal project in Queensland is under construction. Newcrest have committed $420 million to the development of the Acadia Hill gold project in New South Wales. Anaconda have completed a feasibility study on a $900 million investment in developing the Murrin Murrin nickel deposit in Western Australia. Shell have committed over $500 million to the development of a new coal mine at Moranbah in Queensland. And so the list goes on. A large potential project worth particular mention is the development of the multi&hyphen;</PARA>
<PARA>billion dollar LNG project, in regard to which a press statement was released today, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4398"> which will mean over $1 billion in export revenue to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will do all that it can to facilitate these projects without compromising the high environmental standards that we expect the industry to meet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason, we have maintained that. We are actually adding to the number of undergraduate places next year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray uncharitably says that he deserves better than me. Nonetheless, the department that served the previous government&mdash;I presume as well as they are serving us&mdash;acknowledges that they made a mistake and for you to laugh at them I do not think is so funny. The third aspect that I do not think is amusing, but which the opposition seems to think is amusing, is that the matter of correcting the record and taking the appropriate steps and acting with honesty and integrity is an important one; it is not a funny one. So I do not understand the humour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand some of the concerns here because with Labor ministers, when a mistake has been made, you have to drag it out of them. It was like getting teeth out of a chicken, as rare as hen's teeth, in respect of people from the other side who came in and did what they could to make the record as clear as possible. So I understand their embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, seventhly I provide to the Senate the text of a letter sent to Senator Tierney by the secretary of my department reiterating that the department was in error in how the Wright case was characterised to me, summarising the context and apologising for the mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Eighth, I provide a letter to me from the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, in which he concludes that on the basis of precedent, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that precedent is Senator Schacht, the Senate would not hold me liable for giving misleading evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ninth, the secretary's letter&mdash;which is not a document to be tabled&mdash;to Senator Tierney has indicated, as I have in the chamber to the senator, who is still here, that I have overseas commitments next week when the committee will meet, as does the departmental secretary. These are important matters to try to promote higher education for Australia overseas. Although specialist officers will be present, the relevant division head will be on leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken today to Senator Tierney and indicated the times that the secretary and I will be back. I have indicated when Ms Lovett will be back and indicated that either when the secretary and I are back, or a few days later when Ms Lovett is back as well, we would be only too happy to meet with the committee. Despite putting all of this on the record, if they nonetheless have more questions I will be only too happy to meet at that time and tell them anything else we can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, I am not sure whether I asked to table these documents. If I did not, I do so now, unless you do not want me to.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> inform you that the Wright family is not an actual family by another name but a construct based on a real family with some variations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> acknowledge that the Department has failed to make this clear to you before;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> inform you that DSS has advised us that some aspects of the calculations of payments to the Wrights are incorrect;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> suggest action that should now be taken in light of the impression left with the ERC and the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4409"> Senate Estimates Committee, and picked up in press reporting, that the Wrights are an actual family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This became clear to me only yesterday evening when we were considering a request from DSS to release data to them so that they could check the Social Security payments reportedly being made to the Wrights. Notwithstanding this, as Secretary, I must not only apologise on behalf of the Department but accept responsibility for our not accurately informing you of the status of the Wright case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substantive point remains that there are families well off but with a low taxable income and low net assets able to draw Government benefits in the absence of a rigorous actual means test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also remains true that the Government has correctly identified this problem and signalled its intention to address it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a significant extent the paper prepared in the Department on the Wright case properly illustrates these points. The problem is less its content than our fault in not clearly advising you on its status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper (attached) notes that the family profile and financial circumstances are "based on a real family" tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test. This is correct. But some details (e.g. number of children) were adjusted to illustrate the range of payments that might be available to a family. The paper lists "benefits available" rather than benefits actually being paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper incorporated in Hansard in the course of the Estimates Hearings therefore contains these caveats.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I believe the Committee would have been left with the impression from the oral testimony that the Wrights were an actual family. I am seeking to check Hansard as urgently as possible, but certainly you said that you understood it was "a specific example". You were entitled to say this on the basis of the Department's advice to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: that you write to the Chairman of the Senate Estimates Committee indicating that you have just been informed of the status of the Wright case and drawing this to the Committee's attention. A draft letter for your consideration is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My recollection of the ERC discussions is that your Ministerial colleagues are also likely to have gained the impression that the Wrights are an actual family. Again, this is notwithstanding that a close reading of the document itself shows that the Wrights are based on a real family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: that you inform your colleagues on the ERC, perhaps through your office speaking to theirs and passing them a copy of the letter referred to above. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The calculations of Social Security benefits were not developed by the Department in consultation with DSS. That Department, having now had the opportunity to check the calculations, has advised us that the calculation made for Parenting Allowance ($5,954 p.a.) should be $156 p.a. There are two other small variations. A note from DSS is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: these discrepancies should also be drawn to attention in the letter to the Estimates Committee and the advice to ERC colleagues above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, there is the issue that a number of press reports have clearly taken the Wrights to be an actual family and the payments to them actual payments rather than benefits available. I believe this needs to be promptly corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: that you issue a media release, draft attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to proceed in concert with Social Security in the handling of this matter. I have shown these papers to the Secretary of DSS, who has cleared them from his point of view, but coordination at Ministerial level is also important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: that before taking the steps proposed above you speak directly to Minister Newman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I should note that the other cases which the Department put forward in the documents for the ERC were cases of actual families. Also, they did not include an attempt by the Department to calculate Social Security benefits. We can be confident, therefore, of their accuracy based on information actually provided to us by the clients.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Tierney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Committee's hearings on the Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs Portfolio on 23 September 1996 the example of the Wright family was discussed in the context of questions about the Austudy Actual Means Test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A paper provided by my Department, and on which I drew, was incorporated in the Hansard. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4410"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This paper correctly notes that the family profile and financial circumstances of the "Wrights" are based on a real family tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sums cited are referred to as benefits available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, I wish to inform you and other members of the Committee frankly that it had been my understanding that the Wrights were an actual family. I believe the Committee is likely to have had the same understanding from the discussion which took place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have now been informed by my Department that, in developing the Wright profile to illustrate payments which could be available, it made some adjustment to the actual case on which the example is based. I have also been advised that the Department of Social Security calculates two payments differently&mdash;namely Parenting Allowance ($156 p.a.) and Child Care Assistance ($3,840 for 50 weeks)&mdash;compared with the figures in the Department's paper. The Department of Social Security also notes that the husband would be entitled to a low income rebate of $150 p.a. which would reduce his tax liability from $522 to $372.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In correcting the record for you and other members of the Committee I wish to emphasise the substantive point that there are families who have low taxable income and low nett assets who are able to draw Government benefits. This is a problem the Government has identified and is addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary of the Department, having himself become aware of the status of the Wright case, has acknowledged the Department's fault in not making fully clear the status of the example.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of media reports have referred to Government benefits being paid to the "Wright family". The Wright example was also used in the Senate Committee examining the Budget for my Portfolio earlier this week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the paper from my Department on the Wrights notes, the family profile and financial circumstances are based on a real family tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test. But the Department adjusted some details to illustrate the payments that could be available. The case is illustrative, rather than an actual family. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper was first prepared as an internal and illustrative document, and the Department has expressed its regret to me that the status of the Wright example was not made fully clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figures on payments were also illustrative and based on my Department's estimate of family entitlements. On checking with the Department of Social Security they need some adjustment, mainly that the Parenting Allowance would be $156 p.a. rather than $5954 p.a.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government benefits in the Wright case would still be in the order of $15,000 p.a. (rather than $20,000 p.a.).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having now been informed by the Department of the status of the Wright example, I have written immediately to Senator Tierney as Chair of the relevant Committee to set the record absolutely straight.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Tierney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Committee's hearings on the Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs Portfolio on 23 September 1996 the example of the Wright family was discussed in the context of questions about the Austudy Actual Means Test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A paper provided by my Department, and on which I drew, was incorporated in the Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This paper correctly notes that the family profile and financial circumstances of the "Wrights" are based on a real family tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, I believe the Committee is likely to have had the understanding&mdash;as did I&mdash;that the Wrights are an actual family. I have now been informed by my Department that, in developing the Wright profile it made some adjustment to the actual case to illustrate the payments that could be available. I have also been advised that the Department of Social Security estimates two payments differently&mdash;namely Parenting Allowance ($156 p.a.) and Child Care Assistance ($3,840 for 50 weeks)&mdash;compared with the figures in the Department's paper. The Department of Social Security also notes that the husband would be entitled to a low income rebate of $150 p.a. which would reduce his tax liability from $522 to $372.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government benefits in the Wright case would still be in the order of $15,000 p.a. (rather than <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4413"> $20,000). Therefore in clarifying the status and the figures in the Wright example, I wish to emphasise the substantive point that there are families who have low taxable income and low nett assets who are able to draw Government benefits. This is a problem the Government has identified and is addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary of the Department, having himself become aware of the status of the Wright case, has acknowledged that the Department should have made it clearer from the outset that while based on a real family the example also included modifications to illustrate the point. Nonetheless in moving  quickly to correct the record I also apologise that we were not clearer with the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Status of the Wright Family</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of media reports have referred to Government benefits being paid to the "Wright family". The Wright example was also used in the Senate Committee examining the Budget for my Portfolio earlier this week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the paper from my Department on the Wrights notes the family profile and financial circumstances are based on a real family tested by the Austudy Actual Means Test. But the Department adjusted some details to illustrate the payments that could be available. The case is illustrative, rather than an actual family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper was first prepared as an internal and illustrative document, and the Department has expressed its regret to me that the status of the Wright example was not made fully clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figures on payments were also illustrative and based on my Department's estimate of family entitlements. Department of Social Security estimates show that the figures need some adjustment, mainly that the Parenting Allowance would be $156 p.a. rather than $5,954 p.a.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government benefits in the Wright case would still be in the order of $15,000 p.a. (rather than $20,000 p.a.).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is that there are very well off families with low taxable income and low nett assets able to gain Government benefits.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Differences Between the "Wright" Family and the Actual Family</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wright family is based on an actual family who applied for AUSTUDY this year and were tested under the Actual Means Test and assessed as ineligible for AUSTUDY benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family Profile</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ages and the number of children were changed for the Wright family to illustrate the range of benefits that might be available. Ages of the four children in the actual family were 21, 20, 13 and 11. Ages of the three children in the Wright family were 16, 14 and 6 months. Therefore the real family had two children applying for AUSTUDY but in the Wright family only one child would be eligible to apply for AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education Expenses</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actual family declared $7,700 worth of education expenses which appeared to be understated as no expenditure was declared for the two younger students. The Wright family had $18,200 worth of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4414"> education expenses for two secondary students attending private schools. However the total actual means of both families was the same at $188,969.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxable Income</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the actual family and the Wright family had a combined parental taxable income of $12,323. The split of taxable income for the Wright family was 65% to the father and 35% to the mother which differed from the split in the actual family. The split was changed to illustrate the range of benefits that might be available to a mother with such a low taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Profile</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actual family declared "Nil" business assets. Therefore the total assets declared by the actual family comprised only $50,000 of personal assets. This was unrealistic and not typical of a family tested under the Actual Means Test and so $120,000 worth of business assets were added to the Wright family's financial profile. The total assets for the Wright family were $170,000 worth <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of assets comprising $120,000 business assets and $50,000 personal assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$107,098 expenditure incurred by both the actual family and the Wright family comprises $19,552 expenditure on the principle family home and $87,546 on other investments/rental properties. These were the amounts declared by the actual family on their AUSTUDY forms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actual family and the Wright family had investment properties worth $500,000 but these were differently described. The real family has a terrace house and the Wright family has a city apartment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Tierney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you direct on the matter of the "Wright family" because the fault clearly lies with the Department. It was an incorrect characterisation of the case by the Department to the Minister which led Senator Vanstone in him to describe the Wright family as a specific example in the hearings of the Committee on 23 September 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I myself wrongly believed the Wrights to be an actual case and, like the Minister, only became aware this was not so after the Committee hearings. Nonetheless, as Departmental Head, I accept responsibility for the mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In brief, the Department provided the Minister earlier in the year with a number of actual examples of families well off but who, in the absence of the Actual Means Test, were able to draw AUSTUDY benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wright family case was also put forward as a realistic demonstration, in the Department's view, of other benefits that could be obtained by a family with certain characteristics in the absence of a rigorous actual means test along the lines of that applied to AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was, as the relevant document prepared by the Department and tabled in the Committee says, based on a real family. But certainly variations were made, not with the intention to fabricate or mislead but to demonstrate the policy point the Department was seeking to make in its advice to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the Committee hearings, the Department of Social Security on 25 September sought details <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4415"> of the Wrights in order to check the Social Security payments reportedly being made to them. In handling this request, it became clear to me then that the Wrights were not an actual case and also that in some respects the Department's calculations of benefits were in error.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wrote to the Minister on 26 September to inform her both of the status of the Wrights and the errors in calculations. I conveyed my apologies to her. There was subsequent discussion with the Minister and her office in the normal way. Slight adjustments were made to the letter to be sent to you. The Minister's office then checked with their clerk, who suggested a sentence be inserted to ensure the letter was circulated to the members of the Committee. The Minister then wrote to you on 9 October advising the Committee of the correct situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also felt it appropriate to write to you direct since both I and the Minister have overseas commitments next week when the Committee will meet and, although specialist officers will of course be present, the relevant Division Head will be on leave. The Minister has, however, informed me that she will be proposing to the Committee that if it wishes to meet to discuss this matter with her on return, then she would be happy to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to add my apologies personally and on behalf of the Department to the apology which Senator Vanstone made in her letter of 9 October and in the Senate yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am copying this letter to the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked for advice on whether you could be held liable for giving misleading evidence to the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee in relation to the case of the "Wright family".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You wrote to the Committee on 9 October 1996 pointing out that the Committee is likely to have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had the understanding, as you did, that the "Wright family" is an actual family, and indicated that you had been informed by the Department that a profile of a family had been developed by making adjustments to an actual case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In past cases the Senate Privileges Committee had made it clear that leaving a committee with an incorrect impression as to the facts can be the equivalent of giving misleading evidence. The Committee has also made it clear, however, that a Minister is not guilty of contempt if the minister passes on incorrect information but corrects it when the error is discovered. This was the situation in the diesel fuel tax case, reported by the Committee in its 46th Report in 1994. A minister had passed on at an estimates hearing incorrect information about a proposed tax, but subsequently corrected the information in the Senate and before the Committee, although his first correction was in itself incomplete. The Committee found that false information was given, but the minister was not aware at the relevant time that the information was correct, and no contempt was committed. The Senate endorsed the findings of the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Senator Vanstone has blatantly and barefacedly misled both the Senate and the public on this matter. There is no question about that. What we have from Senator Vanstone today is the tabling of documents and a chronology presented with spin from the minister. But the facts of the matter are this. On 23 September the Wright family was brought up at the Senate estimates committee by virtue of a question from one of Senator Vanstone's staunchest factional opponents, Senator Ferris.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4416"> I must say, Senator Ferris, I did not believe I would ever stand in this place and say that I feel sorry for you but I do because you are just another person who has been given the dump by Amanda Vanstone. You were the bunny who asked the question about the Wrights. You were the bunny who put out the press release entitled `Millionaires on Government Welfare Benefits', with the bodgie Wright family document that had been pre pared by Senator Vanstone attached. You were the bunny, Senator Ferris. I hope that in the next internal ballot in the South Australian division of the Liberal Party you do not forget who to blame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That happened on 23 September. At that Senate estimates committee hearing, Senator Vanstone puffed herself up and said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see the Wright family take their case public, whatever their proper name is.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am told that there are plenty of others where they came from.</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, not only are there not plenty of others where they came from but the Wrights themselves do not even exist. Then, after Senator Ferris had put out her bodgie table and her press release as requested by Senator Vanstone, I was given a copy of this press release and the bodgie table by a recalcitrant member of the government. I was handed this&mdash;I cannot name sources&mdash;on 24 September. It was in the public arena but someone had caught hold of it and said, ` Look at this.' I did have a close look at it and, like most members of the Labor Party, I can smell a Liberal dead cat at 100 metres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a bad mistake from Senator Vanstone because the Social Security estimates were on the next day. I had spent a lot of the time at the Social Security estimates&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And so did you, Senator West, and the other Labor senators who were there. I actually asked at the Social Security estimates whether the officers of the Department of Social Security could examine the figures in this bodgie table. They looked at it, pretty perplexed and stunned. Someone raced up from Senator Newman's office and whispered to officers at the table&mdash;so it was all terribly conspiratorial&mdash;and they took it on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Newman is able to say, `Oh well, I found out about this' it is because a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> member of this opposition exposed this table at the estimates committee and demanded that the Minister for Social Security come back with information about the bodgie Wrights. That is why&mdash;no other reason why. Just like the situation we had in relation to Senator Short's and Senator Gibson's conflict of interest recently, it was exposed by a member of the Labor opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 25 September&mdash;what I am giving now is the real chronology, not the chronology with spin from Senator Vanstone&mdash;we had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>, as an example, coming out with this headline: `Millionaires On Welfare'. There were similar stories in many other newspapers right around Australia. This story says that Senator Vanstone `raised the family in estimates'. Of course, the social security minister says that the family is still receiving massive welfare payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To be fair to Senator Newman, who is perhaps not one of the best ministers in the government&mdash;it is a pretty ordinary bunch and it is a bit of a competition for last place between Senator Vanstone and Senator Newman&mdash;she got onto this before Senator Vanstone. She put out what I would describe, I think, as a limited edition press release to correct the $229 parenting allowance mistake. She stated in the limited edition press release that `DSS cannot confirm that the family actually exists.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Senator Newman probably did tell her colleague Senator Vanstone at about that time, probably on that day, that the story that was published in this newspaper and in many others in this country was wrong and that they were both, along with all other members of the government, right up to their necks in a colossal hoax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4417"> Senator Vanstone says that 27 September was the day that she was told that the headline was wrong. Last night on radio on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program, after being pushed to confess, she said, `It was a couple of days later.' They are Senator Vanstone's own words. That was the same day, I think, that my own office received the reply to the questions that I placed on notice at the Department of Social Security estimates stating that the figure for parenting allowance was wrong; it was actual ly $6. What did Senator Vanstone say it was? Two&hyphen;hundred and twenty&hyphen;nine dollars. It also stated that the figure for child&hyphen;care assistance was wrong. That is the real chronology here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the real politics of this? Let me say to the Senate that it is very clear. Senator Vanstone, you have misled this parliament, this Senate and also the Australian people&mdash;you have misled the public. What Senator Vanstone cannot answer is: at any stage after she had been exposed through questioning by the opposition did she do anything to redress this sort of headline that appeared in newspapers around Australia? Nothing, nothing. You did absolutely nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have not tabled any letters that you might have sent to the editors of newspapers. You did not go on radio or television and correct the public record. You did nothing. Your very serious blunder is just another example that we have had in this parliament over the last fortnight of a minister seriously breaching John Howard's much vaunted code of ministerial conduct. That code makes it absolutely clear what you are required to do. That guide to key elements of ministerial responsibility states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity. Any answer which may be found to be incorrect should be corrected as soon as an error is found, using the procedures of the House concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Did you, Minister Vanstone, come into this chamber on any of the sitting days last week to correct the record? Did you? Did you come in early this week to correct the record? No, you did not. Did you at any time, since you found that you had been involved in this massive hoax, attempt to correct the public record? What you did do was to deliberately and barefacedly mislead both the Senate and the public&mdash;and you stand condemned for it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister for Resources and Energy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During Question Time on Thursday 10 October Senator Lees asked me a question concerning the eligibility for diesel fuel rebate of the diesel which leaked from storage tanks at the manganese mine on Groote Eylandt, operated by the BHP Subsidiary GEMCO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised this leak was first confirmed in February 1995. It is not known when it commenced, but apparently well before that date. A drilling program carried out by the company to both identify the extent of the leakage and to enable recovery of the spilled fuel has indicated that of the order of 3 million litres escaped.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say that I find it difficult to understand how a company can lose 3 million litres of diesel without noticing. GEMCO was fined $45,000 by the North Territory Government in March 1996 after pleading guilty to a charge of unlawfully permitting diesel fuel to enter the groundwater. Around 600,000 litres has so far been recovered by the use of skimmer pumps. That diesel is being cleaned and re-used for activities which would be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate. The company has advised me, however, that it does not intend to claim the rebate, for reasons which I will go into in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the many administrative issues we have had to deal with since coming to Government is the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme by the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant deficiencies were identified by the Australian National Audit Office as long ago as May 1991. Over the following three years, the Labor administration established three separate interdepartmental committees and an Industry Commission Inquiry. The only response by the then Government was to legislate to reduce eligibility and to attempt to charge industry an administration <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4420"> fee, or perhaps in this case a mal-administration fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94 a major fraud of approximately $1.4 million was discovered, which resulted in Customs commissioning consultants to review the rebate database system and its claims processing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is instructive to consider the comments of the Australian National Audit Office on this process, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The contract did not stipulate that a written report be provided and Customs did not modify its procedures for DFRS claims processing following completion of the $60,000 consultancy"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administration of this scheme by the previous Government was a saga of inaction and incompetence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that it is not possible to determine whether all or part of the diesel lost was, or was not, subject to a rebate claim without an extensive search of both Customs and GEMCO's records, even then, a conclusive outcome may not result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am further advised by the Australian Customs Service that under the existing legislation, payment of rebate is based on intended use for eligible activities. Recovery is possible where fuel is used for other than eligible purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any prospect that the rebate is not recoverable is not tolerable and will not be tolerated by this Government. It is yet another testimony to the incompetence of the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Prosser initiated a review of the administration of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme shortly after taking responsibility for the portfolio. That review was assisted by the efficiency audit of the scheme which we tabled on 2 May of this year. Senators will also be aware that the Government announced in the Budget that it will introduce legislation, with effect from 1 January 1997, to tighten eligibility for mining industry rebated under the scheme and to ensure that only legitimate claimants receive the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the review the Minister will ensure that clarity is in the Act to make it clear that rebate is only paid when there is an eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime, the company is acting responsibility in relation to the recovery and use of the spilt fuel and I have requested regular progress reports to ensure that his situation continues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to questions without notice asked today, relating to information Senator Vanstone provided to the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee concerning recipients of social security benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>We are dealing here with a matter of the greatest gravity. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, in question time today and just now in her statement gave us the chronology of how long it took her to write to cover herself, to explain that there had been an error. But for far too long she waited. Even then, she did not come into this Senate and give the explanation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clearly established that misleading a Senate estimates committee is equivalent to misleading the Senate. I find it quite remarkable that yesterday Senator Vanstone gave an unreserved apology&mdash;which quite clearly indicates the seriousness with which she takes this matter, the substance of it&mdash;but she is quite cavalier about the timing and the process of what she had to do. `What's a couple of days here and there,' she said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of days here and there are in direct breach of the ministerial guidelines for appropriate behaviour. Those guidelines were put on the record in my question to Senator Vanstone, and also by Senator Faulkner, but they need to be said again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister says, `What's a couple of days here and there.' They are a direct flouting of the guidelines for appropriate ministerial conduct, from which I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An answer which may be found incorrect should be corrected as soon as the error is found.</PARA>
<PARA>`At the earliest opportunity' one guideline says; `as soon as it is found' says the next.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone knew very early on&mdash;some of us have the gravest doubt that she did not know from the word go&mdash;that this was a fake family. Departments do not make hypothetical families by attaching kids to real families. That is a totally political family construct. It is not what departments do, but they are encouraged to do it by their political directors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this hypothetical family was not designed by the minister it was designed by the minister's office. It is about time that the political bent on this matter is made clear. And it is a political bent, blaming the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What department takes over two weeks to explain that they got it wrong? They knew on 26 September&mdash;when the secretary wrote to the minister&mdash;that they had got it wrong. It was two weeks after that before a letter arrived&mdash;and still no apology in this place, not until a question was asked by Senator Carr. This is outrageous! It is interesting to note that the ministerial guidelines say:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4422">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>The question which I think is critical is: what range of information does that cover? Does it cover the minister coming in here and apologising because she said something wrong or misled the estimates committee and was required to make it clear here? It might, but a common other reading of it would be that you would make some effort to correct the mass of misinformation that went out in the major dailies in huge headlines across this nation. There has been nothing to correct that misinformation&mdash;nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia have been fed a heap of lies for cheap political gain. In the process, a lot of people have been very offended. Listen to what Mr Costello's brother had to say about it. Listen to what Mr Harry Herbert had to say. Listen to what people in receipt of those payments have to say about how they feel about being pilloried by Senator Vanstone's very cavalier regard for the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an outrageous misrepresentation of facts for cheap political advantage. It blatantly conflicts with the guideline requiring a minister to be truthful. The minister's performance blatantly conflicts with the ministerial guidelines requiring errors to be corrected as soon as possible. It blatantly conflicts with the guidelines requiring the correction of errors that have gone further than this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister should resign instead of ducking behind her department in a very cheap trick to spread the blame. Quite clearly, the blame rests entirely and utterly with the political players in this scene&mdash;the minister and her office.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, but everyone knows the basic point that this former minister over here has made a statement. It was in the minister's office and the department has said that it is out of the department. That is where the error lies. How on earth could the minister know what was happening within the department? All of us sitting there at the meeting accepted this on face value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go to the real basis of what is wrong in the system. The example of the Wright family showed what happened in the administration, or the maladministration, of Austudy under the previous government. One and a half years ago we had an inquiry into Austudy after the Ombudsman found 17 major flaws in the administration of Austudy. We held a major inquiry into it; we made 24 recommendations to change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you about one of the recommendations. In the past, when people put their name down for Austudy, they had to show their taxable income. The Wright example&mdash;hypothetical as it now turns out&mdash;shows that people can get their taxable income way down and get Austudy. What our report recommended was then implemented in the dying days of the Labor government. They had not done anything about it for 13 years. They would not have done anything about it until they were provoked by our committee, which broadened out the criteria, which did show up people's assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of that Liberal initiative is to better target Austudy, and the people who get it are the people who deserve to get it. That is the basis of this debate. It is just an absolute storm in a teacup for the opposition to come in here and claim that the minister has done something wrong when she, like the rest of us on this committee&mdash;like Senator Carr and Senator Crowley&mdash;sat there through that and believed that it was a real family. Now we know it is not a real family&mdash;it is a hypothetical&mdash;the record has been set straight, and that is where the matter should lie.</PARA></ANSWER>

As deputy chair I have got used <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) not being able to answer questions. For night after night, we sat there asking her questions and she referred those questions, on each and every occasion, off to her officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the case of student youth and language support programs, Senator Ferris&mdash;first cab off the rank&mdash;asked the big dorothy dix question. The dorothy dixer came in from Senator Ferris. There was the minister in all her glory with an answer that you would have to write home about&mdash;a minister who seems to know absolutely nothing about her portfolio when asked about any other area except this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we find? We find that the minister goes on and on about it to the point where her staff have graphs prepared, have all sorts of extraordinary explanations. I say to you: I was surprised. I asked the question very simply: `So we see this sort of thing being applied across all government departments, can we?' I asked the question, and she was not able to answer, other than to say, `I did not assume for one minute that you think these people should be getting off with these benefits. Of course, that is quite clearly the case. You cannot for one minute expect people to get off.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot about this government on so&hyphen;called welfare cheats. I asked the question this week: is it not the case that the most conspicuous bunch of millionaires being paid by the taxpayer are now on the government frontbench? I think that question stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a fundamental principle here. This minister was advised, according to the secretary of her own department, on 26 September that there was an inaccuracy in her statements to the Senate. She had six sitting days to come into this parliament and correct the record as required under the ministerial responsibility guidelines set down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). She failed to do so for six days. If it was not for the question asked by me, she probably still would have tried to get away with her actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She tries to pretend that somehow the actions she has taken in regard to tightening up Austudy, with the introduction of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4424"> means test, were something only she was responsible for. Yet, if you read the correspondence, under the existing guidelines set down by Labor, the so&hyphen;called Wright family&mdash;the original case, the one before she tried to bodgie up the figures&mdash;was not eligible for payments under Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is enough to make it absolutely clear that the actual means test was introduced by Labor. It was announced in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget and came into effect on 1 January 1996, before this government was elected. The portfolio budget statement at the time made it perfectly clear that, as far as the Labor government was concerned, there was a responsibility about community concerns that some well&hyphen;off families could get Austudy and use complex financial arrangements to circumvent Austudy income and assets tests. From 1 January 1996, before this government was elected, certain categories of families, such as those with access to complex financial arrangements, were to no longer get Austudy unless household means were within allowable limits. Who was responsible for that measure? Of course, it was the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Ross Free. He happens to be Labor's candidate in Lindsay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone owes a lot to Ross Free. It was Ross Free who introduced the measures to tighten up arrangements so that people could not abuse their wealth. However, Ross Free never sought to attack people on social security benefits, to suggest millionaires were on welfare and there was some rorting going on, that all people entitled to benefits should not be getting them, or that somehow millionaires were taking advantage of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without due regard to the proper ministerial guidelines, the minister sought to avoid her responsibilities and to mislead this parliament but, above all else, to mislead the people of this country and not correct the record on the basis of the huge media response from the campaign organised by her, commencing with a dorothy dixer from Senator Ferris. It was a set&hyphen;up from beginning to end.

I have to say that when the three kids were read out, the family's income was read out, the $1.1 million home was read out, the truck was read <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out and then they threw in a Range Rover worth $40,000, that is when we all started to think it sounded a little implausible. Senators Crowley and Carr did mention to me informally and at the Senate estimates committee hearing that they were concerned that the social security benefits did not add up, the example did not sound right. We were unable to get facts and figures relating to those families who are allegedly rorting the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is guilty of misleading the parliament. She is guilty of taking her time and being tardy in responding.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a period of three weeks between when Senator Vanstone spoke at the estimates committee and when she apologised to the Senate yesterday. There was also a period up to 9 October of some 16 days. The period in dispute that was raised and referred to the privileges committee in this report was less than one week. The estimates committee met on 26 August, where I gave information unintentionally to the estimates committee which was found in this report. The next item was on the following Monday when the Senate met and Senator Ferguson asked a question on 31 August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was discussion about a question to Senator McMullan, an answer and some comment. On 26 August, when Senator Ferguson was raising the issues that became a matter for this privileges report, I also said that if there was any matter here I was going back to check with my department and would report back in one week when this estimates committee would sit again. I put it on the record that I would be reporting back on all matters relating to the issues raised in case I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4429"> had got something wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within a week the matter had been dealt with and the apology had been given.

There is a world of difference of dealing with it in a week compared with dealing with it over the last three and a bit weeks, as Senator Vanstone has or has not done.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coming from an electorate in Queensland&mdash;around three times the size of Victoria, I know only too well that services in rural and remote Australia are often missing or many miles away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The motivation for developing this policy stems from this Government's election commitment to ensure the needs of people in rural and remote Australia are not forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately often what makes good policy sense in a metropolitan context is impractical and unworkable in the country. Government must take account of this fact and frame policy accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is what the people of Australia who elected us, especially those in rural and remote areas, expect us to do. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4430"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This policy is a downpayment on the Coalition Government's commitment to meet the requirements of veterans living in rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 337,000 veterans, war widows and dependants currently entitled to health care through my Department, over 31 per cent live outside the major metropolitan areas. It is in areas with smaller populations and the remote locations where the problems are greatest. They often have none of the services the rest of us take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, although health care services may be lacking close to home, veterans may have considerable difficulty in travelling to the larger centres to receive appropriate care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of veterans are now aged over 70 years. This ageing is creating further demand for a wider range of health care and support services. The veteran community also includes many younger veterans who served in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and in more recent engagements including UN peacekeeping missions. Their needs and those of carers and indigenous veterans are quite different to those of older veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to honouring the debt of gratitude owed to those who fought for today's freedom. Rural Australia was a great source of recruitment. It is an important goal of this Government to ensure equity of access and entitlement to all veterans regardless of where they live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health Policy for the Veteran Community in Rural and Remote Areas </EMPHASIS> goes a great distance in achieving this goal. It sets out</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the broad strategic directions and strategies to build on and enhance programs to target services better;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it outlines initiatives to specifically addresses service gaps, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it builds in better feedback and planning mechanisms to meet the needs of the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, this policy spells out what we can do to make health care services easier to get to, to promote awareness of preventive care measures and to improve our communications with the veteran community and health care providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy looks to the total health service delivery framework including Commonwealth and State governments, private and community&hyphen;based organisations, and looks to capitalise on opportunities for joint arrangements with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This policy is about what is achievable and realistic. It comes up with practical solutions that we can implement now within budget constraints. It flags what we can do in future to enhance provision of health care for rural and remote veterans. It is, however, just the first stage. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underpinning the development of this policy are wide ranging consultations with veterans, war widows, doctors, nurses, other health and community care providers, carers, ex&hyphen;service organisations and others in Rockhampton, Thursday Island, Roma, Alice Springs, Bunbury, Geraldton, Cobar, Bourke and Echuca.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultations made clear that, veterans living in rural and remote areas cannot and generally do not expect to have the same level and range of locally available health care services as people who live in cities. The policy acknowledges this reality, but, through better focusing and targeting of programs and services, I believe the veteran community can still expect the best possible deal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outlined in this policy are national, state and local initiatives, many of which are pilots, testing innovative approaches to service delivery and information provision. These have the potential to become the basis of practical, cost&hyphen;effective on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground solutions right across the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this motion, I would like to congratulate&mdash;as Mr Martin, our shadow minister in the other place, did yesterday&mdash;the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) for this document entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Health policy for the veteran community in rural and remote areas</EMPHASIS> . While it is a very glossy document, it also mentioned some very good things. A lot of hard work has gone into the formulation of this document both by members of the lower house and by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which has a staff of very dedicated and caring people to look out for the needs of the veteran community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an area where, as much as we can, we should take a bipartisan approach to the formulation of policy and the enaction of that policy, because this is a group of people who have made a significant contribution to this country. For those who are actual veterans, they have laid their lives on the line; for those who are the widows or widowers of deceased veterans, they have had to live with and care for someone whose life has probably been shortened by their military service. I think it is very important that we continue to recognise the contribution that has been made by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veteran community is an ageing community. The bulk of the veterans now are Second World War veterans, but the Korean and Vietnam veterans are also, unfortunately, ageing. As someone who was a contemporary of the Vietnam veterans, it is coming up to 25 years next year since the last lot of our troops were brought out of Vietnam. It does not seem that long ago.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are getting old. Of course, if we are getting old, it means that those people who are our peers are also getting old.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document has identified very clearly the rural and remote areas of Australia where the population of veterans are located. This is a very important issue for the department in its delivery of services. There are 337,000 people currently entitled to health care through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and 31.6 per cent of those people live outside the metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the statistics of where the rest of the community live in Australia, the veteran community is different in composition in its patterns of living. Most Australians in this country live in metropolitan areas on the eastern seaboard, but a lot of veterans have chosen to move to or to stay in the country areas. That may reflect their age, because a lot of them are older and have gone back to those areas. It may also reflect some of the soldier settlement schemes that were put in place after the war ended. But it does provide the department with a challenge to meet in its provision of health services.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4434">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this document, the minister has brought together all of the processes that the department is involved in, which is a very good thing. It looks at the one-stop shops to bring all the services together and it looks at a number of projects that are going to be piloted, which I think is an ideal way for the department to proceed. Many of us will view with great interest the outcome of these pilot programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area of transport, particularly now with the Second World War veterans becoming quite elderly, is becoming more of an issue. The veterans will all be very close to the age of 70 or over&mdash;just doing some quick mental arithmetic&mdash;and many are approaching the age of 80. I know that, with my own parents who are aged 75 and nearly 80, transport is becoming an issue for them living in a rural community. If they require treatment or assessment in a centre in Sydney, which has happened, they are no longer able to drive themselves there. There are dependent upon my brother to do the driving and to provide the transport for them. However, there are many veterans who live in smaller communities that do not have that family support there for the provision of transport. This document is calling for more flexibility within the repatriation transport arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The veterans have asked that their support needs be taken into account when they travel to metropolitan centres for extended periods of treatment. Often the veterans will need somebody to accompany them on these visits. These issues are highlighted in the national and state and local initiatives outlined in this statement. One of the initiatives is to use the community care seeding grants program in Belmont to evaluate trials of two community transport models to assess their suitability for general application in rural Victoria. That is the standard of programs proposed to be undertaken as pilots. That is a very good thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This statement outlines that the department is prepared to look at the guidelines under which the programs are administered and ensure that they take into account the needs of these rural and remote veterans in terms of the access and administration of these ser vices. The department is also prepared to provide some financial assistance to the accompanying person, in cases where a veteran or war widow's&mdash;and I suggested it should be widowers as more women who have served die and their spouses require assistance&mdash;medical condition requires him or her to be accompanied to travel for treatment and while the veterans is admitted for treatment in a centre away from their area. It is the very humane programs and plans that are being put in place that attract my attention and highlight to many people the very valuable results that will arise out of this policy statement. I think the minister is to be congratulated on this policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many pilot programs are going to be conducted. I wish all of those involved in them well. This is a good statement which outlines the direction that needs to be taken, the need for one&hyphen;stop shops and the needs of people living in rural and remote areas. The statement also looks at the need for counselling for Vietnam veterans which is very important. It also recognises the effect of post&hyphen;traumatic stress disorder and post&hyphen;traumatic stress syndrome which, for many years, was ignored. We did not want to accept that some veterans suffered some sort of trauma and stress following their service and the horrific situations they faced. This statement recognises that there is a need for post&hyphen;traumatic stress counselling and support and that is to be commended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a recognition in the statement that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders made a significant contribution to the defence of Australia during World War II. These gentleman are very elderly and many live in small and isolated communities in the north and north west of this country. They are probably not aware of their entitlements, under the Department of Veterans' Affairs Act, to support, medical care and attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This statement is specifically designed to raise awareness among Aboriginal veterans of their entitlements through contact with, and provision of information to, Aboriginal organisations and communities. Training will also be provided to Department of Veterans' Affairs staff in consultation with ATSIC to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4435"> enhance awareness of culturally appropriate services to meet the needs of indigenous veterans. For many years indigenous veterans have talked about the maltreatment and discrimination they received after they were discharged from the armed forces. I think this goes some little way towards redressing the traumas and discrimination they suffered and to make sure that they are able to have what is rightfully theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with caution that there is no new funding announced for these policies. They are to be funded from the recurrent DVA budget which has been subject to an across the board two per cent reduction in running costs. That amounts to about $20 million over four years. Administrative efficiency savings of $48.5 million over four years must be absorbed by the department. This is the code for the slashing of spending. I desperately hope that this slashing of spending is not going to impact adversely on the programs that are being outlined. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott) should be congratulated on this statement. I think it is important to note that changing demographics in Australia over the last 10 or 15 years have meant that many of our veterans who may have lived and worked in city areas have moved to areas outside capital cities. That is why it is important that the government has done what it has done, which is to make the statement and make it very clear the way in which it intends to deal with the issue of veterans who live in regional and country Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give senators some examples of the sorts of problems that we are facing in terms of delivering services to veterans. Look for example at the state of Queensland. Senator Hogg would be aware of the number of retirees from both Brisbane and interstate who have moved to the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Hervey Bay or Cairns and the difficulty in providing services to them, be they medical or other services. That is why what the government has done is very important and why we need to focus on getting some real outcomes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems we had with the previous government was that they made a lot of noise about looking after veterans but when it came to delivering services, particularly to veterans outside the capital city areas, it did not happen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a privilege to stand here today and speak to this document, although I must say at the outset of my contribution that I do have great concerns about the case that was used to establish reasons why the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ought to make significant recommendations to the government about the removal of any form of age discrimination from the Public Service Act 1922.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns were brought about by the fact that the complaints, which culminated in this report to the parliament, were made by four airline pilots who were compulsorily retired from their positions as airline pilots because they had reached the age of 60 years. If there is an occupation in this country which should have extremely high standards of safety applying to it, perhaps even age limits, I think the occupation of airline pilots might be the one that we should remove last from the list <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of occupations that have age barriers and age limits attached to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extremely stressful occupation. Many senators in this place would have sat in the cockpit in light aircraft. I suggest that all of us, from time to time&mdash;as I have done recently on a Qantas flight&mdash;sit up the front with the pilots when they are coming in to land at one of our major airports. One gets the real, distinct feeling of pressure that is applied to those individuals who have the responsibility not only for the lives of persons on board but also for many of the people on the ground and areas surrounding the airports where pilots land their aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years there have been arbitrary and, in some cases, very unreal age limits applying to people. It certainly used to apply in the Defence Force. It applies in our police forces. As I understand it, in my state of Western Australia, senior police officers have to retire when they reach the age of 55. Age limits used to apply in politics. I can recall some very vigorous debates in my party back in Western Australia involving those of us who were advocating that there ought be age limits&mdash;it was a good way of removing people from the political positions they occupied!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that, after growing up in the political party I grew up in, I actually came to witness people who, having argued vigorously for the imposition of age limits at one point in time, somewhat later in their careers arguing for completely the opposite. I am not in any way implying that their latter arguments were influenced by the fact that they too had aged. Might I quickly add that I have made it public that age limits will not affect me in the next round of preselections, because there will not be a next round of preselections for me. But I am going to be round this place for a quite a period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report itself is an interesting one and not one, I suggest, that the government should immediately accept without qualification, without exceptions. There are still areas in this society where age limits ought apply&mdash;that is, age limits at the beginning of a working life and at the end of a working life. I do not think we ought to automatically abolish <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4437"> all age barriers that are in place in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put on the record that I chaired the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, which made a very quick recommendation very early in its inquiry that the age limits applying to judges of the Family Court ought to be lifted from the age of 65 to 70 to at least bring them into line with all other judges in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. I accept in general what the human rights commission has to say in this report, but we have to look individually and specifically at where it applies within the Public Service Act.</PARA></SPEECH>

If a person who is of a particular sex is not properly qualified to carry on a particular job, then he or she should not be given it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In referring to this report, I want to take note of the significance of a case before the commission in the last financial year, as referred to at page 9 of the report. The significance of this matter is that it may well be the last time, if the Workplace Relations Bill is passed, that we see the commission intervening in matters such as this. I refer in particular to the matter of the Tweed Valley fruit processors. I will quote from the report because the matter was seen to be of such importance that it was highlighted as one of the three major cases reported. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this matter (Print M6526) the Full Bench dealt with the issue of whether an appeal lies against a refusal to approve an enterprise flexibility agree <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4438"> ment (EFA). The Bench held that there were limited grounds for appeal on the basis of jurisdictional error.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, at the start of the next paragraph it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this decision, the Bench found that the agreement resulted in a breach of the `no disadvantage' test.</PARA>
<PARA>I cite that because I fear that if the Workplace Relations Bill before the Senate is passed, then the no disadvantage test will disappear and so also will the ability of the independent umpire. So this report holds particular significance in that it may well be the last time that something of that significance appears.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that I wanted to refer to, because I know that union membership and people not wanting to be in unions has always been a bugbear for people, is at page 37 of the report. Page 37 of the report contains the heading: `Applications for certificates of conscientious objection'. This gives people the right to withdraw from unions or not to be part of unions, should they so desire, by going through the proper processes of the Deputy Industrial Registrar. It is interesting to see in the report that there were 92 applications pursuant to section 267 in 1993-94, 60 in 1994-95 and 69 in 1995-96. When one considers the number of workers in the work force in Australia, this is an insignificant number indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw the Senate's attention to pages 56, 57 and 58 of the report. There one sees a report on industrial democracy operating within the province of the Industrial Registry. These pages draw attention to a very enlightened approach to trade unionism, to employer-employee relations and to the development of a cooperative spirit in the workplace. Page 56 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective of the new industrial democracy plan is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To bring about significant participation and involvement by Registry staff in the decision making processes of the registry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise to speak on the annual report <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry. This report is presented to this parliament by Deirdre O'Connor, the president of the commission. There are a number of aspects that I would like to refer to but, firstly, I congratulate the president of the commission on what I think is a very precise, very good report with a lot of information in it, put down in very concise and readable terms. As one who has looked at each of the reports here in this place for the last seven years, I think this is one of the most concise reports&mdash;if not the most concise report&mdash;that we have had from this body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does highlight a number of important aspects. In the year in summary section we find that in total there were some 13,643 applications with regard to unlawful termination. We have already heard that we are going to see the committee stage of the reform bill debated over the next week or two and be dealt with here, it having passed the second reading stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One particular thing in that bill that must be one of the top priorities in this country is the situation that has existed since 1993 resulting from the unfair dismissal laws that were brought in by the former labour minister, Laurie Brereton. They will forever remain a blight on his position and his contribution to industrial law in this country. The year in summary graph says it all, and it is there for people to observe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving through the document, I draw attention to one of the points in that summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1995, the Commission produced a resource book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Making Federal Awards Simpler</EMPHASIS> , as a guide to reviewing federal awards under s.150A of the Act. The industrial parties were enthusiastic participants and made important contributions to the production of the resource book.</PARA>
<PARA>I make the point that, under the reform bill before us, the process outlined here will not only be enhanced, it will proceed in a much more constructive and cooperative manner in dealing with future matters and issues. Of course, having made awards simpler, it is going to put much more responsibility back into the workplace for employers and employ <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4439"> ees to negotiate the detail of their working arrangements. The important point in relating this to the bill we have before us is that the commission will have responsibility for putting in the minimum standards which conditions cannot go below but the other matters will be negotiated between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further on in the report I note that the commission and registry moved to new premises in Perth and Darwin&mdash;and I hope to see this extend. There are some comments that I will not go over, but I think that was a welcome development and one we will see develop further, I believe, under the new legislation in terms of the coordination between the state and federal systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we work through the report, I draw attention to the comments on page 9 with regard to international cooperation. I do that because of the commission's role in hosting a delegation of visitors from South Africa in the context of the changes that have occurred in that nation in recent times with the ending of the previous regime and the beginning of a much more democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document contains comments about relationships with state industrial tribunals, which, as I have already mentioned, are very important. I would like to go quickly to pages 18 and 19 on the statistics of the activities of the commission. It is interesting to note that the notification of disputes has increased from 1994&hyphen;95 to 1995&hyphen;96. I believe that with this much more cooperative approach on workplaces you will see a decline in that under the new workplace arrangements bill. There are a number of other aspects&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some remarks on this very excellent annual report of the Industrial Registry of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. At the outset I have to make a confession to the chamber. I actually was a trade union official for some 18 years and I spent many hours appearing in the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;or as it was previously called, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. On a number of occasions I appeared with the good Senator Crane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very interested in Senator Crane's remarks towards the end of his speech when <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he was actually praising the commission and saying that they might get some new offices in Perth and Darwin. I fear, Senator Crane, that if the workplace relations bill provisions which seek to emasculate, if not destroy, the work of the commission ever come to pass in the form that they are at the moment then you will not be needing any new offices because there will not be any role for the commission at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will be a shame because this report details superbly the excellent work that is being done by the Industrial Relations Commission in terms of both the appointed members of that commission and also the various administrative functions, including the registry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details are provided with respect to the members of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great things about the former C and A Commission and the now Industrial Relations Commission is the wealth of experience of its members. They come from areas such as the business community, the professional business organisations, farmers organisations&mdash;as Senator Crane once represented&mdash;trade unions, companies, the public sector, the legal profession and a range of other disciplines. All of these people bring countless years of experience to industrial relations issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the attitude of the government is that all of that is going to be ignored, thrown out and cast into the dustbin of history under the proposals that they have. Their proposals&mdash;as contained in proposed section 89A and section 44 of the bill&mdash;will take the award regulation functions away from the commission, whereby awards of the commission will simply be varied by legislation to exclude a whole range of provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise that particular issue because I would like to refer specifically to section 150A, review process, detailed on pages 5 and 6 of the report. It indicates that the commission has produced a resource book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Making federal awards simpler</EMPHASIS>, which is a guide to reviewing federal awards as required under section 150A of the current act. The Industrial Relations Commission, over a number of years, as a result of the various amendments put through by the former Labor government and as a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4440"> result of the orderly transition to a process involving enterprise bargaining coupled with the safety net of award regulation, has been involved in cooperating with the industrial parties, both on the employers' and the employees' side, to update and to modernise awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not sufficient for this government,  notwithstanding, as this report notes, that that process has had the enthusiastic participation of the industrial parties. This government wants to undo all of that good work, all of that cooperative work, which has seen the lowest level of industrial disputation in this country in living memory. The good work that is recorded in this report, which went towards modernising awards, promoting enterprise bargaining but at the same time underpinning it with a safety net award system, is, unfortunately, at grave peril, at grave risk as a result of the workplace relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can only endorse the comments of Senator Hogg when he said that this may well be&mdash;or it will be&mdash;the last report of this nature as a result of the proposals contained in the government's current legislation. I commend this report to the Senate and I commend it to members of the government. They should read it, take time to understand it and rethink their current industrial relations policies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(4.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without doubt, the Industrial Relations Commission is an integral part of Australian working life. As a result of its workings, ordinary Australians' lives are affected. This occurs in the areas of wages, conditions of employment and a range of others. This is a prudent time to discuss this report, considering the changes the government is proposing to make to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report outlines several major issues over the past year. I will discuss just a few of those. The period 1995-96 has seen a significant increase in the workload of the commission and the Australian Industrial Registry. There was a 35 per cent increase from last year's all&hyphen;time high in the number of matters lodged with the commission&mdash;they totalled <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 32,972. This produced a 39 per cent increase in the number of hearings by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This fact alone highlights the important role of the commission in Australia today. It is used extensively by our community in the lodging of grievances and the bringing together of employer and employee in attempting to resolve disputes. These are points the Senate should take note of in deciding the commission's future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate should note that the increased workload of the commission continued to occur while preparing itself for the budget cuts of the Howard government. The commission should be commended for its high quality of work while overseeing an increasing workload and a decreasing budget with which to deal with its business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators should be aware that the commission is not responsible only for dealing with issues lodged. It also plays an important monitoring role. In accordance with the act, the Australian Industrial Registry identifies awards that have seen no change for the last five years and writes to all parties involved to establish the current status of those awards. The responses are then referred on to the commission to deal with as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlights that there were 395 awards requiring review with the following results: 169 awards were set aside, 58 awards were identified by the parties as still current, 69 awards were referred to panel heads for further action to determine their status, and 72 awards were scheduled for hearing before the commission in August this year. I highlight these points because they illustrate the important role the commission and the registry play and the issues that would remain unresolved or unmonitored if the commission does not continue in its current form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps this issue is no more obvious than in the area of unlawful terminations. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conciliation of complaints of unlawful termination of employment has become a growing jurisdiction for the Commission during the reporting period.</PARA>
<PARA>In the reporting period, the commission had over 13,000 reports lodged for unlawful termination of employment&mdash;and I think <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4441"> Senator Crane made reference to that. The interesting thing to note about that growth of unlawful terminations is that almost exclusively it is growing in administrative, managerial and non-award areas. It is unclear what process people will be able to go through to resolve these issues under current proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now, more comprehensively, to the Australian Industrial Registry. The registry is a statutory authority established under the Industrial Relations Act. The registry essentially provides administrative support to the Industrial Relations Commission. It plays an important role in facilitating cooperation between the federal and state industrial relations systems. The registry, like the commission, has had an increasing workload over the reporting period. Lodgments have increased by approximately 8,000 in 1995-96 and the average hearings per day have increased to 105. This is up from 76 hearings per day in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the commission, the increased workload of the registry will continue. However, the government will also bring about reductions in its budget. This is most evident in the implementation of the recommendations stemming from the review into the registry in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report highlights a number of recommendations that have been put on hold since the budget cuts, and I will mention just a few these cuts are affecting. They are the establishment by the president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission advisory board; the establishment and convening of the implementation consultative forum; the implementation of an initial communications strategy; and the appointment of a financial restructuring implementation working party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many high standard facets of the commission and registry highlighted in this year's report. It has a good record on internal accounting procedures as well as opening itself up to external scrutiny. It has an excellent staff training and development program, a high level of success with its information technology resources through equal employment opportunity standards and an extensive industrial democracy program. The report highlights the important work of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> both the Industrial Relations Commission and the Industrial Registry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not good enough, Senator Crane. Perhaps, with your enormous influence in the coalition parties and the government, you could give this chamber and the people of Australia an explanation for your priority piece of legislation being put to one side, because no valid explanation has been given to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see Senator Calvert over there. I know of his influence within the government as well, but on this particular point he is silent. I will not invite the duty minister, Senator Herron, to come into the debate to give us some reasons. I think he deserves a bit of a rest at the end of the week because it has been a tough one. Nevertheless, I am making a very valid point in relation to the report before the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make only one other point before I sit down and that goes to what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) had to say during question time today in the House of Representatives. There is a simple reason for the minister wasting five minutes of question time denigrating trade unions, trade union officials, trade union members who happen to be members of parliament and senators&mdash;in turn, denigrating all members of all unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great shame that the minister hates trade unions in the way that he does. It is not a great way to approach industrial relations in this country. The reason he wasted five minutes naming individuals who happen to be members of parliament was to filibuster, to stop the members of the opposition asking very valid questions about the financial affairs of ministers in the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This week has seen an enormous change in the front bench of government, with the resignation of a minister and the resignation of a parliamentary secretary. We saw the near resignation of a number of others and one minister from this chamber apologising to the Senate for misleading the parliament through her invention of a fictitious family and for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> giving details of it in evidence to a Senate committee some four weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committees come on again next week and, certainly, senators from this side of the chamber will be asking more questions about the affairs of government, as we are quite entitled to. The Minister for Industrial Relations might have been able to filibuster for five minutes today in the House of Representatives at question time but it will be that much more difficult for the ministers facing the estimates committees to filibuster during that process. I put them on notice now that they will not be able to get away with inventing families in order to hide the incompetence and ineptitude of some of the ministers in this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This is a very important report. It refers to one of the most important resources in this country, our fishing resources. We all know that, over time, this resource has been depleted. I am pleased to see that the board of the statutory corporation set up in 1991 is doing a very efficient and able job in rectifying some of the mistakes of the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note from this very good report that during 1995&hyphen;96 the FRDC planned, funded and managed 240 projects worth $29.2 million. It sets out the corporation's mission, which is to increase the economic and social benefits for the fishing industry and the people of Australia through planned investments in research and development and an ecologically sustainable framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman's overview explains the role that the board played during the year. I note with interest that 64 final reports on research and development projects were received. The results of those projects, when adopted, will continue the sustainable development of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4444"> fishing industry to the benefit of all stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note, too, the commencement of a project aimed at promoting the need for quality assurance in fishing&mdash;SeaQual&mdash;which is a joint initiative between the Australian Seafood Industry Council, the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. And I also note with interest that one member of the board of directors is Mr Peter Shelley, who just happens to be the Managing Director of Tassal Ltd, a large Tasmanian salmon producer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the best salmon in the world and that is acknowledged by the Japanese, who are very particular with their product. I am very pleased to see that we have people of the calibre of Peter Shelley on this board. One of their goals is to manage the R&amp;D funds. I am pleased to say that our federal government has increased funding for fisheries research in Tasmania by some $600,000 this year. Tasmania is going to receive $3.8 million in funding from the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I acknowledge that the federal government has been cutting back in some areas, in this case the government has announced that it will retain the current funding arrangements for the FRDC, because we recognise that continued research is at the heart of sustainable fisheries management. I know most of us realise just how important our fishing industry is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note in the report that in 1995&hyphen;96 the FRDC received $12.9 million in Commonwealth and industry funding for fisheries research. In my own state, fishing is a very vital part of our economy. It is worth more <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than $215 million per year. Along with mining and forestry, it is one of our major income earners, with ever increasing reliance on aquaculture. In this report, we have dozens of projects that are highlighting aquaculture and the very important southern bluefin tuna industry. That is one of the industries that has been overfished, and it is a very valuable industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the CSIRO is going to receive something like $539,000 over three years to develop an index of the abundance of the southern bluefin tuna so that we do not fall into the trap, as has happened in the past, for instance with the orange roughy industry, of fishermen depleting the industry. We are spending something like $258,000 over three years in tagging, developing and monitoring the southern shark fishery, which is very important because we export a lot of flake to Victoria, where my colleague, Senator Cooney, no doubt enjoys it every Friday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to get an opportunity to refer to the annual report of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. This is an excellent report. I urge senators to have a flick through it if they have a bit of spare time. It deals with a whole range of funding proposals for the next few years and what the Australian Sports Drug Agency is proposing in the lead&hyphen;up to the year 2000 and the Olympics to be held here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made a commitment to not cut back, despite all the other cutbacks, in the athletes program. It is very important that we do not cut back and that we increase our funding for the Sports Drugs Agency to perform its role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to do that in two areas. Firstly, we need to do it locally. Unfortunately, there is going to be a big incentive for a lot of unscrupulous coaches to put pressure on young athletes in Australia over the next few years <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4445"> to take drugs so that they can qualify for an Olympics at home. That will increase the probability that some young people may be misguided and led astray by those coaches. Some young athletes may feel the pressures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we not just maintain our funding levels for this agency but increase them because there is going to be potential for an increased level of abuse over the next few years. It is very important that athletes in Australia know that the agency is about, and see its advertising and the `beat the cheats' program they have been promoting. Abuse is everywhere throughout the country where there are athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want the blot that other games have had over the last 10 years. I well remember watching Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis a few years ago. I sat down and put a videotape on because I thought it was going to be pretty special watching the 100&hyphen;metres final. Ben Johnson ran a world record. I thought, `Jeez, I am glad I got that 9.7 seconds on film.' Then the next day it came out that he was on anabolic steroids. I know how let down and cheated I felt. Certainly Carl Lewis made it plain how cheated he felt at the time. But justice was done and he got his gold medal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we do not want to see in Sydney in 2000. We want a drug free games. We want to make sure that no Australian athletes are able to get through the screening procedures between now and 2000 and that no Australian athletes shame us. I am not suggesting there are going to be any, but the key role of the agency is deterrence so that every athlete knows that, if they are going to try it, they are going to get caught. If we are going to win gold medals in 2000, it is going to be fair and square.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The drug agency also plays a role on the international stage. For many years, international drug testing has been controversial. You only have to look at what has been going on with swimming, where we have probably seen Australian swimmers robbed of gold medals and world records because other countries have not been prepared to be as clean as we have been.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to see an increase in Australia's international participation. We have to see an increase in the number of drug control officers. We only have 29 going around the country. What I am suggesting is that we are going to need more, and the government must be prepared to recognise that and give an increase in funding to the agency. The processes are critical. We have already seen legal abuses over the last few years internationally and even here in Australia, where an athlete gets tested positive and is able to use the legal processes to overturn the federations&mdash;athletics, swimming or whichever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that the drug agency is able to use the correct procedures and not have athletes claim that the tests were done illegally or incorrectly or handled wrongly and those sorts of things. We cannot afford that blight in 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that the agency is able to visit as many schools as possible in Australia over the next four years to get that message out. The beat the cheats program is a very important message for this country and for the youth of this country. We want it in every young athlete's mind that we are about a drug free games in 2000 and winning fair and square so that Australia can celebrate in the year 2000.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, I will take the interjection. I wish I could get more Mars bars into me. I seem to be losing weight at the moment. I will offer you the suggestion later on, Senator Collins. One of the problems of any compulsory regime for drug testing is the risk that you get the test wrong. To show what happens when a test goes wrong, I want <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4446"> to acquaint the Senate with a case that happened to a friend of mine who was tested not by the Australian Sports Drug Agency but by a body overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This friend of mind was a bobsledder who was tested at the world championships in Altenberg a couple of years ago. He had spent most of the tour travelling with me and if we were not sharing rooms, we were sharing a car, travelling together, competing together and preparing together. He was tested and came up positive on a test that said he had taken speed, uppers. If you know anything about bobsledding, you would know that it is pretty unlikely that you would want to take speed because it happens fast enough as it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was the random test&mdash;they test the first five in a random test in a world championship.

It took him two years to overturn the test, which was quite clearly improper. That athlete lost two of the best years of his competitive life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney is a big champion of civil liberties, so he would understand what I am talking about when I say that if we do not get it right&mdash;and I think the Australian Sports Drug Agency does get it right generally&mdash;athletes will lose out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I go on to the start line, I do not mind if somebody is going to beat me. That is a risk you take any time you go into sport. You go in there to see whether you can beat somebody else or they can beat you; but you want to know that you are beaten fair and square. It is important for everybody that these things are right.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of the Australian Sports Drug Agency is about $3&half; million a year to the Commonwealth. If protracted legal disputes arose, the cost of operating the Australian Sports Drug Agency would blow out. So when the regulations were brought before the Senate committee on regulations and ordinances, I said to other honourable senators on the committee&mdash;and I note the presence of Senator Hogg here, although it was before your time, Senator&mdash;that we had to make sure this was right. I did not want to participate in the debate on the regulations, for the simple reason that I did not want to be perceived as influencing it. But I am very acutely aware of what will happen if we do not get it right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were 34 notifiable results from some 500 tests conducted last year. But it is clear that the incidence of drug taking among sports men and women in this country is a lot higher than that because the testing regime is aimed at the elite athlete. However, the damage that is done to your body is the same whether you are an elite athlete or a 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy who wants to get bigger to play football.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must not rely just on the Australian Sports Drug Agency. It is the obligation of everybody involved in sport who has a profile to go to schools and tell young children, `Don't do drugs.' Tell them it is not just about cheating. It is about seeing their gonads shrivel up and slime ooze from their eyes, ears and nose because this is what happens when the level of toxins in your system builds up so much&mdash;your body cannot handle it any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Drugs damage people's lives, and that is the real issue. We have to be aware of those things. If we want a clean games and clean Australian athletes, it does not start when they become elite. It starts the very first day they turn out for training and it continues from then until the day they retire from sport. Unless any other honourable senators wish to make a contribution, I seek leave to continue my remarks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because I want the Senate to regard the D'Entrecasteaux National Park Protection Bill, which is so important to a vital part of Australia's natural heritage, as one that should be taken through to acceptance or rejection during the short period that is available. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the Senate will know, it is very unusual for a private member's bill to be introduced and subsequently passed for consideration by the House of Representatives. I will speak for five or six minutes and I ask that other speakers do likewise so that we can vote on the second reading of this piece of legislation. If the Senate cares to pass it, in the same way as the Senate passed a motion just a few days ago which called for the protection of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park, it can go through the committee stage and, hopefully, be passed by the Senate for consideration by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate Senator Margetts and Senator Murray for the bill. It arises out of the debate on that motion during which a government member said, `But we have no powers.' What the two senators have done is bring to the Senate a bill which shows clearly that the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4448"> government does have powers. It uses the corporations power under section 51 of the constitution. There is ample reference to the use of this power for this purpose in the standard text on environmental law in Australia by Dr Gerry Bates, which points out that while this power has not been used, except, incidentally, in the Franklin Dam case, it would be able to protect areas of national significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is happening in D'Entrecasteaux National Park is that the Western Australian parliament, with the government using its numbers, has excised over 300 hectares of the park within 300 metres of the largest freshwater lake in south&hyphen;west Western Australia, Lake Jasper. In doing so it has not only cut hundreds of hectares out of the national park, but it threatens the lake itself, with its rare and magnificent wildlife and plant life species, including a great number of aquatic species, including local fish and frog species which are only found in that region of south&hyphen;west Western Australia. Moreover, it threatens an underwater archaeological site, the only such site on mainland Australia, which has a rich repository of Aboriginal sites going back at least 8,000 years. All of this is to be threatened by a short&hyphen;term mining operation wholly owned outside Australia, repatriating most of its profits overseas and leaving very little for the state or the people of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Environmentalists all over Western Australia, including many citizens of the state, want this project to be mothballed. They want their national park back. We in the national arena have a responsibility, when you have a maverick state government doing the wrong thing, to help. I point out that in answer to the Hon. Jim Scott, a West Australian Green in the upper house in Western Australia, the Minister for Mines in that state showed that this is not a once&hyphen;off. There are no less than 65 mineral exploration licences issued or under application for issue over almost the complete national park system of Western Australia. Hardly a park is left untargeted, from Karijini to Fitzgerald River through to Purnululu. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We owe it to the National Estate, which is threatened by this move, to stand by it. I commend this bill to the Senate. I hope that all senators will be expedient in contributing to the debate on the legislation. It is a test of commitment to fairness. The government has a lot of legislation coming up between now and Christmas. I know they will want other senators to be expeditious in dealing with that because they think it is important. We consider this legislation to be important. In particular, Senator Margetts and Senator Murray, who have brought it before this House, believe it is vital and urgent legislation. I ask senators to give consideration to it. I say to members on both the government and the opposition sides that they should consider it with the expedition that they will expect for other legislation which they hold to be equally important.</PARA></SPEECH>

She asked whether we were going to support the bill. I said to that journalist, `I have not actually seen the bill yet.' She asked, `What does the minister think about it?' This is from people who believe we should be processing this bill quickly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do, too, but not as quickly as this. I said to the journalist from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>  newspaper that I would check with the minister, which I did within a few minutes. He said that he was aware that a bill was coming in but that he had not seen it. I asked that journalist, `Does that give you an inkling as to the motivations of Senator Margetts in relation to this bill?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts had a choice. When she received the bill from the draftsmen and was happy with it, she could have walked out through the doors, wandered across to Minister Hill's office and sat down with either the minister's advisers or sought a meeting with Senator Hill, who I am sure would have dropped everything to meet with Senator Margetts. She chose not to do that. She chose to jump in the lift and go up to the second floor&mdash;or probably walked the stairs, if I know Senator Margetts&mdash;to the office of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> and gave them the bill. It was more important to get the bill into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper than it was to get it into the hands of the government so that we could give it proper consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not pursue that point much further, but I think it shows the perspective of the Greens. I do not seek to impugn the motives of the Green senators. I know that they care deeply about the Australian environment and its protection, and I know that Senator Margetts and Senator Murray care deeply about D'Entrecasteaux. I perhaps am giving them advice that, if they want to seek the sort of cooperation from the government that Senator Brown has sought today, it would be better to walk across to Senator Hill's office or my office and start talking about it rather than going to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. Leave the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper as your second visit, not your first visit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said in my contribution on behalf of the government when debating the general business notice of motion about a month ago, the issue at stake is whether the Commonwealth government should be involved in legislating on an ad hoc basis, which is what we are being asked to do here, to resolve land use conflicts and environmental issues on a case by case basis from Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put the view that the Commonwealth, in the view of the new government&mdash;and I think to a large extent in the view of the former government&mdash;has a very important national leadership role to play. I do not think that would be contested by the Green senators. We also have a responsibility to address issues of national and international environmental concern, particularly World Heritage areas and Ramsar sites. This is recognised by the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, and it was also recognised by the coalition's saving our national heritage policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Commonwealth is concerned that the existing legislative and administrative structures do not adequately reflect this view of the Commonwealth's role and responsibilities. In some cases, there is unnecessary duplication between what the Commonwealth does and what the states do. So often in Australia we have people proposing land use activities with environmental consequences who go through local processes, then state processes and then are forced to go through a Commonwealth process. There is overlap in a whole range of areas. In other cases, the Commonwealth's role is not adequately recognised. One of the goals of the new Commonwealth government is to try to sort out those roles and responsibilities to create an efficient system and to create a system that is more likely to achieve better environmental outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In this regard, a report from a Commonwealth&hyphen;state working group is due to go to COAG in May 1997. Preliminary negotiations between the three levels of government&mdash;between Commonwealth, state, territory and local government officials&mdash;have already commenced. To give clarity to this issue, this is to better define the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4450">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the states through the COAG process and through this working group, will seek to review the respective roles, to cut out duplication and, most importantly, to create better cooperation. With respect to the Green senators and to Senator Murray, you do not achieve that sort of cooperation whenever you are not happy with the state process or you do not like a particular development by going around in an ad hoc way and saying, `Bring a bill into the parliament, pass it through and stop it.' That is not the way to achieve cooperation. It is not the good way to achieve a good outcome for the environment. We need to create a process that works better for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill seeks to pre-empt that review. It pre-empts the Commonwealth's commitment to achieving a more sensible process of dealing with these land use conflict and environmental issues. The Commonwealth has before it no information that would suggest that the values contained within the subject area come under any Commonwealth jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not World Heritage listed, even though Senator Brown and Senator Margetts might like them to be World Heritage listed. In Australia there are 11 World Heritage areas where the Commonwealth has quite clear powers and responsibilities, but this area does not come under those. They do not come under a Ramsar listing either. We have 49 Ramsar&hyphen;listed sites across Australia, nine of which are in my home state of Western Australia. This site, of course, is not one of them. With Ramsar sites, the Commonwealth again has very clear roles and responsibilities defined in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Brown made the point that the area that is referred to is listed in the Commonwealth's directory of important wetlands. But the point is that there are over 700 areas listed in that directory and 110 of them are in Western Australia. Clearly, it would be ludicrous for the Commonwealth to propose a piece of legislation that would stop activity in or around all of those 700 areas&mdash;although I would not be surprised if Senator Brown and Senator Margetts may propose that that might <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be a course of action for the Commonwealth to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I also refer to migratory species. Again, the Commonwealth has obligations in relation to migratory species, particularly the Bonn Convention on migratory species, the Japan-Australia migratory birds agreement and the China-Australia migratory birds agreement. But there is no reference to the national park providing habitat for any of these species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the National Estate, Senator Brown is quite correct in saying that the area is listed on the National Estate. However, there are 11,000 places on that National Estate and we have to ask ourselves as a government and as a parliament whether we intend introducing 11,000 D'Entrecasteaux National Park protection bills, if that is the criterion for our intervening in this way. Again, I would not be surprised if Senator Brown and Senator Margetts were not proposing&mdash;in their view of an ideal world it would be possible&mdash;to protect all 11,000 sites on the National Estate in this way by bringing an overarching Commonwealth power to bear. But I do not think many other people would view the matter this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that background can I say, as I said in my previous contribution, that this is very much at this stage a matter for the Western Australian government and for the Western Australian parliament. They have, as we know, passed a bill which will excise this area of 300-odd hectares from the park and replace it with about 1,100 or 1,200 hectares immediately adjacent to Lake Jasper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I have said previously, the Commonwealth will have a responsibility and a role when and if Cable Sands, having gone through the environmental process as they are required to in Western Australia, seek an export licence. That will, of course, trigger the EP(IP) act. The resources minister would then be required to advise the environment minister and after appropriate levels of assessment are carried out under EP(IP) the resources minister, on the advice of the environment minister, would decide whether or not to grant export approval. That is very much a Commonwealth role and a Commonwealth responsibility. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4451">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Commonwealth, as Senator Brown and Senator Margetts will not be surprised to know, will not be supporting this legislation as we believe it would set a quite silly precedent for Commonwealth intervention into virtually every environmental issue anywhere in Australia. Our intention is to ensure that there is a comprehensive EIS carried out, involving sensible levels of public consultation, broad public consultation, and that it is conducted before any decisions are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe&mdash;and I have already had discussions on behalf of the minister with the relevant people&mdash;that there is nothing to say that the triggering process for the Cable Sands operation will go ahead. It is my understanding that they have not lodged with the authorities in Western Australia the document that would actually trigger even the Western Australian process at this stage. There is actually no proposal to mine as yet, but we all expect that there will be within the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no reason why, if it is the choice of the company, we could not trigger the federal processes as well and that there be a parallel process with the federal government being involved. We would not then have to jump a whole range of hurdles and processes. The Commonwealth does have an active role in ensuring that the EIS meets the Commonwealth's environmental goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown, I know you would prefer us to say no mining whatsoever in this national park and I am sure many people would hold that view. That particular area has been used for a range of uses in the past. I am informed that it was a pastoral lease for many years, although it has changed since then. I believe there is farming activity only just to the west of the area that Cable Sands has put back into the national park. It is not in the classical respect what I would define as `wilderness', even though I think it does have qualities by which some people would give it that tag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I do not know what the Labor Party's position is on this and I do not want to prejudge it, but I might also say that the policy of the previous state Labor government was very much in line with the actions that were supported by the Court coalition govern ment.

It talks about the rich mineral sand deposits which have been identified in the D'Entrecasteaux National Park. It specifically refers to excisions of mining areas from the D'Entrecasteaux National Park and the replacement of those excised areas with other areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth does not believe this is a sensible way to resolve the issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past the Commonwealth government has relied on its export control of minerals, in the case of Fraser Island, and foreign investment powers, in the case of Shelbourne Bay, to protect the environment from the possible adverse impacts of sandmining. I am sure they are both instances that senators are very well aware of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is also instructive to note that, while the Hawke government in 1987 used its foreign investments powers to protect Shelbourne <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bay, it had indicated that it would have used its export control powers to ensure that that sandmining project did not go ahead if its foreign investment powers had not been available. I think there is clear indication from these past precedents that, when in government, Labor's commitment to protecting the environment was a very genuine one and, importantly, it was legally enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said a little earlier&mdash;I have said it on a number of occasions recently in the Senate&mdash;that I think the Howard government's leadership on environmental issues has been absolutely woeful. I really believe it has been a pathetic performance from the government and from the responsible minister, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill). Let us look at some of that record. The government is set to approve the Jabiluka uranium mine adjacent to Kakadu National Park. As I said a littler earlier, it has given the green light to Keith Williams's massive Hinchinbrook resort development despite clear departmental and scientific advice concluding that it would have an adverse impact on the World Heritage values of the adjacent Hinchinbrook channel. Senator Hill has been absolutely exposed on that issue. The standover tactics of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) have also been exposed by the opposition during the estimates committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also a government that has given state governments veto powers over the listing of World Heritage areas. It is a government that has attempted to abolish its export control powers for minerals&mdash;something that a majority of non-government senators were able to stymie in this chamber during the early life of the coalition government.

I hope your voting record improves on some of these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is clear is that when the Howard government actually has the power to protect the environment, it shows no leadership. Those who are sponsoring this bill have seized on the corporations power because of the Commonwealth government's claim that it had no power to influence the situation at D'Entrecasteaux National Park until the company applied for a mineral export licence. Those sponsoring the bill have drafted the legislation as a challenge to the government to exercise its powers and protect the D'Entrecasteaux National Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill's stated purpose is to prohibit exploration mining and mining related activities within the national park. The opposition is concerned that, as currently drafted, this bill still leaves the protection of the national park at the discretion of the minister. The government currently has the power to intervene. Perhaps if the government were truly concerned about the environment it would intervene. But, without a commitment from the Howard government that it would protect the national park, this bill is just as ineffective as the export control powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that the bill is inadequate in a number of areas. It does not stipulate which minister a corporation must seek written approval from to undertake mining operations in the national park. Is it the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Resources <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Energy? I suppose we could suggest that with this government in office it would not make a huge amount of difference. But we seriously pose the question: who is the responsible minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no requirement within the bill that the minister undertake an environmental impact assessment before giving written approval. Under this bill the protection of D'Entrecasteaux National Park is still not guaranteed. It is still at the discretion of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The excision of land from the D'Entrecasteaux National Park for mining purposes sets a very bad precedent for the management of national parks. I think this is of particular concern, given the recent statement by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, who has called for changes to the law to permit mineral exploration and mining in wilderness areas, something that has been the subject of a considerable amount of public debate and public concern and something that has been raised by a number of non-government senators in this chamber, not the least during recent question times. The D'Entrecasteaux case indicates that so far as the Court and Howard governments are concerned a national park is only a national park as long as it is not required for something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Heritage Commission has recognised the ecological importance of D'Entrecasteaux National Park and included much of the park on its Register of the National Estate. I am pleased to say that the extent of the Register of the National Estate does appear to be one area of environmental policy and programs that Senator Campbell seems to be learning about and seems to have a bit of an understanding of. I am pleased that he has learnt a little in his short time on the coalition front bench about the Register of the National Estate. It just goes to show that even the most recalcitrant person can learn something about the protection of the environment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area's inclusion clearly indicates the need for Commonwealth government involvement in this matter. The Howard government cannot turn its back. The Minister for the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4455"> Environment, Senator Hill, should be aware that the area excised includes part of the catchment of Lake Jasper, the largest permanent freshwater lake in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia.

There are major hydrological concerns that if mining were to take place it could have an effect on the ground water table and therefore the lake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation of the lake varies from year to year depending on the rainfall. The link between the various surface water areas is so complex in the very wet areas that we cannot have any confidence at all that mining can take place without adverse effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complexity of the area in a hydrogeological sense means the government could not allow mining to take place within any reasonable proximity of Lake Jasper. In the region around Lake Jasper there are declared rare flora, many mammals, significant species <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of birds and species of freshwater fish that have disappeared from other parts of south&hyphen;western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lake Jasper is the jewel in the crown of D'Entrecasteaux National Park. It has very important conservation, recreation and heritage values. Mining should not take place in this area. There is substantial community concern against this proposal in the lower south&hyphen;west of Western Australia. The area is an important recreation facility for people from Augusta&hyphen;Margaret River right across to Walpole, Manjimup, Northcliffe, Nannup and Pemberton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The excision of land from the park is giving the mining company an imprimatur to mine. It is hard to see the difference between granting the excision so the mining company can do the feasibility study and approving the mining. Our opposition to sandmining in the D'Entrecasteaux area is not a blanket objection to sandmining per se. The opposition recognises that mineral sands are a valuable resource in the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(6.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Democrats' and Greens' bill to protect D'Entrecasteaux National Park. There is at present a movement by this government and by the mining industry to open up protected areas for mining. I am sorry to say that this is a move which is wanted by some state governments as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a strange phenomenon which I will call `flexible borders'. Yes, it is a national park; yes, it needs protecting; yes, it has important values&mdash;but we are just going to pop in an open&hyphen;cut mine, complete with infrastructure, including tailings ponds, processing plant and trucking routes and, in this case, a sand mine complete with dredge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what these governments think a national park is about, but our understanding is that it is about protecting an area in its own right for future generations. Just four per cent of Australia is designated as national park. By our calculation, that leaves the mining industry with a fair bit of the rest of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats passionately believe that we must protect national parks and the protected <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> areas that we have left. Furthermore, we must move to increase them to save our rapidly depleting biodiversity and our special places. We do not accept this outrageous attempt by the mining industry to get their hands onto our national parks and protected areas, and we will fight every step of the way to see that it does not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">D'Entrecasteaux itself may not be an untouched wilderness, but it is an important wetland area&mdash;so important that it is listed in ANCA's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's important wetlands</EMPHASIS>&mdash;yet the Western Australian government wants to excise this area for a rapacious sand mine operation. I am sure that the Western Australian government would say that it is just a bit of national park, and then the next time a money&hyphen;grubbing greedy mining company comes along it will excise another bit and then another, all with the same justification. The fact is that seven-eighths of this park is pegged for mining. It is imperative that the federal government stop this in its tracks in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does this kind of action leave our unique places, our wild species? Where do the people who love the peace of protected areas go? If economics is all this government thinks about, what about the economics of the tourist industry, which is, I might say, very substantial in Western Australia? People want to visit unspoiled areas. I think it is time governments recognise that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government has a definite responsibility in this area because this national park is on the Register of the National Estate. This bill will give the constitutional power for intervention and provide an important precedent in terms of the use of corporations powers. In fact, Justice Wilcox expressed the view that it would be possible to prohibit trading corporations adversely affecting items on the Register of the National Estate. The most respected authority on the Australian constitution, Professor Leslie Zines, insists that the Commonwealth may regulate and control all acts of trading and financial corporations for the purposes of trade, including mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4458"> Clearly, we have many reasons for intervention&mdash;to protect the area for future genera tions, to protect areas on the National Estate and to prevent states trading away our precious places. We have the right, under the constitution, to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are not too many more incompatible activities within a wetland national park area than sandmining. It represents extensive disruption to the environment. That is why I urge the parliament to pass this bill. I look forward to its speedy passage through the Senate and the lower house.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a contribution to the second reading debate on the D'Entrecasteaux National Park Protection Bill put forward by Senator Margetts and Senator Murray. The first point I wish to raise refers to the head of power under which they have introduced this bill. I find it quite remarkable the way in which they are using section 109 of the constitution. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a law of the State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Commonwealth law shall prevail over the state&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.</PARA>
<PARA>The important point is that, because this can only apply to corporations and this legislation is split between foreign corporations and Australian corporations, if this legislation were carried we would see a much tougher test for individual non-corporation mining operations than for corporations. So it is giving a softer test for foreign owned corporations and Australian owned corporations than non&hyphen;corporation business structures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at this. Under the Western Australian legislation, for those not covered by this&mdash;and I think we are all very aware in this place of what the corporations power means under the constitution&mdash;a decision to excise has to be passed by both houses of the Western Australian parliament.

Then there is a map of the area which I would like to deal with and which I also present here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to this, I thank Senator McKiernan for having passed to me a pamphlet which I do not believe I have received as yet, although it might be in Perth. I also seek leave to table that pamphlet. I thank Senator McKiernan for this document, which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is headed `Jangardup South project'. I seek leave to have that tabled as well. That being the case, if I can get them handed around, senators can have a look at them and make a decision one way or the other, but I have given everyone an indication of what they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will move to my next point, and there are some aspects of this I wish to make. In doing so, I re-emphasise the point that the legislation which is operating in Western Australia in terms of this&mdash;subject to a couple of minor amendments&mdash;is the legislation of the previous Labor government in Western Australia. So, in effect, there is no real difference between either major parties in Western Australia, my home state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only difference of note between the parties over the mining issue in national parks is that Premier Lawrence proposed that there would be no mining in national parks. However, in the recognition of high resource values in five of the 62 national parks, special provisions were made to allow for the continued exploration and excision of mining leases. With the excision of small areas from two national parks&mdash;Watheroo and Neerabup&mdash;only three national parks would be subject to exploration and mining. I will not go over that any further, because Senator Campbell has already touched on those aspects of it. I just make that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we work through the actual aspects of the proposal&mdash;and I have not got the maps right now to do that&mdash;we find that the proposal states that 368 hectares will be available for mining. In return, 1,083 hectares of private land will be transferred to the executive director of the Department of Conservation and Land Management. That is a ratio of three to one, bearing in mind that, when the mining operation is done, the original 368 hectares will also be returned to the national park. In fact, there will be, over time, a net gain of 1,083 hectares of private land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point that much of the area to be mined&mdash;as has already been stated&mdash;is former grazing land or private land. When we talk about this area, we are talking about an area that has been extensively grazed for many, many years. In fact, the area that will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4460"> go back into the park will be significantly increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also rehabilitation that goes with that. The rehabilitation in the mining areas of the south&hyphen;west of Western Australia is undoubtedly world class. A number of operations there have won world awards for their rehabilitation programs. I am absolutely confident that this will occur in this situation with Cable Sands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point relates to a point Senator Brown made in his contribution. I think I have got this right; I am not in the business of misrepresenting people. He asked who would want mining within 300 metres of the lake. The reality of this proposal and the operations involved is that the land being put into the park on the other side of the lake&mdash;land which is under the control of CALM, as all public lands in Western Australia are controlled by CALM&mdash;is agricultural land. If we were quite honest about it, it is far more likely that there would be damage to the lake from fertilisers used on farming land than from any mining operation, although I am told that this has not happened. That is advice I have been given, and I have no reason to question that. I really think the point that has been raised there is not valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of benefits from the proposal which I would like to highlight, and I have touched on some of these briefly. The first is that the state's conservation estate will be increased in area, although there will be a decrease of three square kilometres in the area of the national park in the interim. Once mining is completed and restoration of native vegetation is at an acceptable stage, the area of the class C reserve will be returned to the national park. The national park area will be increased by about 10 square kilometres ultimately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next point I want to make in terms of this relates to the improvement of water quality in the south-west of WA. This is a very important benefit from the proposal. It is required and a lot more work has to be done. The water quality in Lake Jasper will be better protected. Cable has already ceased intensive farming practices on its private land, which has thereby increased the protective <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> buffer between Lake Jasper and the nearest farm land from the 300 metres that I have already mentioned to 2,600 metres&mdash;which is nearly nine times further away. This will be permanent once the mining has been approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that employment and wealth generation will continue with a well&hyphen;established mining company which has a good reputation for mine rehabilitation and native vegetation restoration. Parts of the private land which are partly cleared could be added to the national park as the flora is returned to suitable quality, or used for other purposes, such as sport and other recreational activities, within the national park without further clearing of native vegetation. As to any perceived threat to Lake Jasper if mining proceeds, I re&hyphen;emphasise the points I made about the buffer and farm fertilisers and the threat to water quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I come back now to where I started and restate the fact that I find it remarkable that we have a piece of legislation before this chamber which will establish lesser standards, lesser requirements for dealing with the management of national parks by corporations, particularly foreign corporations, than exist under the state legislation. If a corporation's power were being used to improve the situation, I could understand the objectives behind these measures. But there will be far less scrutiny, with no reference whatsoever to environmental protection assessments and no reference whatsoever to who will manage the land in that particular area in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know who has responsibility for the management of land in Western Australia&mdash;CALM. It is an organisation that was set up many years ago. It has changed its name a couple of times but, essentially, it has been the same organisation for the last 40 or 50 years. When we analyse the cost benefits of the proposal before us we see that land management in Western Australia would have significantly less control. The disciplines required would be significantly less. This proposal would also override the present provisions under the Soil Conservation Act and a number of other acts because of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4461"> way&mdash;I emphasise again&mdash;it relates to foreign corporations and corporations of Australian origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On those grounds alone, I believe we should not support this particular legislation. But we should also take into account the environment, the people who are working hands on, the people who have the scientific knowledge and background. Once again, there is a diminution of that particular aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also runs into the problem of the right of a state&mdash;in this case, the right of Western Australia&mdash;to manage land. That right is clearly spelt out in the constitution. It is my understanding that it would require the High Court to say whether this piece of proposed legislation overrides the rights of the states to manage land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I do not think that this bill has been carefully thought through. It is fundamentally a political stunt. Were it to become law, the environment, mining operations and all the aspects that go with them in Western Australia would be far worse off and nowhere near as well managed, controlled and disciplined as they currently are.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in the debate on the D'Entrecasteaux National Park Protection Bill 1996. The bill, as tabled, certainly has the hallmarks of brevity and simplicity. The consequences of the bill, should it become law, are the exact opposite of those earlier descriptions. The bill, were it to become law, would have enormous ramifications both short&hyphen;term and long&hyphen;term. Let us first look at the pertinent aspects of the bill. The preamble says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Bill for an Act to protect land that is or was a part of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park from mining and other intrusive activities, and for related purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>Going to the substance of the bill, clause 3 defines `corporation' as meaning:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a foreign corporation to which paragraph 51 (xx) of the Constitution applies; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a trading or financial corporation to which that paragraph applies.</PARA>
<PARA>A `national park area' means an area that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is part of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park in Western Australia; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> was at any time part of that National Park.</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4 is headed `Protection of national park area'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A corporation must not, without the written approval of the Minister, carry out any of the following operations in a national park area:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> mining operations or exploratory operations in connection with mining operations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> excavation operations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> any other prescribed operations.</PARA>
<PARA>The intent of the bill is clear. It seeks to prohibit mining or exploratory operations in connection with mining operations in the national park areas as defined. It seeks to prohibit excavation operations and any other prescribed operations in the national park areas as defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the outset, I wish to express very strong reservations about the thrust of this bill. I will itemise those reservations under five separate headings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it is in part inconsistent with&mdash;indeed diametrically in opposition to&mdash;the national policy of the Australian Labor Party. We should be clear on that aspect. The policy of the Australian Labor Party is to prohibit mining in national parks and I do not dissent from that very sound policy. However, the national policy position of the Australian Labor Party expressly authorises exploration activities in national parks. So, to the extent that this bill prohibits exploration activities in national parks, it is contrary to the policy of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it is contrary to the policy adopted by the caucus of the Western Australian state parliamentary Labor Party. I shall return to that policy in more detail later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4462"> Thirdly, it is contrary to what has been the practice of all Western Australian governments since 1990, under the leadership of premiers Dowding, Lawrence and Court. That position, as referred to earlier, can be deter mined from what is known as the resolution of conflict policy, which was tabled in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, the bill expressly uses the corporations power to attempt to create a national park. I know that the extent of the corporations power has been reviewed by the High Court of late. But even with the current composition of the High Court, it seems a long bow to suggest the internal regulation of public companies extends to the creation of national parks and regulation of mining activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context, the bill is deficient, and apparently deliberately so, because it does not seek to regulate the activities of private companies, trusts, family trusts, partnerships and the like. It is not beyond the wit of humankind to establish one of those entities to engage in mining activities in a national park. It causes me to question the intent and credibility of the park when there is no attempt to regulate other legal entities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly and most importantly, the bill will have the direct consequence of putting out of work some 80 directly employed miners. With a multiplier effect, this means almost 300 people have employment directly or indirectly associated with the current mine. With the families of those persons, the number totals some 900. They are indeed weighty matters that have caused me to review my attitude to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other side of this debate, one must acknowledge the views held in the community about mining, resources or extraction activities and national parks. Strong views are held concerning these issues and we would be fools to ignore that the Greens and the Australian Democrats received between seven per cent and 10 per cent of the primary vote in different states around March this year. Their vote is certainly centred around green issues. I acknowledge those views exist in the community and properly are up for discussion and resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, earlier this week, there was a debate about logging and woodchips in Tasmania. In my room I listened to the contribution of Senator Brown from Tasmania. He spoke with great feeling about the insect colonies, the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> various species of fauna, the different colonies of marsupials and the importance of trees. This morning there was some debate over live sheep exports. Senator Margetts essentially argued for rights for sheep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not denigrate those concerns and wish those parties well in the prosecution of their claims. But in the scheme of things, if the issue is about priorities, my priority can only be that of the men and women of the local communities, the miners and their families currently employed on the existing mine site, not the subject of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is sensible to avoid polarisation and taking extreme positions in this debate. Polarisation, extreme positions and positional negotiations are ultimately self&hyphen;defeating and intellectually barren. I suggest that all parties in this debate&mdash;and it appears to be coming back onto the agenda if this bill is any example of the future&mdash;need to avoid denigration of their opponents. More importantly, they need to cease adopting intractable positions and they need to seek to find a middle path or compromise in this debate concerning mining activities and reservation of parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this respect, I would suggest to the Senate that we are well served by the actions of the Western Australian parliamentary Labor Party and successive state governments since 1990 in Western Australia. We should look at the history of mining in this area and the mechanisms adopted by the Lawrence Labor government in 1990 to resolve the issue of mining in national parks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it should be noted that there has been a mine site extracting titanium, a mineral sand, in Jangardup since 1994. The area was explored in 1987 and has been developed since 1993; and extraction activity has continued since around mid&hyphen;1994. The area of the existing mine site was, and is, immediately adjacent to the national park under discussion. The existing mine site, not the subject of the bill, will be exhausted in late 1997 and early 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, Cable Sands Pty Ltd applied to the Western Australian government to excise an area of approximately 380 hectares on the boundary of the national park and sought parliamentary approval to mine that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4463"> new site. That new mine site is known as Jangardup South and is about four kilometres south of the current mine site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the proposal of the company to mine that site, and the excision bill, as outlined earlier, has passed through both houses of the Western Australian parliament. It is the proposal of the company to transfer the existing work force to that new mine site and to employ some additional 20 or 30 workers. If the bill under discussion today became law, it would prohibit that mining activity now excised from the national park. The proposal is thus quite contentious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter was considered by the Western Australian parliamentary Labor Party in June of this year. That body, in resolving the issue, determined to apply what is known as the resolution of conflict policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resolution of conflict policy was created around 1990 when, as I recall, Dr Lawrence was the leader of the state parliamentary Labor Party in Western Australia. That policy was devised to try to resolve the conflicting Green and mining interests in the area of national parks. That policy was applied by the Lawrence government and, as I understand it, is applied by the current government, although I stand to be corrected on that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us examine that policy because it offers a very sensible middle path to the resolution of these issues. In respect of the D'Entrecasteaux National Park, the policy expressly applies four principles. It says that further exploration of the national park is expressly authorised for 36 months from November 1990. Secondly, after this period no more than one per cent of the total land area will be excised from the park. Thirdly, additional land of equal or greater size will be incorporated into the park. Fourthly, the relevant company will commit to value adding and secondary processing of the mined product in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> So that resolution of conflict policy, as outlined in those four points, was adopted by the parliamentary Labor Party in 1990 when Dr Lawrence was the leader of the government in that day. It was applied throughout the life of her government and, as I under stand it, has been applied by governments after that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The state parliamentary Labor Party endorsed those principles and added a number of other restrictions in June of this year when it considered this issue. Firstly, it required a report from CSIRO relating to hydrology of the Lake Jasper area; secondly, an environmental assessment of the proposed mine site; thirdly, revegetation of the mine site to acceptable nature vegetation standards; and, fourthly, a further statement concerning a commitment to secondary processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Western Australian state parliamentary Labor Party brought a very moderate and sensible approach to this problem of mining in national parks. It followed longstanding policy established by the Lawrence Labor government: it accepted excision of the boundary area of the national park for the purpose of mining; it required the company to purchase and gift to the state a parcel of land of equal or superior condition to that which had been excised; it required complete rehabilitation of the mine site at the conclusion of the mining process; and, finally, it required value adding of the mined product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would submit to the Senate that this is a most sensible and balanced position. It protects the long&hyphen;term integrity of the park; enlarges the size of the park; protects the vegetation, the flora and the fauna by requiring rehabilitation; allows development, wealth creation, value adding and employment to grow; resolves conflict; is not all for one side or the other, but it does protect the long&hyphen;term interests of greens and conservationists; advances the immediate interests of miners, mine workers and their families; and is a considered and rational approach to resolution of these seemingly intractable documents. I commend that resolution of conflict policy to the Senate for consideration.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the comments made by my colleague who preceded me in this debate, Senator Bishop, and, indeed, the comments by my leader in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, earlier on this legislation before the chamber. I appreciate that there is not a great deal of time for me to make a contribution this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4464"> evening. But, hopefully, at some time in the future, as a senator for Western Australia, I will have an opportunity to make a more in&hyphen;depth and detailed contribution on this matter which is extremely important to the citizens of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My attention was drawn earlier today to a comment on the bottom of a pamphlet published earlier this year on the issue by the D'Entrecasteaux Coalition, an environmental group operating out of Denmark in Western Australia. On the bottom of the front page of the pamphlet, they make the statement which I wholeheartedly endorse:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you haven't seen this breathtaking part of the State, set aside time to pay it a visit. The scenery is unforgettable.</PARA>
<PARA>They are obviously talking about the national park in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The company, Cable Sands Western Australia, appear to appreciate that point of view as well. In a pamphlet which Senator Crane tabled earlier in the debate, they also draw attention to the environmental aspects of the area where sand mining is proposed. In that information document, they draw attention to the scientific surveys that have occurred: the hydrological study of Lake Jasper; the dieback survey; the vegetation studies; the fauna studies; and the Linnean studies of Lake Jasper. They also take account of the Aboriginal interests in the area, and I am quite appreciative that they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some representatives of the company came to Canberra earlier this week and sought to meet with myself and other Labor senators from Western Australia. I was certainly glad I had the opportunity to meet them. I met with Mr Ken Mills and Mr Christopher Davies to discuss the matter and to have them put their points of view to me as a senator representing the state of Western Australia. I make this point very clearly so that there is no confusion: Mr Mills and Mr Davies left the consultation that I had with them under no misapprehension that no commitments were given one way or the other from myself to support their proposal for mining in that particular region of my state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I have obviously followed the debate on the matter. It has been the subject of quite con siderable debate in Western Australia. My colleague Senator Bishop has referred to some of the debates that have taken place in both the upper house and the lower house of the state parliament. Unlike my colleagues in the state parliament of Western Australia, I have not had the opportunity to do an on&hyphen;site inspection of the proposal. One of the things that I put to company representatives when I met with them on Monday of this week was that I would like to do not only an on&hyphen;the&hyphen;ground inspection, but when you look at a map of Lake Jasper, one appreciates that the only way you can get to it is by foot, so I would also like to fly over the area in order to get a proper appreciation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the pamphlet which Senator Crane tabled earlier, there is a photograph which shows the lake, the proposed mining area and the area that Cable Sands proposed to transfer in exchange for the area that they want to mine. Quite clearly and quite graphically, the photograph contained in the pamphlet shows some of the area that is being handed back. I thought it looked like an area that had been mined previously. It does not make a particularly pretty picture in the brochure that the company put out. The photographs contained in a different publication, to which I have had access, put the matter in a somewhat different light. But I do not think you could do any better than see what the proposal is all about at first hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate on the proposal for this project will go on for some considerable period. The debate in the Senate on this bill is a useful adjunct to that overall debate.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(7.14 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the government members' minority report into the abolition of DIFF, the development import finance facility. This inquiry was nothing more than a cynical attempt by the opposition to discredit the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer. The opposition at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4466"> tempted to do this in the other place last July and, after having failed, they decided to set in place an inquiry in a further effort to discredit the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the numbers in the Senate, the inquiry went to a Senate references committee on which the opposition has a majority. I think that was inappropriate, but that is an argument for another time. The opposition's report is a last ditch stand to bring the minister to task&mdash;and what a weak attempt it is. Nothing has come out of this inquiry, after weeks of evidence and close interrogation by the opposition, that was not known before. No additional information has come to light that has not already been forwarded by the minister, firstly, in his statement to the parliament on 26 June and, secondly, in his subsequent letter to the Speaker on 19 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the opposition majority report can come up with were the following recommendations: firstly, that Mr Downer be requested to appear before the committee to give evidence; secondly, that the Senate order the Minister for Foreign Affairs to provide the committee with more documents and more information; and, thirdly, an extension of time for the committee to report to the Senate on terms of reference (d) and (f) by one month after the first two recommendations are complied with. This is a pretty weak effort. This is after putting five senior AusAID and DFAT officials through an interrogation, which included over 900 questions, over a period of nine hours in four separate sessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The senior officers who faced this barrage included: two deputy secretaries, a first assistant secretary and two assistant secretaries from DFAT; and the Director-General of AusAID. AusAID and DFAT also submitted a comprehensive 105-page joint submission. As well, a considerable amount of additional material has since been provided in writing by AusAID and DFAT. The government has been entirely open and cooperative. The only information not provided was information which no government would consider releasing due to considerations of national interest; that being the confidentiality that exists between governments and their officials and inter-government communications&mdash;all of this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in a futile attempt to bring the minister into disrepute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is worth noting that the minister's non-appearance was in accordance with proper procedure and consistent with the long tradition observed by governments of both persuasions that ministers from the House of Representatives do not appear before Senate committees. We can all well remember Mr Keating's famous statement in December 1992, where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then you want a Minister from the House of Representatives chamber to wander over to the unrepresentative chamber and account for himself. You have got to be joking. Whether the Treasurer wished to go there or not, I would forbid him going to the Senate to account to this unrepresentative swill over there&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That was the reply to a request of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council for both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to appear. I also recall that, in 1994 in the Senate select committee on the print media of which I was a member, we attempted to call the Treasurer to come before the committee to answer some queries about the operation of the FIRB. The Treasurer refused to provide documents and, in fact, instructed officers not to give evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other recommendation in the majority report that I take particular exception to is that the withdrawal of funding has had a serious effect on Australia-Indonesia relations or in fact on Australia's relations with the four DIFF recipient countries or in fact other regional countries in east Asia and the South Pacific. As the minority report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia's relations with China, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines are multi&hyphen;faceted and multi&hyphen;layered and not so fragile as to fracture over the termination of the DIFF scheme and that the aid relationship is only one small part of the overall bilateral relationships.</PARA>
<PARA>It further states that the government's decision to provide additional funding of $64 million for high priority projects, able to be nominated by recipient country governments, will go some considerable distance toward accommodating those high priority project applications that had significantly advanced through <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4467"> the selection process at the time of the scheme's termination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the majority report adequately describes the scheme's history and evolution, the manner in which the opposition members have interpreted aspects of the evidence fails to take into account both the breadth of the evidence presented to the committee and the economic imperatives underpinning the decision to terminate the scheme. It must be remembered that this government inherited a $8 billion deficit on 2 March. It is sensible that some contribution be made to that from the aid budget. It would not be possible, nor desirable, to exempt the aid budget while other departments and programs bear the full brunt of cost cutting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to say a few words in regard to the equal impact on the Australian economy and on those Australian companies who had been involved in the DIFF scheme. Whilst the evidence presented to the committee did not enable a definitive assessment regarding the extent to which DIFF provided industry assistance to exporters to be made, the evidence provided by some company representatives indicated that a concessional finance package was necessary in order to engage in project negotiations with certain countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst individual companies detailed the commercial benefits flowing to them as a result of winning DIFF support, the net effect on the Australian economy is unclear. There have been a number of inquiries provided by the government, some of which remained reasonably unpublished, including making DIFF better, which bore that position out.</PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.20 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  this morning headed  `Aboriginal infant mortality three times that of others'. I would like to say a little about Aboriginal health in Australia and Western Australia in particular. Much has been said recently in the media about Aboriginal health and, more specifically, World Vision over the last week or so has criticised the record of Aboriginal health in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on record in the Senate the other side of the story about Aboriginal health issues in Western Australia and I am sure in other parts of Australia as well. The truth of the matter is that, while there are certainly still significant health problems in the area of Aboriginal health, a great deal of progress has been made. I think the very dedicated people who work in the Aboriginal health area deserve to be recognised for their contributions. Instead of a constant stream of disheartening brickbats, I would like to see those dedicated health workers receive a few bouquets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important point I would like to make is that, were the solutions to the problems of Aboriginal heath simple, the problems which exist in Aboriginal health would have been solved long ago. Were it just a matter of providing more funding for Aboriginal health, again the problems would have been solved long ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason why Aboriginal health problems have persisted is precisely because the whole question of Aboriginal health is very complex indeed. Factors which are relevant to the problems in Aboriginal health include cultural factors, such as the fact that Aborigines living in remote communities often sleep with dogs which, for example, carry scabies, which is thereby passed on to both children and adults. The Pilbara Public Health Service now has a program to encourage Aboriginal <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4468"> communities to accept the need to treat diseases in dogs and vaccinate dogs in camps. Only experience would have brought that problem to light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also relevant is the fact that Aborigines in remote communities do not like living in western style housing, but prefer to live in open style accommodation in which there is little protection from the elements so that babies and older children get frequent chest infections. Last November, I attended the Kimberley medical conference in Broome at which Aboriginal health issues were discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems which was highlighted was that resources are not unlimited and medical services can only be provided to reasonably permanent communities. Servicing difficulties arose with the proliferation of temporary out&hyphen;stations located away from the main communities. The out&hyphen;stations often comprise only small groups of people and it is just not physically possible for medical staff to maintain services to them. The same applies to the provision of other government funded infrastructure such as housing, water, sewerage, power, schools and roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health problems faced by adult Aborigines include a high incidence of blood pressure and diabetes which is undoubtedly related to the adoption of a western diet. The key to dealing with these problems is to change the diet of Aboriginals, but that is more easily said than done. It seems that Aboriginals are genetically disposed to storing excess energy as fat. This is said to be due to the effect of the so-called thrifty gene. A Monash University study showed a few years ago that when Aborigines are returned to their traditional diet they lose weight and their diabetes and high  blood pressure gets better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been significant improvements in the health of Aboriginal people in Western Australia over the past two decades. These improvements are particularly reflected by child health statistics. In 1970 in Western Australia, Aboriginal infant mortality was estimated at 46 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to 15 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1993.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia, the case fatality rate for gastroenteritis in 1970 was approximately five per cent among Aboriginal infants. It is now close to zero. There has also been a significant decline in infant and child hospitalisation rates for respiratory tract diseases in Western Australia over the same period. While there was little information about immunisation coverage among Aboriginal children in 1970 there are now very high rates of coverage&mdash;in excess of 95 per cent&mdash;for vaccine preventible diseases in Aboriginal children throughout Western Australia. Furthermore, in the Kimberley region of WA there has been a significant increase of about 50 grams in the mean birth weight of Aboriginal babies over the past 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These improvements have been primarily due to the concerted efforts of public and community health services that provide such services as maternal and child health programs, immunisation programs, screening programs for diseases, abnormalities in young children and the provision of preventative services to counter problems such as sexually transmitted diseases and alcoholism and to improve the diet of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last decade, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of the role of Aboriginal health workers and Aboriginal environmental health workers in the improvement of the health of Aboriginal people. This led to accredited training courses and career structures for health workers in 1994 and current negotiations to develop a similar training program and career structure for environmental health workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The health department of Western Australia increased the focus on Aboriginal health in the 1980s by the establishment of an Aboriginal health policy unit. In November 1995, a restructure of the health department led to the establishment of the Office of Aboriginal Health which aims to deliver an effective and efficient health service that best meets the cultural and traditional needs of the Aboriginal people of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to name a few of the dedicated individuals who have made great contributions to the improvement of Aboriginal health in the north of Western Australia in the last <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4469"> 20 years. Dr Lawson Holman was for many years the Kimberley regional surgeon based in Derby. He thought up the concept of mobile field nurses who could take preventative medical care out to Aboriginal communities which developed into the WA Community Health Nursing Service. Dr Randy Spargo, as the Director of Kimberley Public Health, did important work on nutritional deficiencies in Aborigines for which he was awarded an Order of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are nurses such as Helen Sullivan, who also received an Order of Australia for her work with Aboriginal communities in the Fitzroy River Valley, and Sister Sally Murray Connelly, who for nearly 20 years has once a week driven a four&hyphen;wheel drive vehicle out to the Yande Yarra community on the banks of the Yule River in Pilbara to provide largely preventative medical services to that community. There are many more doctors, nurses and Aboriginal health workers, such as Vicky Dhu, Jenny Baraga and May Eckerman, who have likewise worked hard to improve Aboriginal health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, while significant improvements have been made over the last 20 years with respect to some aspects of the health of Aboriginal people, unfortunately it is still true that the level of ill&hyphen;health among the Aboriginal population of Western Australia and Australia in general remains disturbingly high compared with levels in non&hyphen;Aboriginal people. That is a matter which should rightly concern the Senate and all members of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I believe the Senate should respect the fact that a great deal of effort is going into bringing these sad statistics about Aboriginal health into line with the record for other Australians and not be tempted into the trap of accepting the kind of simplistic criticisms which are made by people in organisations who really know very little about what is being done to improve Aboriginal health in this country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

It saddens me that this is necessary. It is a national disgrace that Ms Hanson's views have been allowed to remain virtually unchallenged, especially by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I agree and endorse that free speech is one of the most important principles that a democracy is built upon, but free speech requires vigilance so that ignorant and intolerant comment is challenged. Ms Hanson's speech and her subsequent public comments represent some of the most ignorant contributions to public debate in many years. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator CONROY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pauline Hanson. I almost do not know where to start. Ms Hanson uses the figure of 40 per cent over 11 years to imply that Australia, a country of over 17 million people, is in danger of being swamped. The average immigration intake over that period from 1984&hyphen;85 to 1994&hyphen;95 was 102,188 per financial year. That makes a total of approximately 1,226,000 for the period. Of these, according to Ms Hanson, 40 per cent were of Asian origin. This equates to less than 2.9 per cent of the total population. Ms Hanson's views are paranoid and deceitful. I guess the old line `lies, damn lies and statistics' is appropriate in this case. There is no danger of being swamped as she claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Ms Hanson then moves on to assert that they, the Asians, have their own culture, form ghettos and do not assimilate. These remarks echo statements from racists in the past who claimed the same of Italian, Greek, Macedonian, Lebanese and Turkish immigrants. What has history shown us? Let it be the judge of the racists of the 1950s and 1960s. Australia is a much richer country in every way for the contribution of the southern European migrants of the 1950s and 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I live in Melbourne, which I consider to be the centre of multiculturalism in Australia. I shudder to think what life would be like without the rich diversity provided by these <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4470"> migrants in community activity, the arts, business, medicine, culture and, of course, that great Victorian religion, Australian Rules Football. My life would not be the same if I had not been able to stand in the outer at Victoria Park cheering the skills of that Macedonian marvel Peter Daicos and the skills of Saverio Rocca. By mentioning the footy, I do not want senators to think for a moment that I wish to trivialise this issue. Pauline Hanson challenges the greatest tradition of this country&mdash;a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In Victoria earlier this year we had a state election. The Labor Party did not fare well, but in the seat of Clayton, Mr Hong Lim, the first Cambodian born MP, was elected; in the west of Melbourne, Mr Sang Nguyen, Australia's first Vietnamese born MP, was elected. I proudly declare that both of these people are close personal friends who have enriched my life, broadened my horizons and, most importantly, are excellent contributors on behalf of their constituents. It saddens me greatly that if Pauline Hanson had her way neither of these people would have been allowed into Australia. Australia would have been much the poorer for this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I live in what Ms Hanson would have you believe is a ghetto&mdash;the municipality of Footscray. I have been an elected councillor for this area and I was privileged to serve on council with my friend Ms Mai Ho&mdash;Australia's first female Vietnamese councillor. I challenge Ms Hanson, who makes such a play of her simple origins, to come to the Footscray Mall on a Saturday morning and to actually view the harmony in our Footscray community. Yes, we have poverty; yes, we have illness, drugs and all of the other social problems that afflict other communities in Australia. But the quiet determination of the overwhelming number of people in Footscray is to build a better life for themselves and their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty&hyphen;eight per cent of our municipality are from non-English speaking backgrounds. They have come to Australia with nothing but hope, and now they must endure the racism and bigotry of people such as Ms Hanson. I have witnessed first hand the effect of ignorance that Ms Hanson is now the martyr for if you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> read today's paper. The hate, the hurt and the tears are caused by people who will be encouraged by her views; people who feel free to vilify Australians on the street because they look different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, Ms Mai Ho was one of my colleagues on the Footscray Council. In fact, she was the Deputy Mayor of Footscray when Jeff Kennett abolished local governments in Victoria. But I am willing to predict that she will be re&hyphen;elected to the new council next year, and one day she will be Australia's first female Vietnamese mayor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Asian community do have their own distinct culture and religion and I have participated in many of their cultural and religious events. Their community events, despite the ignorant views of Ms Hanson and her ilk, are a blend of Asian and Australian activities. The Tet Festival is an excellent example of this. Many members on the opposite side have been to the Tet Festival held in Footscray Park every year and I congratulate them on that. It is a brilliant display of dragon dance, music, fairground rides, sporting activities and stalls of diverse nature. This festival is a joyous occasion shared by people of all backgrounds in Footscray and from throughout Melbourne. It is not the cause of a Bosnia&hyphen;style situation as her alarmist claims would have you believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I would now like to turn to the role of the Prime Minister, particularly in light of the campaign slogan used by the coalition in the last election, `For all of us'. It now seems that `us' does not include Australians who have an Asian background. John Howard should know better than anyone that he was elected as Prime Minister to lead all Australians. He craves to be a statesman; history will not remember him so. Yes, free speech is vital but by going missing in action in response to Ms Hanson he shames himself and he shames Australia by his silence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Imagine if a Malaysian MP stood up and called Australians `Asia's white trash'. Australian newspapers would be in a frenzy. We would all demand that the Prime Minister of Malaysia publicly repudiate these views. Australia's Prime Minister has failed this critical test. As Pauline Hanson's views are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4471"> reported unchallenged in our region, Australia is diminished. Australians of Asian origin deserve the Prime Minister's public support.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The WA royal commission recommended that a new office, to be called the Commissioner for the Investigation of Corrupt and Improper Conduct, be established. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the proposed Commissioner should possess . . . powers, enabling him or her to deal not only with narrowly defined official corruption, but also with improper conduct by public officials. The Commissioner should also be concerned with preventative and educative measures designed to combat corrupt and improper conduct. In other words, the body we propose has a significantly broader function than the existing OCC. The office should become one of the primary independent parliamentary agencies of the State.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this office would be to provide the people of Western Australia with a body having powers to receive complaints about official corruption and also to deal with improper conduct. The Western Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> royal commission also recommended that, notwithstanding the embarrassment or difficulties it may create, whistleblowing legislation was desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian royal commission identified the vital prerequisites for a whistleblowing scheme for Western Australia, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) that it be credible so that officials and others not only feel that they can use it with confidence but also can expect their disclosures will receive proper consideration and investigation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that it is purposive in the sense that the procedures it establishes will facilitate the correction of maladministration and misconduct where found to exist; and, (c) that it provides reassurance both to the public and to the persons who use it. Consistently with the preservation of confidentiality in relation to operational matters there should be appropriate reporting to parliament. The public is entitled to know that, where allegations are made, they have been investigated and, if substantiated, remedial action taken. Persons using it are entitled to expect that they will be protected from reprisal.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission on Government recommended at recommendation 66 the inclusion of `improper conduct' within the Official Corruption Commission's jurisdiction; at recommendation 69 that the commission should receive, oversee and investigate all complaints against police; at recommendation 70 that the commission should be accountable to parliament and the people; and at recommendation 73 that whistleblowers disclosure legislation is a mechanism for the prevention and exposure of impropriety and corruption in Western Australia. Currently only people who provide information which is within the jurisdiction of the OCC can be protected against reprisals under statutory and common law protection. This means that for people wishing to raise issues of improper conduct which fall outside the new act's definition only limited protection exists. New legislation should be enacted to protect people who make public interest disclosures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 74 recommends that additional protection for whistleblowers, including the provision of both a criminal and disciplinary offence for any person who takes reprisal action.

Recommendation 80 recommends that false, misleading or malicious disclosures or allegations which a person knows to be false, misleading or malicious should be a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Court government made amendments to the Official Corruption Commission. The Court government has denied the will of parliament by failing to proclaim the Official Corruption Commission Amendment Act 1996 in its entirety. The substantive provisions of the act have not been proclaimed. See the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Australian Gazette</EMPHASIS>, 30 August 1996, No. 124. The sections which have been proclaimed by the Court government are those which change the name of the commission to the Anti-Corruption Commission and establish new eligibility requirements for the commissioners. This begs the question: is it the government's intention to proclaim the rest of the act before the election? A government that was genuinely pursuing corrupt, illegal and improper conduct in its public institutions would have no hesitation in strengthening and widening the powers of the Anti-Corruption Commission now for the benefit of all West Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of deficiencies in the new Official Corruption Commission Amendment Act 1996 passed to establish the Anti-Corruption Commission. The Western Australian government's new ACC fails to meet a number of recommendations made by the Commission on Government and these can be identified as follows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the heading `Philosophy', principles such as openness, transparency, accountability and independence are lacking in the legislation establishing the ACC. There has been a failure by the government to approach anti-corruption measures comprehensively. While the government has passed legislation which deals with disclosures on corrupt and criminal conduct by public officials, it fails to correspondingly implement provisions for public interest disclosures such as the establishment of a whistleblower scheme to encourage such disclosure. There is no responsibility by CEOs or agencies to establish internal procedures to facilitate the making of disclosure or to develop and encourage an ethical climate&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is, through codes of conduct or induction. Nor is there responsibility of chief executive officers or agencies to protect internal whistleblowers or to address and establish anti-corruption measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to powers, although the powers of a special investigator appointed by the proposed ACC are considerable, namely the powers of a royal commission, the limitations to the powers of the proposed commission are nevertheless extensive. Some of these limitations are as follows. The proposed ACC only has recommendatory powers, not powers of investigation. The new legislation fails to keep the Anti-Corruption Commission out of executive hands. The reporting requirements of the ACC are limited and are still blanketed in secrecy as it is not mandatory for the ACC to report to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Powers of the ACC to receive information and investigate allegations about the conduct of a person in his or her capacity as to the holder of a judicial office are limited to matters which relate to an offence under section 122 of the Criminal Code. It does not, therefore, have the power to investigate less serious activities such as improper conduct. Although attempts have been made to encompass members of parliament within the ACC's jurisdiction, ancillary amendments linking the jurisdiction of the ACC to a breach of code of conduct of an MP are lacking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to ex-Public Service officers, no enforcement provisions have been provided, even though the ACC may receive allegations and invoke investigations against ex-Public Service officers. The ACC may only report facts and may not make findings. This may prove difficult without some guidelines in relation to weight, standard of proof and credibility of evidence. Even though the special investigator has the powers of a royal commission if appointed, that evidence may only be taken in private. This does not correspondingly endow the ACC with even the appearance of openness, accountability and independence. Save for listening device authorised use, no police powers have been given to the ACC. The ACC has no powers to provide protection for whistleblowers from <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4473"> threat or harassment. The ACC has no enforcement powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to accountability, secrecy provisions are still inhibitive of openness, transparency and accountability. The reporting provisions under the Financial Administration and Audit Act should be more specific. There is no provision for compulsory reporting to parliament. This means that the ACC is a creature of the executive and in the current structure it is not accountable to the parliament and, therefore, to the people. There is no legislative requirement for a joint standing committee of parliament to be established and the new legislation fails to establish whistleblower legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to whistleblowers, the failure of the government to implement comprehensive whistleblowing provisions or legislation is a fundamental weakness in this new legislation which is intended to establish a commission which investigates, exposes and prevents corruption and impropriety. While the new ACC provides somewhere for whistleblowers to go and disclose their information, a similar function is served by a number of other agencies, the ombudsman and the police. The ACC does not provide protection for whistleblowers who make disclosures which are within the jurisdiction of the commission. It also does not provide other services such as advice or counselling for whistleblowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ACC has no anti&hyphen;corruption functions as recommended by the Commission on Government. In the absence of efforts to encourage the prevention of corruption as part of the climate of the public and private sector, the battle to encourage disclosure will be more difficult. Where corruption and improper conduct is considered to be the norm, not only will disclosure be more difficult but an awareness of what is corrupt and improper will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a coherent system. The proposed changes do not appear to be made with reference to the current inadequacies as highlighted by the Commission on Government concerning the Public Sector Management Act 1994 and the current legislative and operational inadequacies of the state ombudsman. The current legislation does not ensure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that all public agencies are included in the ACC jurisdiction as recommended by the Commission on Government.

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.47 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to draw to the attention of the Senate more evidence regarding the failings of the coalition government to implement policies and commitments that they gave at the election in March. There are numerous examples that one could give, as has been demonstrated over recent days regarding the inability of this government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to live up to the commitments they made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the commitments that the now Prime Minister made was to `maintain the real value of all pension benefits and other entitlements for low income earners.' One of the most disgraceful decisions of this government contained in the budget is the proposal to axe the Commonwealth dental health program. This was a program introduced by the previous Labor government to provide equity of access to dental health care for less fortunate members of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme provided funds to hospitals so as to reduce the waiting list for those unable <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4474"> to afford dental care. Funding for the program was in the order of $350 million over the last three years of the Labor government. There is no doubt that this program was a success. Since its introduction, waiting lists for people waiting for dental treatment have reduced from some two years or more down to, in most cases, approximately one month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure all honourable senators recognise the distress that can exist for people, particularly elderly people on pensions, waiting for dental treatment. To have to wait for two years or more was indeed a matter of great concern, and the previous Labor government introduced this scheme to reduce that waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an outstanding success, recognised by many health care groups, hospitals, dental services and others throughout the community. What it meant was that pensioners and health care card holders had access to real, ongoing preventative dental care, not just emergency care. In the last financial year of the Labor government, 1995&hyphen;96, it spent around $106 million on the program and, all told, around 500,000 people were able to be treated under this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately&mdash;and unfortunately particularly for many people living in western Sydney&mdash;this program is to be abolished. In its first budget the coalition government cut funds available to dental clinics and consequently we are going to see a massive reduction in services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who will be affected? For a start, 36 per cent of those that were using the program were aged pensioners, so the elderly will be affected. Thirty per cent of people accessing the program were in receipt of other pension entitlements such as sole parents, disability pensions and so on. Of course, many of the unemployed were able to access this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All told, around 21,000 people in western Sydney alone received emergency or preventative health care. In areas such as Westmead, the Nepean, Mount Druitt and Katoomba many people were able to receive treatment as a result of this program. Therefore it is very distressing and disturbing for the people of western Sydney&mdash;many of whom will get an opportunity next Saturday in the Lindsay <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by&hyphen;election to pass judgment upon this government&mdash;to see this program being wound down and eventually abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Tuesday in the Senate the minister responsible in this chamber, Senator Newman, was waxing lyrical about how she had visited the electorate of Lindsay to assist her friend the Liberal candidate, who could not even get her own nomination correct. The minister was in the electorate to try and help, in a belated way, the candidate from the Liberal party to regain the seat. I would not mind betting that there were two places in the electorate that the minister did not get to visit and in fact avoided visiting. They would be, firstly, the Wentworth Area Health Services and, secondly, the Blue Mountains District Health Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason she would not have wanted to visit these two health service providers is that they would have given very bad news to the minister about the impact of this decision. For instance, the Wentworth area health service has indicated that the impact of this decision will be such that five people from the health service will be expected to lose their jobs before the end of this year. That is a huge cut in the provision of services available for the many people living in the area who will want to access them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All told, it is expected that around 100 patient visits per week will be lost as a result of the impact of this cut and eventual abolition of this program from the Wentworth area health service. It has also been indicated by the health services within western Sydney that, as a result of the abolition of this program, the waiting lists will soar back up again&mdash;they will increase from around one month, which is now the approximate waiting time, to up to two years and maybe even longer. For anybody waiting for dental treatment for that length of time, particularly the elderly, it must be incredibly distressing. It is a cruel, indeed despicable, action on the part of this government to cut funding from such a worthwhile program which has delivered relief to so many hundreds of thousands of people in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This ill-conceived policy now adopted by the coalition, in breach of the commitment <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4475"> given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to maintain benefits for pensioners and other welfare recipients, will destroy the provision of dental care for the real battlers of the Lindsay electorate. It may be okay for the millionaire shareholders on the front bench of the government to pay $200 or more an hour for dental treatment, but there are many people in Lindsay and in other parts of western Sydney who cannot afford that and who do not have the opportunity to even consider having a share portfolio. They will get their chance on Saturday to re-elect Ross Free as the member for Lindsay and to start to put an end to the sorts of policies that this government is seeking to inflict upon the residents of that electorate and upon people of western Sydney&mdash;the real battlers in this community.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the Honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) &amp; (b)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The figure of more than $76,000 is the cost per net impact of the JobSkills program. That is the cost of each extra job obtained by JobSkills participants, over and above jobs that were obtained by those who did not receive assistance. This cost is calculated with reference to program net unit costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net unit cost of JobSkills is derived from the average gross unit cost of assistance and estimated savings in Newstart Allowance (NSA) payments accruing to the Department of Social Security (DSS) as a result of jobseekers participating in the program. The formula for calculating net unit costs was developed in collaboration with DSS, the Department of Finance and the Treasury. The formula includes a range of parameters amongst which are the duration of program assistance, the proportion of participants on NSA and averaged NSA rates. In relation to calculation of the figure reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, the gross cost of JobSkills was $9,971 for each person assisted. The offset or reduction for savings in NSA payments was $3,845, giving a net unit cost of $6,126.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Program net impact is measured by comparing the unsubsidised employment levels of former participants and those of similar long term unemployed who were not assisted. Program participants and non&hyphen;participants are matched on key criteria such as duration of unemployment, age, gender, educational attainment and geographical location. Comparisons of this kind have shown that while 6 months after leaving the program 39 percent of JobSkills participants were in unsubsidised work, 31 percent of those not assisted were also in unsubsidised jobs. This means that there is an increase of 8 percentage points in the likelihood of any individual finding work as a consequence of participating in the program and implies a cost to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Government of $76,575 for each person who got a job as a result of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) &amp; (b) The gross unit cost of New Work Opportunities is $12,700. The offset for DSS allowance reductions is $2,691, giving a net unit cost of $10,009. The Department's data show that just 22 percent of former New Work Opportunities participants have progressed to unsubsidised jobs. In view of this extremely low post program employment level, and assuming a level of effectiveness not dissimilar to that of JobSkills, a cost of at least $100,000 per net impact could be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The breakdown of costs for deriving cost per net impact figures and the method of calculation have been fully detailed in the answers to parts one and two of this question. Additional information on the calculation of net unit costs for all major labour market programs is publicly available. The findings of net impact studies are routinely released by the Department and a full report on the evaluation of JobSkills will be published in due course. Details of employment outcomes for the New Work Opportunities program and associated expenditure information will be published, along with figures for all other programs, in the Department's 1995&hyphen;96 Annual Report.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1996&hyphen;97 Budget provides for the most significant reorganisation of labour market assistance in fifty years. In the lead up to the introduction of the new arrangements in December 1997, the current case management system will continue under the Employment Services Act. The Employment Services Regulatory Authority is currently undertaking a new tender round for the period 1 December 1996 to 30 November 1997. It is envisaged that expenditure on case management in this period will be some $197 million. Under the arrangements to apply from December 1997, some CES staff will transfer to a new service delivery agency to provide registration, assessment, referral and compliance services. The remaining CES staff will join with Employment Assistance Australia staff to form the new corporatised public employment placement enterprise (EPE). The public EPE will compete with private and community sector EPEs to provide employment services to job seekers. Job seekers will be able to nominate their preferred EPE. There will be increased choice for job seekers as the full range of employment services, not just case management, will be available from the private, community and public sectors.</PARA>
