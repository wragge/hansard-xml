<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the key challenges this nation faces is to preserve its natural environmental capital for the benefit of our children and grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians overwhelmingly believe that environment protection and economic growth are equally important. The challenge for Australia is to sustain the rapid advances in living standards that have been achieved in the 20th century in a way that protects the life support systems which are increasingly threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a challenge that all governments around the world must accept. Every society has a responsibility to future generations to leave an environment which is at least as healthy and productive as the one they inherit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to tackle these challenges head-on by establishing a one billion dollar Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. This Trust is the major mechanism for the implementation of the Coalition Government's policies for the protection and rehabilitation of Australia's natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiatives to be funded from the Trust are aimed at reversing the decline in our natural <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4715"> capital. They will contribute to the conservation, repair and enhancement of Australia's unique environment into the 21st Century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the first time in the nation's history a Commonwealth Government has established a Trust for such a purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trust will provide funding certainty for important natural heritage programs of this Coalition Government for the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall the government will spend an additional $1.15 billion over the next 5 years, on a comprehensive package of measures aimed at tackling the environmental and sustainable agriculture challenges facing Australia. The Trust is the centrepiece upon which this extensive package of measures depends.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia must seize the opportunity to play a leading role as a clean, green nation. This objective is not only of environmental importance but will produce major economic benefits and job opportunities for regional Australia and the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is a key plank in meeting this challenge. It is part of the largest and most comprehensive commitment to action on the environment and to restoring our natural capital by any national government in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me put the initiative in its proper context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have inherited an environment in serious difficulties. Little of our natural environment has escaped modification, and what remains is under increasing pressure. It is estimated that over 5 million hectares of native vegetation were cleared during the decade between 1983 and 1993. Once widespread species are declining. Some 20 mammal, 20 bird and 68 plant species are already presumed extinct. Many of our wetlands have disappeared and the water quality and flows of our key rivers are dramatically reduced. The productive capacity of our land has been damaged through erosion, salinity, loss of structure or acidification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These problems have a direct impact on people in our community who, quite rightly, expect quality water to drink and clean air to breathe. They do not want to see precious soils blown away in the wind, blue-green algae spoiling our rivers and streams, or our unique flora and fauna at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of this Trust enables Australia to take a dramatic leap forward in the sustainable management of our natural capital. It provides the opportunity to take a new approach to environmental protection and natural resource management, and to design and integrate programs to ensure strong multiple outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to explain the Trust in more detail.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">OPERATION OF THE TRUST</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will establish the Trust and provide for it to be known as the "Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve". The initial capital of one billion dollars to be invested in the Trust will come from the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In effect, the transfer of funds from the partial sale of Telstra into the Natural Heritage Trust represents a transfer from investment in a telecommunications company to an investment in natural capital. Maintaining and restoring this natural capital is an investment in the well-being of future generations of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For too long Australia has taken its extraordinary endowment of natural resources for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have failed to take into account the depletion and degradation of our natural capital and we have failed to make the investments in management and works necessary to arrest and reverse the depreciation of our natural resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not by chance that the Government's natural heritage package is focused around the big issues of our time&mdash;land and water degradation; coastal protection and the conservation of biodiversity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each has a compelling claim on our resources, but if we were to simply deal with each separately the results would be modest. We would be perpetuating the mistakes of the past if we were to attempt to deal with each of these issues in isolation from each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trust, and the range of initiatives it will support, is based on a recognition that an integrated approach is needed right across the spectrum of problems we face. The initiatives to be funded from the Trust have therefore been strategically developed around five interdependent environmental packages:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Vegetation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Rivers;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Biodiversity;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Landcare; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Coasts and Oceans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within these five packages, seven hundred million dollars of the money invested in the Trust from the partial sale of Telstra will be devoted entirely to five capital projects aimed at maintaining, protecting and replenishing Australia's natural environmental capital. These projects, which will be conducted over a five year period, are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the National Vegetation Initiative;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the Murray-Darling 2001 Project;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the National Reserve System;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the National Land and Water Resources Audit; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the Coasts and Clean Seas Initiative. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4716"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These five capital initiatives will be complemented by a comprehensive range of other environmental and sustainable agriculture initiatives announced as part of this Government's Saving our Natural Heritage and Reviving the Heartland Packages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for funds in the Trust to be invested and for all income from such investments to be returned to the Trust. The Bill also enables funds from a number of other sources to be paid into the Trust. This will include, for example, budget appropriations and gifts or bequests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All interest earned from the Trust and other non-Telstra monies invested in the Trust will be able to be spent on other environmental and sustainable agriculture projects, such as rivercare, endangered species, landcare, and addressing the management and control of weeds and feral animals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the five years, three hundred million dollars will remain in the Trust as a capital base. This money will be held in perpetuity, to continue to enhance the quality of our environment for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trust will be the source of funds for a number of the Government's environment and sustainable land and water programs, which are managed within both the Environment and Primary Industries and Energy Portfolios.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To facilitate the management of the Trust as a partnership between the two Portfolios, the Bill establishes a Natural Heritage Board, comprising the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The Board will provide a formal mechanism for liaison and co-operation between the two Portfolios on all matters relating to the Trust, to ensure a comprehensive integration of the Government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reflects an historic recognition that protection of the environment for future generations can only be achieved through an integrated response to our environmental and sustainable agriculture problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now like to describe the five environmental packages in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1. VEGETATION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Probably the most compelling environmental challenge for Australia is turning around the relentless long term decline in the quality and extent of our native vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated we have cleared 20 billion trees over the past 200 years and, with mechanisation, the pace of clearing increased dramatically over the past 30 to 40 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native vegetation communities, including grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests, represent priceless natural capital&mdash;underpinning biodiversity values, catchment hydrology, water quality, and of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> course the unique character of Australian landscapes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a developing consciousness of the importance of remnant vegetation to sustainable agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's National Vegetation Initiative will ameliorate the land and water degradation and the loss of biodiversity associated with the reduction in native vegetation cover since European settlement. The Initiative will support a range of revegetation activities and develop incentives for the protection and sustainable management of remnant native vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our objective is to ensure that, for the first time since European settlement, the rate of revegetation in Australia exceeds the rate of vegetation clearance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding will also be provided for a related initiative, the Farm Forestry Program. This will further promote and encourage the establishment of commercial farm forestry activities in regional areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Vegetation Initiative provides for the establishment of an expert advisory Council for Sustainable Vegetation Management which will have the task of providing advice to the Government on the Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the direct benefits of such environmental restoration, this Initiative will also provide an important addition to carbon sinks for greenhouse gases in Australia, contributing to the global effort to address climate change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Vegetation Initiative represents an historic opportunity to put in place the first integrated national program for protecting and enhancing Australia's native vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2. RIVERS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The restoration of our waterways must become a key environmental priority for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an integral part of ecological processes on which all life depends and supports a wide range of uses&mdash;industry, irrigation, urban and rural development, recreation and landscape amenity&mdash;all of which are fundamental to our quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet we have not treated our scarce water resources wisely. In the Murray Darling Basin, for example, if all the water allocations were implemented, 90 percent of the average natural flow would be diverted. That system now experiences drought level flows three years out of every four, compared to one in twenty years under natural circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government recognises that there is a need to strike a better balance between consumptive and environmental demands for water.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While current activities being carried out through joint Government and community programs are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4717"> meeting with some success, the Government believes that substantially more resources need to be allocated to improve the sustainable management and conservation of rivers and other waterways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Murray-Darling 2001 Project is an integral component of this Government's comprehensive package of water reform measures, designed to clean up our waterways and coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will complement other new programs such as the National Rivercare Initiative, which will focus on ensuring sustainable management, rehabilitation and conservation of waterways outside the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also committed to enhancing the National Wetlands Program, to encourage the conservation of Australia's precious wetlands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These initiatives will result in improved water quality, increased environmental flows, retention of essential habitat and improved waste management practices to enable reuse of waste water, stormwater and sewerage.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, we have been endowed with a splendid variety of life forms that are found nowhere else on earth. We have a great responsibility to care for and protect this unique natural heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Reserve System initiative will develop, in conjunction with the States and Territories, a comprehensive, adequate and representative National Reserve System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reserve System will incorporate prime examples of Australia's biodiversity and significant natural values. It will ensure that a representative wide range of ecosystems are protected. This will include, for example, wilderness, wild rivers, wetlands, salt marshes and grasslands. The Reserve System will also reflect the need to protect and promote the recovery of species and ecological communities that are endangered or vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Reserve System will complement off-reserve conservation activities which will include other elements of this investment package, such as the National Vegetation Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also recognises the importance of providing specific resources towards ensuring the recovery of endangered species and ecological communities and will therefore provide additional funding for the Endangered Species Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">4. LANDCARE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the success and rapid growth in landcare and the commitment by the Australian community <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to the landcare ethos, this Government believes that more urgent action is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now well accepted that we must move away from an awareness raising phase to on-ground action. Australia has a strong public interest in supporting farmers to take practical action. In return, the community must see changes in farming practices to ensure its investment has lasting environmental benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government is committed to significantly increased funding for the National Landcare Program. The additional funding will provide much needed support for implementation of plans, based on a catchment and regional approach. Substantially increased support will also be provided for the development of community initiated and managed projects on public and private land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, funding for property management planning will be provided under the Rural Adjustment Scheme in recognition that farmers need to integrate the management of their natural resources with farm business planning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will be reinforced by the provision of income tax rebate and credits for qualifying landcare works on private land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising the importance of dealing with weeds and feral pests as part of the overall natural resource management task, additional funding will also be provided for a National Feral Animal Control Strategy and for the implementation of the National Weeds Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure that our limited resources are used wisely and are focused on strategic priorities, the Trust will fund a National Land and Water Resources Audit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This audit will provide the first ever comprehensive appraisal of the extent of land and water degradation in Australia and its environmental, social and economic costs to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will incorporate an assessment of water resources to determine the extent of the resource as a step towards achieving a balance in water supply and use.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the first schedule of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The objectives contained in the schedule provide an opportunity to make a general comment on the principles underlying this bill, as well as to comment on the particular amendments which we will be moving during discussion of this schedule in the debate. The outline given to us yesterday by Senator Campbell on behalf of the government in respect of this section were extraordinarily superficial, for what are the objectives of an act? The objectives of any act are an important indication of the philosophy and the major themes that are identified in the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with a matter of this significance, I find the superficiality of the approach of the government extraordinary in respect of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4719"> changes that they are advancing, as well as justifying the various objectives that are outlined. Frankly, that does not come as a surprise, given this government's attitude to industrial relations, which is extraordinarily superficial generally. Their approach to industrial relations is marked by grandiose claims about the requirement for industrial relations reform in order to regenerate the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some two or three months ago, the grandiose claims included reduction in unemployment. They have dropped that line in recent months. They are now taking a much lower profile as a justification for reducing unemployment. I am sure they are doing this because they have looked at both the official estimate in the budget and the official projection for unemployment&mdash;which they refuse to release&mdash;which, I have no doubt, will show that unemployment is likely to remain high for some years and that the contribution that industrial relations reform makes in that area, at best, will be very minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the superficiality of the government in dealing with the objectives clause. The grandiose claims they make&mdash;the jargon they use about the requirement for flexibility, releasing the chains and shackles of the industrial relations system, the surge in productivity, and the absolute guarantee that the Prime Minister gave that no worker would be worse off&mdash;are the sorts of superficiality that we contend are manifestly incorrect and untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When looking at the objectives of the act, I want to comment on the agreed statement of the Australian Democrats and the Liberal government. It is a fairly extraordinary document. In my six years in the Senate, I cannot recall a time when the government moved amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats, as they are in this objectives section and, indeed, will be doing right throughout the bill. There may be some strategic advantage for the government in moving the amendments first, but I am surprised that the Australian Democrats would accept and adopt that position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The document itself, containing some 100 pages including 171 amendments and, obvi ously, some amendments to the objectives in schedule 1, is almost like a peace treaty in its breadth. It is a fairly extraordinary position that the Australian Democrats and the Liberal government have adopted in terms of the process. The unusual approach that has been adopted by the Democrats and the Liberals does not end with the objectives. We find that this agreement, as it relates to objectives and to all other schedules in the bill, is essentially an outcome that we could foresee, but it is a regrettable outcome because it confirms our worst fears about this industrial relations bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has emerged will bring about some improvement of the government's initial proposal. I draw the attention of government senators, particularly backbenchers, to the policy that they took to the election. Look at what Minister Reith laid down when he first released the bill some two months ago and look at what has now been agreed between the Australian Democrats and the Liberal Party as a consequence of their deal which is reflected in this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From our perspective, the bill which was released two months ago with the objectives contained therein, was an atrocious and unfair bill. I and my colleagues spoke extensively in the second reading debate on behalf of the Labor opposition about the various aspects of the unfairness and the atrocious position which this government and to some extent the Australian Democrats have now adopted as a consequence of this document. We will deal with that in considerable detail in this committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What they have done by this agreed statement of position is turn an atrocious and unfair bill that we fundamentally oppose&mdash;and will still continue to fundamentally oppose, albeit we will be moving a significant number of amendments&mdash;into an unsatisfactory bill that still contains many areas that are unfair and unsatisfactory. This is certainly highlighted in the objectives of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as we are concerned, this deal&mdash;this agreed statement of position&mdash;between the government and the Australian Democrats will continue to leave Australian workers at a significant disadvantage. There will be less security for Australian workers concerning <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4720"> their wages and conditions. Australian workers will be less secure about their jobs. They will be exposed to an increase in individual contracts and their right to collectively bargain will be significantly undermined. As I said earlier, now not even the strongest advocates of this bill are saying that it will do anything to reduce unemployment by the end of this century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, with respect to this agreed statement of position and deal between the Democrats and the Liberal government, I can recall some two months ago when we foreshadowed extensive amendments&mdash;some 300&hyphen;odd amendments that we are pursuing in the committee stage&mdash;the shock and horror that the minister, Mr Reith, expressed about how dare we foreshadow such an extensive range of amendments. How dare we do that. They had a policy and they were determined to pursue it. They had legislation. Why should we as a Labor opposition put forward such a range of amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet here today, and for the first time publicly released on Sunday&mdash;we had the opportunity to read them in some detail yesterday&mdash;we have 171 amendments from the government and the Australian Democrats vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis their deal. Contrast that with the statements from Minister Reith some months ago complaining about any foreshadowed range of amendments that Labor put forward. Yet we are given one day's notice of what was worked out between the Liberals and the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the objectives of the bill. We make it very clear in paragraph (a) that the act is to provide a framework for cooperative industrial relations, not just cooperative workplace relations, as is provided for in the government's objectives, and supported by the Australian Democrats. It is important to understand that industrial relations is not just about workplace relations and workplace negotiation. That is an important part of industrial relations. The objectives of the government purely focus on cooperative workplace relations when there should be an industry wide focus in addition to a workplace focus. This should be contained in the objectives of the bill, and it is not.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also add a requirement in paragraph (a) to encourage the pursuit of better pay. How many times has the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, reminded us that industrial relations and their approach is all about better pay for every Australian worker? Why isn't it in this bill as part of the objectives? Better pay for everyone is the nirvana that the Prime Minister promised. Where is that in the objectives of this bill? All their rhetoric has been focused on this issue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of a fair labour market, there is a change here. The government has as one of its amendments a reference to a fair labour market.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard significant comment today about the Prime Minister expressing his concern about better pay for executives. I wonder what his position will be in the sense of this bill when it is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In paragraph (b) we insert a guarantee that no employee will be worse off as a result of the implementation of this bill. In particular, no trainee or apprentice will receive less take home pay than the relative entitlement under the applicable award. Again, the Prime Minister has made it very clear time and again, both before the election and after, that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4721"> no-one will be worse off. This is vitally important, particularly in respect of trainees and apprentices, as we reflect in our change to the objectives in paragraph (b). These people are amongst the most vulnerable in the work force and this should be specifically enshrined in this bill. The Prime Minister proclaims this and Mr Reith proclaims it. What is wrong with ensuring in the objectives that no-one can be worse off as a result? I will be making some further remarks about the objectives later in this section of the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens totally oppose the philosophical directions that are so apparent in the principal object clause of this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. It is important to clearly state that the principal object clause is not just a superfluous item of rhetorical flare. Potentially, it can be used in any legal interpretation of clauses in the bill which are deemed to be unclear in intent or ambiguous. Debate on this clause is therefore very important. For example, the government's principal object clause states that the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia can be achieved through achieving such things as `international competitiveness' and `a flexible labour market'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the latter day equivalent of the trickle&hyphen;down effect and it is, in effect, a code for the reduction of pay and conditions for the vast majority of workers, particularly unskilled or low skilled workers. These workers will be forced to compete with the low wages and conditions that are endemic in developing countries. The alternative is unemployment as Australian corporations chase those low wages in developing nations. It is all part of the international race to the bottom that is a part of the new internationalism that was started by the previous Labor government with the strong support of the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to these Democrat&hyphen;government amendments Nos. 1 to 7, I would have to say that the wording is better than the previous wording; therefore I will vote for the improved wording. However, the Greens have amendments to the principal object clause. I <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> notice, as Senator Sherry has said, that the ALP also have amendments to the bill. There are some areas of deep concern and there are some common areas of concern that exist also within the ALP amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I believe that a lot of the issues revolve around this belief that was started with the ALP in relation to the push for international competitiveness in order to try to make up for the deficiencies in what was meant to come as the huge benefits of free international trade. The issue is whether or not the worker is primarily responsible for Australia's current economic situation. I believe the principal object of this bill says that. It actually points to the average worker and says, `It's your fault. If only you would work harder. If only you would be prepared to work odd hours for the same rates or didn't require penalty rates or didn't have to have penalties for working when you would prefer to be with your family. If only you would be prepared to do that, we could all be better off.' I think that is erroneous and I think it is not admitting what the real economic issues are in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was thinking this morning of a way to describe the whole situation in this bill, and this is probably a good time to put it. What we had with the original bill, as is embodied by this principle, is the cutting off of legs in relation to bargaining power. It would be pretty awkward for many people to survive without a leg. With the amendments, we only have the feet cut off. So we have people who cannot walk without assistance apart from hopping, one would assume. But we are going to put into the bill that people are quite free to walk&mdash;there are no restrictions against walking. Isn't that terrific! You haven't got a foot but there are no restrictions. There is nothing in this bill that says you are not able to walk. But, if you are going to walk, you will need assistance&mdash;and that is what I think you need with collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the parable that I am putting. These amendments are better&mdash;you are only cutting off a foot; you are not cutting off the leg&mdash;but you are taking away the crutches. You are taking away the assistance that people will need to be able to walk and bargain with any <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4722"> kind of equality within the system. Whilst I will agree to the amendments Nos. 1 to 7 in relation to these principal objects, I will speak later on my own amendments and what I think would be more appropriate in the principal objects of the bill. I certainly recognise that the ALP's amendments to the principal objects have better elements than the current general gist of the Democrat&hyphen;government amendments. However, they still embody what I think was the beginning of the farce and the beginning of the con of workers in Australia&mdash;that if only they could be internationally competitive, if only they could work faster and harder for less wages and more flexibly, they would stop the damage that they are doing to the Australian economy. It is time for honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that I can read the numbers. I can see that whatever we do, amendments Nos. 1 to 7 will be carried. But that will not stop me, and I am sure that it will not stop the ALP from moving their amendments and from putting what I believe should be a model for what the principal object should be, if we are looking for a 1996 bill and not a 1986 bill in relation to industrial relations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to some general comments with respect to the objects, firstly, I would like to go back to the Democrat&hyphen;government agreement and the comment that they make in the summary of their agreed position:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objects will continue to reinforce the primary emphasis and directions of the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>I actually do think that the objects, as they stand in this agreed position, do continue to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On considering the commentary with respect to the agreement, and in the context of how well the objects continue to reflect that, I had a look at the description of the overall bill from the Senate Economics References Committee. I will take us back to just one comment in that. At 1.2 in chapter 1 of the overview, the majority of the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Workplace Relations Bill represents a significant remodelling of Australia's industrial relations system. The Bill proposes the reshaping of bargain <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ing arrangements, the confinement of awards to that of a minimum safety net, and a reduction in the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and registered organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>This agreement still does all of that, quite clearly. In my remarks, at this stage, I will concentrate on the confinement of awards, because I do not believe it is just a confinement. These changes, despite the agreed amendments, will destroy the award system that we have had in Australia for near a century. We are not just talking about some remodelling to fit the current economic circumstances; we are talking about changes which destroy Australia's award system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I applaud the Democrats and their agreement for bringing the government to the position of including fairness, because as we travelled around Australia, that was one of the very clear and obvious things that the government continued to try and ignore in its ideological bent with this bill. I applaud that we now have reference to fairness in the objects but, as Senator Sherry has pointed out, the objects should reflect other things, such as the government's election commitment&mdash;their commitment to better pay, their commitment that workers will be no worse off&mdash;as I think Senator Murray also referred to in his report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage, I would like to focus on and ask the government: whilst we understand the need to emphasise workplace relations and accept that, why now do the objects not more adequately deal with the award system other than as a minimum safety net? This is perhaps an obvious question, because I think that the changes which occur in the bill highlight the point that I made earlier. The objects no longer reflect a description of awards as other than the minimum safety net, because there is no intention that they should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no intention that we should have a vibrant award system to protect workers. There is no intention that we should be able to describe awards, as the act currently does, or that the system should provide the means for establishing and maintaining an effective framework of protecting wages and conditions of employment through awards&mdash;not just minimum safety net awards.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4723">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to highlight where I think the object should be improved, references regarding awards providing relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions should be maintained in the bill. They have been removed later in the bill. I think it is quite clear to us why that is the case, because we will only have awards as minimum safety nets. I am not sure it is clear how changing the objects and changing the thrust of the bill affects awards to some of the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this sense, unfortunately, despite all of the good intentions that the Democrats have made in previous policy positions and in their report after the inquiry, I think that they have been duped on this question. I do not think that they quite understand that the overall thrust of our industrial relations system has been destroyed by this change to awards. It may only seem like a small area, but it basically destroys the unique system that Australia has had in place for near on a century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area I would highlight where changes need to be made with respect to the objects, and following from these comments that I have just made, is that arbitration should occur where necessary with respect to dispute resolution&mdash;not just where appropriate. That has been the nature of our award system. They have been vibrant living things dealing with industrial disputation and promoting industrial harmony. I commend the Greens on their amendment in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole thrust of awards promoting industrial harmony and dealing with industrial disputation has been destroyed. Now, at the very stretch, the government has agreed that we will have arbitration, where appropriate. When is `where appropriate'? If you look a bit further on in the bill `where appropriate' is the 20 allowable matters and `in exceptional circumstances'. At this stage, the government is going to have to be quite clear about what it means by `exceptional' as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is going to be kept very busy in times to come. Ten per cent budget cuts are not going to help them much as they try and discern what constitutes 20 allowable matters, what constitutes exceptional circumstances? <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Any thought that work will be taken away from the commission is a bit simplistic. Awards will not be simplified that quickly. There will be a lot of disputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to the fundamental issue of this attack on the award system which, again, as I said earlier, I think unfortunately the Democrats have been duped into accepting. As I said, it ends an era in Australia. It ends an era in which, in recent times&mdash;for about the last decade&mdash;we have been able to introduce bargaining flexibility in an environment of security, fairness and trust. This will change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to remove one of the illusions which were reflected in the objects and the general commentary to date on the bill, opposition to Australia's unique industrial relations system is not new. The thrust of this bill and Howard's industrial relations agenda is not new. Some people have this perception that it is a new thing to deal with our current economic circumstances and international markets, et cetera. It does not simply reflect the need for reform to deal with our economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It reflects the ascendancy of the New Right in the Liberal Party over the last several years and their ideological agenda. That is quite clear. This has been obvious by the approach to the bill to date in ignoring substantive concerns, concerns which the Democrats picked up in several areas throughout the inquiry and in their report, but concerns which seem to have been lost in some areas particularly with respect to awards in recent times. On my perception, the Democrats have been duped, by Reith, away from their position as they reported it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take us back to that pre-election commitment. The Democrats accept that removing award conditions after 18 months just because they did not fit into the 18 allowable matters was a breach of this commitment. The commitment that the Democrats have referred to in their report was that no worker in Australia, under Mr Howard's industrial relations policy, can have his or her award conditions taken away. I'm sorry, but they will be taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly disappointed that award conditions will be taken away in one area which is perhaps an area where the object should more effectively deal with situations with respect to awards which are going to be minimised; that is, occupational health and safety. Occupational health and safety reflects very well what I want to highlight about awards. What it reflects is that awards have historically been those vibrant things that deal with industrial disputation for the general public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that Mr Reith, the minister, said to the Democrats, `Don't worry about occupational health and safety because there is legislation that deals with occupational health and safety.' But what exists in many awards are provisions specific to particular industries. We heard about provisions for shearers, for instance, which are not clearly provided for in industrial legislation. I know of retail award provisions dealing with health and safety issues which are not adequately provided for in industrial legislation. Let us not delude ourselves. Employers are not going to bargain and agree to those sorts of provisions no matter how many small little prods the government thinks they might be given. They will not bargain unless they have to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it quite clear where I think the Democrats have been duped in terms of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objects. The object with respect to awards in the agreed position refers to awards solely as a safety net. The Democrats' confusion on this issue is obvious by their approach to awards in the agreed position. They want to protect paid rates awards but they allow award minimisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, strangely there will be a reward for people not on paid rates awards since compulsory arbitration is being removed from several areas and there will be a reward for people who undertake industrial action which causes severe harm publicly. In those circumstances, you will have access to arbitration but bad luck to anybody else. Let us cause more industrial disputation because that is the way we will actually get the commission to do something. It does not make much sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is obvious from reading the report that the Democrats have tried in several areas to improve the bill as much as they thought they could. But not allowing it to include arbitration means that all industrial disputes won't be able to be dealt with by the commission. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

It is important that the objects are consistent with the detail of the legislation and that the legislation is consistent with the objects. There has been some improvement as a result of the coalition-Democrat deal, but I think the most significant thing is that, even despite the coalition-Democrat deal, the legislation is still consistently bad. The objects that the Democrats have agreed to are inadequate and flawed. They have accepted the limitation of `workplace relations' in the objects as opposed, for example, to Labor's `industrial relations'. That is very significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the worst example of the Democrat-coalition deal is that it fails to take in the fundamental object proposed by the Labor Party of better pay. I urge the Democrats to reconsider their position on that. In the same way, Labor proposes a new object (b) and I believe that should be supported. There is no excuse for not supporting guaranteeing that no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4725"> employee will be worse off as a result of implementation of this act and, in particular, that no trainee or apprentice will receive less take-home pay than the relevant entitlement under the applicable award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while comparing the various objects that have been proposed by the various parties. As I have just said, a critical commencement point is the comparison between the Labor proposal of providing a cooperative industrial relations object and the limitation that is being proposed by the government and accepted by the Democrats where they narrow that cooperative arrangement to the workplace alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why won't the coalition government adopt industrial relations legislation which sets the scene for cooperative industrial relations by adopting objects which reflect the values of cooperation, fairness and collective bargaining? By continuing to limit its attentions to workplace relations, the government is denying the need for industry activity or sectoral activity. This is the narrowness of the government's focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of its narrow focus, it ignores the importance of establishing industry&hyphen;wide solutions, for example, industry&hyphen;wide training schemes. There is no better example than in the metals industry where a complete change of culture was established, giving people career paths for the first time. It is all very well for professional people to have a career path, but we want, if industry is to be effective, for there to be industry solutions. An industry&hyphen;wide approach makes it more difficult for the individual bad employer, for one exists in every industry, to become dominant. Once there is industry&hyphen;wide pressure, and if the system and the objects of a system are based on industry&hyphen;wide activity, then that acts as pressure on the employer who would do the wrong thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way, it allows for development of the human capital of the industry by concentrating on industry needs. It raises understanding when you look at world best practice ideas and adds pressure for industries themselves to look outward, and that has been shown by the successful examples where industries that were on their knees have been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pulled up. You have it in the steel industry, the clothing industry, the shipbuilding industry and a number of other industries where that catalyst of having an industry approach has been used to good effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has done the opposite. Yesterday at 6 o'clock in South Australia the last group of workers at Griffin Press, who are going to be given the sack as a result of this capricious government's decision on the book bounty, were being given notice. That is an example of this government's resentment about a sector&mdash;in this case a sector of the printing industry. In this case, they are taking away from an industry that had planned its future the ability to gain markets or to keep those markets it has in Japan and other places. At the moment, there are several hundred people in that book industry who are being hurt. So I appreciate that this government does not understand the need of sector or industry approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government focuses on the workplace rather than on industrial relations in the objects of the bill. It reflects your desire to segment the labour force. You assume that there is strength in numbers, so you are setting up a system in which employers will be able to pick off individual workers and fragment workplaces one by one. This shows, I believe, that all your rhetoric about better work, increased productivity, best practice and excellence in management is false, because this government is trying to adopt the United States model of industrial relations, and it has a history of wanting to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the early 1980s, Senator Campbell, your colleague Ian Viner, when minister for industrial relations in the Fraser government, announced that he would introduce United States style legislation based on workplace activity&mdash;exactly the model that we face today. He announced it to the United States Chamber of Commerce in Australia. He told the big companies that were reflected there that he was going to deliver them the American industrial relations model in this country. But of course Malcolm Fraser&mdash;or the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser; I am not sure what he is&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was not only a sport but he was an intelligent leader and he quickly moved the Hon. Ian Viner out of industrial relations because he was facing an election in 1983. It did not save the Hon. Malcolm Fraser. He was defeated. You will remember that he was defeated at a time when, in industrial relations, we had anarchy as the order of the day. It was quite well known that the anarchy that existed as part of government policy under the Fraser government was something that had to be addressed very quickly by the incoming Labor government in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you had was instability and insecurity in industrial relations at the end of the Fraser government period. What is happening now is that that instability and insecurity is going to be transferred on to ordinary wage plugs&mdash;on to the wage and salary earners in this country. They will have instability and insecurity when the objects of this bill are translated into practice under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Hawke government did was pull industry leaders together. It concentrated on industrial relations in line with the object that we put forward today. It made industrial relations the centre of a new culture of modernisation. Health and safety and work practices were approached on a cooperative basis. People have forgotten in Australia that it was in 1983, and shortly after, that, for the first time, we did have a workplace emphasis. We encouraged every person to look at their workplace and we, through industry programs, were able to encourage the improvement of health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not against the emphasis on health and safety or on approaching the workplace itself. But we know that to be successful if you are fair dinkum about getting improvement you have to do it on a cooperative basis. You have to mobilise the resources of an industry. You have to use the good experiences of one place to encourage change in others. They are the sorts of things that Labor did in office. That is just the opposite to the proposals in these objects which do not accept industrial relations based objects but want to go back to the individual workplace. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of the Senate Economics References Committee that heard evidence right across Australia. I was reminded of the evidence given by some very eminent people, and I will refer to what they said. Mr John Hendy QC, Professor Breen Creighton and Professor Keith Ewing, all on behalf of the International Centre for Trade Union Rights, gave evidence to the Senate Economics References Committee that most employers do not want to obtain a competitive advantage by undercutting wages and conditions they accord their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most employers want the certainty of labour costs provided by the existing system. They seek to compete upon the basis of superior efficiency and quality of service and product. Nevertheless, there are unscrupulous employers, perhaps those who are less able to compete on the basis of quality of service and product, who will welcome this new regulatory regime. Mr Hendy, Professor Creighton and Professor Ewing told us that, instead of encouraging competition between employers on product and service, these new provisions will encourage employers to compete on the pay packet of their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United States system, which focuses only on the workplace, may be sustainable for the United States. It has a vast economy. It has a vast population. It is certainly not like Australia, which has a relatively small population spread over a vast continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The benefits of growth in the economy of the United States have accrued almost exclusively to the top half of one per cent of individuals in the United States. That is, the multimillionaires are doing better than ever in the United States, and at the same time debate raged over whether the minimum wage for US workers would be increased from $4.25 per hour to $5.15&mdash;$US4.25 is $A5.70. Full-time workers who earned the minimum wage earned $US8,500, not even half of the official poverty line for a family of four.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The end result of this legislation, based on these objects, will be Australian workers facing the same experiences as workers in the United States. About 3.7 million Americans earn the $4.25 minimum United States rate. Another 10 million earn between $US4.25 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4727"> and $US5.15, still below the poverty line. The American Democrats wanted to raise the minimum to $5.15. As a compromise, workers on the minimum wage will receive three wage rises of 30c.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the same basic system this coalition government and their supporters would like to establish, and all the ingredients in the objects and the details of this legislation over time will allow them to achieve that. It is subtle. They are not like the Hewsons of 1993 when they were going for a big hit; they are now subtle. The details of this legislation will allow these things to happen over time. They know that in individual workplaces there is weakness where people are not able to bargain effectively. When I have another go, I will go into the details of those weaknesses in the objects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments on the objects clause of the workplace relations bill, currently before the Senate and under consideration. I wish to make five points by way of introduction and, if there is time left, make a couple of other observations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, it needs to be put on the record that this bill, as proposed to be amended by the Senate, is a backroom deal between the government and the Australian Democrats, with all the connotations that flow from that. Secondly, the bill is opposed by the overwhelming majority of the leadership of the trade union movement of Australia. Thirdly, the bill is specifically designed to hurt low paid and female workers. Fourthly, it is a bill that the Australian Labor Party is proud to repudiate and will continue to repudiate, and when we return to government will seek to overturn. My final observation is that the bill, even with the amendments currently before the Senate, repudiates a significant number of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the key Australian Democrats' principles that they put in their supplementary report to the workplace inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the conclusion of those five points, I intend to make a few general comments concerning the bill's shameful treatment of female workers and low paid workers. I will also offer an option as to how they can be protected by referring to specific developments in my own state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn firstly to the fact that this is a sleazy, backroom deal negotiated between the government and the Australian Democrats. It was negotiated in private and concluded in secret. The process had no regard for accountability, transparency of process or honesty, despite the election campaigns of the government.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2L6">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, despite the oft repeated comments about openness of process, both by the government in its election campaign and by the Australian Democrats, those key objectives or principles have been expressly repudiated. Secondly, the bill is indeed opposed by the leadership of the Australian trade union. It has been opposed publicly and condemned by most major trade unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Indeed, looking at today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  of the last two days, you will see that the general officers of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, the Australian Workers Union, the LHMU, the STA and the CFMEU have all been quite direct and critical of the content of the bill. It has been extensively criticised in both public and private by the ACTU for adding a little dross around the edges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, this is a bill expressly designed to hurt, harm and disadvantage low paid and female workers. There should be no doubt <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4728"> that it harms the direct financial interests of low paid female workers. These workers may be found, as we all know, in hotels, restaurants, the hospitality industry, process aspects of manufacturing, retail, supermarkets and sales. The Australian Democrats are a party that ostensibly advances the interests of women. It attempts to solicit the union vote and proudly parades the fact that five of its seven members in this place are female. There is no reference in the objects of this bill heeding the interests of this group of workers, and they are explicitly ignored in the bill by that party. This bill deliberately sells this group of people down the river.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, this is a bill that the ALP is proud to repudiate: we are proud to reject it, and we are proud to have no part of the amendments proposed by the government and the Australian Democrats. This is a bill that only those two parties can claim title to and ownership of. We are very pleased now, in the medium term and in the long term to be isolated from this vicious piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would forecast that, over the next six to 18 months, unions in every shop, factory and warehouse will have one thing to say as they explain the meaning and intent of this bill. As people complain of cuts to their hours, loss of guaranteed weekly minimum hours, loss of guaranteed weekly maximum hours when working part time, as they suffer the loss of guaranteed daily minimum hours, guaranteed daily maximum hours and as they suffer a loss of security, there will be only two parties to blame: the government and the Australian Democrats and their leadership. We will be very vociferous in pointing out to every part-time and female worker who suffers a cut of hours where the responsibility lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, it is clear that the Australian Democrats have paid little heed to the 13 key principles that were outlined in Senator Murray's report. It is true that a number of aspects of those key principles have been incorporated in the agreed amendments which are before the Senate. However, there is no support for a comprehensive up-to-date award system. There is no suggestion that the award system will remain relevant over time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Additionally, there is a limitation on arbitration, there is no reference to industrial democracy and there is no recognition at all of the legitimate role of trade unions. Members opposite like to swing off and make comments about the fact that trade union membership is somewhere around 30 to 35 per cent of the Australian work force and dominates in key industries and sectors of industries. This bill deliberately ignores that fact. It offers no comfort, no protection, no purpose and no role to those organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, there is what can only be described as a `sleazy deal' on secondary boycotts. They are apparently proper and legitimate&mdash;authorised to be legal. By definition, public policy is to encourage secondary boycotts of a consumer nature or on environmental issues. But if a worker or group of workers wishes to protect their living standards, wages and health and safety issues, that is to be outlawed. So there is more value in insects&mdash;flora and fauna&mdash;as has been outlined in other debates, than there is in the working conditions of Australian workers. That apparently is to become public policy in this country in a deal between the government and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixthly, there is little protection for part-time workers. Therefore, I will turn to the more distasteful aspects of the bill and the fact that they are not addressed in the objects. Particularly, I will refer to the shameful treatment of part-time and female workers. I will relay to the Senate my experience in Western Australia over the last few years, as we have had a nearly identical system in that state, and I will refer to the submissions of the Commissioner for Workplace Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my direct observation from the independent supermarket industry that my comments are equally valid concerning unskilled workers or low skilled workers anywhere. Unions in awards, enterprise bargaining agreements and certified agreements in low skilled and unskilled industries essentially achieve in negotiations a margin above what the market will pay. That margin extends to wages and conditions and establishes for that group of workers a higher standard of living than they would be able to achieve otherwise. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4729"> There is no doubt about that, and that is agreed on both sides. That is the purpose of awards&mdash;to achieve a rate above that which the market establishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Awards of that nature have little relevance to professional people, to high skilled people and to highly educated women. The market sets a high rate for their pay based on skill, and they do not need awards or other instruments to increase it or to maintain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last three years in Western Australia, as workplace agreements have been introduced in a range of low skill, low value industries, the results have become clear. The market price for retail workers in independent supermarkets and allied firms has fallen by up to $5 per hour. The rate has gone below the award rate, which was in the order of $12 or $13 per hour, down to a rate of $7 to $8 per hour, depending on the suburb and the locality. That rate of $7 to $8 per hour in Australian dollars is remarkably similar to the $5.25, $5.55, permitted in the US minimum wage law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the results are clear from Western Australia&mdash;perhaps less clear in Victoria because there are not the detailed records&mdash;that the introduction of workplace bargaining via individual contracts to low skilled, semi&hyphen;skilled and low value industries results in a cutting back of above market wages to market levels of some $7 to $8 per hour. This bill is explicitly designed to achieve that outcome. It is designed to achieve that outcome on the backs of low paid workers who are principally female and in retail and hospitality industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the life of me, I cannot understand why any party&mdash;let alone the Australian Democrats, who seek to parade the interests of female workers, of female voters&mdash;would deliberately establish a policy and agree to amendments in a bill that would have the direct consequence of decreasing their wages. I can understand why the government would want to  do that, and I can understand the financial drive behind that objective. Why the Australian Democrats, with their five female senators, who have proudly outlined their principles in their maiden speeches and other efforts, would seek to drive down the wages of their own gender is beyond me. But that is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the direct purpose and will be the obvious outcome of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, it is proper to highlight the deficiencies in the objects clause. It is entirely proper to sheet home the blame for that to the government, but more particularly to the Australian Democrats, who have engaged in that secret negotiating process which they apparently, until now, have repudiated. It is proper to highlight that the objects of the bill and the express provisions that we will discuss later are designed to harm the interests of low paid workers and female workers in a range of service industries. It is proper to place on the record that we wish to have no part of it, that we oppose it and that we will go into the community and into the workplaces and outline our concerns, explain our principles, and properly and accurately outline what the Australian Democrats and the government have sought to achieve in this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The workplace relations bill was born out of an ideological obsession by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the coalition parties to devalue the award system of this country, to destroy the role of the trade union movement in this country and to reduce the wages of ordinary workers in this country. Notwithstanding all of the rhetorical flourish of the Prime Minister's policy launch, launched when he was Leader of the Opposition, prior to the election, notwithstanding the high sounding rhetoric of some of the objects of the bill and notwithstanding the recently announced agreement&mdash;or secret deal, as Senator Bishop so accurately describes it&mdash;one can still see that this bill will damage, maybe irreparably, the position of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly refer to those workers in low paid jobs who rely upon the industrial awards system of this country for protection. Let us remember that we are here today dealing with legislation of the parliament, legislation which the Prime Minister claims is one of the hallmark, central pieces of his government's program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have always understood that legislation is about protecting and maintaining the interests <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4730"> and welfare of Australian citizens. That is what the former Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the Industrial Relations Act have been about. Certainly, they are not cast in stone. It is appropriate from time to time for governments and the participants&mdash;employers, employees, unions, employer organisations&mdash;to look at updating or revising the provisions of that act as circumstances warrant. Indeed, the history of industrial relations in this country is that that has been the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, that was the process engaged in by the former government when it brought in the Industrial Relations Act. It is an act which sought to establish a new development in industrial relations in this country, that is, more emphasis on enterprise bargaining. It is an act which sought to also recognise the increasing complexities of the labour market and international impacts upon it. But at all times it recognised that a fundamental system needed to be retained, that is, a system of industrial awards regulated through the processes of conciliation and arbitration by an independent umpire, namely, the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill heads in an entirely opposite direction. That is evident when you look at the objects of the act, because what is so stark is what has been removed from the objects of the current act. What is also so stark is the inconsistency&mdash;I would suggest hypocrisy&mdash;of the coalition government's position with respect to their electoral promises and the legislation now before the Senate. That continues to exist and has not been remedied by the agreement between the government and the Democrats. I have to say to the Democrats that they have walked away from some of their own election promises and pronouncements on this issue. I will come back to that in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's industrial relations policy was headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better pay for better work</EMPHASIS>. The Prime Minister went to great lengths to assure the Australian work force that no worker would be worse off as a result of his zeal to reform&mdash;in his words&mdash;the labour market. Why is it then that, if one of the twin objectives of this legislation is the achievement of better pay, there is no mention whatsoever in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the objects of the act of that fundamental commitment? According to the Prime Minister, two things are supposed to flow from this legislation: firstly, improved employment and, secondly, better pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will see in a couple of years, if not sooner, whether those results were achieved. It is our belief, based upon years of experience, that that will not occur. You would think that, if you were being honest with the Australian people and you were going to stick to your commitments, the one object that would be staring out at you from page 1 of this legislation would be an object to promote better pay. You would also expect an object to be in this act which said that no person, as a result of this legislation, should suffer any diminution in their wages and working conditions and other entitlements. But that is precisely what is going to happen as a result of this legislation. When we get to discuss some of the more specific aspects of the legislation, such as those dealing with allowable matters, you will see very clearly how workers will suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people place great store upon the objects of legislation. Indeed, it is correct that one should look to the objects of the legislation: firstly, to see what is actually supposed to be achieved by the legislation and, secondly, to see whether it can be an aid in resolving issues relating to a lack of clarification or uncertainty in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall what happened in the Senate inquiry proceedings. On a number of occasions when it was pointed out by witnesses that various protections which existed in the current act had been removed, Senator Crane and other members of the coalition said, `Oh, but it's in the objects of the act.' Any industrial relations practitioner with a minimum of experience will tell you that, in the absence of specific provision in the legislation, the objects of the act&mdash;no matter how grand&mdash;may, nevertheless, deliver nothing. In the absence of specific provisions in legislation, for instance, dealing with matters outside of the 18 allowable matters under section 89A, the objects of the act are not going to enable either the Industrial Relations Commission or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4731"> the participants in the industrial relations negotiations to fill in the gaps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is what the government wants. What they want to do through this act is force people out of the award system. They say that it is designed to encourage people to utilise enterprise bargaining. The very provisions of section 89A coupled with sections 44 and 45, which prescribes by legislation that awards cannot contain provisions other than those listed, is completely contrary to the so-called object, which is to encourage conciliation&mdash;it was as a last resort, but I notice that it is proposed to be amended&mdash;and arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to this bill, the current act placed great emphasis on conciliation and arbitration. We now also have in the act the parallel system of enterprise bargaining. The two have worked very well together, as the recent report of the Industrial Relations Commission indicated. But in this bill conciliation and arbitration has been reduced to a mere by&hyphen;line, notwithstanding that the constitutional power for this bill is derived from section 51(xxxv)&mdash;that is, the power of the Commonwealth to make laws dealing with the conciliation and arbitration of interstate industrial disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this bill, the role of the commission is reduced to virtually a rubber stamp. I am not surprised about that because we have also seen that the other sections of the bill, such as those dealing with the Employment Advocate, were going to be rubber stamp processes too. Nobody was going to have any opportunity to scrutinise whether or not the tests of fairness and of equity had been met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt we are going to have a lot more opportunity throughout the day to look specifically at some of these objects. But let me just point to a couple of the problems that I see. Firstly, as I have indicated, there is no object which relates in any way to the maintenance and protection of current wages and working conditions of employees. Secondly, this bill removes from the act the existing provision which encourages the registration of democratic organisations of employers and employees. Nothing has been done to restore that position in the deal that has been made between the government and the Democrats.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I also say in relation to that deal that I find it hypocritical to the highest degree that legislation which is supposed to be about encouraging employers and employees to negotiate and reach agreement will ultimately, it appears, get through this Senate because of a backroom deal&mdash;an agreement where the very participants have had little opportunity or no opportunity to be involved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

As a precursor to that exercise, my office and I worked out precisely what productivity figures were on a state-by-state basis and then matched those to the relevant industrial relations systems that each of those states had. It proved to be a very interesting exercise indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of `productivity' became a bit of a vexed question in the hearings that were held. Because I have an interest in this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4732"> area, I asked many people who gave submissions, particularly employer groups, what they regarded as the definition of `productivity'. Quite frankly, their definition of `productivity' was probably best put by the chamber of commerce from my own state. They said, `Senator, how long is a piece of string?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found this quite a disappointing response from a chamber of industry that signed up to a bill that has as one of its objects increased productivity, increased international competitiveness and higher employment levels. If you cannot determine or if you do not know what higher productivity is, how can you have it as an object? The reality is that it is a parenthood statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The definition of `productivity' is very simple. There are two definitions that you could use. They are: gross state product by the number of hours worked&mdash;that is to gain productivity per hour&mdash;or by the number of people employed to gain productivity per employee. This is the ABS formula; this is not something that this side of the chamber has plucked out of the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you use the formula used by the ABS and apply it on a state by state basis, the results in relation to productivity increases become very interesting when, as I said, you look at the various industrial relations systems that these states have. I will go through them, because I would like to put them on the record. I will go through the results from 1991 to 1995. It may be a bit tedious, but I think it is very important for people to understand precisely what is going to happen in relation to this Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 and what has happened in other states that have attempted similar moves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">New South Wales, for example, in 1991 had minus 0.4 per cent productivity growth; 1992, plus 2.7 per cent; 1993, plus 3.4 per cent; 1994, plus 1.5 per cent; and 1995, minus 1.3 per cent. That will hopefully improve through the changes in the industrial relations system and the election of a Labor government. I am sure it will. Tasmania, my home state, is the worst&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;because of having a state Liberal government for such a long period of time. Tasmania also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> introduced industrial relations legislation based on, as Senator Collins mentioned, the New Right agenda, the agenda of the H.R. Nicholls Society, and so on. The productivity levels in Tasmania were as follows: 1991, plus 0.8 per cent; 1992, plus 9.3 per cent, which seems a bit of an aberration; 1993, plus 1.95 per cent; 1994, minus 5.73 per cent; and 1995, minus 2.02 per cent. That was the worst economic performance in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we go to South Australia. This is also interesting: 1991, plus 0.65 per cent; 1992, plus 2.15 per cent; 1993, plus 3.58 per cent; 1994, minus 0.41 per cent; and 1995, zero. There was no productivity growth at all. Queensland: 1991, plus 3.6 per cent; 1992, plus 4.34 per cent; 1993, plus 1.87 per cent; 1994, plus 1.43 per cent; and 1995, minus 1.61 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now it gets really interesting. In Victoria we have Premier Kennett lauding his industrial relations package as being, to a large extent, responsible for the purported improvement in the Victorian economy. You would think there would be a fairly gargantuan increase in relation to productivity there, given what has happened in Victoria with regard to the low wage outcome that has been deliberately perpetrated in that state. Victoria: 1991, plus 1.5 per cent; 1992, plus 3.3 per cent&mdash;these are the years when we actually had a state Labor government, which, incidentally, was absolutely pilloried in relation to economic management by senators opposite&mdash;1993, plus 4.3 per cent; 1994, no productivity growth; and 1995, 0.3 per cent. That is not a very good outcome given how many Victorian workers have suffered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the piece de resistance. We come to Western Australia, where Minister Kierath has actually lambasted this government for not going far enough and for doing the deal with the Democrats in relation to this bill. His view is that the industrial relations system in Western Australia, as currently constituted, is the appropriate way to go in relation to improved economic performance and improved economic indicators. Let us look at Western Australia: 1991, plus 5.6 per cent; 1992, plus 2.5 per cent; 1993, plus 2.4 per cent; 1994, plus 1.5 per cent; and 1995, minus <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4733"> two per cent. In 1995, Western Australia had an economic productivity growth of minus two per cent, the second lowest in Australia. Minister Kierath had the nerve to say to this government in relation to this bill, `You should have gone as far as we did. You have not gone far enough. Had you gone far enough, you would have had the outstanding economic record that we have achieved in Western Australia.' Excuse me! I do not think the second lowest productivity rate in Australia is a particularly good outcome, given the impost and the pain that the workers in Western Australia have had to go through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very interesting in the hearings in Western Australia to hear precisely how the Western Australia government actually presented this so&hyphen;called terrific economic record. Just for the interest of the Senate, in their submission they used a period of wages growth of three years, a span of three years, to illustrate the economic record. For employment they used a span of three years. For working days lost due to industrial representation they used a span of nine years. For productivity they used a span of one year. Listen to this: they actually said that, for the May quarter 1994 to the May quarter 1995, it was plus 3.6 per cent. Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of economics knows that there is no such thing as a May quarter. They were silly enough to use this in their submission to support the government's bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty in relation to the bill&mdash;and the difficulty in relation to the Democrats' position, quite bluntly&mdash;is that it is not going to assist the economy at all. The amendments that have been negotiated between the government and the Democrats are not going to assist the economy. They are not going to assist those productivity rates. They are not going to assist employment levels. The only way that they would actually assist employment levels&mdash;this is something that both the government and the Democrats should bear in mind, and are, in fact, very well aware of&mdash;is if you have a low wage outcome. The only way that you can increase employment through this bill is by having a low wage outcome. You have actually cut workers' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wages. You only have to listen to what Senator Childs said with regard to the situation in the United States to understand precisely the impact that has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at international comparisons again. I think Senator Childs has adequately covered the United States. During the speeches in the second reading debate on this bill, I quoted some statistics with regard to New Zealand. I understood it was pretty clear that the government regarded New Zealand as a relevant model to actually base this bill on. I was interjected upon several times by government senators saying it is not based on the New Zealand bill. If it is not based on the New Zealand bill or on the circumstances in the United States, what is it based on? Of course it is based on the New Zealand bill; of course it is based on the circumstances in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is&mdash;I will not go through it in great detail again&mdash;that the report I quoted in the second reading debate, which is called `The report of the study program on structural adjustment and social change', indicated very clearly that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand's better growth performance appears to be due more to a more rapid accumulation of raw factors of production (capital and labour) rather than to relative improvements in resource utilisation or in the quality of human capital.</PARA>
<PARA>New Zealand's productivity growth has not been good. It has not even matched Australia's performance. This is under the Employment Contracts Act, this great system that was supposed to provide economic nirvana in New Zealand. Our national growth rate has been higher than New Zealand's&mdash;that is the reality. New Zealand's reforms have had very little impact on efficiency. This is clearly not a good sign. They also said in the report that much of New Zealand's recent strong economic growth can be attributed to temporary factors and they go on with the most telling point that the report made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential gains from New Zealand&hyphen;type reform need to be weighed against the social costs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is right. Let us say you are not concerned about social cost. Let us say you are not concerned about the lives of ordinary Australians. Let us say you are not concerned <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4734"> about how much people are paid. Let us say you are not concerned about whether they actually earn&mdash;as Senator Childs says&mdash;$5.15 per hour if they are lucky. In the United States workers are largely casual, which is essentially what this bill will promote in Australia. Let us say you are not concerned about that. If you look at the fundamentals in relation to economics, this bill will not produce the outcomes the government claims. The only way their bill can produce increased employment is by reducing workers' wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, what I have attempted to demonstrate here by using empirical data, not simply by using rhetoric in relation to productivity, is that those states that have chosen to adopt a new right or radical industrial relations system have not seen the gains in relation to productivity. They have not been realised at all. I turn to to the deal between the Democrats and the government. Economic outcomes have not been addressed here either. There is no way either the fundamentals of this bill or the government/Democrat amendments have done anything to improve those economic outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, as has been said by previous senators, will not create jobs unless workers' wages are battened down. That is the only way that job creation is going to occur. And what kind of jobs will you have? We will see the same sort of situation as in New Zealand where you have largely part&hyphen;time workers. But they are not really part&hyphen;time workers in the sense we currently know them; they are actually casual workers. I say to the government and to the Democrats that the amendments that have been put forward and the bill in its entirety will not assist Australia's economic outcome. In fact, it will make it worse and it will make the lives of ordinary Australians worse.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to the objects clause of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, particularly the object that Senator Mackay and some others have referred to. The object, as it is proposed to be amended by the deal between the government and the Democrats, would read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> encouraging the pursuit of high employment, improved living standards . . . low inflation and international competitive through higher productivity and a flexible&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and the words are then added&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and fair labour market.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the only flexibility that the bill will introduce into the labour market will be a downwards flexibility for the low paid, for young job seekers and for casual and part&hyphen;time employees. We ought to remember that the government is responding to pressures from the business community who are demanding a more flexible labour market and labour market reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at how flexible and fair the labour market is. I refer to an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which talks about what has occurred in our labour market in the last couple of years. It does not just fix on the pay of ordinary working people; it fixes upon the increases that have been paid to business executives, as well as the general labour market. On the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> there is an article which deals with this matter under the headline `Howard blasts executive pay rises'. In the third paragraph it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pay packets of senior management rose by 6.5 per cent on average in the year to September&mdash;the same pace as in the year to June, and faster than the figure in early 1996&mdash;according to the latest survey by</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cullen Egan Dell, which is scheduled for publication this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That acceleration has taken place at the same time as general wage and salary pressures have eased from a peak of 5.1 per cent in late 1995 to a two&hyphen;year low of 3.5 per cent in September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A day after Coles Myer revealed its chief executive, Mr Peter Bartels, enjoyed a 76 per cent remuneration package boost to almost $3 million last year despite a slump in the company's profits, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, called yesterday for `equality of sacrifice' from high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>What is fair about this and what is the bill going to do to address this? It is all very well for the Prime Minister to make high&hyphen;minded calls, but this bill is the government's, and apparently the Democrats', response to these sorts of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Business has been one of the key instigators of this so-called reform package. I do not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4735"> think it really is reform, because I thought reform was about improving things. I do not believe that this bill, particularly as it is described in its objects, will do anything to improve the situation. As I said earlier, it is talking about flexibility. But when you look at the rest of the bill, the flexibility will be downwards for the majority of Australian people, particularly those who are without power in terms of their employment relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at that particular object. As amended, it talks about a flexible and fair labour market. At the same time, we looked at what is actually occurring in the labour market and who is benefiting. Those who are in positions of privilege have obviously helped themselves at the same time as calling upon those who are in a position of disadvantage&mdash;those in an ordinary employment relationship&mdash;to take hold of their expectations and to accept less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of that power relationship, the Senate Economics References Committee looked at the question of bargaining and the Australian Democrats' position, as I think represented by Senator Murray, was set out in its report. At page 339 of the report the Australian Democrats' recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is recommended that the bill seek to expressly encourage collective over individual bargaining, but allow for individual bargaining of AWAs where the conditions of the AWA as a whole are superior to the award, and that the employee genuinely and freely agrees to the AWA.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that anywhere in the objects clause is there effectively reflected an object which expressly encourages collective, over individual, bargaining. I make that point because the Labor Party will be moving an amendment to the objects clause which will have the effect of giving that importance to the issue of collective bargaining over individual bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Clearly, individual bargaining is not in the interests of ordinary Australians. It may be in the interests of business executives in a position of power and in a position to influence their boards to give them increases far and away above the sorts of pay increases that have traditionally been available to the ordi nary Australian worker; that is, the majority of the community that this parliament is supposed to be serving. We are not here simply to be serving the interests of business executives who repeatedly, allegedly in the national interest, call for this workplace reform agenda, as they call it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of the objects clause of this bill that I wanted to touch upon was the question of the organisation of employees and their responsibility for the maintenance of the award system. As I said in my speech on the second reading, it is the trade union movement that actually maintains the award system. Object (d)(ii) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to ensure that there is an effective award safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is proposed to be amended in the government&hyphen;Democrat deal to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to ensure the maintenance of an effective award safety net of fair and enforceable minimum wages and conditions of employment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On its face, that seems a reasonable amendment, although it could go a lot further. In terms of what happens elsewhere in the objects to the bill, there is no proper recognition of the fact, in the amendment or in the bill as it stands&mdash;when I say `the amendment', I refer to the government-Democrat deal on the amendment to the objects clause&mdash;to the importance of the trade union movement to that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fine to have high-minded objectives for maintenance of the safety net system but, on the other hand, elsewhere in the bill&mdash;even as it is proposed to be amended by the government and Democrat deal&mdash;it seeks to diminish organisations' ability to organise and, in fact, gives primacy to individual contracts over the award system, thereby undermining the ability of the union movement to maintain that safety net for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that the union movement will do an excellent job with limited resources, but realities are realities. I believe it is an object of this legislation to make the maintenance of the award system a more difficult task for the union movement, specifically by not recognising their importance in the objects&mdash;as they would be recognised if those objects were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4736"> amended as proposed in the ALP amendments to this clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said a fair bit about the interests of the business community. What tends to be their newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, is a newspaper which I know a lot of members of the Senate have great regard for. Today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review </EMPHASIS>there is an article by the economics editor, Mr Mitchell. I wanted to refer to that because I think it is giving us a few clues as to where we are going in the context of the objects of this bill. On page 17 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, in a story entitled `Consequences of compromise', there is reference to the deal between the government and the Australian Democrats. I relate this to the objects of the bill that I have just referred to, in particular, the importance of the trade union movement and how the objects do not particularly give the importance that the trade union movement has to the maintenance of the award system. Alan Mitchell says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other important compromise made by Mr Reith was on the question of freedom of association. The Government's intention had been to abolish the "conveniently belong" rule under which unions have been granted effective monopoly rights to represent particular classes of workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers were at last to be given the right to join the unions of their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, at the behest of the Democrats, the right of workers to choose their unions is to be restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead of the old conveniently belong rule there is to be a "more conveniently belong rule".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, incumbent unions will be able to maintain their monopoly rights to represent particular workers if they can demonstrate to the AIRC a) that the workers "could more conveniently be members" of the incumbent union and b) that the workers "would be more effectively represented" by the incumbent union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, employers who don't want the problems of managing workplaces in which workers have a choice will think this is wonderful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But one of the most important objectives of the Government's reform&mdash;to make unions more accountable to their members&mdash;has been seriously compromised.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the fact that I believe that Mr Mitchell is particularly ill&hyphen;informed on the subject of the representative character of unions, I want to go to what he said about the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whole package, and that includes this question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also means that the Government, having compromised on its legislation, must now clearly articulate to the AIRC in its submissions and public statements how it wants the regulation of the labour market to be managed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the final analysis the commission must have regard to the policies of the elected Government&mdash;and all the more so when that Government has a strong popular mandate for reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard must also take every opportunity he gets to reform the AIRC itself, to populate it with commissioners sympathetic to reform.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the newspaper that seems to be the advocate of the business community is saying that the Prime Minister should nobble the outcomes of this legislation by fixing the jurisdiction with biased opponents. That is what the article by Alan Mitchell is suggesting, and that, I think, is a fundamental problem with this bill&mdash;the objects clause does not properly express the role of the trade union movement in making the award system a fit and proper one for the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that in mind, I think we have to have a good look at this objects clause. The Democrats no doubt will mount some sort of cogent case for the deal that they have done. But let us wait and see about that, because I believe that they need to further consider their position and consider the Labor Party amendments on these matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I commend Senator O'Brien, the previous speaker, on the excellence of his contribution in the chamber. It was very worth while and I think it will be referred to on a number of occasions by other speakers. In commending Senator O'Brien, I am not taking anything away from the previous speakers on this very important piece of legislation from this side of the chamber. The legislation is so important that we have actually got opposition senators in the chamber. We have actually got a Democrat senator in the chamber. We have not got one Liberal Party senator in the chamber at this moment in time, apart from you, Mr Chairman Watson. We have not got a government minister in the chamber. That is absolutely pathetic. It is not quite as pathetic as the bill or the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4737"> grubby deal that we are effectively talking about in the chamber today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In commending Senator O'Brien on his contribution in the chamber, I must admit that he has taken some steam out of the contribution that I had intended to make. In the latter part of his speech, he referred to an article contained in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> entitled `Consequences of compromise' by the economics editor, Alan Mitchell. It appears on page 17 of that newspaper, directly opposite another very interesting article entitled `Howard's shameful silence'. I do not want to talk about either of the articles here. Senator O'Brien has made a contribution on Mr Mitchell's article and, in order to save the time of the chamber, I will not repeat the matters that have been referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In dealing with the objects of the bill which the Senate is debating at the moment, I want to draw attention to one particular part of the objectives&mdash;that is, the matter of what conditions are going to apply to workers in this country if this legislation is passed in the form that is proposed by the joint amendments put forward by the government and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to the election in March of this year, one of the flagships of Mr Howard's electoral messages was in the industrial relations area. He said, `No worker in Australia under the Howard industrial relations policy can have his or her award conditions taken away.' That was a commendable and admirable statement made in the context of an election. One would have thought at the time that this was a core promise. This was one of the promises that was not going to be broken&mdash;like the almost 100 other promises that have been smashed in the eight short months that the government has been in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the bill was introduced into this place in June of this year, everybody, not only those on this side of the chamber, recognised that core promise as smashed, breached and meant for nothing. Subsequently, the bill was referred to the Senate committee which traversed the country, taking evidence from working people, workers organisations, employer groups, employers and governments <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right across the length and breadth of this great land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Still that was not enough. Even after that committee's report&mdash;a comprehensive one&mdash;had been presented to the Senate chamber, more needed to be done. The workers could have been assured by the prospect of this further work that was to be done. However, the work that was to be done on the part of the government was to get into bed with the Australian Democrats. I thought I had lived a long time and seen everything. I never thought I would see the day when the joint party rooms would consist of the Liberal Party and the National Party, a very unholy alliance at the best of times, and the Australian Democrats. I am just hoping that some day we can get some photographs of Senator Kernot sitting beside Senator Ian Macdonald in deep dialogue about matters of great import. I would love&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But I come back to the objects of this very important bill. The Democrats also went to the election with a core promise launched with great fanfare. The core promise, and I am quoting here, was they `would keep the bastards honest'. I understand `bastards' can be an offensive word and, indeed, it is offensive to some. Now with the joint amendments by the Australian Democrats and the government to the bill which is before this chamber, we find three main political parties breaching the core promises upon which they went to the election. We had Mr Howard's promise that under his government's industrial relations policy no worker in Australia can have his or her award conditions taken away. Those people have been done. That promise <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4738"> has been breached by this particular bill which, if passed, will become an act of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The Democrats, who went to the election saying they would keep the bastards honest&mdash;meaning that Senator Murray, Senator Kernot and Senator Stott Despoja would keep John Howard to his promise that no worker would have his or her award conditions taken away&mdash;have reneged on that agreement as well. I suppose that is politics for you. It is not a comforting thought that that should happen in this day and age. It is no wonder indeed that some people in our community are disillusioned with politicians when you see promises of this nature worth nought when push comes to shove and bills are brought before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Now, I am hoping that somebody from the other side will come up to try to correct this impression&mdash;even from the Australian Democrats. But I suppose that in the context of this debate we should refer to `the other side' as being from where you are sitting, Senator Murray, because you are in bed together&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;on this particular bill. I hope somebody will be able to come up to refute the claims that I am making about these core promises that have been breached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the promises were going to be fulfilled, where should they have appeared?  They should have appeared in the bill that was presented to the parliament in June this year. They did not. The bill was referred to a committee for evidence to be taken. I know during the brief times I had the opportunity of sitting in as a participating member of the committee, in my home town of Perth and also here in Canberra, that question was addressed on many occasions to various witnesses appearing before the committee: will the bill before this committee hearing maintain Mr Howard's promises to the electorate prior to the election? The answer on every occasion, although some people did try to fudge it, was no, it would not do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So we get the Democrats getting into bed with the government doing a grubby, secret deal over weeks and weeks of negotiations. On that commitment to keep the bastards <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honest, they failed to deliver. The bastards are still dishonest and the Democrats have reneged on their commitment that they gave   to the electorate prior to the election. I was very careful&mdash;</PARA>

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.54 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has ever come before this place in the six or seven years I have been here. I think it behoves us all to raise again the issues that are, and if not should be, of concern to the average person on the street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We look at schedule 1, the very beginning of this bill. It talks about higher productivity and a flexible labour market. It talks about the fact that the primary responsibility of determining matters affecting the relationship between employees and employers rests with the employee and employer at the workplace or enterprise level. I will start with that one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I gave my speech on the second reading I expressed concern that if employers and employees are going to be negotiating and reaching agreements then there has to be an assumption that both sides are equal&mdash;both sides have equal power, equal rights, equal knowledge, equal information. For every other legal contract in this country there is an assumption of equality. If it can be proved that it is not so, it is overruled in courts of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is going to happen here? You cannot tell me that a 16- or 17-year-old person, who is just out of school or doing part-time work while they are still at school, shares equality with their employer. Usually at that stage when people are seeking those <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobs there are more people after the jobs than there are jobs available and they are basically forced to take what is available&mdash;take it or leave it. Nobody at the age of 17 can be considered to be in a position of equality with their boss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that will happen with these negotiations is that they will be done in secret. You could have a work force where each employee does not know or technically should not know what their peers are getting. So it could be a case of the boss rewarding what he or she sees as better work, despite the fact that there may be other circumstances or other factors involved. I will keep going back to the fact that you cannot have an agreement where there is not equality between those entering into the negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken about young people. I also have concerns about the self-confidence of women re-entering the workplace after they have been at home maybe raising children. For the first time back into the workplace after four or five years out&mdash;it is a changed circumstance from what they left&mdash;they are being expected also to enter into this negotiation. There is no way that those people are entering into those negotiations in a position of equality. That to me is something that is eminently unfair. I wonder about the legal ramifications of it as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also see that the bill talks about building upon a foundation of minimum standards. When we look at the minimum standards we find there are some major points being missed. I wonder where occupational health and safety stands in the minimum standards because I cannot find it and I would be quite happy to be proved wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke on the adjournment on Monday night about a memorial service I had attended in Broken Hill to the miners who had lost their lives on the Line of Lode. Up to date they knew of 704 names but there were many more. There were many more because at the time the mine started and for some considerable time afterwards if an accident occurred at the mine and miners were taken away alive to receive health care, surgery or whatever treatment was needed, be it at home or in the hospital, and they subsequently died, those <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4740"> deaths were not recorded as deaths on the Line of Lode. They were not attributed to the fact that they were injured at the mine. It is becoming quite apparent to those who are working on this project that the public figures currently available are totally inaccurate as to the morbidity rates of people who had worked at that mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put to you that this lack of setting occupational health and safety as a minimum standard leaves it open for the return to the bad old days such as on the Line of Lode in Broken Hill where hundreds of men lost their lives&mdash;two men remain in the mine, their final resting place&mdash;as a result of accidents on that line. We do not know how many; we are still trying to find out how many actually lost their lives as a result of the work on the Line of Lode.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to you that these are very important issues. When you combine that with the fact that occupational health and safety, Worksafe, has had a cut to its budget, you have to become much more concerned, as those of us who have concerns about occupational health and safety are, about the lack of minimum standards for occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also talks in this schedule about higher productivity. I am wondering how you measure higher productivity in a number of areas. I can say from the health scene&mdash;from a nursing perspective&mdash;that productivity is extremely hard to measure. The work that is undertaken has changed quite markedly in the last 30 years. Procedures, diagnoses and surgical intervention that are undertaken now could not be made 30 years ago, or, if they could be made, the treatment was just TLC&mdash;tender loving care. The TV program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">RPA</EMPHASIS> on one of the commercial stations on Thursday nights shows the resuscitation of very tiny babies&mdash;babies of less than 1,000 grams&mdash;and it shows these children going home as fit, healthy and well young infants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I worked at that hospital over 20 years ago 99 per cent of babies born at that birth weight died. Now it is quite apparent that the figures are almost totally reversed. Being able to save and to have a great outcome for these individuals means that a hell of a lot more care is required. They require a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lot more intensive care than normal weight babies; they are much sicker. How do you measure that with productivity? The advance in technology has changed the outputs and the outcomes for many people in the health area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Productivity used to be measured, and still is in a lot of areas, by bed days occupied. But what you have in those beds are people who are a lot sicker than would have been the case 20 years ago and who are being discharged earlier than we would have thought possible, or even acceptable, 20 or 30 years ago. And you are telling me that you want to increase productivity. I, as a former registered nurse and someone who is still a member of the College of Nursing in this country, am asking you: how are you going to measure productivity in that particular case? I do not want my nursing peers to have somebody say, `You've got to increase productivity.' When you have a ward full of unconscious or semiconscious patients and they are totally dependent upon you for every one of their needs, how can you possibly increase productivity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier today when I raised this issue, somebody made the facetious statement that you put roller skates on them&mdash;and that is about the only way you can do it. Here it is, stuck in this bill with no cognisance of what the real world is like out there. It is just typical of how totally out of touch this coalition government, which now really does deserve the title of coalition because it is the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats, are. They really do not understand that particular issue. They have obviously never gone and spoken to anybody in the health field about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times I have also received some material from the AMA. The AMA is not known as a supporter of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, there are a couple of members of the AMA in this chamber. There is one on our side and three on the other side. That is probably the ratio of membership and their attitudes. What they are concerned about is promoting a positive occupational health and safety culture, and they are doing it for themselves. They want a safe system of work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4741">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do they want in this safe system of work? We know from reading section 3D(d)(1) that they want a foundation of minimum standards, but I do not think what the coalition is putting up as minimum standards are the same minimum standards as the AMA wants. The AMA want a maximum number of hours per shift. They want minimum uninterrupted rest breaks between a shift. They want minimum uninterrupted periods between shifts. They want consecutive shifts and shift patterns. They want adequate minimum breaks between shift changes to ensure appropriate rest and recovery. They want adequate rest and recovery periods to be taken at night and the frequency of on call commitments of medical officers to enhance the value of rest and recovery periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is from the AMA. This is from the doctors who are one of the health providers for this nation. Why do they want this? They want this so that they are able to be fresh and deliver high quality care. They are obviously indicating that, if people are operating under circumstances where they are not fresh, alert and awake, the quality of care is not the optimum that they would choose to deliver. That is highly commendable. It should ensure that people look very closely at this, because occupational health and safety and things like maximum hours per shift and minimum breaks between shifts do have to become a minimum standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember 30 years ago working a shift pattern that had only an eight&hyphen;hour break between one set of shifts. You finished at 10 o'clock one night and you started again the next morning at 6 o'clock. That meant you got fewer than eight hours sleep. Some 30 years ago when you were nursing, whilst your shift might have started at 6 a.m., you were expected to be there at 5.30 at the latest and you had to get up half an hour before that to get ready. You did not go to sleep immediately at 10 p.m. because you were flat strap getting off the shift at 10 o'clock&mdash;you usually got off at 10.15&mdash;so you were down to five and six hours sleep. Our efficiency, our productivity, was shot to pieces and not particularly good.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even now, when people are coming off night shift and going on to day shift, employers are attempting to have people finish their night shifts at 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the morning and front up again that afternoon at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock&mdash;and that is without even having a sleep at night. So, basically, in 24 hours they are expecting people to work two shifts, and it is not of their own volition. These are the sorts of things that will be able to be done under this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take note of the comment from Senator Ferguson because his comments are always intended so kindly. I have some questions to ask about the principal objects of this act. I will go to the queries I have as I read through it. It starts off by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal object of this Act is to provide a framework for cooperative workplace relations which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia by:</PARA>
<PARA>And then it lists the 10 objects of this act. As I understand the amendments, there is an 11th object to be inserted, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . assisting in giving effect to Australia's international obligations in relation to labour standards.</PARA>
<PARA>At some point, I would like to know from the minister whether the listing of these objects affects the interpretation of the act. If a matter were taken, for example, to the High Court, would the High Court have to consider whether or not a particular action by the commission itself was conducive to higher productivity or to a more flexible labour market? If the court had to make that deci <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4742"> sion, in what way would it go about giving effect to such a decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What purpose, if any, do the objects as listed have in helping either the commission or a court interpret the act? If it does not have any effect, why is it in there? Is it in there simply because it is following the precedence set by the present act, or is there some other reason? Object (a) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . encouraging the pursuit of high employment, improved living standards, low inflation and international competitiveness through higher productivity and a flexible labour market;</PARA>
<PARA>Why do you want to pursue a flexible labour market when the reading of that particular clause says you have to get higher productivity through other means? That particular object says the object should be `higher productivity and a flexible labour market' as if the concept of a flexible labour market is divorced from the idea of higher productivity. If that is not so, why are the words `and a flexible labour market' added after the words `higher productivity' as an object to be gained under these provisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same section, why does object (a) encourage the pursuit of high employment rather than simply encourage high unemployment itself? Why is the pursuit of high employment rather than high employment itself a desirable objective? I would have thought most people would want high employment rather than simply try to go after it. Object (b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ensuring that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with the employer and employees at the workplace or enterprise level.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that particular clause mean there has to be an equal input into the making of an agreement by the employer and the employee in question, or can one or other of those people have a greater input into the agreement? Does the commission, and ultimately the High Court, have to be satisfied that the employer and employees have an equal input? It says here that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with them, so one has a greater determining factor than the other. Does that in any way go <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> against the sense of the principal objects of this act? Object (c) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . enabling employers and employees to choose the most appropriate form of agreement for their particular circumstances, whether or not that form is provided for by this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>I notice that object (d) goes on to state there must be `minimum wages and conditions'. But what is meant by that phrase `whether or not that form is provided for by this Act'? Does it simply talk there in terms of the actual drafting of the agreement, or does it mean that the content of the agreement is in issue? If it means that the content of the agreement can be other than provided for by this act, what is the purpose of having this act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Object (d) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . providing the means:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for wages and conditions of employment to be determined as far as possible by the agreement of employers and employees at the workplace or enterprise level, upon a foundation of minimum standards; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to ensure that there is an effective award safety net of fair minimum wages and conditions of employment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and it goes on. But how does (d) fit in with (c) if the form can be other than `provided for by this act'? Object (e), which follows, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . providing a framework of rights and responsibilities for employers and employees, and their organisations, which supports fair and effective agreement-making and ensures that they abide by awards and agreements applying to them . . . </PARA>
<PARA>and it then goes on to the next clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do the particular clauses (c), (d) and (e) affect the legislation, and in particular how do they affect workplace agreements? If the commission or the court were considering whether or not a workplace agreement came within the provisions of this legislation, how far would (c), (d) and (e) affect that exercise? It seems that they would provide people with a very wide ambit within which agreements could be made outside of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Object (f) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ensuring freedom of association, including the rights of employees and employers to join an organisation or association of their choice, or not to join an organisation or association . . .  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4743"> </PARA>
<PARA>That clause is fairly self-evident. Object (g) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ensuring that employee and employer organisations registered under this Act are representative of and accountable to their members . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Does that clause do any more than provide for the present situation under the present act where there are many sections dealing with the financial propriety of the particular organisation in question and the proper means by which people are to be elected? Does (g) go beyond what is contained in the present act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Object (h) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . enabling the Commission to prevent and settle industrial disputes by conciliation and, as a last resort and within specified limits, by arbitration . . . </PARA>
<PARA>An amendment to that object has been signalled which, I think, is to delete the words `as a last resort' inserting instead the words `as far as possible'. Could I ask: what difference do the words which are proposed to be substituted make to the effect of item (h)? In other words, what is the difference between the expression `as far as possible' and the expression `as a last resort'? It might be thought that doing something `as far as possible' is much the same as going on to the next step, `as a last resort'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Object (i) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities effectively through the development of mutually beneficial work practices with employers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How does that particular item gel with the rest of the principles? The rest of the principles are devoted, it would seem, to encouraging higher productivity, flexible labour markets and low inflation. How does (i) marry in with the rest of the objects? I know that we cannot say how that marrying in will be effected finally, but what does the government consider the effect of (i) to be when measured against the rest of the objects? What would it consider the commission and the courts would do about trying to marry those two together? In fact, as I have asked before, do the principles as set out here have any legal effect in any event?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Object (j) states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . respecting and valuing the diversity of the work force by helping to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.</PARA>
<PARA>What does `respecting and valuing' those things mean? Where in the proposed act is that particular object reflected?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, there is the one to be put in:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . assisting in giving effect to Australia's international obligations in relation to labour standards.</PARA>
<PARA>Its meaning is self-evident, but it would be interesting to know where in the bill there is a manifestation that that particular object is going to be carried out. I do not expect to get the answer to this question now, perhaps as time goes by I will: are there any specific parts in the bill which form the carrying out of each of the 11 objects that are set out? In other words, could we get a chart which shows what part of the bill carries out the intent that each of these objects contains?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that I follow the nightwatchman because he has raised a number of issues that are dear to my heart in respect of the objects of this workplace relations bill before us. I share the same concerns as Senator Cooney. When I read through the objects, I wondered what the purpose of the objects is and who the objects are addressed to. Are they addressed primarily to the courts&mdash;and to this parliament&mdash;employers, industrial relations consultants, unions or employees? To whom do they have the greatest application? Are there areas that I have mentioned to which they have no application whatsoever?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the objects of anything&mdash;a bill before this parliament, an award, an organisation, whatever it might be&mdash;are to play a significant role in how an organisation or a particular piece of legislation should perform. In this case, the objects have quite clearly missed the mark. I believe that in time there will be difficulties in interpreting where these objects are best placed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a cursory glance at the objects, one would interpret that many of them have been <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4744"> made specifically for the employers. When I look at the objects piece by piece, I become confused as to how they dovetail in to the piece of legislation before us. That was indicated by Senator Cooney. In particular, with object (a) I see a missed opportunity for both the government and the Australian Democrats to address one of the prime issues that confronts this nation&mdash;unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the object says `encouraging the pursuit of high employment', at no stage do we know what that means. We do not know whether it means the pursuit of full-time employment, the pursuit of part-time employment or the pursuit of casual or contract work. Of course, the form of work is particularly important. This bill could have been&mdash;should have been&mdash;the means and the opportunity for the government to address the issue that I have raised in this place before, that is, the changing nature of work. This would have been an ideal opportunity for this bill to address and redress that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats, of course, sadly missed the mark, as did the government. So, when the first principle says `encouraging the pursuit of high employment', we are none the wiser as to whether this means that it is the government's objective to pursue more full-time employment and more meaningful employment for people in the community or whether it is an employer objective&mdash;I think it is meant to be&mdash;which sees more people thrust into part-time and casual employment. So this is not addressed, to my way of thinking, in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly and sadly, it is a missed opportunity on the part of the government, particularly when unemployment is on the increase, particularly when something like 25 per cent of all the jobs in the work force are part-time, particularly when about 6.5 per cent of the work force are underemployed and particularly when people are overworked in our work force&mdash;37 per cent of the full-time work force are estimated to be working 49 hours or more per week, and full-time workers are already averaging 42.6 hours per week, which is an increase of two hours per week over the last 10 years.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One then questions: where does this objective fit in? What is its purpose? What is its role? As I said, the government and the Democrats have sorely missed the mark of being able to address this fundamental issue which goes to the very heart of the livelihood of people in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks further at that, the pursuit of high employment, are we talking about part-time, casual or contract employment, all of which have, over a period of time, been replacing standard jobs? My concern in this of course is that, when you look also at downsizing, you will find that there are about 300 senior people at Westpac to go, over 20,000 at Telstra to go, and so on. We have this problem that is persisting and I cannot see how it will be addressed in the objects that are currently before this chamber in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that it fails to address&mdash;and it is not reflected later in the bill from my reading of it&mdash;is the issue of full-time junior employment. Full-time junior employment, from my experience in service industries and the retail industries has collapsed over a long period of time. Junior rates, whilst they were available to employers, saw no lifting in the employment rate of young people. Here we have a thrust of pursuing high employment in an era when we have high levels of junior unemployment. We have very low levels of juniors being employed full time. So I really question what this objective means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second object that I want to look at briefly is object (b). Object (b) refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring that the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting the relationship between employers and employees rests with the employer and employees at the workplace or enterprise level;</PARA>
<PARA>This objective, as one of my colleagues said earlier, fails totally to take any cognisance of the role of the trade union movement in the industrial relations arena. This objective, by my interpretation, seeks to exclude&mdash;more so than include&mdash;the trade union movement. One would think that this is a negative path to be going down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Object (c) states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4745">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the most appropriate form of agreement for their particular circumstances, whether or not that form is provided for by this Act;</PARA>
<PARA>That is most inconclusive indeed. It is certainly very open-ended. It leaves a lot to be questioned in terms of young people who will be exposed to the vagaries of this act. It is not clarified in any way within the act itself, as far as I can see. Therefore, it takes up very clearly the point that was raised by my colleague Senator Cooney before I stood here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks further to object (d), it talks about the foundation of minimum standards. Whilst there are certain minimum standards within this particular act, there seems to be no indication in either the objects or within the act itself as to how those minimum standards are to be moved over time. Or, having once been established, are they established forever more? It does not give any indication in the objects when the standards are to be set in place; in other words, where the line in the sand would be drawn in terms of the particular standards that are to apply. I find that particular object within the act quite difficult to come to grips with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One also finds, within object (d)(ii), the reference to ensure the maintenance of an effective award safety net of fair and enforceable minimum wages and conditions of employment. This particular objective is going to be difficult to put into practice because of the reduced role that the Industrial Relations Commission will find itself having under this particular act. Whilst it is an objective, it is not an achievable objective in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Object (e), effectively, as I understand it, destroys the award system by stealth because&mdash;as I read the particular objective&mdash;it talks about agreement making rather than focusing on the basis of the award, which, in another part of the objectives, seems to be the underpinning and underlying safety net for those people without any form of industrial muscle, without any voice, without any form of representation. I find that particular objective at odds with the purpose of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to objects (f) and (g). The particular concern that I have with object (f)&mdash;and this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is one that I think needs to be addressed&mdash;is that it refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring freedom of association, including the rights of employees and employers to join an organisation or association of their choice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That really is quite open. Again, on reading of the proposed bill, it in no way covers some quite bizarre possibilities that could come about as a result of that objective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues in making a contribution in the committee stage of the debate on the very important Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I want to make some remarks about the objects of the bill and the amendments proposed by both Labor and the Greens. I think debating the objects of the bill allows us to have a wide debate about the purpose of the bill, which I think is important in terms of setting the scene for the more detailed debate that will occur as we move through the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to start by saying that it is with a sense of futility that I rise today. I usually limit my contributions in the Senate to occasions when I think it is important to make a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4746"> contribution in the hope of making some difference to the outcome, to public debate in Australia or to some wider purpose rather than just to get my speaking time up, as some senators have been wont to do over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, given that the deal that has apparently been struck between the Democrats and the government in relation to this bill seems to preclude any impact from the debate changing that deal, we are in a very difficult position. As I understand the Democrats' position from their public comments I have read, there is very little likelihood of them being able to accommodate any arguments put to them in this debate because they have signed off on a written deal with the government and the government will hold them to that deal in the sense of not allowing them to stray from the deal even if arguments put to them would convince them that further amendment is necessary.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One feature of the native title legislation was the fact that amendments and the final outcome of the bill were not known until people sat down and worked out what the amendments that we had passed meant. It is quite a contrast.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You certainly debated them. My purpose is to say that I hope that that is not the case, that the Democrats will listen to the debate and that their position is more flexible. Clearly, if they are locked in with the government, then there is a sense of futility about the debate. We will attempt to persuade them. We will continue to have the debate because I think it is important for it to be on the public record and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the Australian community to understand the principles at stake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is tempting to start a contribution by doing what a lot of journalists in this country have done, which is to look at the government bill and then look at the amendments to be moved by the Democrats and the government, analyse their impact and say this is what this debate is about&mdash;the difference between the original bill and the new deal offered by the Democrat and government amendments. That is not the real game at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real analysis has to be a comparison of the existing Industrial Relations Act with the bill as it would be amended by the amendments proposed by the government and the Democrats. That is the real contrast. That is where the real game is. That is where you can analyse what changes are proposed for industrial relations in this country. I think people were a little swayed by the publicity and the sort of spin put on the announcement the other day of Cheryl Kernot and Peter Reith, dancing in ball gowns or what have you, and we got a bit distracted from that analysis. That is what we have got to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new objects stress the role of the employee in industrial relations, they stress the role of the individual workplace and they talk a lot about flexible markets, et cetera. They are quite a change from our traditional industrial relations approach and represent quite a radical change in direction in terms of the major piece of industrial relations legislation in this country. As I say, the stress is on individual employees negotiating their conditions and it takes away a lot of the structure and the tradition of industrial relations practice in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have added words like `fair' to the objects. That looks great. It is like adding `motherhood'&mdash;I am surprised we did not add that in. If you look at the original act and then the proposed bill as amended, you see what the real debate is about&mdash;that is, they are giving primacy to individual negotiations. They are trying to remove from the system the role of unions and employer representative bodies and they are trying to give primacy to individual negotiations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4747">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key provision in my view is the existing paragraph (e) of the objects of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, which says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">encouraging the organisation of representative bodies of employers and employees and their registration under this Act . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the latest expression of 92 years of encouragement of the role of employee and employer bodies in the industrial relations system in this country. Ever since the original Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, we have encouraged the role of employer and employee bodies within our industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have regulated them, but we have given them positive encouragement and set out their roles and responsibilities and ensured that they play a key role in ensuring fairness and the proper resolution of industrial disputes in this country. This bill does not do that. For the first time in Australia's history, employer and employee representative bodies will not be encouraged. They will be regulated, but they will not be encouraged. In my view, that is the key difference in this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I wish to address today relates to the Australian National University and the most recent student association elections on that campus. I recently received a letter from a female student on that campus who wrote to me expressing her genuine concern about the events that took place there in recent times. I think it is important that we highlight what occurred there to put into context the debate that we have just witnessed in relation to the role of unions and these so&hyphen;called representative bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allow me to quote substantially from the letter I received, because it sets out the factual circumstances in a fairly brief but nevertheless <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> detailed way so that people can understand what the problem was. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to draw your attention to the 1996 ANU Students' Association elections that were held in the last week of last term, and where the Labor&hyphen;endorsed ticket, "Rage" were caught with their hand in the ballot&hyphen;box so to speak.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elections were held in the last week of third term. There were four main tickets involved . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the current SA President is William Mackerras, a member of the Labor Club. His Treasurer, Daniel Jenkins, is also a member of the Labor Club, and was the Presidential candidate for the Rage ticket. Due to the SA electoral regulations, it was up to the current executive to appoint the returning officers. William delegated this job to Daniel (despite the fact that he was a presidential candidate) . . . Five student officials were appointed . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Polling took place and was uneventful (except for a failed attempt at a beer&hyphen;stack by the Labor Club) until the last afternoon. An impartial and apolitical student observed one of the Rage candidates (and Labor Club member), . . . attempt to stuff a wad of ballots into the presidential box. He was initially unsuccessful, but was seen trying again a little later and this time succeeding. A complaint was lodged, and special care taken when opening the Box for counting the following Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 146 suspicious ballots were found in total, all of them bundled together in wads, and all of them&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>surprisingly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with Rage candidate Daniel Jenkins number 1. Scrutineers say that there were four distinct handwriting types on the ballots, that the ballots were originals, not forgeries, and that all carried the initials of either one of two returning officers&mdash;neither of whom were checked with any other candidates prior to polling.</PARA>
<PARA>Believe it or not, Mr Mackerras is currently conducting an investigation. In other words, Labor is going to investigate Labor. It is likely that even if the candidate had not been seen placing the forms in the box they would have been caught anyway, because the ballot papers were stuffed into the ballot box in wads, rather than as single sheets, which is how they would have appeared if placed there by legitimate voters. This sort of corruption of the student union process at the Australian National University ought be a matter of great concern to everybody.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Bolkus is interjecting. He is undoubtedly laying his own credibility in honesty and integrity on the line and trying to say that somehow this is an appropriate course of conduct. We know it happens in the Labor Party on a regular basis, so it is nothing new for senators opposite. But those on this side happen to believe in the democratic process and that you either win fairly or lose fairly. You do not have the introduction of all these excess votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know, of course, of the rumours about the way that your former Prime Minister is alleged to have won his preselection. Yes, senators opposite are starting to smile when that is mentioned. They are not roaring out denying that ballot boxes were rigged and extra votes introduced to allow that to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is a matter of concern that this has taken place at the Australian National University. It is interesting to note that the same Mr Jenkins who was the beneficiary of those 146 introduced votes wrote in very pious terms in his local student newspaper only a few months before. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1995 election results overwhelmingly made it clear that the membership of the student association fundamentally rejects the people that don't believe in the organisation or the democratic process itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet he or people on his behalf were introducing those extra 146 ballots into the ballot box&mdash;undoubtedly to give democracy a little help; to ensure that Labor might at last win an election!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, although there were only about 1,000 votes cast, even with the introduction of the 146 votes the Labor candidate still did not win. It really does indicate how hopeless the whole effort was and I think it is to the great credit of the student who observed what occurred that it was brought to the notice of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This is a student association which people are compelled to belong to. They have to belong to it if they are to get a tertiary education.

Through his interjections, Senator Forshaw is basically telling the Australian people that that is a fair and reasonable system. Yet they still wonder why they were so overwhelmingly rejected on 2 March! You see, people believe in a fair go and those who believe in a fair go would say you ought be entitled to a university degree&mdash;in fact, the right to enter a university&mdash;without the need to join a student association. The joining of the student association might somehow be desirable in some people's eyes, but these students are old enough to pick their own courses, they are old enough to decide where they are going to live and which university they are going to study at. Surely they are old enough to also determine whether or not they want to belong to a student association, because those students who are forced to belong to the student association then have to make a determination whether or not they can afford the time to fight the sort of skulduggery that I brought forward earlier in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>

Rorts may well be common in the Labor Party. We know of other occurrences in union elections where that has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting to look opposite to see how many senators are former union officials. They tell me that in Labor Party circles these days the preselectors have a joke. They ask people, `What do they call a failed trade union leader?' Answer, `Senator.' That is where they put failed trade union leaders these days. They get shunted off into the Senate to get them out of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can see the sorts of tactics that they were trained in from university days, as witnessed by these recent events at the Australian National University. I hope that there is a full and detailed inquiry. I would have thought that, rather than having a situation where students are not allowed to sit exams at the Australian National University and have their results withheld because they are not members of the student association, that when they find all those involved in this incident they might like to bring some discipline to bear and deny them the right to their education and to sit exams and be given their results. Then the university may gain some credibility in this very sordid matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the students at the Australian National University who have been pursuing this issue, who want to see justice and who have exposed that what the Labor Party gets up to in trade union ballots, in preselections, seems to be taught to them at a very early age at university. From there they just seem to graduate and go on to bigger and better things. Of course, the prime example of that was the former failed Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when he was preselected for his own seat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I look forward to the day when students are able to study at university right around this country without being forced to be members of student associations and where they are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able to pursue their chosen career without having to continually look over their shoulders of those Labor students who want to play politics and, more importantly, want to play it in such a corrupt manner as the ANU Labor Club has shown that it is willing to do.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

I sought to remind him&mdash;perhaps I should not have interjected&mdash;about what took place in Tasmania where the Liberal government, under the then Premier Gray in caretaker mode, obviously tried to corrupt the electoral process of the whole state and there was a royal commission into it.

Indeed, the Groom government made sure that the costs of the perpetrators were paid, including a convicted criminal, Rouse. So let's not get too pious about which side of the Senate has clean hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk now about the principles upon which the society of this country is based and the shameful lack of leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on those principles. There is a key principle, I believe, that this country should operate under, and that is the pursuit of a harmonious and cooperative community spirit. There is an article, and a cartoon, on page 16 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>: I would describe the article by Malcolm McGregor as an angry article. I think Malcolm McGregor is entitled to be angry because the subject that he is dealing with is one which brings great shame upon the leadership of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a quote in that article from Robert F. Kennedy, who was, I think, one of the leading figures in American politics until he himself became a victim of the violence and hatred that continues to grow in the community in the United States. It is a model that we should learn from and avoid. I want to quote extensively from the article because I think it should be on the public record even more <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4750"> than it is by being published in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. The article begins by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the immediate aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King, rioting swept through American cities with significant black populations. The next day Senator Robert F. Kennedy, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, delivered a speech that is as poignant and relevant in our nation today as it was in the United States in 1968.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kennedy offered healing in place of hate, and conciliation instead of revenge when he told his audience: "When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his colour or his beliefs or the policies he pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your freedom or your job or your family then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies. . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We learn at last to look at our brothers as aliens, men with whom we share a city, but not a community; men bound to us in common dwelling but not in common effort. We learn to share only a common fear, only a common desire to retreat from each other only a common impulse to meet disagreement with force."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And he added: "Our lives on this planet are too short and the work to be done too great to let this spirit flourish any longer in our land."</PARA>
<PARA>They are great comments which I commend in terms of their eloquence and logic. I commend Mr McGregor. Further in the article he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">History tends to be kinder to the dreamers and healers than to the frightened little people like Pauline Hanson.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think it was appropriate that he used the words `little people' because I do not think Pauline Hanson deserves to be elevated or reduced in her stature as a member of this community. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Needless to relate she will never grace our public life with one speech which appeals to what Lincoln termed "the better angels of our nature". And she will in time return to grinding obscurity, having neither enriched nor ennobled our lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is because it takes no wisdom nor any courage to mouth ignorant and uninformed prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the article he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What surprises me is not Hanson's lack of sophistication but the breathless way it is all being received in the media. She has discovered nothing and presents virtually no facts. She just whines <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> away about our being "swamped by Asians". The most cursory examination of the facts shows that proposition to be unsustainable. The fact she feels this is more a comment on her alienation and timidity than on the demographic make up of Australia or the composition of our migrant intake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">And that is why John Howard's squirming about in awe of Hanson's poll numbers is so pathetic. Leadership, especially of the type that masquerades as being "for all of us", imposes a moral duty to confront socially destructive ignorance. Howard's shameful performance has been dramatically highlighted by the public repudiation of Hanson by Liberals of the stature of Tony Staley, Malcolm Fraser and Fred Chaney.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister is clearly coming under more pressure about his shameful lack of leadership in this issue. Later in the article, McGregor says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But until Howard designated himself a latter day Simon Bolivar, the peddlers of ignorance did not feel they had the licence now accorded them. Censorship is not the answer. But a line by line rebuttal of distortions and misconception is. And it should have come from the very top a long time ago. Of course an even loftier appeal to the decency and generosity that co&hyphen;exists with fear and anger in all of us would have been even more admirable. But I accept that is well beyond the present occupant of Kirribilli House.</PARA>
<PARA>And he says that in reference to the Prime Minister. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that regard the contribution of the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Harry Goodhew, was most appropriate. He was saddened to hear that `some of our Asian brothers and sisters' had been verbally and physically abused in the street, he said.</PARA>
<PARA>Even Senator O'Chee has reported to the Australian media that he has been the subject of such abuse, such ignorance, in his own electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that the lack of leadership by the Prime Minister is substantially to blame for the heightening of this sort of comment in our community and the feeling some people have that they are at liberty to reveal their prejudice and to abuse members of the community in such an undeserved way. McGregor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This debate is not about freedom of speech. It is about the core moral and ethical issues that set the tone of our society. To that extent it demands the same evangelical fervour that the apparent majority of Christians in the House of Representatives is now bringing to bear on the euthanasia proposal. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4751"> From my reckoning Jesus spent more time urging compassion for the downtrodden than he did arguing the merits of mercy killing.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation where the position of the Prime Minister is being more and more exposed in the media. Business is clearly uncomfortable about the impact of his lack of leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper that I want to refer to, but I also want to add here that the Prime Minister's own political colleagues in the states are becoming more and more uncomfortable with his lack of leadership. Certainly, premiers Court, Borbidge and Rundle are uncomfortable, and I believe that is also true of Premier Kennett and Premier Brown, as to the impact of the lack of leadership on Australia's trade position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today Michael Gordon says in his commentary on page 4 under the heading, `PM pays for failure to confront misfit':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOHN Howard is now paying the price of his failure to move swiftly and directly to counter the views of Pauline Hanson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now clear that Mr Howard miscalculated when he decided that direct repudiation would serve only to elevate the views of the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The truth is that the Prime Minister's refusal to more directly confront the inaccuracy, ignorance and bigotry of Ms Hanson served only to increase her profile.</PARA>

<PARA>I must say that it is rather suspicious that this matter is being played in this way. It seems to me that this is being played on the basis of politics and not on the basis of good policy, and I concur to that extent with the comments of Michael Gordon. Later in his article he says:</PARA>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to speak on behalf of people who cannot speak for themselves. I am rising to speak for another generation of Australians who are being asked to pay a price that some of us have already paid. I am rising to speak on behalf of the young school students who are ethnic Asian, but farther in heart from Asia and far closer in heart to Australia than anyone can possibly imagine. I am speaking in this place because it is about time that those young Aussies, the flower of the next generation, received the respect that they deserve in the schools which they attend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other place, an honourable member has said that we should halt Asian immigration. There have been claims that Asians are responsible for tuberculosis, that Asians are responsible for crime, and that Asians are responsible for the forthcoming civil war. As every honourable senator knows, each one of those claims was outrageously false and outrageously ill informed. I want to deal with each of those claims briefly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last century, it was believed that Asians were responsible for leprosy. That was false, just as it is false to say that Asians are responsible for tuberculosis. The facts are that no ethnic group is more susceptible genetically to tuberculosis than is any other ethnic group. Tuberculosis is a consequence of one's environment. Asians coming to this country cannot be responsible for the introduction of tuberculosis, because every person seeking permanent residency in this country has to undergo a health check before they get their residency. Of course, there are those who say, `Oh well, it is the Asian tourists who bring <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4752"> tuberculosis.' If that is true&mdash;and it is hardly likely, because it tends to be the people who have the best diet and the best health in Asia who come down here&mdash;and we are to close our borders to these people, then it also follows that we must close our borders and stop Australians going overseas, lest an Australian get tuberculosis overseas and bring it back here. So Asians are not responsible for our health crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Asians are not responsible for our crime rate. In fact, to the extent that the Bureau of Criminology keeps statistics of crime rates of different ethnic groups in this country, the ethnic Asian community has one of the lowest crime rates in Australia. You only have to go and sit in the criminal courts of any city in this country to see that that is a fact. There are very few ethnic Asian defendants in court cases, because there are very few ethnic Asian criminals. So that is also an outrageous and ill&hyphen;informed comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, of course, there is the suggestion that the Asian community in this country is going to cause a civil war. Why would we want to cause a civil war? This is our country; it is our precious homeland in which we were born, in which we were nurtured, and in which we strive to live in freedom and in peace. We have no interest in civil war, we have no interest in strife, and we have no interest in division. Our interest is in peace and equality and freedom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to the claim that freedom of speech is paramount. Freedom of speech is important. It was one of the things for which our Anzacs fought and died. It was one of the finest, most wondrous gifts which we inherited from the Westminster system. But freedom of speech counts for nothing unless the citizens of a nation enjoy freedom from fear, freedom from violence and freedom from persecution. Together, freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom from violence and freedom from persecution are the four great freedoms on which this nation was built. But none is more important than the others, and those who exercise freedom of speech must ensure, just as those who exercise the freedom to drive a car must ensure, that their freedom does not come at the expense of the freedom <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of others to live safe from fear or persecution or violence. Every freedom in this country is a freedom that must be exercised cautiously and lovingly, if that freedom is to have value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If she truly believes in a united Australia, in one Australia, one people and one flag, it is about time that the honourable member for Oxley, Mrs Hanson, called on her supporters to cease the intimidation and the violence against young Australians of ethnic Asian background. Unless she does so, she gives lie to her claim that she is interested in one Australia. Unless she does so, she divides this country. Unless she says that racial persecution must stop, nobody in this country can have any faith that her comments about building one country are anything other than mere rhetoric.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk about those precious young Australians who are the victims of the consequences of her actions. In hundreds of schools around this country young Australians watched the clock in fear as the minute&hyphen;hand ticked closer to lunchtime. They knew that once they left the safety of their classroom and entered the playground, they would become the whipping boys and the whipping girls of the fear and paranoia that Mrs Hanson has whipped up in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say that? I say it because I know it. Twenty&hyphen;five years ago I was one of those children. I do not speak about it often in this place. In fact, I have never spoken about that to this day, but it is true. I understand how Mrs Hanson can feel discriminated against when she sees people getting special treatment on the basis of the colour of their skin, and to a certain extent it is discriminatory. But that is nothing in comparison to the real discrimination and fear that these wonderful young people feel as the clock comes round to lunchtime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really believe that this country is far finer than the vision of hate and division which has been created in the last couple of months. This nation is about upholding the fundamental truths which attract people from the four corners of the world. As the people come to us from the four corners of the world, I propose a four&hyphen;square deal for all Australians because there are four truths that underpin <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4753"> everything in Australian society. They are as follows. Freedom&mdash;freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom from persecution and freedom from violence. A fair go&mdash;equality of opportunity regardless of circumstance, regardless of the colour of your skin, regardless of the wealth or poverty of your parents. Mateship&mdash;loving one's countrymen, respecting them and treating them as you would want to be treated yourself. And reward for effort&mdash;looking after those who seek to look after themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the four great truths upon which this nation was built. They marked the upward passage of our society and turned us from a convict settlement into one of the greatest nations on the face of the earth. They encouraged young Australian men and women to spread these truths to other countries and to other people less fortunate than ourselves. They are the four great truths which we should seek to uphold in this place. Protecting the weak, the needy and the vulnerable are a consequence of the four great truths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this nation is to have any meaning, if this society is to have any value, we must ensure for all of our citizens the four&hyphen;square deal which I outline here today. But, most importantly, unless you have lived with fear, unless you have felt it well up in your throat, unless you have come scarred and battered from the battlefield of the intolerant mind, freedom of speech, which is won with little effort and paid for with no sacrifice, is freedom of speech in rhetoric only. It is really freedom to be intolerant. I believe the finest thing we can offer is a tolerant Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Mrs Hanson that, if she believes in the Australian spirit, if she believes in one Australia, she should publicly call on those who support her to end the hatred. If she does not, it is not being cruel to be kind, it is being cruel to be cruel. At the end of the day, despite our differences across this chamber, we are here because we love what Australia can be. Do not turn it into something which it should not be or once was and should be for ever regretted. But lift high our hopes, our aspirations and our vision to make one Australia mean one people who live free from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fear and free from persecution. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to participate in the debate on matters of public interest. Before I turn to the subject that I specifically wish to deal with, I will make a couple of brief comments about the speeches of Senator O'Brien and Senator O'Chee. Firstly, I read the article in today's paper by Malcolm McGregor. I do not normally agree with the articles written by Malcolm McGregor when they relate particularly to what may or may not be happening in the Australian Labor Party in the New South Wales branch but I have to say that today's article is one of the most beautifully written and poignant articles that I have read on this issue and I congratulate Malcolm for that. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think he does, as Senator O'Brien commented, capture very eloquently the important issues in this debate and the need for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to stand up and be counted on this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Saturday I went with my family to see a performance of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Miss Saigon</EMPHASIS> in Sydney. This is a show which has attracted many thousands of people during its long season. I could not help thinking at the time that many Australians were there watching and enjoying the show.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, this horrible dilemma that is out there in the community at the moment where unfortunately many people are letting their fears run away with their judgment&mdash;irrational fears at that. The story of the stage show <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Miss Saigon</EMPHASIS>  revolves <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4754"> around the involvement of America and, of course, Australia in the terrible Vietnam conflict. The involvement of the Australian and American forces in that conflict was sought to be justified on the basis that they were over there defending freedom and defending the rights of people in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether one agrees or disagrees with that&mdash;I was one who believed we should not be there&mdash;the fact is that we were in their country and certainly not at their invitation. Many Vietnamese refugees have come to Australia to escape civil war. And, indeed, many refugees and migrants from Europe have come to escape the ravages of civil war in their areas. We have invited them and we have welcomed them. Therefore, on that score alone, we should exercise and preach tolerance and acceptance rather than the division and hatred that is currently being expressed. That is an issue that I intend to speak about on another occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the matter that I want to speak about today, which is also a matter of public interest. It is a matter on which I have spoken before: the potential for the building of a Sydney second airport at Holsworthy. If this proposal comes to fruition it will impact upon the lives of hundreds of thousands of residents in south-west Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I bring to the attention of the Senate some of the more recent developments that have occurred in relation to this issue. The government is letting the people and the community of that region in Sydney down, and it stands condemned for doing that. When Holsworthy was put on the list of two potential sites to be investigated for Sydney's second airport, the people, and the community of that region, were promised the most full, open and transparent environmental impact assessment that had ever been conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is on the record as having stated that on a number of occasions. For instance, on 28 May, in response to a question from the member for Hughes, Mrs Vale, Mr Sharp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there will be a full environmental impact study on both Badgerys's Creek and Holsworthy. The study will follow the guidelines established by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involves full public consultation, full industry consultation and its being a transparent process. The honourable member for Hughes is concerned to ensure that residents of her electorate will have their views considered in this process. I assure the honourable member for Hughes that that will be the case: their views will be considered and given great weight in the process of determining the environmental impact study.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, that is not the case. The government has not lived up to that commitment and, unfortunately, as each day and each week goes by that commitment continues to be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, as we know, at no stage prior to the election did the coalition parties indicate that they intended putting Holsworthy back on the list as a possible site for Sydney airport. They went to the election, like the Labor Party did, with a commitment to build an airport at Badgerys Creek. The electorate of Hughes and surrounding electorates in south&hyphen;west Sydney were deceived by this government because they had been told on numerous occasions that Holsworthy would never be the site for Sydney's second airport. And we all know the reasons why it had been ruled out many years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have settled into that area, purchased land put up for sale by the Defence Housing Authority and made their lives in that region. But notwithstanding the decision to then put it back on the list, commitments were made about a full and open process. Of course we know that the amount of time given for community responses to the draft guidelines was initially limited to four weeks. It was only through community agitation and representations by parliamentarians, including myself, that that was extended by another month&mdash;still not sufficient time for people to adequately get across a very complex issue regarding the environmental impact of such an airport. Nevertheless, the government was forced to back down in its haste to rush this process through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I read a moment ago, the minister had given a commitment to follow the guidelines laid down by the Senate select committee report. One of the recommendations of that committee was and I quote:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4755">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a `parallel environmental audit' procedure should be available</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">during the preparation by the proponent of an EIS for a significant proposal, with the auditor having access to the same data as the proponent;</PARA>
<PARA>The EIS process was commenced. The draft guidelines were prepared and released to the public, as I said, with a very short duration in which to respond. The consultant to undertake the EIS has been appointed and yet still no environmental auditor, as recommended by the Senate select committee and endorsed by the minister, has been appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was only on 22 October that the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, issued a media release stating: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has announced the Government will appoint an independent environmental auditor for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process for the proposed second major airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the process is about halfway complete. The consultants are due to report by early next year&mdash;only two or three months away. The consultants have already been appointed. They have already commenced discussions with the councils and other groups in the area. They have already started to compile their information on this particular site, which is the Holsworthy army base and, still, the government has not appointed the auditor; they have only just called for expressions of interest. The media release put out by the minister goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Environment Department has written to seven leading environment consultancy firms asking for expressions of interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Further down it says that the minister hopes that an appointment can be made within two to three weeks. What sort of a process is this? The department has written to seven consultancy firms. Nobody knows who these consultancy firms are except, presumably, the minister and the department. I am beginning to wonder whether or not DDB Needham have been put on the list. We may find that out in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an example again of this government making statements about openness, community involvement and keeping faith with the people&mdash;the great hallmarks it claimed it was going to implement&mdash;yet on <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such an important issue as the biggest single infrastructure project we will see in the Sydney region in coming years, other than the Olympics, the government still has not appointed the environmental auditor, that is, the person or the company that will be charged with the responsibility of ensuring the community's interests are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a further concern that arises. The responsibility for overseeing this process in terms of the environmental aspects rests with the Environment Protection Agency. We know that this government really does not think too much of the Environment Protection Agency because at one stage it was their policy to get rid of it. But they have not done that. What they have proceeded to do is to nobble it so that it will become merely an arm of the government, rather than an independent authority charged with ensuring absolute integrity with respect to the EIS process. And what have we seen in recent days? The Executive Director of the agency, Mr Barry Carbon, and the Assistant Secretary, Mr John Ashe, have both resigned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The EPA is leaderless and rudderless. Yet it is the body supposedly looking after the interests of the people of south&hyphen;west Sydney&mdash;indeed, of all of Sydney&mdash;by ensuring that this process is conducted properly. The people of south&hyphen;west Sydney have absolutely no faith in this government when it comes to this issue. They do not believe them and they are in fear that they will have an airport thrust upon them. It is about time the government started to live up to the promises they made to those people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on the issue of race that has been discussed earlier today by Senator O'Brien and Senator O'Chee. I am moved to speak on it because I have always held the view&mdash;which was just reinforced for me by Senator O'Chee&mdash;that unless you really are a victim of racism, unless you experience it, then you do not really understand it fully. That is not to say that those who do not experience it do not understand it. But when you are the victim of it, you know the de <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4756"> meaning, corrosive, negative effect it can have on people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to do today is put on record some of my thoughts about the current bushfire that is pervading our society, and also put it into some sort of context. As a young person&mdash;and, I must say, not just as a young person, but even in recent days&mdash;I was also the victim of racially inspired abuse. When you are told, `Go home, you wog,' and you are told that directly in the streets of Australia by people who do not know you but who make that assertion on the basis of what you look like, then you do not feel you are really wanted here as much you thought you were. You do not feel the security that you think you deserve to feel, having been born in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my motivating factors for joining a political party&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;was the issue of race. I was inspired by people like Whitlam and Dunstan in the late 1960s. Consistently through my time in politics I have had a very firm view about how we should treat those who are of different ethnic backgrounds, colour and political beliefs to ourselves. You cannot be a `former' minister for immigration. Because once you have been a minister for immigration the experiences that you have in that job stay with you for the rest of your life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the experiences that stays with me from the three years that I was privileged to hold that portfolio is the enjoyment of the richness and the diversity of our society. Another experience that stays with me is that consistently wherever I travelled in the world as a representative of this country, I felt proud when religious, political and business leaders recognised the degree of tolerance and respect for diversity that Australia, under the multicultural banner, was recognised as achieving internationally</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other motivating factors that makes me get up this afternoon is that in recent weeks&mdash;in particular, the recent seven or eight weeks&mdash;I have had quite a number of calls from people in our community, from all parts of our community. Only a week ago, I was with some Chinese Australian friends&mdash;I was, in fact, experiencing some acupuncture&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when one of them said to me that she had had problems with her 14&hyphen;year&hyphen;old son who had had a metal plate inserted in his eye. That kid needed a metal plate because he had been a victim of racial abuse in the schoolyard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She kept discussing this and telling me about how the daughters of some of her friends have had their hair pulled and how they have been taunted on a racist basis at school. She said that that was bad enough, but the fact that the parents of the kids who did this did not even bother to ring and apologise for this unprovoked racist inspired action hurt her very much. Senator O'Chee, she was saying that, having lived here for quite a number of years, she did not feel the sense of security that she deserved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not the only circumstances that make me get up this afternoon. Members of the Aboriginal community are ringing me. Some of my Asian Australian friends, people who have actually been born here and have made a great success of business life here are getting spat at in galleries, and so on, and being told to go home. This is not the way that Australia needs to go, nor is it the way that we should go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the galling things about this is that these victims do not have their experiences paraded in our media in a way that, for instance, the person that lit the bushfire has her experiences paraded in our media. We do not see the end result of the bushfire that she has lit. We do not see the victims because, firstly, it is hard for people to come up and be brave enough to go on the media and say what they have experienced, and secondly the media is not accessible to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One young Aboriginal person wrote to Pauline Hanson and she floated the letter to some of us, as well. She said to Pauline Hanson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you think you're smart you should see what your show was like on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> . If someone asked you what you think about the Irish or the Scottish coming to Australia, it would be a totally different thing.

<PARA>These are the kids who are suffering and about whom we should be concerned. We should have a greater assumption of responsibility to them to ensure that what is happening is, in many ways, discounted, quarantined and put back in the box in which it belongs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pauline Hanson is of the advance Australia backwards school. Her comments are unfounded, they are ignorant, they are illiterate. It is a position of prejudice, of ignorance, of fear. She has lit a bushfire and it is bushfire which is contrary to our national interest. It is not our destiny, and never has been, to be a monocultural nation that Pauline Hanson dreams of our being. It is not in our national interest. We are judged as a nation on what we stand for, how we respect each other and how tolerant we are of each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diversity of our society is an asset; it is probably our biggest asset. The extent is enormous. We need to foster this diversity and not destroy it. We have been acknowledged as a successful multicultural society internationally. We all benefit from the diversity, from our diets to our economic and social outlooks. Those prospects have been enhanced by the diversity here.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to recognise that. We need to embrace it and we need to ensure that we work it to our advantage. In that respect, how we are seen by the rest of the world is important. We need to treat the Aboriginals in our society in a non&hyphen;racist way and a tolerant way. Race is a commodity in the global community which cannot be underestimated. How we handle the issue of race is not just important to the way that we develop as a society within Australia but it is important to our global image. Unless we get it right, we are going to suffer. And, unfortunately, I think the message is that we are starting to suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might be a lone voice in this&mdash;I do not think so&mdash;but let us not undervalue the importance of immigration to this society. We are a nation of migrants. Not many of us would be here if it was not for planned and unplanned migration programs. If we look at the history of Australia this century, we will find that whenever there has been a depression or a recession, conservative governments, particularly, have responded by bringing in people to stimulate growth and, through growth, to generate employment. If we look at the regions of Australia over recent years, where there has been population growth, we will find economic growth and less unemployment. That is a factor that should not be ignored. I come from South Australia where we have an aging population. We would like to have more population to ensure a critical base there and to ensure a market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look also at the communities that have come in through our migration program. Not one of them can be seen to be a burden on the overall Australian society. They have all very quickly made contributions, not the least being the Vietnamese community which, in very quick time, coming from refugee origins, has reached the top of the class in respect of retention rates at schools, employment records and low levels of criminal records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is the previous waves of migration&mdash;the Irish, the English, the Greeks, the Italians&mdash;or the more recent Vietnamese, Cambodians, Lebanese, Turks, and we go on to 221 different ethnic communities, all of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4758"> them have made and continue to make contributions at home and they also contribute by the fact that they build bridges to the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past, we have had the Hansons and the Campbells and others in our society and their views have been jumped on. It is unfortunate that&mdash;I say it is unfortunate and I will not go any harder&mdash;John Howard has not done in this particular case what we used to do in the past. I just cannot for the life of me understand why he hasn't, why he didn't, and why he won't just say the magic words that would put an end to this debilitating discussion in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Alan Ramsey this morning in a very clear and accurate article canvasses why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is wrong. He goes on to say that the defence he has is a miserable one. I do not want to read it into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> but I think Ramsey, in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, has tackled this issue very clearly and succinctly. He asks why the Prime Minister quite deliberately and quite stubbornly has refused, for the better part of two months, to repudiate the bigotry of a speech as offensive as Hanson's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go to the issue of freedom of speech. Sally Morgan wrote an article that I read about three weeks ago in one of the weekend magazine supplements. She said that by not responding to Hanson, the Prime Minister has not just given her permission to speak; he has also given her authority and status from which to speak. That is the particular point that really needs to be understood by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an end to political correctness that we are talking about here; we have debated immigration across the country in the past. An organisation like the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research had the job of stimulating debate but, unfortunately, that body copped the axe in the recent budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to finish on the call for a fair go. We have always stood for a fair go for ideas, culture, diversity, each other, blacks and migrants. My son just a few weeks ago said to me, `You know, we didn't have this problem six months ago. We've created a problem we don't really need at the moment.' <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> He is one of those who is experiencing&mdash;not as a victim&mdash;what many of his school friends are experiencing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My call is to the business community. The religious community is starting to come out. The opposition, of course, is taking a role, and it is good to see members of the government also taking a role. But the one community that benefited consistently from migration&mdash;and always used to come to me in my consultations on the migration program&mdash;was the business community, always wanting more. It would be really good if they got into the debate now and stressed to the Australian public, from their position of status in our society, the positives that we have achieved and the positives that we continue to achieve, if we work together constructively to overcome the Hansons, the voices of prejudice, ignorance, hatred and fear and build on that enormous diversity we have here, for our social and economic future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee, I was going to ring you a couple of weeks ago when I heard you on ABC radio. I accept that you also have close contacts with migrant groups in our community in the diversity of our society. It is important that we hear more and more the voices of those people in this debate.

Is it a fact that your government now is proposing no restrictions on the numbers of full fee paying students other than the ministerial guidelines, which are not disallowable instruments and therefore escape parliamentary scrutiny?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is a relatively simple matter, Senator Carr. In the profiles process engaged in with the universities, if universities attempt to do the wrong thing, they will be paying penalties. It is as simple as that. We have an absolute determination to ensure two things. Given you have the goodwill and the good sense to allow Australian students to buy a place at an Australian university, just as international students can, the government funded students will be properly protected. There are two mechanisms that we intend to ensure are there to ensure that the government funded students are protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is that universities cannot enrol or sell a full fee place to an Australian student unless they have filled their quota of government funded places. That will ensure that universities do not do what they otherwise might choose to do, and that is take a lot of full fee paying students in the expensive courses&mdash;because the money from full fee paying students, of course, goes straight to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4762"> university; it does not come to the government&mdash;and squash government funded students out of those courses. The mechanism of saying `You have to fill your government funded places first' is one to ensure that universities do not do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a second requirement on universities, and that is that, even when they decide they do want to sell places and agree that it is perfectly acceptable&mdash;it does not matter whether they agree or not actually&mdash;they have to fund their government funded places first and we will only allow them to make up an Australian student body with 25 per cent full fee paying places. That will ensure that, in any one course, the government funded students form 75 per cent of the load. That will ensure that the fearmongering raised by some people on your side and others comes to nix, because in each course there will be 75 per cent government funded students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people have said that this is nothing but a substitution exercise. Forgive me, Senator Carr, I have not yet had the opportunity to go back and check everything you have said. I do not attribute any bad faith but I suspect that you might be one of them.

I will simply tell you that some people have said that this is nothing but a substitution exercise&mdash;that I can talk to you in terms of the fact that you have got to fill your government funded load before you can sell full fee places, that I can talk to you in terms of the full fee places only being 25 per cent of the total Australian population and that that somehow would be misleading because what the government really wants to do is to cut the number of undergraduate places.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any event, do not assume for one minute that anticipation of a new differentiated HECS and do not anticipate that implementation of the recommendations of Neville Wran, the former Labor premier of New South Wales, is necessarily what is going to have any particular impact. For example, you might imagine that some things that might have an impact on enrolments would be comments by people like Lori Faraone, the president of the National Union of Students, who made a remark to the effect that you need $30,000 to study at university. That sort of thing might put people off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people were to believe some of the stories they have read in the paper, some of which have been supported by people on the other side and down that end, that this government was cutting $1.8 billion out of higher education, that might worry people too.

If students could read that funding per student was remaining effectively the same, then they would not be worried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, if there is any drop in enrolments&mdash;and we already know that in Queensland, for example, there is not but we do not know the figures&mdash;do not look simply to the implementation of more equity in the HECS system or to a situation where we are not going to charge a teacher the same as we are going to charge a doctor on a per annum basis as being the reason for that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am very pleased to do that. Late last week, at the third Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Ministerial Forum, Australia and Indonesia did in fact take a significant step towards their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The signing of the statement of intent with Indonesia demonstrates Australia is following through with the commitments it made in Geneva in July 1996 at the conference on climate change. It is the first bilateral agreement signed by Australia and, coincidentally, it is the first such agreement also signed by Indonesia. It is also important that it was signed in the presence of private sector representatives, which reflects the key role the private sector will play in implementing AIJ projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indonesia has signalled the project based cooperative activities to limit greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia will focus on improving forest management, efficient energy use and production and agricultural land management and livestock related emissions. Australian companies have already indicated substantial interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through such means with Indonesia.

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prepared to provide, obviously, all relevant materials because I believe in transparency in government, and the public have a right to know. I am reasonably confident, because I did take a great deal of care in relation to this matter, Senator Kernot. To be absolutely true in this confessional, I will say that I was a little sceptical when I first saw the recommendations, and I <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4769"> went back to the scientists at GBRMPA and CRC and requested further information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended Townsville and debated the issue with them personally. In the end they convinced me that this scientific work, this research, is soundly based scientifically and is necessary to ensure that the fishing that is allowable on the Great Barrier Reef is not threatening the sustainability of any of the fish species. This is, of course, an experiment proposed by the Cooperative Research Centre on research designed to gather the information necessary to manage commercial and recreational fishing in the marine park in an ecologically sustainable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, as you know, line fishing is a permitted use within the park, but estimates of the level of pressure being placed on the reef are difficult to establish. I am told that it is even less certain what the long-term effects of this fishing will be on the ecology of the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many respects, existing fisheries management, I am informed, is more guesswork than science. That is why this research program has been put together. It has been put together to the background of a history of fisheries that are prone to collapsing from overfishing, without forewarning. This is the concern: that, although the evidence available from reefs that are currently fished suggests that the resource is sustainable, history demonstrates that that resource can drop away alarmingly quickly, and that is why there needs to be a comparison between reefs that have been fished for some time and reefs that have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, as you know, Madam President, some 500 conservation reefs on the reef. What will happen is that eight of those 500 reefs will be open for a period of one year. But to more than balance that, eight current reefs that are open will be closed for a period of five years. So the fishing industry is actually complaining to me that the net result of this will be a loss of resource to the industry. Nevertheless, that loss is something that will have to be borne by the industry because it is necessary to ensure that the fishing that does take place on the reef is taking place in a sustainable way and, as I have said, that we are not threatening the fishing resource of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reef by practices that are existing at the moment and that have existed in the past. So that is the background to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The researchers say that the way in which they have put this program together is the only way in which they can adequately assure us that the fishing levels are sustainable. After some considerable time in debate with them, they have satisfied me that that is the case and that this scientific research should go ahead. I think I certainly tried to meet all the legal prerequisites. But I am more than happy to open my books to you, Senator, and you can make that assessment for yourself.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Chee for the question. Yes, I am aware of the recent tragedies in Queensland. The latest death occurred in the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre and involved 30-year-old Edmund Auda. Mr Auda was found hanging from the bars of his cell on Monday morning. I understand that he had been transferred to Queensland from the Northern Territory in 1991. He had been released to work on 17 January 1996 but returned to custody on 3 April after being charged with various counts, including indecent assault and rape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Auda was housed in a single cell in the Murri unit at the Sir David Longland Correctional Centre and was due to face court yesterday. I am sure that all senators share my concern that there has been a continuing high rate of deaths in custody since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody released its findings. Compounding the problem, of course, is that incarceration rates for indigenous people continue to be at an unacceptably high level. This is particularly so with young indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only conclusion that can be reached is that the process of implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has not effectively addressed these issues. This government came into office with the commitment to hold a Commonwealth-state summit on Aboriginal deaths in custody and the causes for the continuing high incarceration rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the staff of my office, ATSIC, the Attorney-General's office and department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Office of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, we formed a steering committee that meets regularly to plan the summit. A consultation process involving indigenous communities and organisations will be coordinated by the Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee in the lead-up to the summit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An indigenous preparatory meeting will be held on 17 and 18 February next year prior to the summit, which is scheduled for 1 and 2 May 1997. The ministerial summit is open to Commonwealth and state territory ministers with responsibilities for indigenous affairs, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> law and justice, policing and corrective services and juvenile justice. The intended outcome of the summit is that there will be a renewed commitment by all Australian governments to reduce both indigenous deaths in custody and incarceration rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The areas identified for discussion in consultation with Aboriginal justice advisory committees are juvenile justice, diversionary strategies and policing in prisons. Obviously, Senator O'Chee and the Senate will acknowledge that&mdash;unless there is involvement of the Aboriginal people in the process, and their advice should be taken&mdash;no changes will occur in this regard until we get an effective strategy that has the support of the indigenous community itself, particularly in keeping young indigenous offenders out of custody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been considerable discussion in that regard as to the manner in which this can occur. There have been pilot programs whereby young offenders are taken not into custody but to facilities where they are trained in work activities. This allows them to be trained in horse breaking and in activities that will give them the encouragement to enter the work force. So useful occupations will ensue out of this and also give them the opportunity of access to their family members, which was one of the major factors involved in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The summit is in line with recommendations 62 and 188 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I would hope that&mdash;as a result of this process and the summit that does occur with the involvement of indigenous people&mdash;an effective outcome can be achieved where at long last, after the expenditure of that vast sum, something can be achieved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following these claims, my office and the department looked at the study, and I was informed that both of these allegations were without foundation. No, the World Bank report did not make a general recommendation applicable to all countries. It made a qualified recommendation for Latin-American countries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally, I think it is incorrect to assert on the basis of this report that only in Korea would students enrolled in public universities be contributing proportionally more than Australian students. I understand, Senator, that you may be referring to the World Bank study table comparing tuition fees as a proportion of recurrent expenditures. If that is the case, it is very important to examine the table in that report very carefully. What that table does is compare fees as a proportion of total recurrent expenditure, not as a proportion of total tuition cost; that is, recurrent expenditure includes many activities other than tuition&mdash;in particular, research. That ratio should not be confused with the proportion of tuition costs recovered by the HECS scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have estimated that on average with the benefits, taking into account the benefits of the implicit interest subsidy under the deferral option used by some&mdash;that is, the deferral of their payment&mdash;and the up-front discount used <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by others, students will contribute, on average, about 27 per cent of the cost of their tuition. Obviously, Senator, you can look at one course or another course and you will find percentages lower than that and higher than that. That is, quite obviously, what an average is: it is an average of things that are higher than that point and lower than that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, I am particularly grateful to you for drawing my attention to the World Bank report, because it has a range of other comments that are of relevance to the current higher education debate in Australia, which you have not yet referred to. That may be because you have not yet had a chance to go through the whole report. Maybe you, like I, did not have a copy of it when you asked your question. Nonetheless, for example, it argues that some positive examples demonstrate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible to achieve a well&hyphen;functioning, diversified, growing higher education system, even as public spending per student declines.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, in Australia, of course, public spending per student will effectively be maintained.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President. I would like to move, therefore, on to the detail of the fit&hyphen;out&mdash;or refitting again&mdash;of my office. Following the federal election and my appointment to cabinet, there was a need for more office space to accommodate extra ministerial staff in my Launceston electorate office, which I have used since my election to the Senate in 1986. Discussions started in March with a DAS officer based in Hobart. Rather than fit&hyphen;out and relocate to a new office at considerable expense and effort, it was decided to occupy the lower floor of the same building. Some security work was also carried out by Asset Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mid&hyphen;May I finally received a formal fit&hyphen;out plan from Works Australia. Some discussions were held with a DAS interior designer who then went on three weeks holiday overseas and was never heard from again. There was no handover to anybody else in the DAS office, and there was no knowledge. Heating was disconnected and heater covers were removed on 4 June. The entire office area was left without heating in a Launceston winter. No replacement was provided, and my staff had to bring their own small fan heaters from home. The electrical wiring for the heaters&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, my workers were cold for two weeks in the middle of a Launceston winter. The electrical wiring for the heaters was left exposed, which of course is dangerous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 11 June the contracted carpet layers arrived from Hobart. Why Hobart tradesmen were engaged for Launceston, I do not know. They wanted to do the job in one day so that they could return to Hobart the same night. Works Australia had in fact scheduled the job <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4776"> over a couple of days, to commence the next day. There were no removalists organised to move furniture and office equipment so carpet layers were delayed and unhappy and had to wait for the removalists. So the removalists and my own three office staff spent the rest of the day moving furniture and equipment to allow carpet laying, and the job continued until at least midnight. It is worth noting that my staff assisted the removalists against the instructions of Works Australia operating out of Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electricians arrived on 17 June to do the rewiring for the lighting, communications, phones and computers. This required pulling up the newly laid carpet as they required access under floorboards in order to put wiring through walls and ceilings for the lower floor. Again the removalists had to be called in to assist with the moving of furniture and equipment with the help of staff. It was then necessary for the office to be closed for two days. Wiring work was continued on 20 June, and the carpet, now looking the worse for wear, was being relaid. Some office furniture was put back in place and the rest had to be despatched to storage for the duration of the refit. Some of the carpet had to be lifted for a third time for some extra wiring work due to the poor planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the painting, wiring and final carpet laying was finished, the office furniture was moved back from storage. There were still a number of outstanding deficiencies. The fittings for the lighting in the downstairs offices were excessively large compared to what had been ordered.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, with regard to the point that Senator Newman made about the lighting, Senator Newman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of lighting that was put into that office was not what I asked for. There was an excessive amount of lighting and I find that a gross waste of taxpayers' money as well.</PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that maybe Senator Newman talk to Minister Jull and ask him about a letter I understand he may have received to ascertain that that amount of lighting was fitted into the office because there are Australian standards that must be complied with. You, Senator Newman, through you, Mr Deputy President, requested specific lighting because of the nature of the building. When they started the work they discovered that there was a false ceiling in the building, which is part of an old building, and they had to change the nature of the lighting, which gives the appearance that there is an excessive amount of lighting. But that has to be the case to comply with the Australian occupational health and safety standards. That is about workers.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, Senator Newman has clearly misled this parliament. She has made a claim that is totally false. The minister ought to be called upon to apologise to the Senate for doing it. More importantly, she should be called upon to apologise to the workers she has reflected upon. This really raises the question with regard to the Department of Administrative Services and the minister responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just have to wonder whether or not the Minister for Administrative Services will ever stand up for the workers that he represents and the department that he represents. Quite clearly, he is not prepared to do so. He is prepared to allow a minister in this Senate to get up and condemn them without any defence from him. If there ever was a person who should take a good look at themselves and this claim about representing workers, it is Minister Jull.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The accusation about the Mowbray office for a start is absolutely wrong. Let us get back to what this is all about. On Monday in question time, Senator Denman, a Tasmanian, obviously set out to get a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> &mdash;in the local paper&mdash;and they gave it to her. The question was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you think it is appropriate for the Minister for Social Security, in these times of financial stringency, to have spent $53,761 on fitting out your ministerial office and $15,345 on furniture.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the interjections from Senator Collins was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You could buy a house in Launceston for the same price.</PARA>
<PARA>And it went on. I looked through the answers that Senator Newman gave and time and time again she spoke about professional supervision, about the Department of Administrative Services and the way that they did not supervise this correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the costs that were involved you see that, of the $53,000 spent on the fit-out, $31,000 was for electrical work. Senator Newman has been in that office for over 10 years&mdash;I have visited it on many occasions&mdash;and it is an old house. It is certainly not grand. Half the time you have to sit outside on the veranda at the back to get a bit of extra room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman was trying to save the taxpayer money by fitting out a couple of old rooms underneath for her staff. Most of the money was taken up in electrical work. I guess, if you had had a professional quote done on that place in the first instance, they probably would have advised the minister against doing anything. They probably would have advised her to move somewhere else. Senator Newman, being a true Tasmanian, spent $17,000 on new furniture for extra staff. I looked through the $17,000 and saw where the furniture came from. It came from Tasmanian Executive Furniture. It is all Tasmanian furniture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at some of these other figures. Senator Sherry, when he had his fit-out, spent $27,000 on furniture. You could buy a house in Launceston for that, Senator Collins. That is $10,000 more than Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4782"> Newman spent. Let us have a look at former minister Duncan Kerr, who only had to move into the Commonwealth offices in Hobart. The offices were already there; all they needed was a fit-out. There was $80,000 spent just on fit-out. We are talking about ministers. How much do you reckon he spent on furniture? He spent $33,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we have to recall that one of the issues raised in this matter was: who is going to stand up and defend the employees of the department who have been attacked by Senator Newman in her answer? That is the answer we originally were taking note of. They were in fact attacked and convicted publicly, under privilege. There is no-one, apparently, able to put their case and it is left to the Labor Party to put the case again on behalf of the employees, who are under the direction of the minister. That is a very important point that has to be taken note of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4783"> In relation to the question of the allegations unproven, they seem to change from one day to the next: are there stuff-ups by the people who are doing the work or are there problems because of the management of the job? The allegation seems to have changed from one day to the next, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will reveal that. We are again left in the position of dealing with a non-answer by the minister, who seems to have taken as a joke the ques tion of looking after and representing the interests of the employees of the department, whose only proper voice here would be the minister. But, again, it is going to be left to the Labor Party to represent those interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to some of the comments that have arisen in this debate and earlier in the statements that have been made, I do not want to talk about the costs of the refurbishment of additional office space and the furnishings because other people will be more competent to deal with those matters. But I do say that it has been made very clear in the statement by Senator Murphy that there is no addition to the cost caused by alleged stuff&hyphen;ups.</PARA>

We make no apology for saying that we will not put up with that sort of administration. We are going to clean up the act, and the people of Australia are going to thank us for it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator O'Brien very clearly put it on the record with regard to the minister responsible for the work force. The minister approves the budgets for office fit-outs. Senator Newman made a claim that the cost associated with the fit&hyphen;out of the extension of her office was associated with so-called stuff&hyphen;ups. That is the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You falsely made accusations against workers and against officers of a department. That is the issue at question here&mdash;as to whether or not a senator and a minister can come into this place and blatantly lay down claims, false claims, against people either from a department or from the private sector and get away with it because of the privileged protection she has in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the question that must be answered. If the minister has any integrity at all, if she cannot prove the claims that she has made&mdash;and she cannot&mdash;then the minister should withdraw and should apologise to the people that she has made the claims against. She says no, she will not. She does not say that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> claims are wrong. She says no, she will not withdraw, and no, she will not apologise, even though those claims are false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the question. That is the reason this issue was raised. People have a right to protection. They have a right to have their integrity defended if it has been wrongly claimed that they have done something that they have not done. That is the question. Clearly, the minister has a responsibility and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) also has a responsibility to say to the minister, if the minister has made false claims, which she has, that the minister ought to apologise and withdraw them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This is a form of a motion which had been agreed between the government and the opposition which was to be debated and, no doubt, carried in the House of Representatives. The government is of the view that it should be similarly carried in this place. The terms of the motion are as follows. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) reaffirms: <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4785"> </PARA>

<PARA>I guess in some ways we would say that what we put down in the terms of this motion is really self-evident and, perhaps, should not require reaffirmation in this form. Nevertheless, there does seem to be a debate taking place in the community, and it is important that those of us who have the privilege to lead through this institution do reaffirm these values which are so basic to our society and really help make it the society of which we are so proud. The government has made its position clear time and time again. There is no doubt about that. That should not need to be restated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I am prepared to do that again. In particular, I might pick up the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I refer to a very good speech the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) made to the Malaysia&hyphen;Australia alumni conference in Kuala Lumpur on 19 October. Mr Downer quoted what the Prime Minister said in parliament on 8 October. Mr Downer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's immigration policy is and will remain non&hyphen;discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government completely rejects any notion that the immigration program should have any reference to race. I personally, and the Government as a whole, find any such notion to be repugnant. Australians in general regard such sentiments as repugnant and we reject them in their entirety. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that Australia has a proud record for welcoming migrants from all around the world and we will not let that achievement be threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, Australia's commitment to a non-discriminatory immigration program and to engagement with Asia is bipartisan and enjoys widespread support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, our record on immigration has been and remains vital in developing Australia's international links&mdash;particularly with our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to make it absolutely clear that the Australian Government is resolutely opposed to racist sentiment and will fight against it in all its manifestations. That statement is clear, absolute and unequivocal.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt that it is a statement that is supported on all sides and by all senators in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we are a tolerant society. We have had a remarkably successful migration program. It has brought immigrants to this country from all over the world&mdash;immigrants of all races and so many cultures. We have had a remarkably successful program for receiving refugees. Refugees have come to this country over the decades in waves and, in terms of this debate, we particularly think of how successful the Indochinese refugee program has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The result of all this is, I believe, a very healthy multiracial and multicultural society. Part of the culture of Australia in fact is to accept the culture of our immigrants, and we do not ask them to forgo that. We believe that it enriches our society. It becomes part of the broader Australian culture with which we are all happy to be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, having said that, it is important that we do not take for granted what I have been stating&mdash;that is, we are a tolerant society and a multicultural society. It is necessary, it seems, to continue to express it and reaffirm it from time to time&mdash;in other words, to not take it for granted. Perhaps what is more important than what we say is what we do. It is important that we practise it, that we demonstrate in our activities within our communities that these values are in fact important to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of this debate has now broadened into our place within the region and how the multicultural and multiracial society we have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4786"> developed fits within the region. Again, it is my assessment that it actually fits very comfortably in that Australia's place within the Asia-Pacific region is growing stronger and, in a way, more natural by the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was in Indonesia late last week. I have not been there for some years and I found it fascinating that Australians from every walk of life are now working in Indonesia and are part of their society as well as ours. There are now 10,000 Australians living and working in Indonesia, taking every skill and experience that we have in our country into Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some 300,000 Australians visit Indonesia each year, and the largest percentage growth of tourists to Australia at the moment is coming from Indonesia. It is a demonstration of how we are starting to mesh within the region much more comfortably than we have in the past. Whilst we do not seek to qualify our values or our background, in doing so we recognise that the cultures and backgrounds we are moving into are different and we have to learn to accommodate each other's beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from what some people are attempting to assert in the press and outside this place&mdash;that is, it is a difficult task for Australia&mdash;my observation is that we are being well received within the region. From an Australian perspective, we are very comfortable with it. The strength of those new relationships will grow as the years go by and will further enhance us not only economically&mdash;that is, materially&mdash;but also in other ways as we better understand the languages, cultures, histories and values of our neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, take the opportunity to reiterate the values that are contained within this motion. I might have thought that they should not be necessary to restate, but I accept that they are. I trust the Senate will join with us and support us in this motion so no doubt can be left within the community as a whole that this motion identifies the Australia that is important to us and the Australia we wish to continue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion&mdash;more importantly, the debate on this motion&mdash;is one of the most <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> significant developments that will take place in this parliament. This motion is significant because, if it is carried, it means the national parliament will insist that an absolutely essential ingredient take its place in the current community discussion about racism and multiculturalism. That ingredient is leadership by us at the national level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without that ingredient, the discussion will continue down ugly and destructive paths. Without the national leadership given to discussions on these issues by governments from both sides of the political divide for the last 30 years, we would never have grown into the tolerant, fair, decent and fundamentally democratic society that we are today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since World War II, we have received a massive influx of new citizens bringing with them a wide range of cultures. Over this period, we have progressed from what used to be an inward looking mono&hyphen;cultural society. Each new intake of people brought with it a new culture that enriched and sustained our community. We have now become a society in which all these different cultures are not only accommodated but also celebrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over this same period, our attitudes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have changed. It cannot be said that we have completely and successfully discharged the responsibility given government by the 1967 referendum, but much has been achieved to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people their honoured place in the development of Australia as a decent nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been 30 years since the coalition parties, followed&mdash;we freely admit&mdash;by the Labor Party, wiped their platform clean of the phrase `white Australia'. It has been more than 20 years since the concept of a white Australia was abolished from official government policy. It has been 20 years since the Fraser government enacted the Northern Territory land rights legislation creating a development which led to the Mabo legislation of the Keating government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is more than 20 years since the Whitlam government embraced the concept of multiculturalism. The significance of this was that it finally denied the implication in assimilation and integration that all other cultures, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4787"> whether indigenous or from overseas, were in some way inferior to the Anglo-Celtic European model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mention these changes with pride as an Australian. They have been critical to our becoming a decent society. They are critical for our future. They have been critical also for our relationship with the region around us. This has happened just in time. Having been shut out of our traditional markets, we have to strike out in this region. This has meant our exchanging a tradition&hyphen;bound Anglocentricity for a role as a truly multicultural community interacting with our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along the way, we have developed into a decent, hospitable society with a honoured place in the global community through such policies as support for the elimination of institutional racism in South Africa. We in the Labor Party are quick to recognise the role that was played in this by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. These changes have been critical to the solidity and strength of our relationship with the rest of our region. We have grown into the sort of society with which our neighbours are happy to be associated, with which they are happy to trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we have to be realistic. One of the reasons why we are a decent society is that we are a pluralistic society. Not everybody agrees with the path we have taken&mdash;and those who disagree have the right to air their views about it. But when those views are as false and as destructive as some which have been put about lately, they have to be answered. However great the disagreement, we have to preserve our climate of tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people are abused in public places, it is time for government, for people in authority, to step in and act&mdash;and this is what we need now. It is a disgrace that, because of the way in which the issues of race and multiculturalism have been argued lately, Australian citizens could be physically abused in the street because of their perceived origins. We are especially saddened when we see reports of headlines about this in newspapers in countries all around us, especially newspapers which reflect official or at least authoritative opinion. We have not seen a picture of an Australia like this since the bad <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> old days of white Australia and our discriminatory immigration procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just quote a few of these reports. On October 7, when the member for Oxley put the debate on a new plane, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS> talked of `Australia's new found freedom of speech and bigotry'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South China Morning Post</EMPHASIS> talked of our response `as a stamp of approval for those individuals who hold extremist views to take the stage in Australia'. An official of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce thought that the debate would make many local people think twice before travelling to Australia. `It would not take much in Hong Kong,' he said, `to revive memories of the dark days of the White Australia Policy.' A prominent scholar of the School of Commerce at Kayo University in Japan also thought that the debate, as it was developing, `evoked memories of the White Australia Policy'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we have seen this week, this view continues among commentators in countries in our region. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bangkok Post</EMPHASIS>, for example, has commented on our prolonged silence on the issues being debated. Not only is this deeply shaming to us as Australians; it is deeply threatening to us as part of the regional economy. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nation</EMPHASIS> newspaper of Thailand has warned of potential economic retaliation against Australia. The Australian Tourism Commission has complained that derogatory comments about Asian immigration made during the debate have had a negative impact on tourism into Australia. John Hutchison, managing director of the commission, confirmed this last week in hearings before an estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only a few days ago the Premier of Queensland warned that, as a consequence of the race debate running off the rails, a $12 million investment by Chinese interests in a resort near Brisbane is now in doubt. In Mr Borbidge's own words, the stated reason to a senior member of the government is the `perceived anti-Asian mood in Australia today' and `they are off to New Zealand'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, just in the last 24 hours, we have had reports that defence personnel from Singapore, guests of Australia, have been attacked and abused in Queensland. It is small <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4788"> wonder that former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has had to point out to the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that the discussion has now got to a point where, in his words, it is `extraordinarily dangerous for the future of Australia'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes that we have seen over the past 20 to 30 years have made Australia a good and decent place to live. They were successful because they have received consistent bipartisan support. They have been sustained because they were supported by the national leadership of the day. In the Labor Party, we are proud of the indigenous and the multicultural policies and activities that have been set in train by Labor leaders such as Gough Whitlam, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also put on the public record our appreciation of the pioneering roles in all these issues provided by Harold Holt, Malcolm Fraser and state leaders such as Jeff Kennett and Nick Greiner. It was the extent of this bipartisan support and leadership at the national level which helped the community deal sensibly and maturely with the debate that was stimulated when migration issues were raised during the 1980s. By this, I mean the questions raised by Geoffrey Blainey, Lauchlan Chipman, Stephen Rimmer and others&mdash;they are good examples&mdash;and by the then Leader of the Opposition's One Australia speech at Esperance in 1988 and by the FitzGerald report in the same year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of whether or not the discussion will be as sensible and productive now depends on the line that we take here in the national parliament. This is the central point made by any number of involved observers of the way the race debate has developed&mdash;the clerics, the academics, the community organisations. More than any other players in the process, governments have the obligation to make sure that discussion on issues such as race proceed in a proper framework, are not fuelled by falsehood and are not allowed to lead to antisocial consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Keeping the current discussion on race on a sensible and accurate basis, as I have said, is an issue of economic security for us. But the implications of the race issue are much <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more important than that. Governments have the obligation to point out that it is not true that society has been diminished or threatened by the reconciliation and non-discrimination policies of administrations of all colours over the past 20 years. It is not true that they have subverted our traditional dream of the egalitarian democracy. In fact, they have strengthened this society. Our traditional notions of democracy have survived all the changes that have taken place over the past 20 years. They still accurately describe our dominant values. They transcend ethnicity and race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians are one people and we are many. But we all share faith in Australia and concern for its future and its security. With very few exceptions, we understand this in the national parliament. We have a duty to reassure the community at large about it and not take advantage of it for whatever reason. We cannot let go without challenge the myths and the neuroses that have been let loose in the current discussion about race. We cannot tolerate this as we approach the centenary of our federation. Future generations would never forgive us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am confident that this parliamentary debate and the carriage of this motion, late as these actions are, will help us in this parliament to discharge our obligations. On behalf of the opposition, I commend this motion to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support this motion. I want to spend some time talking about why this motion is necessary. It is absolutely necessary because of the deep hurt and offence that has been given to many decent Australians who are simply going about their business of living and making their own contribution to this nation&mdash;indigenous Australians, Australians who were born overseas, their children who were born here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is necessary because of the way that this debate has been absolutely spiralling out of control, because of the damage being done to Australia's reputation as a tolerant multicultural nation, because of the consequent effects on trade, investment, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4789"> tourism and our capacity to attract overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is necessary because of the delay that we have seen in this country showing the required leadership on this issue. Mr Malcolm McGregor in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> describes it as a `shameful silence'. It is a silence that has resulted in newspaper pages day after day being filled with letters of barely repressed bigotry and hatred, and television news giving&mdash;again, evening after evening&mdash;great prominence to bigoted, ignorant and offensive views. The problem is that those views go unchallenged. Equal time has not been given to the other side of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shameful silence that has resulted in letters, in this case from Chinese students, from Deakin University, La Trobe University, Melbourne University, Monash University, RMIT, et cetera, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are Chinese international students . . . studying in Australian universities . . . Unfortunately, we have been targeted by racial hatred and are suffering of racial hostility directed against us. The cases of . . . insults/attacks on our members, our families, and even on our children are increasing daily; some of us have been attacked by the racists at the railway stations, in the streets, on the roads, at the shopping centres, even at the schools and university campuses for no reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>This is Australia in 1996. It is a shameful silence that has resulted in the Vietnamese Australia Welfare Association of New South Wales, in its newsletter for this month, recording:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the . . . Vietnamese Community in Australia have recently received bomb threats and this has made people question to what length freedom of speech should be allowed to go.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>It is a shameful silence which invites others to perpetrate fraud. A respected former member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Mr Ted Egan, found, one Saturday morning, that somebody had written a letter in his name, expressing views quite the opposite of what he holds about future prospects for reconciliation and healing. Mr Egan had to have a letter published disassociating himself from that letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a shameful silence which sees my 13&half;&hyphen;year&hyphen;old daughter, with her close Asian friends of the last seven years, simply walking <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down the streets in Brisbane and being told, `Go back where you came from!'&mdash;something she has never experienced in her 13&half; years of life. It is something which causes her distress and anguish and obviously to question why this is happening. It is, as others have referred to it, a silence that has seen visiting Asian troops subjected to insults and violence; a silence which has seen attacks on indigenous Australians, which has resulted in distortions of their place in history&mdash;in fact, almost a denial of their place in history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast to the silence, we have seen in this place the continued imputations directed towards indigenous Australians&mdash;of a lack of accountability, of fraud, of corruption, of incompetence&mdash;day after day after day. It has been very hard to have the other side of that story told as well. This motion is absolutely necessary because previous qualified silences have resulted in an incitement to vilification, a lack of respect&mdash;a hatred almost&mdash;all dressed up under the guise of free speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 50 days, since that disgraceful speech, some Australians have spoken out. I know Democrats have spoken out. I am reminded that, in 1977, the Democrats were founded on the slogan of tolerance, honesty and compassion. Some people thought that was very idealistic and old-fashioned, but I think they are qualities that are very important in Australia in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important for leaders not to wait to sniff the wind of public opinion before they speak, because some truths are fundamental. One of those that I truly believe is that evil flourishes where good men and women sit and do nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me address what the motion says. There is not much in it to quibble about. I find it very interesting that it avoids the use of the word `multiculturalism' and uses the words `cultural diversity'. That change is interesting to me. Of course I support reaffirmation of our support for the reconciliation process. Of course I support the sentiments associated with cultural diversity in this motion. But what is interesting to me are the omissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I compared the words with the words of the original motion, which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) tabled some time <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4790"> ago, and that original motion certainly uses the word `multiculturalism', and it certainly talks about providing leadership. There is no mention of history in this motion. I find that incredibly disappointing and cowardly, because how are we going to stand up as a mature nation&mdash;Senator Hill talked about going towards the next century&mdash;without simply acknowledging our past, without acknowledging the fact that there have been failures of policy in the past?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can do that without saying we have to acknowledge guilt. We can talk about the shame some may feel, but we have to acknowledge in order to heal and move on. So this motion is incredibly deficient in that respect. I listened to the speech in the other place by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in support of this motion and I note that he still asserts that we are too apologetic about our history and far too self-conscious about our achievements. How ironic that many countries in the world consider our success in multiculturalism to be one of our achievements&mdash;but we are not allowed to talk about our past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think leadership is incredibly important. Leadership sets the tone of this country. It defines what we are and  what we aspire to be. Leadership leads to understanding, and I think there has been a failure of leadership in one important area, which has led to the capacity to exploit people's fears about difference. I think that failure of leadership has been on the pace of change in this country as a result of the economic rationalist policies of the last decade or so, a simple failure to say, `Of course we are living in an era of global capitalism; of course there are adjustments this country has to make; yes, there will be some pain on transition; yes, we are planning to ease the pain of transition.' We have had none of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I accept that people feel insecure about the future. But that does not mean that they are excused for taking refuge in ignorance and racism. It is absolutely time for leadership on this issue. It is time to restore respect for the dignity of our fellow Australians. It is time to restore mutual respect, because that is what tolerance is based on. Mutual respect is the fundamental prerequisite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of reconciliation, and it is that respect that has been missing in this debate for the last 50 days or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one in this country should be afraid of a rigorous debate about immigration levels and population policy. No-one should be afraid about rigorous debate on what constitutes appropriate policy directions in indigenous affairs, but it has to be a debate without hate. I have been ashamed of the debate in this country over the past 50 days. I do not want to live in a country that is perceived as racist by Australians who live here and by our important neighbours overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard may say he abhors racism and he may hope that this motion proves that, but it is my view and the Democrats' view that it will take more than a resolution of a couple of hundred parliamentarians to redress the deep hurt and offence that has been caused to so many Australians. It will take more than this motion to redress the damage that has been created by 50 days of qualified shameful silence. Make no mistake about it&mdash;the damage that has been done is long term and it is deep. The healing that we were hoping would happen as we move into the next century has irreparably been set back.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, I wish to associate myself with this motion in the strongest possible terms. It is a sad day when the Australian parliament finds itself in the position of having to reaffirm fundamental beliefs about the society which we are all working towards no matter what our political perspectives are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last weekend, the Queensland National Party approved an ethnic affairs policy which has as its opening statement:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4791">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strength of Australia is a result of its people from different backgrounds working as one Australian society with diverse cultures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Party recognises the contribution migrants have made and that it will continue to form the basis for the development of our Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>The policy continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Party will continue to work for greater tolerance, understanding and equality towards all Australians and their culture.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Party policy is inconsistent with the comments made by the independent member for Oxley, Ms Pauline Hanson. I do not believe I can beat around the bush with this. It has to be said and it has to be said straight out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have often gone on the record in this place to warn about the dangers of snake oil salespeople selling simplistic solutions to complex problems. Australia seems to throw up these glitches from time to time. First there was Eric Butler and then there was Jeremy Lee, Peter Sawyer and Graeme Campbell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appeal of political charlatans is not to be ignored. It is real. It will always be there in a dark corner of Australian psyche, but we are not the elders of the village of Hameln that let the Pied Piper come in and take away our children. The motion before us means that we can strengthen our opposition to intolerance, that we are on guard about the threats to it and that we regard non&hyphen;discrimination as an essential part of our society to be defended at all costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like others before her, Ms Hanson is an exploiter of fears and prejudices. She exploits unhappiness, frustration and cynicism. She capitalises all those who feel the trauma of rapid economic and social change. I have heard her been spoken of well by professionals and by academics. We are not just talking about those people actually referred to as rednecks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hanson phenomena has been compared to many things, but to me it is a disturbing echo of the Lindy Chamberlain saga, where otherwise rational people, community leaders and so on fell in with this lynch mob mentality. This sort of hysteria takes on a life of its <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> own and can turn the world upside down. Why should Lindy Chamberlain be deemed guilty while Pauline Hanson is treated like the virgin Joan of Arc?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the gun debate before it, the Hanson factor has the potential to accumulate a political head of steam. A recent Morgan poll published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> this week showed that a Hanson-led party would win 18 per cent of the Senate vote if there were an election now. I would like to speculate on what that hypothetical situation would mean to the Senate. We all know that opinion polls are volatile and have limited application. I do not think for a moment that that would happen, but let us just assume that we have just had an election and the Hanson party has won 18 per cent of the vote and now has the balance of power in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What signals would this send not only to Australians but to the rest of the world? How would the Senate operate as a result? The government would introduce legislation. What would be the price for winning Hanson party support to allow the legislation to pass? What deals would be offered? Would the Hanson party demand substantial and discriminatory cuts in immigration and foreign aid? Would compulsory national service be the price for letting government legislation through? Would Australian children once more be threatened with removal from their mothers if they did not win the Hanson tidy town competition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government would not bargain or negotiate, what then? Political instability and further elections? Imagine the strains the Hanson party would put on the operation of the Senate. Would we have MPIs on Australia being swamped by Asians or references to committees about international financiers conspiring to run the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4792"> In order to mobilise the Hanson supporters, whose networks and organisations support will be used? Who will be called on to develop her anecdotes into policy documents? Already we have seen Ms Hanson collecting well&hyphen;wishers like Bruce Whiteside and the One Australia Movement born out of the scattered CAP ranks. Did the 500 people who allegedly signed up to this fan club know that they were each paying $5 to a group associat ed with extreme right&hyphen;wingers, some of whom even deny the Jewish holocaust?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who will run the Hanson movement? Who will offer the networks, administration and advice? The same group who thought Graeme Campbell was their great white hope&mdash;only now they have an even whiter champion. Racial intolerance is incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to be, as the motion before us says today. We cannot have any reverence for our own lives without reverence for others. The respect is missing from Ms Hanson's demeanour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Three years ago in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> a letter to the editor from a Chinese immigrant was published. It had the headline `You gave me so much&mdash;I'll repay the debt'. After working to support himself, this man became ill and had a lifesaving operation. These are his words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The medical report show that I was given 8 litre blood while I had 14 hours' brain operation. So now Australian people's blood are flowing through my whole body. It is Australia saving my life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this country give me something, I must give something back. . . I do thank you, Australia, who give me the opportunity of regeneration. God bless Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely this is the attitude we want to encourage, both here and abroad. The increasing international reports and today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>  headline about Asian soldiers being abused in this country are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Australians we have a choice at this point. Are we the country of regeneration or degeneration? It may well end up as a choice between having Senator O'Chee in this chamber or a Pauline Hanson clone or worse, depending on who she aligns herself with. Anyone who heard Senator O'Chee's speech earlier today would realise the great contrast between an Australian who brings a legacy of tolerance, freedom and respect for all Australians and the narrow, bigoted and wilful ignorance of the likes of Ms Hanson. If Australians make the Morgan poll a reality at the next election, then they say to people like Bill O'Chee, `Your childhood fears of being vilified in the school playground were only a vision of what is to come.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Greens join earlier speakers in totally deploring the turn of events in this country since Pauline Hanson made her inaugural speech in the House of Representatives. It was a sheer coincidence that, at the very same time she was making that speech, I was making a speech in this house reflecting Greens policy for an egalitarian country where everybody, without fear or favour, felt proud to be able to demonstrate their own feelings, their own culture, their own creed and their own zest for life. It was a call to this country, this lucky nation of ours, to take a lead in a world where we are no longer apart, but part of a global village of six billion people. If we cannot do it in this country with the inherent advantages we have, then we cannot expect people elsewhere to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I like to think that it was a good thing that that speech I gave got no coverage in the Australian press, but the next day headlines everywhere covered the racist epithets in particular from Pauline Hanson. What I was saying reflected more clearly and closely the real feeling of Australians, and what she was articulating was the absurd, abhorrent and anti&hyphen;Australian viewpoint. However, things have proceeded in a downward spiral on the slippery slope towards a more divided Australia and, as a consequence of this debate on racism in this country, an Australia with its reputation impugned. There is little evidence to say that we are off that slippery slope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, there is still a simple factor in this&mdash;the touch point to this unseemly debate that has taken up Australia&mdash;and that is Pauline Hanson herself: Pauline Hanson, the member of the House of Representatives, who knowingly took her first opportunity to exhibit this unseemly discourse on racism and bigotry which is now a matter for universal comment, not only in this country but increasingly elsewhere around the world, to our detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I support this motion wholeheartedly, I still believe it pulls the punch. It still fails to take the confrontation for those of us who feel appalled by Pauline Hanson's philosophy to that member of the House of Representatives. Moreover, it fails to come to grips with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4793"> the reality that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself has failed to take her head&hyphen;on. He has gone out of his way to avoid naming her as the spark in this conflagration against our nation's interests. I do not believe it will be until he, as the leader of this nation, as head of government, joins all of us in condemning her that we will start to put things back to rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the Prime Minister has made a mistake in believing that, by ignoring her, in some way or other she will go away. In fact, what has happened, sadly, is that her notoriety is inversely proportional to his recognition of her central role in what is happening. It is essential that he take her on as an individual who must take major responsibility for this awful debate that is taking place in this wonderful nation of ours. Therefore, I move an amendment to this motion in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After paragraph (b), add:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Deplores the racist statements of the Member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and calls on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to name her and condemn her bigotry.</PARA>
<PARA>I do so because I believe, otherwise, we too are pulling the punch and we are not going to the core of the problem. Until we do, we are not going to be able to face the problem, dampen it down and apply the medicine that is required. The newspaper comments which increasingly say that the Prime Minister has failed or has made a mistake in his decision not to take on Pauline Hanson are correct. I believe that this motion falls short in that it does not do so either. Pauline Hanson ought to be taken to account in this motion. The Prime Minister's failure to recognise her central role in this, and his repeated refusals to do so, even under fairly intense inducement from journalists in this country, has been a mistaken policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe it is going to give her greater kudos or  add anything to her bailiwick. I think it is going to add a united front to the leadership against this insidious racism which has come into public discourse in Australia. It is important that we have the courage to inveigle the Prime Minister to change tack and let Pauline Hanson know that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we hold her responsible&mdash;along with, of course, those who are speaking out in her support&mdash;for the hurt and the harm to so many individuals in our nation and to the nation as a whole as far as our international reputation is concerned.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Australians, we are all privileged to live in one of the freest, fairest and most tolerant societies on earth. It has not always been that way, but it is now. As I said in the adjournment debate last night, it is not the absolutely indisputable fact about our racist and bigoted past that worries me, and I am worried; it is the prospect, because of the complete lack of leadership that has been demonstrated on this issue, of a racist and bigoted future that concerns me greatly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I got a phone call early this morning from a close, journalist friend of mine, an American. She has been in Australia for more than 20 years. Last night she had a sleepless night about this and rang me in the early hours of this morning to say, `I've lived in this country for 20 years and have never seen anything like the last two months since I've been here. I'm absolutely terrified that, if something sensible and reasonable is not done to keep this in check, then this country is going to degenerate into the same sort of social division that exists in my former home of the United States.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is entitled to have that fear&mdash;I think we all are. Is it reasonable to suggest for a minute that the sort of situation we are, without question, faced with at the moment could all have been caused by a backbencher, a single member of the federal parliament in the House of Representatives? Of course that is nonsense. It couldn't have been. Are the apprehensions of the international press that are now coming forward based on some misconception or misunderstanding, as the Prime Minister would have, about the situation here in Australia? I do not believe they are. In fact, I believe I can demonstrate very quickly that they are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not Pauline Hanson, I regret to say, who has brought this about. It is not Pauline Hanson who is responsible in a real sense for the appalling situation where members of the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4794"> military forces from Singapore have been attacked openly on our streets, one being elbowed in the face, another having eggs thrown at her and being subject to verbal abuse. It is not Pauline Hanson who is responsible for an elected mayor of an Australian city publicly expressing the view, `My three beautiful kids are mongrels.' Pauline Hanson does not have this power. She does not possess it. I regret to say, the reason&mdash;and it finally has to be appreciated&mdash;we are in this very unpleasant situation as a nation at the moment is that the person who speaks on these issues for us all, irrespective of our political allegiances, the Prime Minister, has shown a profound lack of leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a politician, I recognise what he has been doing and he has to be brought to account for it. The Leader of the Government in the Senate said two things which I noted: one I agreed with and one I did not. Senator Hill said that we should not require the reaffirmation of the sentiments that are contained in this motion. He is right; we shouldn't. What we need to examine, as Senator Kernot noted, is the reason why we are doing it. The reason we are doing it is that the Prime Minister's crimes of omission but, more particularly, commission, need to be noted in this respect. The thing Senator Hill said that I did not agree with was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps what is more important than what we say is what we do.</PARA>
<PARA>The one thing that distinguishes the human species from other species on this earth is our ability to communicate in a very sophisticated form of language. We as politicians know full well that what we say has always been as important as what we do, and it is now. That really is what has brought us to this particular point that we are at now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last two months an impression has been deliberately created that the sentiments expressed by Pauline Hanson, as sad, wrong, ill-informed and ignorant as they are, have had the silent support of the Prime Minister of Australia. That is an appalling position for us all to be in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue which has dominated debate in this country like none other this year. It is an issue that strikes at the absolute <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> heart of the Australian ethos as we want to see it and Australia's place in the world. In that forum, who is the person, irrespective of our political affiliations, who speaks for us all collectively? It is the Prime Minister of Australia. The Prime Minister of Australia has dodged and weaved and ducked on this issue every time the name Pauline Hanson has been mentioned. You cannot get better evidence for that&mdash;I commend all honourable senators to have a look at it&mdash;than the transcript of the interview that he did with John Laws on 24 October. Read it; it is instructive.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when that speech causes concern in the country . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A full paragraph of gobbledegook follows from the Prime Minister, not wanting to directly answer the question. If we keep going over to page 3 of the transcript, John Laws interrupts the flow and says:</PARA>

<PARA>When he did not succeed, the Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>John Laws persists on page 4 of the transcript, still trying to pin down the Prime Minister. He says to him:</PARA>

<PARA>The Prime Minister said:</PARA>

<PARA>He could not pin the Prime Minister down with a forthright statement about what he believed. But I talked about the Prime Minister's sins of commission, not omission, that have led to the situation that we are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Have a look at the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, with the headline `Howard blasts Asian critics'. That will be worth another five per cent to him at the moment in terms of the people who support Pauline Hanson. `That is telling them where to get off', says the Prime Minister! Above that headline is a smaller heading which says, `PM remains defiant over Hanson as Fischer voices concern on trade.' Other members of this government&mdash;I wish to commend them&mdash;have been very forthright in their rejection of these views.

We have always enjoyed in our modern history the right of free speech to an extent that many countries in the world have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This nonsense about political correctness was simply code, particularly for those of us who are in this business of throwing words around and understanding them. It was code for, `Although I am being politically correct in saying the things I need to say, to rebut the things that Pauline Hanson is saying, I nevertheless quietly&mdash;wink&hyphen;wink, nudge&hyphen;nudge&mdash;am giving support to them.' He was far more explicit about this. The federal Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, said, `I disagree very strongly with the things Pauline Hanson said.' He was right up front. On the same day he said that, what did the Prime Minister say? He said that a number of the comments made by Ms Hanson were `an accurate reflection of what people feel'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What people is the Prime Minister of Australia talking about when he makes a statement like that? Did he qualify it by saying `what some people feel' or `what a few people feel'. That would have been bad enough. He did not. On the same day as he talked about everyone having the right to free speech, he said that Pauline Hanson reflected `accurately' what people feel. When that is reported on the front page of Australian newspapers, as it should be, accurately, and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4796"> then it is picked up overseas, who do you think&mdash;reasonably&mdash;overseas journalists, opinion makers or politicians believe that the Prime Minister of Australia is talking about when he says the all embracing word `people'? Of course, he is referring to the Australian people&mdash;to us. These issues are central to our national ethos and, I might add, to our international place in the world. He is our spokesperson, irrespective of whether he is Labor, Liberal or whatever. He speaks for us all on these subjects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning the Prime Minister is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suggestions in some sections of the Asian media that in some way I have encouraged&mdash;by what I have said or what I have not said&mdash;any acts of discrimination against Asian Australians are absolutely wrong . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Can that statement be sustained? No, it cannot, because the Prime Minister's own words rebut it. Pauline Hanson, the member for Oxley, had no further authority than her own. The sentiments she expressed should have simply hung there either unsupported or attacked&mdash;which is what they should have been&mdash;or corrected, as Dr Wooldridge and Mr Ruddock corrected them, to their credit. On the day that she said them, the Prime Minister said on behalf of us all that, as far as he was concerned, what she had said in its entirety was an accurate reflection of what people feel in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, is the impression that has been formed overseas by these journalists or by opinion makers&mdash;the people who are writing these stories&mdash;inaccurate or accurate? It is accurate: the Prime Minister's own words provide the foundation for it. It was a totally unqualified statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the games that the Prime Minister has been playing with all of us on this. We all have our own biases and prejudices; it is not a prejudice free or bias free world. I come from a city that has had two Chinese Australian lord mayors. The first, Harry Chan, was not only mayor of Darwin but also president of our first parliament; the second, Alec Fong Lim, probably the most successful and popular mayor Darwin has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ever had, would probably still be mayor if it had not been for his death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from an Australian city very close to Asia with a long history of Asian involvement going back to the turn of the century. I know that what politicians say is important. The Prime Minister, having declared that we had a new birth of free speech, went on to say a month later that he was very disturbed about school teachers teaching children that we had a racist and bigoted past in Australia. Did he qualify those words? No, he did not. He simply said that Australians are told quite regularly that we have a racist and bigoted past. Well, do we? Yes, we do. Is that something that we should feel guilty about? No, it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister, in debate again yesterday, said that we should not have a `black armband' approach to our history. You need to see all of these statements of the Prime Minister together to understand the impact that they are having. But what did the Prime Minister say today in debate on this motion about a racist and bigoted past? Of course we had that past. We had a White Australia Policy until very recently. It was official government policy that you could not get into this country if you were not white. I am not quite sure how much more racist you can be than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had little things like the Coniston massacre, which, in another place and another time, would have been determined to be a war crime, without any threat or hindrance. As I pointed out in debate last night, next year, 1997, will be the 30th anniversary of the Aboriginal people of Australia becoming citizens in their own country. As I said last night, that is not exactly prehistory or the deep past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Prime Minister say today in terms of these word games he has been playing for the last two months? He said that he rejected that we have a `totally racist and prejudiced past'. The spin doctors have been at it again overnight, and that is what has been happening over the last two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would it have been a nonsense for anyone to have suggested that we have a totally racist and prejudiced past? Of course it would be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4797"> nonsense. But that is not what the Prime Minister said up until yesterday. Today the language has changed. It is classic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Animal Farm</EMPHASIS> stuff from politics. The message on the blackboard changes every night. There is a new message up for you every morning and John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, has done it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that he cannot escape from, as I said before, is that while his deputy was forthrightly attacking the comments of the member for Oxley, whilst the minister for health was pointing out the errors&mdash;and, I might add, to their credit, other Liberal backbenchers in the House of Representatives in their maiden speeches did so as well&mdash;and while the minister for immigration was properly, responsibly and carefully pointing out the facts, that Ms Hanson was wrong about us being swamped by Asian immigration in Australia, the Prime Minister, in the same context, was saying publicly that people&mdash;all people, us people, we people, the Australian people&mdash;in fact were sympathetic to the sentiments that Ms Hanson was expressing. In fact, he said that it was an accurate reflection of what people&mdash;all Australian people&mdash;feel. It is not what this person feels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I resent the fact that the person I acknowledge speaks for me on the international stage on these issues was wrong. He is not speaking for all Australian people when he says that, but he should have been. When he links that to this nonsense about a new dawn of free speech&mdash;these statements were all made on the same day&mdash;is it unreasonable for people to add two and two together and come up with four, just as he wanted them to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have campaigned in political campaigns over the last 20-odd years in a place where race issues are daily bread&mdash;the Northern Territory. I have on many occasions been verbally attacked by groups of people in the Northern Territory on the Labor Party's support for land rights for Aboriginal people, for example. At those meetings&mdash;this was a regular event&mdash;people would get stuck into me and say, `We won't vote for the Labor Party because you are strong supporters of land rights for Aboriginal people.' At those meetings I would produce the Country Liberal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Party's written policy and I would say to these people, with the voice of sweet reason, `Yes, we do support these aspirations for Aboriginal people but so, might I point out, do the Country Liberal Party, our political opponents. Here it is in black and white in their policy documents.' The reaction I used to get to that, time and time again, was, `Yes, we know that is in their policy&mdash;they have to put that in there&mdash;but they don't mean it and the Labor Party does. That is why we will be voting for the CLP.' That is the Realpolitik that the Prime Minister has been trading off for the last two months, but he has been making those trades at the great expense of this country and it is about time it stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have a lot more to say about the distortions that have been made of Aboriginal affairs over the last few months, all of which have been strongly and publicly supported by the Prime Minister&mdash;the nonsense that investigations into the affairs of Aboriginal organisations have disclosed that 90 per cent of them mismanage their money when in fact the reports cleared 95 per cent of all organisations and gave them a clean bill of health&mdash;but I am not going to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am going to say is that the concerns that have been raised by the overseas press are, I regret to say, legitimate. The press reports are not ill-informed. They are, in real substance, based on accurate reports from the  Australian media of the Prime Minister saying in respect of the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Oxley, which would have fallen, I think, on fairly barren ground if she had not had this support from the Prime Minister, that not only was this a land of free speech and she had the right to say it&mdash;no-one is doubting that&mdash;but more importantly `what she said was an accurate reflection of what people feel in this country'. Well, it isn't, it wasn't and I hope it won't be. It is about time, on an issue this important to the national interests of our country, the Prime Minister started saying that up front.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite important that the Senate is debating the issues in front of us today, though I feel&mdash;it is probably not surprising to people who have listened to the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4798"> contributions I have made on similar issues in the past&mdash;that the majority of the debate has missed the point. I think it is extremely interesting that Mr Beazley's most public response in relation to the issues we are dealing with today has been a concern expressed about the impact these debates and issues might have on Australia's trade figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of concern to me&mdash;I reflect the statement made by Senator Boswell here&mdash;that the issues relate to responses to what Senator Boswell called the trauma of rapid social and economic change. Until we in Australia can admit and deal with the issues related to rapid social and economic change, then statements like we see today may assist but will never deal with the issues that are creating this level of disharmony, distress, hurt and anger in society. There are a number of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have people calling my office who do not know what to do in terms of their lives and want someone to do something about what they think is the Pauline Hanson factor. They ask: why doesn't someone speak out? I explain to them as best I can that we have a very fertile environment in Australia of people who are disillusioned because there have been massive social and economic changes within the last few years. They have changed people's livelihoods, their lifestyles, the nature of their work and even their family environment. They have changed the way people are able to think about each other and the way communities form and hang together or fall apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The `me' generation that comes with economic fundamentalism has hurt a great many people, as has the rapid change associated with competition policy, which basically pits one person against another and assumes that we get better social outcomes. Quite truly, if we were honest enough to look, we would find that those outcomes can be very damaging in our society. But social outcomes are not the real aim of many of these policies. People are being hurt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not excusing anybody from speaking out. However, there is blame to be laid on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for not saying clearly whether or not he disagreed with a statement made by a member of the House of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Representatives. That is very clear. There is a responsibility to respond to those issues. We know that just as issues of trade can be poll driven so can issues of scapegoatism. It is my belief that the Prime Minister did have a responsibility to clearly disagree with those statements but the polls were saying, `If you do that you will lose this growing popularity that comes from riding in on the wave of scapegoatism.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But just dealing with words and dealing with individuals will not solve any problems in Australia. What will perhaps begin to lead to a change will be for us to acknowledge the history, for instance, of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia, to attempt to understand and to deal with the real problems that arise from that history. That is important. I agree with Senator Kernot there, but we also need to acknowledge the reality of our recent history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New Zealand there has been, if you like, a similar response. The last election saw not just a response for New Zealand First, which was perhaps a physical reminder of how disconcerted people can be with this wave of internationalism when they are starting to talk about what the outcomes are of this link to internationalism&mdash;there are a lot of various, mixed and confused ideas in there with New Zealand First&mdash;but there was also a rise of the Alliance in New Zealand. The Greens were involved in the Alliance as well. There has been an entire political change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At least in New Zealand they are now beginning, because of that political change, to talk about some of those issues which have manifested themselves in what appears to be a racially based argument. It is not just occurring in Australia and New Zealand; it is occurring in various parts of the world. I would put it to you that even the in the situations in Rwanda, Zaire and former Yugoslavia there are elements of those pressures of the new wave of internationalism, free trade at all costs, and massive changes, that are boiling into that level of scapegoatism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, in Australia, have to be intelligent enough to start addressing the issues and start seeing why it is so easy in 1996 for people's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4799"> fears to be manipulated in the way they are. Until we start talking about those massive economic and social changes, what part we have all had in creating those, whether those changes were correct, whether those decisions were right and whether there are different things we should be doing, we will continue to have the `lock them up' law and order debate that we have had in Western Australia over the last few years with the former Premier Carmen Lawrence, followed by the `lock them up' election platform of the former leader of the opposition in Western Australia, Jim McGinty, ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the answer: social disruption and alienation caused by massive social change and let's point the finger at the victims; let's point the finger at the symptoms of the change; let's not deal with the issues involved with the massive social change that we are experiencing and that a number of countries around the world are equally experiencing. No amount of word games will change this situation enough for us to be able to honestly deal with this situation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned in a previous speech that with the issues of the massive economic and social changes over free trade and structural adjustment there have been riots in various parts of the world. They are seeing immediately what that outcome is and nobody is stopping that debate. I would have to say that the media, which are currently pointing to the Prime Minister saying, `Name her! Name her!', must also bear a large part of the responsibility if they have not fostered proper debate about the issues which have created this degree of social discohesion in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must all bear that responsibility and perhaps from this day onwards say that we will not continue to pretend that the leap into internationalism has been the best thing since sliced bread but continue to pretend that people are not hurting because of that. I asked questions the other day of Senator Hill and he gave me the same answer I was getting three years ago: `Yes, we are still going to get billions of dollars of benefits.' It is not here and the people in the street know it is not here. They can see it in their shops. They can see it in their lifestyles. They can see it in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their working lives. We are pretending it is not even happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time for us to be honest and say that this parliament has a responsibility to start talking about these issues. The community has the right to be given information about what those pressures have been and why those changes have occurred. If we are honest enough to start talking about what changes have occurred, we then must be honest enough to say what the options are. If the response from government&mdash;and I remember it was very close to the response of Senator McMullan in dealing with the World Trade Organisation bills&mdash;is that virtually we have no choice, if that is what is believed by governments and opposition, then let us hear it. Let us debate that we have no choice. I do not believe it. I think there are thousands of choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the real issue, I believe, is that, if we are pretending there is no other choice and, because of that, pretending that what we have done is right and that there are no problems and all we have got to do is buckle down, privatise more, internationalise more and trade ourselves out of existence and everything will be fine, we will continue to have these debates. We will continue to live in a society of which we will become increasingly ashamed. I call on the members of the Senate to start taking their responsibilities&mdash;all of their responsibilities&mdash;as leaders seriously and start working for change as from today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were a number of comments made by the last speaker, Senator Dee Margetts, that we should really consider very thoroughly, but it is not the time to do it now. I have been asked to speak for no more than five minutes on this particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But she is correct. Much of the blame goes on the press because they have run with a particular statement of a backbench member of this parliament and blown it out of all proportion and not even attempted to consider the underlying problems of social cohesion that we are experiencing at the present moment, and this includes employment. They are the ones that should at least examine the question of employment. Of course it has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4800"> nothing to do with the immigration program, except in certain very narrow areas, say, for example, the oversupply of doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally, immigration into this country has built this country. Immigration into this country creates jobs overall. There have been a number of studies done on this particular matter. As I have indicated before, there is an enormous problem with jobs, particularly for the young at the present moment. Let us have a look at the reason for that such as policies that require families to have one, two and three incomes to make ends meet. We will get on to that in the objects of the workplace relations legislation, which ought to look at the question of unemployment and the reasons for unemployment and whether they are being overcome by that legislation. I certainly do not think they are. I am certain of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an underlying racism in some of our foreign policies, for example, the population control policy. There are other major areas that we should be looking at, too, in relation to anti-discrimination. You may have read this morning of the German biochemist who proudly states that he is a cripple. He was a thalidomide baby. He is now 34. He said, `If I was an unborn child now,'&mdash;if it happened now&mdash;`I would not be able to be born.' Let us just think of what this nation is doing. Let us look at other discrimination&mdash;discrimination against the disabled that is taking place and being paid for by this government in the abortion of those unborn children who are deemed not to be perfect. Let us have a look at that. That is never put forward in the press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to stand here and acknowledge the contribution that has been made to this nation by immigrants. I do so having married one of them. I do so as the father-in-law of a Javanese girl from Indonesia who is expecting another baby in a week's time or so. I am very proud of my daughter-in-law and all of those other people who have made such a contribution to this country. I am also honoured by the contribution that indigenous Australians have made to this country, particularly those Aboriginal Australians who share the name of Harradine.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support wholeheartedly this motion, but I raise one issue about it. This motion was moved in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. I thought that what we would do here today would be to carry a resolution without highlighting a particular individual who has contributed very little to the debate. Certainly, she has contributed much that passes for debate but she has not contributed anything to a proper, intellectual and informed debate. She has made shallow and intolerant statements that pass for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally am opposed to singling out an individual in this particular motion. I believe we should be above that sort of thing. The motion reaffirms our commitment to the rights of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or religion. Of course, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. I feel that what has passed for debate thus far has caused division and distress to a large number of people. Again, I say the media have a lot to answer for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion reaffirms our commitment to maintaining an immigration policy, wholly non&hyphen;discriminatory on the grounds of race, colour, creed or origin. It reaffirms our commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage. We reaffirm our commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society united by an overriding commitment to our nation and our democratic institutions and values. We denounce racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are&mdash;at least I hope we are&mdash;and certainly the kind we want to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with colleagues in the House of Representatives and other colleagues here in supporting this motion. I hope it is carried unanimously in the form that I have just read out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate today is about an unseen guest, and her name is Pauline Hanson. I feel very strongly on this issue for a number of reasons, and I will be supporting the motion. It is a good motion as far as it goes, although one could debate whether or not it goes far enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons I feel strongly about this issue is that I am a politician who is in Pauline Hanson's way. Having had some members of the Liberal Party in Queensland speak to me about this issue, that is their assessment of the politics of the whole debate. I am also a Uniting Church minister, and have spent almost all of my life in Queensland confronting this issue for it is one that surfaces in that state regularly. I have tried to promote what I believe is a Christian vision of a tolerant and caring society. I do not believe that you can have a caring or a Christian society if it is not a tolerant one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is and has been in the press, particularly in Queensland, a lot of speculation about whether or not Pauline Hanson will run for the Senate. Apparently her staff believe this is where the action is. If it is her intention to run for the Senate in order to gain some kind of balance of power in this chamber, I guess I will be at the epicentre of that struggle. Some say it would be my seat she would have to take in order to get here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, in any sense, I am under that kind of challenge, I certainly accept the fight. It is one I have been involved in for many, many years. I will be glad to continue to fight for the justice of this issue and for the kind of society that I want my children and grandchildren to grow up in. I do not expect to lose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect Pauline Hanson's push for the Senate would be very similar to the old `Joh for PM' campaign or, if you like, Bronwyn Bishop as leader of the Liberal Party&mdash;a phenomenon that is like a brief comet that wends its way across the political firmament and then expires. Believe me, I can assure you that Mr Pasquarelli is no Sir Robert Sparkes&mdash;and Queenslanders will understand that reference.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are greater issues in this debate than my political future and any challenge that Pauline Hanson might represent. I have a lifelong experience in those issues. I do not think people understand what can be unleashed when you make room in our society for extremists, and it actually happens. When you begin these kinds of debates, they never stay within the bounds of people who seem to think the debate is about freedom of speech or about the right of people to say what they think. The debate never stays within those boundaries. Once we have unleashed the debate, it is one in which we make room for extremists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me read to you a letter. In 1984, as the Director for Social Responsibility for the Uniting Church in Queensland, I entered the debate on Asian immigration. You will remember it was a contribution partly made by our present Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Having entered that debate, I received this letter:</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>One could dismiss that as a lot of stupid nonsense, except that it was followed up for weeks by phone calls to my home that were in the same vein. Whenever my son or I answered the phone, the person who was calling would hang up. But when my wife or daughters answered it, then a message of that same kind was given to them. In the end it caused very great trauma, particularly for my 13-year-old daughter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4802">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what happens when we open up this kind of debate and make space for extremists&mdash;and extremists certainly exist within our society. I do not want our society to go down that road. I have seen the effect that it has on people, particularly my own family. In the end, of course, we had to approach the police and other authorities in Queensland. Eventually, Telecom monitored our phone and we were able to stop it. But it did have a very serious effect on my family. We have to stare these attitudes down and declare openly, often and directly that they are unacceptable. We have to bear witness for tolerance, for honesty and for compassion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This debate also interests me because often people are prepared to say that intolerance and discrimination will affect our trade in Asia whilst perhaps not being quite so ready to also say that they affect our Aboriginal people. I want to make sure, as is made sure in this particular motion, that we understand the effect this kind of debate has on all those people who are being affected by it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me name some of the groups in Queensland that have been involved for many years in this kind of issue&mdash;groups like the League of Rights; many fascist groups with different names, such as the Australian National Association. These groups exist and have existed for a long time. Most of the time they have no effect on public debate. It is only when we open the box and make room for them that they begin to peddle their pernicious propaganda and affect the lives of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that the Senate will indeed support the motion which has been moved. It is high time we did move such a motion. It should have been moved weeks ago. Perhaps I will not repeat what others have said about those leaders in our nation who perhaps could have done more. But finally, let me say: let us support this motion&mdash;and I hope, as Senator Harradine has said, that we support it unanimously.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were previously discussing the objects of the workplace relations bill, I was trying to make the point very clearly that for the last 92 years this parliament has supported the encouragement of representative organisations of employers and employees. We have given positive encouragement to those representative bodies because that gave fulfilment to our commitment to collective bargaining. So it has been a central tenet of industrial relations in this country for the last 92 years at the Commonwealth level, and for most states as well, that unions and employer organisations were encouraged by the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is proposing that those organisations continue to be regulated, to be limited and to be fined for misdeeds but not to be encouraged or promoted. We are going to recognise that they exist, but the whole emphasis of this bill is to concentrate on issues like the rights of individuals not to join unions or on the requirements for unions to be representative and accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no difficulty with any of those concepts, but what is interesting is what is removed, what is left out. The encouragement that has been provided for years is no longer there. We have the punishment, the regulation, the fines and the restriction, but we do not have the encouragement and promotion that we have had for 92 years. Basically, the government does not want to promote unions of employers and employees. It is trying to focus industrial relations back on the individual negotiation between an employer and an employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very problem that gave rise to the first Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1904 was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4804"> that individual negotiation was resulting in employees being exploited. The bargaining power between an individual employee and an individual employer was not fair and was not equal. Because of that unequal bargaining power, we created in this parliament a Conciliation and Arbitration Act that gave encouragement to collective bargaining and gave encouragement to organisations that represented employees and employers in order to provide for a fairer, more just and more equal system of industrial relations in this country. This is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia that this parliament is looking to remove that encouragement for those organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill makes it very clear that the government wants to give primacy to employers and employees at the workplace level and remove that encouragement for representative organisations. The Australian public and the parliament are not surprised by this move on behalf of the government. The Liberal Party has made its opposition to trade unions and trade unionism very clear over many years&mdash;despite the members of the farmers union and the doctors union who sit on the government benches. Their rhetoric, their whole policy position, has been to oppose trade unionism, to oppose the functions and role of trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does surprise me is the position of the Australian Democrats in this. It is not in keeping with their traditional position to support a bill and amendments which try to strike out the role for trade unions in this country and ensure that the promotion and encouragement of trade unions no longer occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the policy that the Democrats took to the last election, you would be surprised by the position that they are adopting in this debate. Ironically, their general policy was called `Getting the balance right'. Their industrial relations policy had basically four major elements under the heading `Role of unions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary four statements of position included, firstly:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats support the continuing and important role for unions as the principal representatives of workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting. Where is that policy position reflected in this bill? It is not there. The Democrats went to the election saying that they support the continuing and important role of unions as the principal representative of workers, but there is no expression of that principle in the amendments that they are supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no support even for collective bargaining, per se, except for a small reference in the objects to `meeting our international obligations'. Those obligations include, of course, support for collective bargaining, but how do you give support to collective bargaining if you do not support collective bargaining agents? If there is no encouragement for unions of employers and employees, then how do you get collective bargaining? The reality is that the bill represents an attack on collective bargaining because it seeks to give primacy to individual negotiations. So there is no expression in the bill in relation to the first aspect of the Democrats policy on the role of unions, and it is particularly not expressed in the objects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the second element of their policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We support unions having the right to be heard on matters before the AIRC which have the potential to impact on their members, including test cases and the registration of enterprise agreements with significant flow&hyphen;on potential.</PARA>
<PARA>What is clear throughout this bill is the restriction on the right of unions to be heard, the restriction on the role of unions to play any part in the negotiation of Australian workplace agreements and to be heard when they have concerns about those agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, again, we see that the whole structure of Australian workplace agreements is based on secrecy. It is following the Western Australian workplace agreement model by providing for secret agreements to be registered and for unions and other parties&mdash;with an interest in proceedings&mdash;not to have access to the detail of that information and not to be involved in the making of those agreements. Clearly, the policy position the Democrats are adopting is contrary to the second point that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4805"> they stressed in their election policy document as being their position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, though, in terms of their third and fourth major policy positions, in respect of the role of unions, that they are all in here. They are in here in spades. The third one is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe that workers should not be discriminated against on the basis of membership or non&hyphen;membership of a union or coverage or non&hyphen;coverage by enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>That is right up there in the objects of the legislation: no discrimination against people for not being members of a union. They have been very faithful to that policy prescription.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their fourth one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will continue to oppose compulsory unionism and closed shops.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is given full weight in the bill and the amendments that they are supporting. You can see the dichotomy of their position. They say their policy is about getting the balance right but what we have here is not getting the balance right at all. What we have is an expression of that part of the Democrats' policy as it relates to regulation, control of unions and penalties on them and protection for those who do not want to belong to unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no problem with that protection. But what we do not see is any expression of the Democrats' position in terms of encouragement and the giving of a primary role to trade unions. That is what they said was in their policy. That is what they said was essential to getting the balance right. The Democrats have not got the balance right because those aspects of their policy, that go to the rights of trade unions and the rights of employees to bargain collectively, are not represented in this bill and are not represented in the objects which give very clear expression to what this bill is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1">  It is about encouraging individual agreements and moving away from the encouragement of collective bargaining and the promotion of unions of employers and employees. The Democrats have failed to live up to their policy commitments and I would urge them to think carefully about some of the Labor amendments that will be moved in this sec tion which try to re&hyphen;insert support for promotion and encouragement of representative bodies of employers and employees. It is essential that that statement of encouragement be contained in the new act. It is essential and vital that the parliament express the view that it still provides encouragement and promotion of those organisations because they are the key to whether or not we have fair outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Without those organisations, without that right of employees to bargain collectively, to form organisations, to have those organisations encouraged, we will not get fair outcomes. It does not matter how many times you put `fair' into the text of this bill; you will not bring about fairness without putting in place the structural support to make sure that you get fair outcomes. Putting in the word `fair', or `motherhood' or `apple pie', does not deliver the result. The structure of the bill has to provide the ability for people to get fair outcomes. That means allowing them to bargain collectively and allowing them to be represented by organisations that represent them collectively. This bill is about attacking that right. That is a right we have recognised since 1904 and this parliament ought to think very carefully before&mdash;for the first time since 1904&mdash;we seek to remove from our major piece of industrial relations legislation in this country that promotion and encouragement of representative organisations of employees and employers. If you know anything about industrial relations, you know it is about power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I know the Liberal Party and the conservatives generally have concerns about union power but if you know anything about industrial relations you know that individual employees get their power from their ability to bargain collectively. That is why the ILO and the other international organisations have given primacy to that collective bargaining right over many years. If you take away the right of employees to bargain collectively, if you take away the encouragement and promotion of unions of employers and employees, you take away power from those individual employees. All the weasel words and nice&hyphen;sounding amendments will not overcome that change in the balance of power.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4806">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If the Democrats are really about, as their policy says, `getting the balance right', I urge them to reconsider whether the balance is right when you remove from the objects of the act that encouragement of the role of trade unions of employees. In doing so, what you are doing is reducing the power of individual employees because you reduce their right to bargain collectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, of all people, should know that because that is at the heart of the Western Australian state legislation in which we have seen the encouragement of individual workplace agreements. They have effectively isolated employees into individual bargaining units who have experienced an erosion of their conditions because they have not been able to bargain collectively. The AWAs proposed in this bill seek to do the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is a very important point. I urge the parliament to consider very carefully moving for the first time in 92 years to remove that encouragement and promotion of unions of employees and employers from the objects of the major industrial relations legislation in this country. It would be the first time in our history and it would be a backward step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> For 92 years, conservatives in this parliament have been able to bring themselves to support that proposition. Now, in 1996, the Democrats cannot do that. I want to know why because it seems to me a terribly retrograde step and certainly not in keeping with the Democrats' policy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal object of this Act is to provide a framework for cooperative workplace relations which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> encouraging the pursuit of high employment, improved living standards, low inflation and international competitiveness through higher productivity and a flexible labour market . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This all sounds wonderful, but how will this impact on an industry such as the meat industry where workers are already working to full capacity? Meatworkers do piecework, they are paid for the work they do, so obvi <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> ously their work is already driven by a commitment to productivity. Does higher productivity mean lower wages? Does this mean Australia has to go the way of the American meat industry? In the American abattoirs they employ cheap labour and the workers undercut each other's hourly rate of pay to gain access to these jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party accept the concept of a flexible labour market, but we believe that the labour market should not only be flexible but be fair. Where in the objects of the bill does it refer to the promotion of better pay for productive work? It does not. Despite the government's pre&hyphen;election commitment and all the subsequent verbosity that its industrial relations proposals were to achieve better pay for better work, the objects do not state that the bill seeks to promote better pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Flexibility is one thing. With no reference to fairness, this bill is all about flexibility, certainly not about fairness. In the objects of this bill there is no commitment to the guarantee of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that no-one will be worse off as a result of the implementation of this bill. This commitment is crucial to those who are most vulnerable within the workplace, especially apprentices, trainees, casual workers and so on. The objects of this bill should reflect a commitment to the provision of relevant, secure and consistent wages and conditions through awards, not just a safety net of minimum wages and conditions as provided in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of a flexible labour market, how far do you want to go? In many service industries, such as the hospitality industry, the workers already experience their fill in terms of flexibility. Many service workers already work nightmarish hours and are casualised beyond what is reasonable. Many of the new jobs being created are being created within interactive service industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who works in these jobs? I will tell you. Women, young people and semi-skilled workers. How flexible do you want these workers to be? The so-called flexibility being advocated in the objects of this bill is really nothing more than a squeeze on the most vulnerable and unprotected workers in our society.  </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4807">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take, for instance, the deal between the Democrats and the government regarding the power of the commission to set the maximum number of hours for part-time workers. According to this deal, all award quotas will be repealed without exception. With regard to the hours of part-timers, the commission will have no power to set maximum hours. The commission's power to set minimum hours will be restricted to the number of consecutive hours only. So much for the Democrats' pre&hyphen;election policy where they stated, `The Democrats will oppose any attempt to reduce the powers or jurisdiction of the commission'!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have previously stated in this chamber&mdash;and I repeat it for the benefit of those who do not yet quite understand this issue&mdash;the vast majority of part-time workers are women. The proposed amendments concerning the power of the commission to set maximum and minimum hours for part-time workers is an attack on women workers. Why the attack on women workers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also in direct contradiction to proposed section 3(i) of the objects of the bill, which clearly states that this bill is supposed to assist employees in the balance between their work and family responsibilities through the development of mutually beneficial work practices with employers. What is mutually beneficial about waking up in the morning and not knowing whether or not you are going to work? What is beneficial about employers being able to call a woman into work at any time with no regard for how difficult it is to arrange child care at such short notice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not even a remotely family&hyphen;friendly practice, yet we are consistently told that this bill espouses a family&hyphen;friendly orientation towards the workplace. Proposed section 3(j) tells us that the object of this bill is to respect and value diversity of the work force by helping to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Many aspects of this bill are anything but family&hyphen;friendly. Wage earners who have families, particularly women who work part time, certainly need flexibility in the workplace. It seems the term `flexibility' has been grossly misunderstood in terms of the promo tion of family&hyphen;friendly workplaces. What workers need is regularity, consistency and trust within the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two aspects of the objects to which I have just referred are actually in contradiction. There will be no mutually beneficial arrangements for many disadvantaged workers, but there will be a great deal of systemic discrimination on the basis of family responsibility. Women will be discouraged from taking up part&hyphen;time work, and this will have a flow&hyphen;on effect in terms of levels of family and child poverty. I have said it before in this chamber and I will continue to say it, because it is obvious to me that, in relation to women in the work force, many of you just don't get it. Women are there and they are going to stay there whether you like it or not. There is no doubt in my mind that many women workers will suffer as a result of the implementation of this bill, as will young people and those most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The objects under discussion here do not accurately reflect the real intention of the bill. The principal objects of this act pay lip&hyphen;service to the very real problem of equity within the workplace. This bill will affect nearly every worker in Australia, and it is my deep concern that these objects do reflect the very real possibility that workers will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act must provide a framework for fair and effective bargaining, not just agreement making, as provided in the bill. There must be fairness provided in the bargaining process, not just in the ultimate making of the agreement. Freedom of association provisions must not stymie the rights of workers, as recognised by international law, to organise and bargain collectively. This needs to be stated categorically in the objects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A requirement of the act should be to encourage and facilitate the development and registration of organisations. This is an object of the existing act&mdash;and a fine object it is too. It should be retained. The objects of this act do not encourage a cooperative industrial relations system, because they do not encourage the practice of arbitration for all workers. Arbitration should be enacted by this bill where it is needed and not as a last resort <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4808"> within a limited range of contexts as this bill provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator LUNDY</EMPHASIS> (Australian Capital Territory) (6.18 p.m.) With respect to the principal objects in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, there are a whole range of issues that really go to the heart of what the workplace relations bill is all about. First of all, I would like to address my comments to the distinction between the term `workplace' and the term `industrial' in terms of relations. When we talk about industrial relations, it is an issue that goes far beyond each individual workplace. Having come from an industry where, in fact, it is quite hard to define what your workplace is, what appears to be something of semantic value becomes a real and tangible issue, particularly when it is put in the context of being part of the objects of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On that definition of industrial and workplace relations and the distinction between the two in, for example, the building and construction industry, it is actually very difficult to define what a workplace is. There have been difficulties in assessing that definition under a variety of acts, including, of course, the various state occupational health and safety acts. In the construction industry a workplace may be a place which is under the control of the particular employer, but it may not. Quite often work takes place in an area in someone else's workplace, for example, during refurbishment, repatriation work or something like that. The definition becomes very blurry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue about the distinction between industrial relations and workplace relations is that it really does preclude approaching those issues on an industry basis. This government is signalling quite clearly a move away from approaching industrial relations on an industry basis down into individual workplaces. That really symbolises the move of this bill away from collective bargaining and away from approaching wage setting and conditions of employment across a whole range of classifications in a given industry down to the individual workplace. That raises questions of equity as well as collective bargaining.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry&hyphen;wide role is a crucial one in industrial relations and must be recognised in the objects of this bill. If it is not, then the workers in those industries will be the ones that will be split and divided. Their ability to retain their existing workplace conditions and wages will certainly be jeopardised. The ability of those workers to operate and organise themselves collectively is quite fundamental to maintaining decent conditions. It is no secret that in the industrial movement it is those workers in the well&hyphen;organised sectors that can organise effective campaigns to improve their wages and conditions and who help move along and bring up the wages and conditions of those workers in the industry who are not in a position to organise themselves collectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This been a feature of industrial relations and the evolution of industrial relations in Australia that has brought some equity to wages claims and to the way that they are progressed through the system. The transitional movement from solely centralised wage fixing and awards to enterprise bargaining has meant that there is still some ability for workers organising themselves collectively in an industry to look after those at a greater disadvantage in the industry. But, under this bill, and in terms of the objects here defined, that ability will be vastly diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be those workers who cannot pursue a fair and equitable outcome, who are not in a position to bargain with their employer, who will be at the greatest disadvantage. That is what we are really talking about when we look at this bill and see where the damage will be done. It will be those workers who currently rely on the stronger sectors of the work force to bring their wages and conditions up to par.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4809"> This system does not provide for any mechanism of that nature to occur. In fact, what it sets in place is the very opposite. Yes, it provides for some workers to enter into workplace agreements, if they are in a position to do so, but then it leaves all the other workers totally exposed. The protections that were in place before this bill was introduced, by allowing unions to actively intervene on behalf of workers if they suffered a disadvan tage, are also being removed. The need to protect those in our work force who are not in a position to bargain goes right to the heart of what our amendments to this bill are all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has always looked after the disadvantaged worker and the system of industrial relations that has evolved over the last 13 years while Labor was in power has kept this fundamental principle foremost of our concerns. Our amendments to the objects reintroduce some of these principles and put them in the objects clause, which really states what this bill is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later we will be talking about the specific features of the bill, but what Assistant Treasurer Kemp had to say today in response to a question is worthy of noting. He talked about restraint in the spirit of cooperation and said that wage restraint must be exercised by all. Yet, we see in their policies phrases like `better pay for better work' and all the rest of it. Tell me where, in these objects, they talk about a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. There are many inconsistencies in this government's approach as to what they say and what this bill contains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can see quite clearly that the government can use all of the phrases they like&mdash;whether it is `the individual exercising their own choice' or `better pay for better work'&mdash;but none of those words are conveyed or enacted in this government's bill. The issue of better pay for better work is something that has been embraced in Labor's industrial relations policy and provided the means for people to pursue better pay. This government knows full well that better pay has nothing to do with the aims and objectives as they are contained in the amendments to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that this government has been so exposed by the guarantee that no worker will be worse off only serves to reinforce the falsity of some of the policy statements made by this government. The fact that we are moving to operate&mdash;now that the Democrats have done the deal on this&mdash;in an industrial relations system that does not allow better work to get better pay, and that we can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually contemplate doing this to Australian working people, is an indictment upon this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no respect or consideration given to the fact that our industrial relations system has evolved for the last century on a set of principles which mean you do get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. This system allows specific exploitation of workers who do not have the collective strength to protect themselves from being exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own experience as a labourer in the private sector in Canberra tells me that, if we had not had the award rate at the time and had not had a significant union presence, there would have been no pressure for my employer to pay me the award rate. The fact that I was able, at such a young age, to earn a wage that was comparable to my adult counterparts meant that I was getting paid equal pay for work of equal value. Where is the commitment to that under this act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the specific areas in these objectives with respect to apprentices and trainees and the commitment that no worker will be worse off, that no apprentices and trainees will take home less pay. The deal that has been done will completely compromise this commitment by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know when I started working in the private sector that, if it had not been for the protection of the award which set minimum rates&mdash;we were working on a paid rates award&mdash;there is no way I would have been in a position to stake my ground as a young worker entering the work force, excited about my new job, keen to get into it and pretty thrilled about earning my first wage. Staking my claim, in fact being quite assertive about it, was something that I do not believe I would have been in a position to even contemplate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder how many young people under this new workplace relations bill are going to have any hope of setting themselves up with a living wage, particularly when you look at some of the provisions that require the establishment of an AWA and the matters thereof, even before, technically, that employment contract begins.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4810">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of freedom of association is also one that is worthy of comment at this point with respect to the objects. Freedom of association is something that, from my background, is absolutely crucial, but not in the language of this government. It is crucial in the language of Labor and in the language of working people, which allows them to join the trade union that is involved in that particular workplace and, subsequently, allows that trade union to play an active role within that workplace in collective bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one signal that is patently clear in this particular bill it is the fact that this government is all about breaking the trade unions and destroying their ability to collectively bargain on behalf of the people they represent. Never mind that working people choose to pay their subscriptions to their union so that the union can represent them. Never mind that for 100 years the union movement has led the way with the development of awards here and improved the award wages and conditions which have flowed on into the areas where perhaps union membership is not so high. Never mind that that is the movement that has made all the difference for working people in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is so narrow-minded in its ideological pursuit that it does not matter what it takes in this bill&mdash;dress it up how you like; it is about undermining that fundamental ability. I think this is where the Democrats' deal really needs to be called to task. It is one thing to say certain things, having come to a balanced outcome and all the rest of it. How can you have a balanced outcome in the Industrial Relations Commission if the unions are not allowed under this act to operate effectively as the collective representatives of workers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industrial Relations Commission has not awarded these wage rises and improvements in conditions over the years from the goodness of its heart. It has not said, `Well, in our view we think it should go like this.' It has been the fact that we have had the balance of powers between the employer organisations and trade unions arguing the toss. The unions are saying, `The workers are worth more because they do this, this and this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and they are working these hours and this is the nature of their work and the cost of living has gone up this much and they have transient employment, which means they deserve some sort of severance or redundancy pay or some TCR provision or superannuation so they can have dignity in retirement.' On the other hand, the employer says, `We don't want to pay anything. We can't afford to pay.' That is where the balance lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The balance lies in the Industrial Relations Commission being able to come between those two parties and come to a position that satisfies, hopefully, the needs of the working people in improving their conditions of employment in a way that also satisfies the public interest. That is where the balance is. You will create an imbalance by undermining the role of trade unions in the Industrial Relations Commission, and that is what this bill does. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on the objects of the bill, which are before the committee. I want to do so by prefacing my remarks with the observation that when I spoke last there was not a publicly notorious deal between the Australian Democrats and the government. There is now.

Clearly, such a deal enables an act to be carried in the form that the majority of this extended coalition will allow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to put on the public record some of the concerns and also sound a note of warning about some of the potential results of that deal in a practical world. That deal was struck on a two-party basis without the Australian Labor Party being involved and without the immense knowledge and background that the Australian Labor Party has in this field. It was a deal struck by the Democrats, with the greatest respect to them and an acknowledgment that their intentions were honourable. Nonetheless, without that information base, I would submit strongly to this chamber, it is a deal flawed. Without that knowledge base, it opens up the workplace to exploitation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4811">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at this bill, I think the first and obvious question that anyone asks themselves about a bill before a parliament is: what is the head of power in the constitution of Australia that the parliament draws on to enact this legislation? In the case of the original Industrial Relations Act in this nation, the head of power was that clearly set out in the Australian constitution by our constitutional forefathers, allowing the parliament of Australia to make laws governing the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes going across the border of more than one state. It is set out in the constitution. For clearly a century we have drawn from that head of power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last two parliaments we extended that head of power to include the foreign affairs power. We did that for a very good reason. The international standards in this field, with Australia moving into the international economy, are important issues. The arbiter of international standards&mdash;the United Nations, if you like; certainly it is a UN agency&mdash;of international labour relations is the ILO. I know that the government has made a great deal of sport publicly by misrepresenting the ILO. The ILO is called the International Labour Organisation&mdash;L-a-b-o-u-r&mdash;because it deals with workers and employers and the labour force. When it was the opposition, the government tried to pretend that it was a `Labor Party' international organisation, which is of course a public lie and not true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ILO is a tripartite body. It is unique among international bodies in that sense. It is tripartite in that it has three parties that appear in it as the stakeholders&mdash;governments, employers and workers. For a convention of the ILO to be proclaimed as a fair labour convention, all three parties must concur. Where all three parties speak with the one voice internationally through economies that cover developed countries and developing countries and countries in various stages of economic growth, there has to be an overwhelming unanimity of view. Conventions are given birth when there is. Because they are, they carry a certainly international moral as well as political force as to what the fair standards of behaviour should be in modern <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> workplaces as we move towards the year 2000 and the 21st century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seemed appropriate to the former government that, as a good international citizen, through the foreign affairs powers of the constitution, we should draw on those international powers in setting standards in Australia. That still remains a fundamental principle. It is one the government rejects. The government is wrong in that and the government is captured by its own tawdry rhetoric on this subject. What this bill does is go further and draw on another head of constitutional power which our constitutional forefathers never intended but which this government has pressed into service for the sake of the expediency of this legislation, and that is the corporations power in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had an interjection from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Senator Campbell), who is at the table, to Senator Lundy, when she was talking about some of the things in the objectives of this bill. He said, `Why didn't you do it?' We did not do it for the reason that we had not used the corporations power as the head of power to legislate. But this government is using it. I think there is an arguable case whether it should but, for the sake of improving industrial relations, my party at least accepts it for the time being. But there is an arguable case as to whether or not that is a legitimate expression of what was intended by the constitution. It is a way of managing the constitution for modern legislation. We all know how difficult it is to bring the constitution up to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those remarks, let me say that the objectives of a bill ought to reflect indeed the full intention of the bill. The two most important clauses, I always think, in a piece of legislation, are these. Firstly, what are the objectives of it? If they are clear, how you then encode those objectives or give expression to those objectives is what the rest of the bill is about. The second most important part of the bill is what its scope is. In other words, what is the extent of its coverage? One of the most vexed questions in Australia over history has been: what is an industrial question? <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4812"> What matters can the arbitration commission deal with&mdash;that is, matters prescribed as industrial questions? What matters can't it deal with&mdash;that is, matters that are not prescribed as industrial questions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the truths is that the limitation of the constitutional head of power has limited the objectives of previous acts&mdash;and limits the scope of them&mdash;and left outside a number of things that, in the modern workplace, are clearly industrial but, nonetheless, the commission were not clothed to deal with. I also foreshadow, when we come to the question about the scope and power of the industrial relations commission, that that is a matter of quite considerable importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just turning to the objectives part of the bill, I will not take these necessarily in order because, in the time allowed to address the committee, I do not have sufficient time to go through this in the type of detail that I would like. It is convenient for me to start with the opposition's proposed amendments&mdash;firstly, as I read it here, paragraph (l). In this we say that we need to add in to the bill the provision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(l) ensuring that labour standards meet Australia's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>It is convenient only because I have just addressed the committee on the ILO. I think that is a fundamental provision. As I say, we, as a nation, need to be sure that the labour standards applied in Australia are labour standards that are reasonable by the international measure and not just by our own domestic measure. The court that determines that is that tripartite body the ILO. Unless the objectives of this bill reflect the ability to do that, to encode ILO conventions and recommendations, then we fall short of what is necessary in modern industrial relations. Indeed, by excluding it, the government reveals, I think, its hand in that it wants to not meet those internationally declared standards or it wants to provide a bit of ice for itself to slide below them or to manipulate them where it suits its needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most sensible thing here is to say that the ILO does have power in this field; its role is respected; it should be recognised. We should have, in this bill, a provision that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> explicitly does so. I support strongly the opposition proposals on that score.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one needs to look at all the amendments that we are proposing, without in any way derogating from the significance and importance of any one of them, the one that I would place as the pre&hyphen;eminent change that is necessary to the objectives of this bill is the provision that we insert in the objectives of this bill that no&hyphen;one will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that for a number of reasons. Firstly, I believe this bill is a public confidence trick by the government. The government has hijacked Labor rhetoric to sell a bill of goods to the community and reassure the community that it will be all right. If this bill gets passed as the package that has been agreed and comes into force and is shown to be flawed and the people begin to realise that the promises made blithely by the government at election time are false and fraudulent, then they will rebel&mdash;but then it will be too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the role of the opposition is to hold the government strongly to the position that it put to the people, which the government sought a mandate for. The fundamental thing it said to the people in the election debate was that no&hyphen;one will be worse off. That is what the government said; that is what the government should have in this bill. That should be a fundamental objective of this bill. If that is what it sought its electoral mandate on, and it got a mandate, that is what it should be made to encode in this legislation. If it does not do it, it is the first step towards eroding its own mandate or crawling out from its own election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one could say that that was not a core promise. You would all have to say that that was a fundamental promise. The reassuring noises the government made to the Australian work force and to Australian employers that no-one would be worse off and that this would bring harmony into the workplace were, I think, quite a significant undertaking by the government in the run-up to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is it important to hold the government to its promise; it is important that it be there in order to protect vulnerable members of the work force, in particular trainees and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4813"> apprentices, who have virtually no bargaining power in the present labour market. They need the force of law to guarantee them a protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard just last sitting week that a Newcastle firm had advertised for 40 apprentices and that something like 1,900 applicants turned up for the job. No-one can believe that, in the queue for those 40 jobs, any one of those 1,900 young prospective workers had any bargaining power at all in negotiating with that company, a major Newcastle firm, over the terms and conditions of their employment. I think a provision such as this is necessary in order to provide some clear direction in this act, as a key objective of the act, to ensure that those people are not exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I say: if you leave that provision out&mdash;if that is what the package between the Democrats and the government does&mdash;then this has to be declared, frankly and openly, to be a reprehensible package that should not pass in the public interest, and certainly not in the interests of those who are vulnerable in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also draw attention to provision (c) in our amendments, which states that, whilst we accept that the act must ensure that primary responsibility for determining employment matters should be at the workplace, we in the opposition wish to add the necessity for this to occur within the framework of the act and with the protections of the commission. I think that is pretty fundamental because the act should not recognise, even in a de facto way, determination of employment matters at the workplace outside of the framework of the act itself; that is, informally or without the protections of the commission and without review of workplace agreements by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only umpire in this field is the commission. If you tie the hands of the umpire behind his back, put a blindfold over his mouth and prevent him from speaking, then injustices will occur. The only way you can guarantee that is, I think, by accepting the principle we have set in terms of this legislation. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a lot of other things I could talk on in relation to the objectives, but I do not have time in the allocation available to me now. One of the other ones I draw particular attention to is (f) about effective bargaining&mdash;not just agreement making, as provided for in this bill. Bargaining, to succeed and to hold, must be fair. If the parties cannot conduct fair bargaining, if it is just an agreement, it is a fraud. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly a very important report and a very timely one for the Senate to consider, as it deals with the workings of the council that has been set up to establish a proper, full and permanent reconciliation between the original inhabitants of the land we live in and all those that have followed them. We have been discussing today the objects of the workplace relations bill. Object (j) states that the workplace should be a place where the welfare and prosperity of the people of Australia are assured by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">respecting and valuing the diversity of the work force by helping to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.</PARA>
<PARA>We are in disagreement on many aspects of clause 3 of the bill, which deals with the principal object of this act, but we certainly would not, any of us, disagree with the sentiments set out in that particular object. It is one that must be transferred, clearly, from the workplace to all other parts of our life also. In other words, it should not be confined to the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, there is a strong current in Australian society which would have the situation other than that provided for in object (j) of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. That current is based on racism, which does not, in the way <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4814"> we should proceed in this society, respect people for what they are and who they are and which does discriminate against people on the ground of their colour, on the ground of their race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very helpful report that we have before us is very encouraging to those people in our community who form a counter current to what we have been hearing so much about. That presses for Australia to be a society where everybody is respected no matter what their colour or race and Australia can go forward on the basis that we can reach a state in this place in which we all live where people are respected, where people are treated as human beings, where people are given proper treatment, not only in the workplace but in every aspect of life. There must be a start to that with the original inhabitants of this land. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is a very fundamental step on the way to giving that current, which we all agree with here, predominance over the one that is much more dark.</PARA>

<PARA>This is another very important section of our society that needs to be noted. These people classify the material we watch and the computer games that we play. They often come in for great criticism. I notice that the director of the classification board is John Dickie, who has done a lot of work over the years in classifying material that is sent out for us to consume in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know he has come in for a lot of criticism, but he has done a grand job, as has everybody else on the classification board. Indeed, while I am still on my feet, I should mention the Classification Review Board. It also has done good work. It is always a very difficult problem to decide what should be censored and what should not. People have heard these arguments over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one aspect about all of this that is of interest. The classification scheme in Australia needs the cooperation of not only the federal government and the state governments but also the territory governments as well. So all governments in Australia must come together to get an efficient classification scheme. It is a part of a national scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One problem with those sorts of schemes is this: because there are agreements between governments, it becomes difficult for parliaments to give the scrutiny that should be given to the underpinning legislation. I see in the chamber the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch. She is a great parliamentarian and she has worked over the years on this and she would understand the importance. And, of course, Peter O'Keeffe is in the chamber, too, who was my secretary on the regulations and ordinances committee, which was directed towards supervising what governments do.</PARA>

<PARA>I would like to take a few moments in relaying to this chamber exactly where the National Museum is at. Many will be aware that, in its endless search for construction, the National Museum of Australia has been, once again, forced to jump through several hoops in its quest for a physical presence in the nation's capital, Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular report really highlights the very grand efforts of the staff of the National Museum in times when it must be very difficult for them to keep their morale as high as they obviously do in their work. Particularly, it is worth noting the work that has been done in taking the National Museum around Australia. One of its key result areas as noted in the report is access and making the collections of the National Museum accessible to people right around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many senators will know that the bulk of the National Museum's collection is in a couple of warehouses in Canberra. Funding is provided on an annual basis to ensure the collection is maintained in adequate form for when the museum is ultimately constructed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If honourable senators have not taken the opportunity yet to peruse the collection of the National Museum of Australia in the suburb of Mitchell, may I suggest that they do so and ask the very helpful staff to conduct them through the hallways, warehouses and storage areas of the National Museum of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So where is the National Museum going? It is still waiting, as it has for many years, for a decision by this parliament, or by the government of the day, to move to construct for it a permanent residence. The nature of that permanent residence has changed over the years with funding constraints, other pressures and contentious issues, such as the siting issue, impacting upon the museum. We will move slowly, but I am hopeful it will inevitably be towards the construction of the museum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Its nature has also changed in that we are now talking about a hub of a collection that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will be transported regularly around Australia. The innovative CD ROM collection the National Museum is putting together means that schools have the ability to access the collection through multimedia as well. The siting study that is being conducted at the moment is going through its own throes of uncertainty with new sites being introduced by the ACT government and others all the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point in noting this report, I would like to commend the work of the staff of the National Museum. I say to them, `Keep your spirits up. Keep the morale high.' I am hopeful that we will see the construction of a National Museum and am hopeful and ask that this government honour its commitment to construct the National Museum of Australia here in Canberra. It would be preferable at the Yarramundi site, but the siting study will no doubt provide some recommendation with regard to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps one day we will ultimately see what will prove to be one of the most exciting and innovative modern museums this country has ever seen. It will truly be a museum that not only we in Canberra, in the nation's capital, will be proud of but also every Australian will be proud of and hopefully visit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 4 o'clock this afternoon in Melbourne, Training Unionists for the Future was launched by the Hon. Clyde Cameron, who is a former Minister for Labour, a former Minister for Immigration and a former Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs in the Whitlam Labor government from 1972 to 1975. He was crucial to the setting up of the Trade Union Training Authority and, unfortunately, may I say, that initiative has now been frustrated. Nonetheless, there is a need for people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4817"> who are members of unions and who are interested in seeing unionists and workers have an ability to cope in the workplace to be encouraged, and that is the purpose of the training unionists for the future scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This scheme has been set up by the Victorian Trades Hall Council. The secretary of that council, Mr Leigh Hubbard, is the person who took over from Mr John Halfpenny and has done very good work since he came into office. This latest venture is certainly amongst the best that he has undertaken. The person who has done much of the work in getting the actual nuts and bolts together is Mr Greg McConville. I think it is an appropriate time to go through some of the work this organisation will perform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will get under way and start teaching people in January next year. It is interesting to see the topics this particular program will deal with.

The courses this body will run will include grievance and disciplinary procedures; communication strategies for unionists; media skills; compensation and rehabilitation; working together&mdash;organising and recruitment in the workplace; and, records management for union offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I go through the list of subjects this institution will be dealing with, I can see that it is very comprehensive and very essential. A fee will be charged for the various courses, but it is an initiative that is funded completely by the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Education gained through this organisation's proposed initiative will enable workers' representatives to have the same abilities and conduct themselves in an equally skilled way as those with whom they will be negotiating&mdash;the employers and their representatives. It is a most essential initiative because, when the new industrial legislation we have been discussing today has been passed&mdash;as now seems inevitable, there being agreement between the coalition and the Democrats&mdash;there will be a crucial need for people to be able to handle themselves well in negotiations and for unions to be on equal terms with those they will be negotiating with.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator O'Chee raises a very good point when he says that he hopes they will not put some very good barristers out of work. I do not think they will, Senator O'Chee. I think there will still be great scope for litigation when this legislation has been enacted. I think it will be very productive of litigation and there will be plenty of work for lawyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular scheme is aimed at something different: it is aimed at enabling those who are actually in the workplace to be able to stand their ground, to be able to negotiate and to be able to understand the quite complicated negotiations they will have to go through. No doubt the various relevant unions themselves will help them in that, but there will be great need for people to be able to cope with the situation with which they will be faced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must confess that it has been exciting to see the Australian union movement&mdash;and particularly through that part of the movement in my own state connected with the Victorian Trades Hall Council and its secretary which I will always think of as the best part of the Australian union movement&mdash;move so rapidly into an area where it needs to go. It shows an ability to cope with problems as they start to become real and gather weight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps it is only fair for me to say that a lot of the training and lessons that will be given will be based on the curriculum developed by the Trade Union Training Authority and by the Australian Committee for Training Curriculum. I think it only proper and right that I acknowledge the contribution that those two organisations have made to the programs put forward by the Training Unionists for the Future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that this opening took place in the executive room of the Victorian Trades Hall Council in Victoria Street, Carlton. That is a quite magnificent building, a building set up by workers that symbolises the dignity, confidence and `forward&hyphen;lookingness'&mdash;if I can use that expression&mdash;of workers in the last century and into this one. I invite Senator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4818"> O'Chee, if he is down that way, to go and see the restoration work that has been done in that building which brings to life the history of the workers movement in Victoria.</PARA>

The launching of this project shows, as does that building, that the movement has a great future&mdash;particularly when you get people like Mr Hubbard and those who run the Victorian Trades Hall Council initiating projects like this and carrying them through with the `panache', which I think is the proper word, that they have on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity of the adjournment tonight to refer to the debate we had earlier today on what was meant to be a bipartisan motion on racial tolerance and equality, a motion that we do all support and a very clear and strong statement of the parliament's position. But I want to express my profound disappointment with the remarks made by Senator Bob Collins in the debate on this statement. I thought he made what can only be described as a distasteful, unhappy and unnecessary contribution to that debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion was drawn up in a bipartisan fashion by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) in the House of Representatives. It was aimed at achieving and expressing the support of the whole parliament for racial tolerance, equality, a non-discriminatory immigration policy and a reaffirmation of our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position on reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians. Instead, we had Senator Bob Collins using the whole of his 20&hyphen;minute contribution to the debate not to advocate and uphold those worthy values but to attack the Prime Minister  (Mr Howard) of this country in an appalling, ugly and party political manner which I thought brought no credit to himself, the motion or this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great pity that people like, in this case, Senator Bob Collins cannot help themselves. Any opportunity to exercise a party political position seems to be too attractive. In his attribution of very cynical and populist motives to the Prime Minister, I thought he was disgraceful in the way that he attacked him. It was nothing more than a personal attack on the character of the Prime Minister. Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to make a statesmanlike statement on the important values that maintain this nation cohesively, he instead attacked the Prime Minister personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seemed to be that Senator Collins was insisting, by his personal attacks on the Prime Minister, that the Prime Minister should be personally attacking Pauline Hanson. Of course, that is what the media seems to be demanding&mdash;that none of us should stand up without attacking Mrs Hanson personally. I have heard the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) do just that in radio interviews&mdash;attack the very character of Mrs Hanson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take advantage of this opportunity tonight to say that this is becoming an ugly feature of public policy debate in this country. I do not want to get party political, but it must be said that the former Prime Minister encouraged this particular feature of Australian debate&mdash;you do not talk about the merits of issues, the merits of proposals put forward by your opponents, but you personally attack them. You attack their character, you attack their motives, you attribute false motives to them in any way you can. Public debate in this country is far less civilised in that sense than it ought to be in terms of contributing to the sensible debate of public policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said that I am disappointed that Senator Collins, for whom I have said before <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4819"> I generally have some regard, has chosen to use this debate to personally attack the Prime Minister in this way rather than deal with the merits of the issues before us. In fact, it is part of the whole hysteria that has been whipped up by the media and others over this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to refer briefly to what Mrs Hanson actually said, and what has, I guess, generated this debate and the motion today. The feature of her speech that has drawn most attention is this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immigration must be halted in the short term so that our dole queues are not added to by, in many cases, unskilled migrants not fluent in the English language.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be the guts of Mrs Hanson's speech that has caused the most anxiety and concern in the community, and those statements were obviously inaccurate, insensitive and uncalled for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make is that the Prime Minister has repeatedly and often stated, as a consequence of that speech, and subsequent to that speech, the government's position in relation to the issues raised by Mrs Hanson. He has dealt with the merits of the issues raised by her and the policy proposals put forward by her, and he has refrained from personal attacks on her. He has repeatedly stated the government's position on immigration: we are committed to an immigration program based on non-discrimination on the grounds of race. He has said that over and over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has repeatedly stated this government's commitment to tolerance and equality regardless of race or the colour of one's skin. He has rejected her views on Aboriginal Australians. He has acknowledged their particular disadvantage and this government's commitment to dealing with that particular disadvantage. That is why I was disappointed with what Senator Collins said. He attributed false <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> motives to the Prime Minister and then ignored the fact that the Prime Minister has dealt with the issues raised by Mrs Hanson in her speech. He did not, as I said, attack her personally, which seems to be what Senator Collins wants the Prime Minister to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not quite sure what Senator Collins wants the Prime Minister to do. Does he want the Prime Minister to order that Mrs Hanson be locked up or something? He has dealt with the issues raised by her in a matter of fact way. He could not have done more to repeat the government's position on the issues raised by her&mdash;this government is committed to non-discriminatory immigration policy. He has dealt with those issues raised by Mrs Hanson with great dignity, with great responsibility as the leader of this whole nation. I am sorry that Senator Collins in his contribution did nothing more than play party politics with a very important issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both parties had worked together to draw up this statement and make it a bipartisan statement. Instead, Senator Collins used his opportunity to speak to just attack the Prime Minister for what he has allegedly not done or what his alleged motives are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins also seemed to attack the Prime Minister because he acknowledged that a lot of Australians agreed with Mrs Hanson. So Senator Collins seems to want the government to also deny reality as well as personally attack Mrs Hanson. The fact is, like it or not, many Australians do agree with many of the policies advocated by Mrs Hanson. That is a fact of life, whether we like it or not. Newspoll found that 71 per cent of Australians now want lower immigration. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> today says that 66 per cent want to stop immigration in the short term, and 51 per cent agree that Aborigines should get no special advantages. The Prime Minister has been attacked for simply acknowledging the reality that those are the opinions of a lot of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The paradox is that much of the state of public opinion in this country, which presumably Senator Collins does not like, can be attributed, in part, to the 13 years of Labor rule that we had in this country. The Labor Party's policies over that period&mdash;which were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4820"> roundly attacked by one of its own ministers, Peter Walsh, in his very good book&mdash;were an out of control immigration program, a roller-coaster immigration program, massive unemployment and vicious government attacks on anyone who criticised any of the former government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to draw attention to a very good article by Professor Marilyn Lake, a professor of history at La Trobe University, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That resentful workers, employed, self-employed or unemployed, erroneously blame Asian migrants, Aborigines and welfare recipients for their reduced circumstances simply highlights Labor's failure to provide alternative explanations, to come up with different ideas about how we came to be in the state that we're in and how we might move on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politics is about securing the electorate's identification as well as promoting ideas. Is the Labor Party capable of meeting the challenge?</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid to say, as someone who has quite honestly respected Senator Collins in the past, that his contribution today, which I thought sullied what is otherwise a good bipartisan motion on these issues, represents the fact that the Labor Party apparently is not capable of meeting the challenge which Professor Lake has described in her very good article, which I think all Labor supporters and members ought to read because it sets out very clearly the great dilemma facing the Labor Party after its 13 years of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all deplore the fact that so many Australians seem to agree with much of what Ms Hanson has said, but we must deal with that reality. It will serve this parliament no good if we pretend to ignore that reality or deal with this issue on the basis of personal attacks. Let us deal with the merits of the arguments and attack the arguments on their merits. I therefore conclude by saying I hope that Senator Collins's contributions will be constructive.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Northern Territory)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Spoken, Senator Minchin, like a true political spin doctor, which of course is what you are. Interestingly enough, I actually came into the Senate this evening to talk about my own experiences and the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian Labor Party's experiences in the Northern Territory with the firm DDB Needham.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about personal attacks, Senator. Well, I suggest you listen in the next five minutes to what I have to say. We all know your associations with that company. Having sat here for a couple of minutes listening to your pious platitudes about how horrible it is to make personal attacks, knowing your association with DDB Needham and knowing the job they did on a Labor colleague of mine in the Northern Territory, which was one of the lowest political campaigns that I have ever seen in 20 years, I give all of your comments the weight they deserve&mdash;that is, nothing at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last two months this country's leader has adopted a two bob each way approach on this vital national issue&mdash;and Senator Minchin knows that those charges are fully made out. He was having two bob each way right up until yesterday&mdash;indeed today, as I said in debate earlier this evening. There were the subtle changes of wording in 24 hours. Yesterday he said what a dreadful thing it was that teachers were telling our school children that we had a racist and bigoted past. Today, with a single word addition, he totally changed the meaning of the script: he now says he rejects that we have had a `totally racist and bigoted past'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the slippery slope that the Prime Minister has been tracking us down over the last two months. He has been doing it deliberately, Senator Minchin, and you know it&mdash;trying to appease both sides of the argument and to give comfort to both sides of the argument because his research is telling him that it is a popular view at the moment. It is a high price to pay, in my view, for a bit of populist domestic politics, because that is what it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all the words that were uttered today and all the press analysis, this entire debate for me was summed up by Alan Moir's brilliant cartoon in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. This is an award winner if there is any justice in cartoon awards. In a few square inches, in one picture, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> cartoonist today summed up this <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4821"> debate better than all the words and all the speeches that have been uttered today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cartoon shows the Prime Minister with a speech in his hand, striking four different poses, and uttering the words: `I may not agree with what you say .. but I'll fight to the death for my right to be opportunistic.' That is it precisely: nailed to the mast&mdash;game, set and match. That one simple picture sums up the entire debate better than all the speeches that were delivered today and in the last two months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise in the adjournment tonight to say a few words about the government's increasingly shrill attempts to claim that it did not fix the awarding of the $4 million in advertising contracts for the national gun buy&hyphen;back scheme to ensure that they were not awarded on merit, but awarded to companies that were owned by their mates. That is another case that has been fundamentally made out in these last few weeks by Senator Ray in Senate estimates committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me digress just a little. During a recent drive between Canberra and Melbourne, an acquaintance of mine made a diversion to a small town in the Murray Valley. He stopped in to see the lessee of one of the local hotels, a bloke called Terry Smith. In a previous life, Terry Smith was a prominent member of the Australian Labor Party in the Northern Territory. He was a quintessential territorian. He followed me, in fact, as leader of the party in the Northern Territory. He quit politics in 1991, a few months after he became the sole target, as leader of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory, of one of the most personally vicious advertising campaigns in Australian political history, which certainly had an effect on him personally and also on his family&mdash;his wife and children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never seen a campaign like it. There is no getting away from&mdash;as tough as we all like to pretend we are&mdash;the extent to which he was personally attacked during at that campaign. Those responsible for that election campaign were the now Prime Minister's chief political adviser, Grahame Morris and the principals of DDB Needham, John King and Toby Ralph. An extraordinary interview with Toby Ralph in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which I have quoted in this chamber before, said it all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ralph claimed, probably rightly, not only credit for the viciously personal campaign that denigrated Terry Smith&mdash;not the Labor Party, Senator Minchin, not policies, not issues of substance, but Terry Smith. It sent up his moustache, sent up his personal appearance and portrayed him as an effeminate person by calling him Terrence instead of Terry. It was a vicious campaign, and the only campaign they ran. Not only did Toby Ralph claim credit for it; he also claimed credit, probably rightly, for the advertising agency actually setting the date of the election itself rather than the Northern Territory government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He told the newspaper, boasting about it, that the campaign, which was held in October 1991, was planned in mid&hyphen;September when:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John King, Toby Ralph and federal secretariat staffer Grahame Morris went to Darwin to recommend an election date and strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>After two days of intense debate, this group, that is, Morris, King and Ralph, decided on an election date for the Northern Territory of 27 October. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The first part of our negative strategy was a vicious attack on the Labor leader Terry Smith," Ralph says.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a quote from Ralph himself&mdash;a vicious attack on the Labor leader, Terry Smith. Senator Minchin, these are your friends&mdash;the ones you were just talking about that should not mount personal attacks on people. I quote Mr Ralph again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We wanted to position him as a knocker. This would make it difficult for him to attack us and force him to run an ineffective positive campaign&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same article, Ralph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We called him Terrence&mdash;not Terry&mdash;because it sounded more contrived and effeminate and very unterritorian . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This strategy was reinforced with saturation TV ads which featured an incredibly distorted head and shoulder shot of Terry Smith, now Terrence Smith, caught in a graphic similar to those red warning signals of `no smoking' signs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In every single interview and in every single personal interaction that Terry Smith then had with government members&mdash;this is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4822"> in the chamber of the parliament&mdash;members who had called him Terry for 20 years now called him Terrence. They called him Terrence for the whole time the campaign went on, even to his face in the chamber. It was absolutely personally sickening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The campaign was totally alien to Australian political culture. It was the first time I had ever seen a classic American negative campaign in my life&mdash;I hope I never see another one. It was lifted straight from the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When word of the article reached the territory&mdash;that is the boasting about them destroying Terry Smith as a person and choosing the date for the election&mdash;Ralph was immediately dubbed the `mouth from the south' in the Northern Territory. When you look at some of the things that he has said since, you would have to agree&mdash;for example, his comments after the recent federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ralph, one of the four members of the Liberal advertising team, was one of a number of people who spoke at a post-election symposium held by the Melbourne&hyphen;based Centre for Corporate Public Affairs on 15 April. One paragraph of his illusive contribution to this symposium is on page 321 of Michael Gordon's recent update on his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A True Believer</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Andrew sort of got rid of the gentlemen farmers who had been hanging around the halls for a long time and put in a pretty professional bunch of dispassionate, almost mercenaries if you like, people you wouldn't like to meet down a dark alley at night . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are your friends, Senator Minchin. I take great heart from the fact that this trio of political hatchet men are now in the gun themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the first time they have been embroiled in controversy over guns and advertising. There are those of us who recall the reaction to the Liberal Party's sniper TV ads during the 1993 federal election campaign showing Australians on TV screens in the gun sights&mdash;the crosshairs of a gun&mdash;of unemployment. Do you remember those ads, Senator Minchin?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ad used the image of a sniper focusing on individuals caught in the crosshairs of a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> telescopic rifle waiting to be shot while a deep male voice asked who would be next. The ads caused an absolute storm, with the Coalition for Gun Control issuing press statements calling for them to be withdrawn because they encouraged gun violence, which they did. They were appalling advertisements. Their spokesperson, Rebecca Peters, said the ads were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a cynical exploitation of the tragic gun violence problem in this country. More than once a week an Australian is murdered with a gun.</PARA>
<PARA>The then ALP national secretary, Bob Hogg, said that he would rather give the game away than run ads like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the Liberal Party say? The then Deputy Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Grahame Morris, told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> on 14 February of that year that the few complaints the party had received about the ads were `mild by political standards'. It is paradoxical that this same trio have been chosen by this government to put together an advertising campaign to encourage gun owners to comply with the buyback.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak again on the subject of education and on the statements the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, made today on the subject of literacy. Obviously, the minister has not felt the need to modify his inaccurate and his damaging comments made over the past week about&mdash;to put it in his own words&mdash;`the need for tough new accountability measures to improve literacy levels in our schools'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On Radio National this morning, the author of the study on which the minister so liberally draws was asked how he felt when he picked up the paper and found headlines about all the year 9 students who could not read. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, I am surprised at the various interpretations that are placed on these things. That not achieving a mastery level of literacy becomes can't read and so on. I mean people are entitled to place their own interpretations on data but I think some of those interpretations weren't the ones we would have made.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4823"> </PARA>
<PARA>Generous remarks I would say, given that we are talking about the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Later on in the interview, the minister was asked why it was that he bothered to draw from this longitudinal study when we are right in the middle of the first ever detailed, expensive&mdash;$3 million&mdash;targeted national English literacy survey to be carried out in Australia. He was asked, `Why not just wait for those fresh results?' Why not, indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we know the answer. It is because the minister chose to be selective and he did so because it suited his political purposes. Denigrate the education system, denigrate teachers and frighten parents into taking their children out of state schools so that they can pay fees for their children to be sent to private schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was the minister's answer? It is a very long answer and I will not bore the Senate with the full text. I am happy to provide any senator with a full transcript if they are interested. We need to remember that this is a question about why the minister chose to use an inappropriate, incomplete study ranging over 20 years on the transition of young people from school to work rather than a study which is under way and which is designed to give the minister the data he needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interviewer, Jane Figgins, also pointed out that the results of the study to be completed next year could not be sheeted home to schools or even to sectors of schools. The minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I was calling for was much more information to parents by individual schools about their performance. Parents are ringing schools and asking school principals long lists of questions about the school in order to make that choice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of course, the minister does not make clear what choice he is referring to, but I can imagine that he means the choice between the public and the private sectors&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but the information is not available to them.</PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was suggesting that that would be a very important kind of information that should be out there in the public and I'm not thinking of any simplistic measures in this regard, I think obviously some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> schools start with an advantage because a lot of their students come from highly literate households, on the other hand a number of schools are drawing students from families that don't have English as a first language or who suffer some other educational disadvantage. What parents want to know is not so much the starting point but whether the school is able to add value.</PARA>
<PARA>I get the feeling here that the minister is confusing our children with products and industry when he talks about adding value. However, Jane Figgins on Radio National again tries to get the minister to address the question of what the government wants to achieve. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have thought that being consistent with what you are saying is that you would really look for some absolute standards and, no matter what background a child came from, it would be unacceptable if they did not reach those standards.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think as a community of course we aim to do that, we aim to have every child literate and we will be seeking out of the National English Literacy Survey to set national standards for literacy for years 3 and 5. We need to make sure that teachers have available to them a way of assessing their entrance into grade one so that they can identify those students who have already achieved a good level of literacy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>a good level of literacy, I ask the minister, in grade 1?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and those who are going to need particular attention. We will need to look at the curriculum and say, `Does it allow sufficient time for students to gain literacy skills?' </PARA>
<PARA>I will not repeat the remarks which I made here yesterday about the absurdity of such simplistic approaches to solving problems associated with literacy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister told us today that there is research which suggests that there are many students who simply do not find the time in the curriculum, and that many teachers are frustrated at the moment because of the amount that they are being asked to do. I would like to suggest to the minister that one way of dealing with this would be to see that class sizes are reduced so that teachers can spend more time with individual students. As a teacher, I can assure the minister that there is a far better chance of being able to deal with literacy in all its facets with a class of 20 children than one with 25 or 30. I remind the minister that in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4824"> my home state of Victoria the state government has actually increased class sizes and reduced support services for teachers. The minister also needs to be reminded that teachers often cope with composite classes of two and three levels in which the literacy achievements of students are highly varied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter I want to address is the question of broadbanding and literacy. As the Senate will be aware, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996, which is before the Senate committee, includes a proposal by the government to do what is called broadbanding for government programs. This involves reducing the number of programs of targeted assistance from more than 40 to just five. One of these is literacy. These 40&hyphen;odd targeted assistance programs did just that: they targeted assistance to those students who were most disadvantaged, educationally and socially. They acknowledged the direct relationship between social and economic circumstances and education outcomes. They were a genuine attempt to introduce some across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board equity into primary and secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Literacy may well be one of the five priority areas under the government's broadbanding proposals, but it is not going to deliver real improvements in literacy in the absence of a solid commitment to equity and to reducing disadvantage. You will notice that Minister Kemp never mentions that word `equity'. Perhaps it has become a dirty word. In any case, it seems to have disappeared in relation to education. The government, it seems to me, is saying that if it lets parents know the truth, if the government develops a policy and if we get literacy programs in place, then it is all just a matter of students knuckling down and getting on with it and&mdash;hey, presto!&mdash;every student will magically be able to master literacy or learn to read; we are not sure which the minister is aiming for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Disregard the circumstances of those students' lives, disregard their cultural backgrounds, disregard the standard of equipment, the class sizes, and all those other factors which impact on a child's ability to achieve standards of literacy. We all know that this is simplistic arrogant nonsense. An education <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system that fails to acknowledge the connection between socioeconomic status and school outcomes is a system which will fail many, if not all, of those disadvantaged students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take the STAR program, for example. That program assisted schools to identify students most at risk of not completing secondary school, and it encouraged their participation through a range of school based projects. Because of the sorts of students involved in these programs, many STAR projects actually focused on basic literacy and numeracy skills in combination with addressing the health, housing and other needs of students. In short, STAR did not just try to get students reading and writing in isolation and it did not simply give them more English classes instead of sport; it took those problems in context and it recognised that poor literacy and numeracy skills were a consequence&mdash;and an exacerbation, I might say&mdash;of those other social and economic problems. I remind the Senate that STAR has, of course, been abolished by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the words of Joan Brown, the Director of the Australian Centre for Equity Through Education:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nowhere in the government's new programs is there recognition that students are coming to school with complex social and health problems that schools and teachers are not trained or resourced to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA>I urge the minister, for the sake of Australian children, to start to listen to what educators are saying instead of alarming people with his predictably simplistic phrases about information not being available to parents, about competition and choice&mdash;whatever those words mean&mdash;in the context of an education system serving 70 per cent of Australian children, and in the context of the many students who, in some way, are less advantaged than others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By failing to explicitly address equity issues, the minister's broadbanding effectively ends any federal government commitment to nationally target those students and communities most in need.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) $2.8 million has been allocated by CSIRO for research into fertility control of feral species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD) has already been declared a biological control agent.

These effects will be taken into account, in decisions on the proposed mode, design and strategic use of any immunosterilising agent or organism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) CSIRO is committed to the conduct of research for the benefit of all Australians. Its animal based research includes research in support <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the domesticated livestock industries, research to provide a basis for the management of native and introduced fauna, research directed at a better understanding of human nutritional and nutritionally&hyphen;related pharmacological needs and research for the enhancement of non&hyphen;human animal well&hyphen;being.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO does not separately account for the funding of its research involving invasive procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Wherever possible, CSIRO uses alternatives to the use of non&hyphen;human animals for the conduct of research. It does so for animal welfare reasons and for reasons of cost; alternative procedures, when available, are usually cheaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO's Animal Experimentation Committees (AECs) are set up under the terms of the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, a code to which CSIRO is a signatory.
