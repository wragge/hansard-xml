<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1996 No. 144.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations commence generally with retrospectivity of more than 10 months from gazettal. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on the apparent delay in making the Regulations, which, the Explanatory Statement advises, provide for obligations under an agreement signed on 21 September 1993 and which entered into force on 31 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations properly provide that any immunity from suit conferred by the Regulations commences on gazettal. However, r. 5 provides for retrospective rights which apparently include the right to sue. This retrospectivity would benefit the SPREP but would appear to prejudice anyone being sued. The Committee would appreciate your comments on the validity of this provision and, if valid, whether it is appropriate to prejudice people in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations provide for other retrospective privileges and immunities. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether any person could have been prejudiced by this retrospectivity.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator O'Chee</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 13 August 1996 regarding questions of retrospectivity of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (Privileges and Immunities) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1996 No. 144 ("the Regulations").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Regulations was to do no more than restore the status quo ante to SPREP, and my Department's drafting instructions to the Attorney-General's Department were explicit in this regard. SPREP was a program of the South Pacific Commission (SPC) and until 31 August 1995, on which date SPREP became an autonomous organisation when the requisite tenth ratification of the Agreement Establishing SPREP was lodged, it enjoyed the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the SPC. Technically, when SPREP achieved autonomy it lost those privileges and immunities, hence the need for their restoration. With specific reference to the question of retrospectivity, the Attorney-General's Department confirmed the acceptability of such a provision in all respects other than immunity from suit, on the basis that only the Commonwealth itself (in respect of tax) should in practice be prejudiced by the retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, I note that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a. there was no activity in Australia by SPREP or its staff between 31 August 1995 and gazettal of the Regulations, hence there is no possibility of prejudice to third persons; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b. a "retrospective right to sue" is meaningless in practice as SPREP could not have sued anyone before gazettal of the Regulations; while it is true that SPREP could now sue on a cause of action that accrued between 31 August 1995 and gazettal, it is difficult to see how there could be any prejudice in this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of expansion of this last point, I might add that if SPREP were not able to sue on a cause of action that accrued in that time (between 31 August 1995 and gazettal), this would in effect confer an immunity on any person who had done SPREP a civil wrong. It would not be desirable for any person to escape liability for such a wrong merely because SPREP was not a legal entity at the time. In any event, while ever SPREP was not a legal entity, the wrong would have been suffered instead by some natural person who could have sued in his/her own name even before gazettal of the Regulations.</PARA>

<PARA>In my remarks, I will attempt to answer Senator Harradine's concerns. This is not an attempt to have a long debate on this particular motion. But, Senator Harradine, because so many things in the reconciliation debate happen in the other place, we do not have a contemporary opportunity very often to address it. I am seeking only five minutes now to answer the continuing, festering racist comments that I think we see all around us on a daily basis. That is all I am seeking to do.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5138">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we passed our so&hyphen;called bipartisan joint house motion last week, you can see the continuation of comments and the continuation of incidents which need to be commented on. They need to be remarked upon. It is not enough for members of parliament, in good faith, to pass a resolution which is full of rhetoric and pretty empty on action. Since that resolution was passed last week, we have seen the incident in Townsville. We have seen the distortion in the reporting of the incident in Townsville by the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I believe this chamber has just as much right to comment on that matter as does the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also heard this morning and seen in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> comments about the Chair of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, and inferences that there is something wrong with her earning a salary level equal to a departmental head. The simple point I want to repeat is that we passed a bipartisan motion. That motion says, in part, that we reaffirm our commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might think that is the end of it because we said we reaffirm our commitment. These were the fine words at a luncheon in May this year and in a bipartisan joint house resolution last week. But what is going on out there in the community in terms of racist comments, community division and alienation are things that are continuing. That is why I wanted the Senate to have a few minutes today not to let it pass without comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take huge exception to somebody like Alan Jones editorialising on Lois O'Donoghue's right to earn a salary that is equal to that of a departmental head. The clear inference was: she is an Aboriginal woman; how could she possibly be worthy of this level of salary? We politicians have to speak up. I am taking that opportunity to speak up and to tell Alan Jones, and all the rest of those who are ill informed, who might be listening and who have no access to the information, that that salary is set by the Remuneration Tribunal&mdash;as are our salaries.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lois O'Donoghue does not have a right to representation in terms of going in there and saying, `My salary is not enough.' This is a departmental head equivalent. I think it is objectionable that we have made this commitment to reconciliation and we allow comments like this to go unremarked upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make two other points. You cannot make a commitment to the process of reconciliation and you cannot talk about redressing profound social and economic disadvantage when, at the same time, you reduce the budget of the Council for Reconciliation, whose job it is to bring together indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians. It is a huge task&mdash;just leading to a greater understanding about the true history of this country, about the significance of land and sea to indigenous Australians. You cannot have this commitment and, at the same time, reduce the running costs of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation by 30 per cent and take $400 million out of the budget of ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the points I want to make. We have passed a resolution; it is not enough. We might have felt good about it on the day; it is not enough. We, as politicians, have to stand up every time somebody out there continues this ill&hyphen;informed, bigoted campaign aided and abetted by the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Senate has a small role to play in this debate as well. That is all I wanted to say, Senator Harradine. Because of the uncertainty of what is going to happen on Thursday, I cannot accept that we should have postponed this matter to Thursday. I do not seek to delay the Senate unduly, but I do seek to make those points. Let us not sit here and be complacent about the fact that we have passed a resolution on this. Let us try to match the rhetoric with a bit of action. At the individual level, that action includes speaking up and speaking up every time the misinformation and the bigotry continues.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is time that Senator Kernot stopped playing politics in this important area, opened her eyes and considered the facts. The fact is that this government is committed to increasing spending on indigenous affairs and it is time that Senator Kernot realised and acknowledged that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us deal with the substance of her motion. She calls for a restoration of funding to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The council had a reduction in its forward program estimates from $4.66 million to $3.5 million for 1996-97. The council has also been allowed to roll over $711,000 from 1995-96 to 1996-97, primarily to meet costs associated with the council's Australian reconciliation convention to be held in May next year and coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the 1967 referendum. This means that actual expenditure this year will be $4.195 million higher than the actual expenditure last year of $3.806 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is right Senator Kernot, more will be spent on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation this year than last year. As for overall Commonwealth spending on indigenous  specific programs, I point out that we will be spending more&mdash;$429 million more&mdash;over the next four years than was spent during the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The non&hyphen;government parties fail to comprehend that there is a new government in office. They fail to comprehend that the policies of the last 13 years have proven to be an unqualified failure. They fail to comprehend that this government will not play the politically <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> correct game if it means that Aboriginal people on the ground in remote communities continue to miss out. They fail to comprehend that this government is about achieving real outcomes for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 300,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia, and less than 100,000 of those are adults. In the past 12 years, over $12 billion has been spent on indigenous specific programs. Despite that, indigenous Australians still have an infant moratality rate two to three times that of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians, a life expectancy rate up to 18 years less than for non&hyphen;indigenous Australians, an adult diabetes rate that runs at four times the rate for non&hyphen;indigenous Australians and falling education standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those opposite would have us continue the same failed policies. Instead, we have embarked on policies that will deliver real outcomes. Despite the savings that we have made within the ATSIC budget, during the next four years the Commonwealth will spend in today's dollar terms $429 million more on indigenous specific programs than during the last four years. During the next four years we will spend an additional $97 million on indigenous health, an additional $26 million on the community housing and infrastructure program, an additional $337 million on the community development employment program and an additional $147 million on Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs run indigenous education and training programs. For all these reasons we oppose Senator Kernot's motion.</PARA>

There are racial overtones in quite a number of Alan Jones's comments. This is not the first time that this has occurred. It is a disgrace. I think that the radio station has some responsibility in this matter, as has Channel Nine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On another occasion, on 13 September this year, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS> show Mr Alan Jones took a sideswipe at three Chinese women who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5140"> were seeking asylum and refugee status. His slur was against three Chinese women who were seeking refugee status due to their well-founded fear of persecution if forcibly returned to the PRC. Mr Jones claimed that the basis of their application was that these women wanted to have more than one child. He painted a picture of millions of people coming down from China to flood this country if their application was agreed to. Bear in mind what he said&mdash;that these women want to have more than one child. If Mr Jones had done even a tiny amount of research he would have learnt that having more children is impossible for these women, all of whom were sterilised by the PRC and one of whom had her baby forcibly taken out of her womb at 7&half; months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you think those people feel? How do you think the people who represent them feel? How do you think they feel in the detention centres? Alan Jones, how do you think they feel? How do you think Lois O'Donohue feels? How do you think the Aboriginals, whom she represents and serves extremely well, feel? It is time that the television stations like Channel Nine acted responsibility in this so-called racism debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is a racism debate going on. There are certain allegations by xenophobic twits, but there is very little serious discussions about these matters. The joint resolution of 30 October that is before us states in part:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard from Senator Troeth. I accept her defence of the government, but the reality is, Senator Troeth, that the government has downgraded the position of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. It has done this in financial terms. It has justified it on the basis of treating everybody equally and that, if there have to be cuts in other areas of government expenditure, then why not for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation? But we do not treat everybody equally. There were no cuts to the defence budget; there were no cuts to a number of other areas of the budget.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why single out an area of significant importance to this nation: the question of reconciliation with indigenous people?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to comment on Senator Dee Margetts's contribution and acknowledge that there are indigenous peoples who do not accept reconciliation, partly because the focus has been on Aboriginal reconciliation. Senator Kernot and a number of other senators and I know that it is not a question so much of Aboriginal reconciliation. It is a question of non&hyphen;indigenous Australians recognising indigenous people, recognising their culture and history and coming to terms to with our past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this motion. In doing so, I would just like to refer to a couple of articles in today's press. You can find on almost a daily basis in the press around Australia an indication of the need for a process of reconciliation in which facts can be put before the Australian people rather than the fiction which is constantly peddled. This never ceases to be important. I am talking about a story from the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>  that all honourable senators will find in today's Senate clips and it is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS>  and various other papers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because Senator Alston is in the chamber at the moment, I might just mention in respect to these stories&mdash;they are, of course, all written by the same journalist&mdash;the constant concern in Australia with the concentration of media ownership in this country. I got some real evidence the other day of the difficulties that are caused by our unfortunately bad situation in Australia with concentration of ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I received a letter that had been circulated, I presume to all members of parliament from <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> News Ltd, extolling the virtues of new arrangements that they had just entered into that would provide nomination of a number of specialist journalists to particular areas of reporting which would result in a better quality, more accurate, and so on, news service for Australians. They pointed out&mdash;it made my hair stand up to see it in black and white&mdash;that this one organisation, News Ltd, is responsible for `70 per cent of the print media which Australians read on a daily basis'. That attracted my attention, and I am sure Senator Alston got a copy of the same letter as we all did. The letter was simply advising us of these new arrangements and boasting about the fact that News Ltd had 70 per cent of the coverage of the morning news that Australians sit down and read.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very good thing if all the stories that News Ltd prints are accurate. But it is very disturbing when you discover gross inaccuracies in stories written about Aboriginal affairs&mdash;I have pointed out some of these in earlier debate in this chamber&mdash;knowing that those stories are simultaneously being read by 70 per cent of Australians that are reading morning newspapers. That places a significant responsibility on the people who enjoy this kind of monopoly in this country to ensure that their coverage is not in any way biased and is accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this respect, I see in today's papers a banner headline that reads `ATSIC bosses' windfall'. It talks about pay rises that have been received by executives of ATSIC. This often happens in newspaper reports. If I had to list one significant whinge about newspapers in 20 years in public life, misleading headlines would be at the top of the list. When you read the body of the report, it accurately points out that the ATSIC bosses' windfall is precisely the same windfall that every other public servant in a similar position received across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also points out accurately that these remuneration levels are set across all government departments by the Remuneration Tribunal. This is all carried in the body of the story itself. It also points out&mdash;and I was intrigued to see this&mdash;that the ATSIC bosses get more than their minister. Well, hold the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5142"> front page! Hold the back page, more like. In my seven years as a minister in all the portfolios that I was in, I was never in a position where I earned as much as any one of the people who were in fact employed in statutory authorities responsible to me. In fact, I can recall that the chief executive of the smallest organisation for which I had carriage&mdash;and it is a very small organisation and there is no need to name it&mdash;was then earning $180,000 a year, which was commensurate with the same positions held by executives in other statutory authorities. In fact, that was about double what I then earned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out that that is a commonplace situation, because the fact is that most of us are not in it for the money. We are in it for other things and job satisfaction has a lot to do with it. It is commonplace for statutory officers in every single statutory authority that a minister is responsible for to be earning significantly more than the minister. So what? But this is highlighted as some dreadful crime being committed by ATSIC and that it is uniquely ATSIC bosses' windfall. It then goes on to talk about Pat Turner and I found this grossly offensive in personal terms. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC's latest annual report reveals the chief executive, Ms Patricia Turner, a niece of former ATSIC deputy chairman Mr Charles Perkins, tops the payroll.</PARA>
<PARA>On this occasion that is an absolutely clear and sleazy inference in that paragraph that Pat Turner got that job because of preferment, nepotism and her relationship with Charles Perkins.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) would be the first one to agree with me on this, but anyone who even knows Patricia Turner slightly&mdash;and perhaps you could ask some of the people she worked with when she worked for Prime Minister and Cabinet in an equally senior position&mdash;knows full well that Pat Turner got that job purely on personal merit and nothing else. In fact I know that Pat Turner was approached on many occasions over a period of years to take the chief executive's position at ATSIC and declined to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do so because she deliberately wanted to broaden her experience in other Commonwealth government departments. In fact, she is a public servant of significant ability and has got her position, as everyone who knows her knows, through nothing else except her own ability.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were talking earlier in the session about leadership being required on these things in order to get the correct picture through to Australians and about the role the Prime Minister has played in that with his comments for example about the `Aboriginal industry'. I was profoundly disheartened when I heard the Prime Minister say it. As I pointed out at the time, the only two people of whom I was aware who had used that totally pejorative expression `Aboriginal industry' in the last several years were the honourable member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, who used it in a column she wrote to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, and the Prime Minister of Australia.</PARA>

The Prime Minister made <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5143"> public statements in respect of the honourable member for Oxley's contribution about Australia being overrun by Asians and so on. To quote the Prime Minister again, he said that many of the things she said were `an accurate reflection of what people feel'&mdash;that is people generally, all people&mdash;and I rejected that. Comments were made at the time correctly that, where the Prime Minister has failed in this debate, is that he has been talking in code and that is a fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was reminded of a biography I read years ago on a very well known character in terms of race debates in the United States, and that was the former Governor of Alabama, George Wallace. It triggered a memory for me and I have just finished re&hyphen;reading the biography. It is a fascinating biography. There is a particular section of the biography that I recall from years ago which just nails this stuff down. Everyone knows what they are talking about. This book is written by a southern journalist called Marshall Frady.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What prompted this memory was an absolutely superb television production broadcast by the ABC in Australia last week on the American presidential election and Dole and Clinton. It was heartening to see that kind of in&hyphen;depth, quality television being produced once again by the public television organisations in the United States. They are the same organisations which produced that magnificent civil war series. If honourable senators did not see the Dole/Clinton production last week that I am talking about, they should do themselves a favour and have a look at it. It was superb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the journalists that was a commentator in that program was indeed the same Marshall Frady, the author of this biography of Wallace. On page 6 of this biography, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To many he portends the eventual arrival of a final racist psychology&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is George Wallace&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">into American politics. It seems certain that his candidacy can only increase the racial alienation in the country. A moderate Alabama politician declares, "What he's trying to do in the nation is what he's managed to do in Alabama. When you draw the line the way he does, the whites go with the white, and the blacks with the black, and when that happens, you're in for warfare." A former <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Alabama senator echoes, "It's conceivable that he could win a state like Illinois or even California when he puts that hay down where the goats can get at it. He can use all the other issues&mdash;law and order, running your own schools, protecting property rights&mdash;and never mention race. But people will know he's telling them, `A nigger's trying to get your job, trying to move into your neighbourhood.' What Wallace is doing is talking to them in a kind of shorthand, a kind of code.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct. That is what we have seen during these very disturbed several months in Australia, to the great concern of us all. I have seen nothing like it in the 20 years that I have been in public life and it is about time it was put down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for the position he took on this on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to sum up first before you put the motion, Madam Acting Deputy President, whether it is separately or collectively. The Senate should pass parts (a), (b) and (c) of this motion. I am hopeful that when we have the vote on part (b), the majority of the Senate will pass that anyway; but we should pass it for a couple of reasons. We should pass it in the context of the recent resolution of the parliament, particularly the third dot point which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage';</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Troeth says that the government objects to part (b) of my motion and has put before us what she says are facts which support the government's assertions that they are increasing funding for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and that, through various other programs, there is an overall increase in the indigenous issues budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you cut everything by 20 per cent across the board it is very easy then to say, `But next year you are getting an increase.' When you are rolling over something into the next budget it is very easy to say, `You are getting an increase.' The fact of the matter is the budgets were cut by 20 per cent. In the case of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, the cuts have reduced its staff and severely reduced its capacity to carry forward its work for the remainder of its term. That is the reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate should pass this motion because there is a special case to be made for the work of ATSIC and the work of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in furthering this parliament's reaffirmation of its commitment to reconciliation. That is why ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation should have been a special case when budget cuts were being considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, ATSIC and the council are not immune from scrutiny. No&hyphen;one is saying that. This motion is simply saying that you cannot one week pass a resolution saying we reaffirm our commitment, allow yourself to feel good about it and do nothing about the actions which make it possible for that resolution to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason we should pass this motion is that the Senate and the individual members of it should take their opportunity to continue to speak out in the face of the continuing ill&hyphen;informed and racist comments of the member for Oxley and certain media commentators. We have an obligation to do that and I thank those who have taken part in this debate for being willing to take this opportunity to do so.</PARA>

Last week in this parliament there was unanimity for a motion which comprehensively reaffirmed this nation's tolerance, its diversity, its multiculturalism and its sense of a fair go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it was a turning point against the outbreak of racism which followed the first <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speech of Pauline Hanson in the House of Representatives. One can see the impact of that motion by referring to comments from the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Chris Sidoti, on the weekend. He was commenting on the furore that has followed the racist and bigoted statements of Ms Hanson in saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is perhaps a new industry that we are seeing develop in Australia&mdash;the manipulation industry that tries to attract some points of advantage from the misuse of different phrases, different words, to dignify it with the word `debate'. What we have had and what we have experienced in the last few months is a gross misstatement of what has occurred. What has occurred is an outbreak of racism. There has been no fact and no logic in what many of the people who have dragged this so&hyphen;called debate into the community and inflicted on us have had to say.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Pauline Hanson has shown a weakness in compassion. She has shown a failure to relate to others.

And that is what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Prime Minister's failure of leadership, as much as anything, which has led to the need for an urgent call from this Senate for him now to take the tack he should have taken at the outset.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make the position of the opposition absolutely clear on the substantive motion of Senator Brown, No. 311. Last Wednesday, we had a situation in the parliament where both houses of the parliament engaged in what I described as an historic debate. It was a debate on the kind of society we are and the kind of society that we aspire to be: a decent, tolerant, pluralistic society; a society that is free of racism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That debate was a direct response to the divisive and dangerous community reaction to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5147"> the sorts of intolerant views, the stridency and the ignorance of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). In that debate, the motion was passed unanimously by both houses of parliament. It provided national leadership on an issue of vital national importance. I must say that the opposition has clearly said it shares the sentiments that that leadership has been found wanting in the lukewarm and ambivalent responses of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this issue. That debate provided an opportunity, though, for all parties represented in the parliament to express their views on this issue. There was a further opportunity this morning through the vehicle of the motion moved by Senator Kernot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The substantive motion that Senator Brown wants to bring on is one that the Labor Party will support. We do support this substantive motion. But I also want to say this: in this chamber a few moments ago, we saw a trick from Senator Brown, as has been exposed by Senator Hill and Senator Kernot, and a trick from Senator Margetts. Senator Brown, in his substantive motion, asks for formality and Senator Margetts says, `No. I, Senator Margetts'&mdash;Senator Brown's comrade in arms; the other Green senator&mdash;`will not agree to formality.' That, I am afraid, Senator Brown, is just not acceptable practice in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never known a political party in this place to think a motion is of significance but then have that motion formality opposed by a member of the same party. It has not happened from the Labor Party since I have been a member of the Senate; I do not believe it has happened with the coalition; I do not believe it has happened with the Australian Democrats. I want to say to you, Senator Brown: it has never happened before with the Australian Greens. It is a trick. It is a crude parliamentary device that I think you will regret.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it clear to you that we will support absolutely the substantive motion you move. Don't be under any misapprehension about that. But also, Senator Brown, don't come into this chamber and use those sorts of devices, those sorts of tricks, those sorts of abuses of parliamentary privilege and expect a party like the Australian Labor Party, which <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> has always had a fine record of defending proper parliamentary process in this and other chambers, to support it. We will not do that, Senator Brown.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So while I am happy to place on record our strong support for your motion, the sentiments behind your motion and many of the comments you have made in support of your motion, I will not support the use of this sort of device now or on other occasions.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are talking about proper process and about what is and should be the proper process in this Senate, it is about whether or not the device of leading the Senate in one direction in terms of declaring formality in order simply to gag debate is good process. For the purpose of process, to allow a debate to occur which is important is to say that the question is whether this should be without debate or not. That is what the process of formality is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By denying formality, as Senator Harradine did on a previous occasion, it is saying the debate should occur, the people in the Senate should listen to the ideas before we knew what everybody knew, which is that both major parties had various opinions. The government said no; instead of denying debate, you have the process to listen to those debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are talking about process, it is time the government stopped using that device to gag debate and realised that people do have the right to speak on important issues in the Senate. I certainly have different viewpoints on the issue of the handling of the race debate from Senator Brown. People heard my passionate contribution to last week's debate. If you have not read it, I advise people to look at what I said in that debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My viewpoint is that we will never in our community be able to deal with this urgent issue until we look at the means by which a growing number of people in our community are becoming disillusioned. And yes, I also <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe it is absolutely necessary and urgent for the leader of the government in Australia to rebut the misinformation that has been provided to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I may have a different viewpoint from Senator Brown in relation to how that might be done, but I do not think it is proper process to do what the government has been doing in recent times, which has been to gag debate. Quite frankly, this is probably a convenient means by which the opposition can avoid dealing with the issue, by saying, `We are shocked and horrified by the contravention of the process' when they have been involved in complicity in recent weeks in subverting that process themselves in gagging debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if we are going to talk about process, let us go back to the beginning of what motions are about, what formality is about. If I have subverted the process, let us talk about how that process is being subverted at the moment by parties together guaranteeing formality in order simply to gag debate, by saying, `Yes, we agree with formality but no, we won't allow any debate on this issue.' So process is important. Let us talk about process, before we start flinging outrageous arrows, and about what we should be doing in this place to look at rights of speech. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, with due respect to Senator Brown, I would like to say that what he is doing here now is really something that he has been doing for the last three, four or five weeks: in essence, he is trying to jump the queue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a large number of notices of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. What is happening here, as has happened on a number of previous occasions&mdash;through you, Madam Acting Deputy President to Senator Brown&mdash;is that there is a call of formality. On a number of occasions that has been agreed to; on other occasions there has been a call of non&hyphen;formal. But bear in mind that other senators have notices of motion they would like to see dealt with by this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under standing order 66 there is provision, if the notice of motion is called formal, for the notice of motion to be put without debate. Generally that occurs after there has been discussion between people in the chamber and people have been given time to consider the implications of voting on a matter without debate. That is a special procedure that I believe is allowed for under standing orders, but it relies on the goodwill of every one of the 76 senators here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As Senator Hill has indicated, we oppose this return to order as an abuse of process. We believe the opposition is using the process of a return to order just simply to tie up the administration of the government. It says a lot about the opposition's real intentions that they have not sought to indicate quite specifically the documents that they want. The return to order asks for `all records'. This is clearly a fishing expedition. The opposition is hoping to  find documents that would justify their specious claim that there has been some sort of fix in the tendering process, which has been consistently denied by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an indication of our good faith, Senator Hill offered to provide certain documents to the opposition in confidence on the basis that they are commercial documents of those who tendered them. The opposition rejected that offer because it clearly did not serve their purposes. Again to prove good faith, we will comply with the opposition's request under this return to order but do so under protest. However, it would be irresponsible of us to provide documents where to do so would be clearly against well-established precedents of not tabling cabinet documents, legally privileged documents, documents which are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5151"> regarded as being commercial-in-confidence or advice prepared by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as commercial-in-confidence documents are concerned, the government takes the view that it is against the public interest to make public any material that could adversely affect the broader, long-term commercial interests of the tendering companies. Where such information could be deleted without affecting the integrity of documents, I am advised that we have done so. I share Senator Hill's disappointment that the Australian Democrats, Greens and Independents have chosen to support the opposition in this venture. I am hopeful that, unlike the opposition, once they&mdash;that is, the Greens, Democrats and Independents&mdash;have seen the documents the government is tabling, they will realise that the opposition is really on a fishing expedition and they will join us in forcing the opposition to get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in a position to table some documents at this time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;At the outset, let me say that we are not talking about a fishing expedition. We are talking about a case that has been substantially proven in the estimates process and in the parliament. It is a case which the government has to answer but which it is continuing to cover up. The documents we are seeking are documents that are quite critical to exposing the extent of the rort and fix that has been involved in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are accused of making a daily fishing expedition. It is worth placing on the record that, in the last 12 months of the previous government, 54 returns to order were passed by the Senate and responded to by that government. We are nowhere near that level now. We are choosing quite deliberately which returns to order we will proceed with. There were 54 in one year. That is an average of two per week in sitting times. Senator Kemp, Senator Hill and Senator Vanstone ought to be aware of that next time they come in here and make generalised statements with respect to our motivations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taxpayers' funds in the Medicare benefit have been rorted. You are fixing up your mates, and the public is entitled to know about it. It is just not good enough to come in here and say that you are not tabling certain documents. There is a cover-up here. There is no good reason to deny access to the Senate, the parliament and the Australian <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5152"> people to the sorts of documents that the government is already talking about denying access to. At the start of the last government finance estimates committee, Senator Kemp said, `You can have all the documents you want. We are here and open.' That was a pretty general statement. The government has had to back down on that commitment given by Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about having access to submissions to ministers. Of course we expect them. They were given in the past by the previous government, and they are quite critical here. We are talking about accountability to parliament. We can go through the record and find all the statements of Senator Hill, Senator Kemp and Senator Vanstone when they were demanding documents, which the previous government would provide. We are talking of a cover-up of critical documents from within the Attorney-General's Department to the Attorney&hyphen;General. Those documents argue very strongly against the tender going to the favoured son firm of the Liberal Party of Australia. We are talking about documents that are consistent and trenchant in their opposition to the DDB Needham proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about a cover-up to the extent that the Attorney-General knew of the advice of his department and how strong it was. But, for some dereliction of duty and responsibility, he chose not to take sides in terms of the particular bidders. We are talking about grand embarrassment to the Attorney-General, a person who has not met his responsibilities in what is, and is to be, the most critical campaign run by his department under his responsibility. That is the sort of thing we are talking about in terms of briefs to ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of commercial-in-confidence, no-one is arguing that there is any doubt about the figures. We have seen all the competitive figures. If there are any more, we are prepared to go through that process. I remind Senator Hill that I have spent some time in his office late at night from time to time going through what were then supposedly commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence documents. We agreed to what extent they could be published <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and produced in the parliament. There is a process, but it does not cover qualitative research, generalisation, competitive tenders and bids other than where there might be some commercial-in-confidence financial information shown. As I say, there is a mechanism for that. We are talking about whether there is continuing tracking  research of this DDB Needham bid. In terms of commercial-in-confidence, the previous government had a practice of providing as much information as possible. That is not the practice that we are seeing here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of legal advice, there was no exemption to the offer made by Senator Kemp the other day. We knew, and we know, that we would not be talking about advice that would jeopardise the Commonwealth in any legal suits. No-one is talking about legal suits in this case. There is a good case to argue that some legal advice should be kept from public view. We would argue that, in this case, in the absence of any pending court action, the government should show more flexibility in terms of legal advice. We accept the opposition's decision with regard to cabinet documents. We are talking about fundamental accountability to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has come in here this morning and argued that the search goes on and that people in Mr Jull's office were working till 3 a.m. to provide all the documents. This is not a new practice. People in my office used to work all night to get documents in on time. It was demanded of us that we get them in on time, and we got them in on time. The government has already had an 18&hyphen;hour extension to the time that they should have produced these documents by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is part of the responsibility and accountability to parliament that documents are provided here on time. It is not good enough to say, `We need a little extra time' or `We'll give them to you in our time' or `We can't give you an exact time'&mdash;as Senator Vanstone has said today. We have an estimates process tomorrow night, and we expect to be able to see all the documents before that process kicks off. To the extent that we do not see documents, to the extent that they have to be dragged out of you, Senator Kemp&mdash;like <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5153"> wisdom teeth&mdash;that process will have to continue. You will be exposed, even more, for covering up the fix, the rort, that your mates or the Prime Minister's men have been involved in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a fishing expedition. We have an entitlement to these records. There is nothing unreasonable in terms of what the opposition is seeking here. There is a fix of Fine Cotton proportions, a fix that plunders the taxpayers' funds. It is a fix for which the documents, I think, will expose the extent of the rort that it is. So we do expect to see documentation&mdash;advice to ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that, with respect to, for instance, the research done on the DDB Needham bid, there were at least three levels of research. We have seen the advice from the Office of Government Information and Advertising. We have seen the research from Elliott and Shanahan. But we also know what the government is very keen to hide here: advice from just about every area of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department telling the Attorney-General that this DDB Needham bid was not the one to be supported, that it should not be supported in the interests of the campaign to recover as many guns as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I say to you, from experience here and elsewhere, that to the extent that you continue your cover&hyphen;up and drag your feet on this, this will continue to be an issue. The opposition will find more and more ways of exposing the fact that you, your government and a Prime Minister who has a hypocritical commitment to standards have plundered the taxpayers' Medicare levy in pursuance of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of documents, there is probably very little that has been produced this morning. That should also be placed on the public record. There are very few documents and that, generally&mdash;and specifically in this case&mdash;is just not good enough.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

Rather than tapping now into the just over four per cent of the reef that is protected, we should be increasing the amount of reef protected to closer to 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at this issue that is before us today. Many Australians believe that the entire reef is protected. It is a view that is widespread but, unfortunately, very little of it is. It is opened up to a range of resource extraction activities, in particular, fishing. That is a major means of extracting resources on that reef and, indeed, the major way in which the resources of the reef are depleted. It is rather ironic that so little of our marine species on the reef are protected, because this is what the majority of tourists go to see. This is what attracts the tourists and earns the huge amount of money that is being earned by the tourism industry in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the beauty and the abundance and diversity of marine life that draw people to the reef itself. One of the major reasons it is now listed as a world heritage area is its abundance and diversity. The other 96 per cent of the reef is open to a range of activities, including trawling, commercial and recreational line fishing, diving, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is already considered that there are areas of the reef that are over&hyphen;fished. This is and has been recognised for some time as a major problem. However, instead of protecting more of the reef from the damaging effects of fishing, the Cooperative Research Centre for the Great Barrier Reef and GBRMPA want to open up some of the protected zones to fish target species and then see what happens. The experiment is designed to take about 24 <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5154"> reefs&mdash;16 of them in protected zones&mdash;and fish target species, then close the reefs for a few years to see what comes back and how biodiversity is affected. That is akin to opening up some of our national parks, shooting out maybe black cockatoos, lining up the carcasses to count how many there are and then sitting back and waiting to see how many of that species find their way back into that particular forest area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the minister will undoubtedly use arguments that there are still some protected areas left, that this experiment is not going to go into all the protected areas, I think he will forget to tell us what the evidence is of the actual impact of this activity on the reef. I think he will conveniently avoid mentioning the fact that there will be more impacts on some areas than others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in the central zone of the barrier reef there are only 32 protected zones. Yet he seeks to allow eight of those to be used in this experiment; that is one in four areas on that reef. Nowhere is there an assumption that most of the reefs once had the fish that are now to be found in these protected areas and then use that basis as a means of comparing what has happened in other parts of the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not quite sure, but it seems that there are some scientists out there who actually cannot count fish that are swimming. They have actually got to kill them and line them up and then see how many of the species were out there. Nowhere is there an assumption that closing off fished areas, waiting to see what comes back and comparing that to protected zones in two years would also give the result without opening up these protected areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere is there an assumption that the computer modelling, which has already been done and is based on an earlier experiment, is sufficient to at least give a very accurate idea of exactly what is going to happen rather than going out and plundering these areas of reef. The government has an act to protect the reef and the intent of that act has not changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Moss Cass said in a second reading speech to this parliament that the Australian govern ment `has decided the protection of our unique Barrier Reef is of paramount importance to Australia and the world'. Since the Great Barrier Reef act was enacted, the only thing that has really changed is that there is now the overlay of the World Heritage Act, which has the primary aim of protection, conservation and preservation of the reef to transmit those values to future generations. It is based on the ethic of the precautionary principle, which in no way could be stretched to allow these experiments to go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Democrats put through two significant amendments to the Great Barrier Reef act to include the precautionary principle also in management plans and to have the concept of world heritage put into that act. We have two acts affecting this area and the precautionary principle is in both of them. Yet still the authority and the Cooperative Research Centre are persisting with this reef line fishing experiment which goes against the precautionary principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year GBRMPA stopped their anchor damage experiment. They were going to deliberately destroy reefs to look at the effect of anchor damage instead of monitoring the reefs that had already been affected by anchor damage and looking at the impact on species and what was happening on those reefs. Where is the consistency in opening up protected areas of the reef to fishing and fishing out as much as they can target species. They have already done this experiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point to the example of Bramble Reef, which was closed to fishing for about 3&half; years. It was reopened and within several weeks 80 per cent of its adult fish were taken by the industry. I could go through the documents that Senator Hill has presented to us. They are able to do their computer modelling on that experiment. They know what is going to happen. They know what was left. They are already making some suggestions on what the results of this experiment that they are arguing they absolutely have to do are going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There certainly are a few scientists within GBRMPA that support this experiment. Unfortunately, many of those who think the experiment should not go ahead have not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5155"> been listened to. Proper process has not been followed by the environment minister. I do not believe we should let these regulations through this place because, firstly, proper process has not been followed and, secondly, we should be conserving, not experimenting with, what little of the Great Barrier Reef is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment minister, as you know, is required to take a number of steps to gather advice before making or allowing Commonwealth decisions which will significantly affect the environment. Yet on 17 October he tabled regulations to downsize some of the few protected areas of the reef to allow fishing. He tabled and expects the parliament to allow these regulations without ever examining reasonable and prudent alternatives, without asking the Heritage Commission for advice and without ever receiving and considering such advice. He has also not made a decision about designating the proposal and whether or not to have any environmental review proposal under the EP(IP) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now it appears the minister will argue that he still could ask for some of this advice after the rezonings have been through this place&mdash;that is, before the advertisement goes in the paper notifying that the rezoning has occurred. Technically there may possibly be room for this to happen, but surely this is a farcical approach to decision making. He has made his decisions on the rezoning to allow the experiments without due process or proper advice as he is required to do. If we let these regulations through today we will not have another chance to debate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have received a copy of a letter from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to the Australian Heritage Commission demonstrating that correct process has, in their words, been `unfortunately overlooked and a slip has occurred'. It also sets out the minister's argument that he could wait until the end of the process to begin the process. This is like something I remember from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alice in Wonderland</EMPHASIS> where the Queen said, `We always do it like this&mdash;verdict first and evidence later.' I have circulated to a number of senators the advice I have received from the clerks on the letter, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the legislation and the minister's arguments. Senators can see for themselves that the opinion of the clerks tallies with our opinion and they support what we are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats argue strongly that this advice provides a clear argument that these regulations have to be disallowed today. This particular form of regulation cannot simply be deferred. Only by disallowing can the parliament be assured that the minister made an informed and proper decision before putting the regulations before us. The minister could come back in six months after following this process and do the same thing. I notice that the minister is already talking about some revision of the body that oversees the Great Barrier Reef. What is the point in letting through things like this major reef experiment and then reviewing the body that has let this slip through its net?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to the second reason for disallowance which is the science of this issue. It does not appear that the idea of conservation has got through to this government. Conservation means you look after something, protect it and do not start eating into the few areas that you have actually protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Conservation is not about hanging onto something for a while, then gradually downsizing the area you have protected bit by bit. To say that we have to kill fish in protected areas to count them is like that old argument Japan has been using about having to kill whales to count them. That is an argument that Australia has found abhorrent. Hopefully Japan and Norway are now moving away from those scientific experiments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must remind the Senate that this is also a world heritage area. Under that act we should be using the precautionary principle. We should be observing that principle and using a totally different methodology from the one that these scientists are suggesting. Obviously we have to know about fishing pressures on the reef, but there are other ways of doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, letting industry into a protected area, even if it is only for a few years, is a very dangerous precedent to set. Why not close some of the 96 per cent of the reef that is currently open for various periods of time, put different fishing pressures on them, let <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5156"> line fishing and commercial fishing in and see some of the impacts there rather than open up these few protected areas? Surely at the very least we should have before this chamber more time to look at some of the very difficult issues we are facing in regard to the very small amount of reef that is protected. As I said before, less than five per cent of forest areas are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What if the industry minister does not accept the results and asks for more time? Where are we going to draw the line in the sand? The Democrats argue that it should be drawn now, that there are compelling reasons, both because due process has not been followed and for conservation reasons, why we should not pass these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stress again that we want the minister to follow his own legislation before making such decisions. Indeed, if the regulations are not disallowed we will have no further opportunity in this place to debate this issue. There will be no point in waiting for any review that the minister might put in place of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. There will not be any time to revisit the issue of line fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they are disallowed, the minister still has the opportunity to follow the processes and then, in six months, he can present these regulations to us. I acknowledge those senators who have indicated that they are supporting us on this. I hope that other senators will move with us today to protect the Great Barrier Reef and, indeed, to protect one of Australia's 11 world heritage areas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.33 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what this debate is all about&mdash;what is the best course of action to protect the reef and its conservation values. In this instance we are particularly talking about the fish resource of the reef. There is no debate about what we are seeking to achieve. The debate is about whether the advice that is being put to the authority by Australia's best marine scientists as essential to ensure that there is not overfishing of the reef to the extent that it would threaten the resource should be accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> I have some sympathy, as I said in question time a few days ago, with the sort of instinc tive reaction of Senator Lees, which was not dissimilar to my own reaction when I first read these papers. I wondered why it was necessary to open currently closed reefs to produce data that was essential to assure us that we were not overfishing the currently open reefs. As I said in question time, I was sufficiently concerned to sit down personally with the scientists in Townsville. Even after listening to their argument and debating it with them I still went back and sought further information from them because I felt that I had to be satisfied that, although years of planning have gone into this experiment, it was well based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not easy for a non-marine scientist to do. If you cannot turn to the experts for advice in relation to specialised areas, where do you turn? We all start with our instincts and our prejudices but most of us, if it is an area of specialisation beyond our training or experience, then turn to the experts and listen to their arguments. We probe them and we test them. As I did in this instance, if necessary we revisit it several times. But in revisiting it they constantly came back with the argument that they could not be confident that the current fishing regime was not putting stocks at risk unless they were able to compare the resource with an area that was not currently fished. Only with that would they have sufficient data to be confident that the conservation regime that is in place for the reefs that are being fished was such that it would preserve the stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When they come back and are reinforced by their professional colleagues in this assessment it is very difficult to decide otherwise. In fact, my judgment in the end was that it would be reckless of me to put my non-specialised assessment ahead of the specialists who told me that, unless this experiment was carried out, the stocks would be threatened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experimentation is to ensure that the conservation regime is adequate and is working. My agreement to the experimentation is therefore precautionary, Senator. You said that the precautionary principle should apply. But it would have been disregarding the precautionary principle if I disregarded the advice of the scientists and said, `You are not going to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5157"> carry out this experiment and I will take a chance that the current conservation regime, against your judgment and your advice, will work.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can imagine the uproar in this place in a few years time&mdash;if perchance I was still the environment minister&mdash;if the stocks had collapsed on the reefs that were open and I stood up and tried to justify why I had not taken the advice of the scientific experts and enabled them to carry out the experimentation which they had said was necessary to be satisfied that the conservation regime in place was working. Senator, they tell me and they tell you that the history of fishing on reefs internationally&mdash;and fishing generally&mdash;is that stocks collapse quickly and often with very little evidence that it is going to occur. At times it happens so quickly that it is too late to then change the conservation regime and preserve the resource. That is the fear that some Australian scientists have expressed to me on this matter. In those circumstances, the precautionary step for me to take is to accept their advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees, I know that you are sitting over there and saying all the scientists are wrong. But I do not think that I am in a position where I can responsibly make that judgment. A lot of these scientists&mdash;</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know many of these scientists, I have to concede. But I was interested in a press release that was put out in response to a press release of Senator Meg Lees on 30 October. This was put out by Dr Alan Butler, whom I do know. He put this out as President of the Australian Marine Sciences Association. I do not think he has any interest in this experiment, but I am not absolutely <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sure of that. I am sure Senator Lees will tell me if I am wrong. The press release read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If we are to protect the Reef, we must understand how it works. That means we have to understand how the fish respond when fishing activities are carried on," Dr Butler said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The series of experiments criticised by Senator Lees are an absolutely central tool in the process of gaining scientific knowledge."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There are good and bad ways of designing experiments, and there must be no confusion about the difference. Poorly designed experiments lead to unreliable knowledge."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Butler said that the Reef research process had been thoroughly discussed by competent scientists at both national and international level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Senator Lees' emotive claims that the experiments would "rip the heart" out of sections of the Reef are simply not true. The scientists involved in this project are vitally concerned about the long&hyphen;term future of the Reef," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He criticised the experimental suggestions put forward by the Democrats, saying they would NOT yield the same understanding as the properly planned opening of some reefs and closing of others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In supporting these experiments, which require a rezoning of portions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, AMSA sees Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GRBMPA) as acting in the best interests of protecting and managing the Reef, and not merely acting for the fishing industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lees came into the Senate the other day and said, `Why are you doing this for the fishing industry?' And I told her, although she disregards it, that I have witnessed correspondence from the fishing industry complaining about what we are doing. Why are they complaining? I will tell you why they are complaining. They are complaining because it means that for some years their resource will be less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To conduct this experiment, eight reefs that are currently closed&mdash;and I understand that is eight out of some 500 reefs that are currently closed&mdash;would be open for one year. But, on the other side of the ledger, eight reefs that are currently open would be closed for five years. It is not as if the stock is captured within one reef, so it logically follows that over that period of time the fishing industry would have to accept a reduced take.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5158">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will accept that, Senator Macdonald, because they are obviously interested commercially in ensuring that the resource does not collapse. They are interested in maintaining a resource for commercial reasons. They, like all other Australians, are also interested in preserving the conservation values of the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are prepared to cooperate with scientists to demonstrate that the conservation regime at the moment is working satisfactorily in terms of protecting a resource or, if it is demonstrated that it is not, the conservation regime would have to change. Not only do you have the scientists involved in the experiment&mdash;from James Cook University, from the CRC and AIMS&mdash;the Australian Institute of Marine Science&mdash;up at Townsville all providing us with advice that it is important that this experiment take place to protect the reef values; you have scientists outside of that group, such as Dr Alan Butler, whom I have known for a long time and whom I respect greatly, reinforcing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have the industry prepared to take a drop in stock out of respect for the importance of the experimentations. Yet you have the Democrats and, I think, the Greens coming in here and saying that we should disregard all this advice and take a chance. They say that the precautionary principle is to take a chance. That does not, with respect, make any sense. So I accepted the advice of the scientists after some considerable testing of their argument and that is the reason I have been prepared to agree to these regulations and the rezoning necessary to enable this experimentation to take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of process, Mr Deputy President, my legal advice is that the process that I have adopted is perfectly correct. So it is something of a red herring to say that this should fail because there is some error in process. I am not just simply judged by senators in this place. Every action I take has to be in accordance with my obligations, as set out in the various pieces of legislation. I take the best advice to help me ensure that I meet those obligations which are not all straightforward in terms of the legislation under which I operate. The advice I have is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that I have acted in accordance with my obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go through every step that has been taken by me and also by GBRMPA because we both have separate responsibilities in relation to this particular effort but I think that would unnecessarily take up the time of the Senate. I simply wish to put on record our response to certain queries put by the opposition, in particular by the shadow minister for the environment, Dr Lawrence. She asked us if we would ensure that the Australian Heritage Commission would be formally informed of the proposed action, as required under the Australian Heritage Commission Act, and would be given a reasonable opportunity to consider and comment on its impact. In the response&mdash;which I have given to Dr Lawrence&mdash;from the chairman of the marine park authority, Dr McPhail has confirmed that he will consider the application of the Australian Heritage Commission Act before any reefs are opened. He advises that he has already informally referred the proposal to the AHC and if the legislative test is triggered, the proposal will be formally referred to the AHC. I would have thought, Senator Lees, that you would accept that as his obligation under that piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr Lawrence also asked if formal consideration would be given as to whether to designate the proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Dr McPhail has also confirmed that he will give formal consideration as to whether to designate the proposal under that act. She asked a number of other questions which I also should put on the record because I have not yet heard whether she believes the authority and I have sufficiently answered her concerns. She said that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, we believe that the status of the area requires, as a minimum, that explicit monitoring mechanisms are in place for the duration of fishing on the green reefs to ensure irreparable damage is not caused.</PARA>
<PARA>The response is that monitoring of fish stocks will be undertaken five times per year for the duration of the experiment and more intensely for the first three months following each reef opening. This will provide a reliable measure of what fishing impact has occurred as a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5159"> safeguard to ensure irreparable damage is not caused. I would have thought that would give some comfort to Senator Lees. Secondly, Dr Lawrence said that she wanted a commitment from the government that, as a matter of urgency, the information obtained from the experiment would be used to develop a proper management strategy for commercial and recreational fishing on the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reason for adopting such an experimental approach within the specified time frame is the information is vital for the effective management of the impacts of recreational and commercial fishing on the Great Barrier Reef. That is one of the purposes of the experiment which this is all about. The government is committed to ensuring that this information is promptly applied to management strategies for these two fishing sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, Dr Lawrence wanted a guarantee that the reefs would be rezoned to their current status at the completion of the experiment. The response is that the provisions relating to the opening and closing of reefs are spelled out in the proposed zoning amendments. The proposed provisions, which deal with fishing on those reefs that are presently closed, provide that only four of the reefs would be open at the one time and that each reef may be open only for a maximum of 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that Dr McPhail had assured me that the authority would commence proceedings to rezone the green reefs at the completion of the experiment which, I think, is exactly what she was seeking. Fourthly, she was seeking an assurance from me that I would report to parliament, at the end of the first year of the experiment, on the preliminary results of fishing the green reefs. I have given her my assurance that, at the end of the first year of research under the experiment, I will table a report containing the preliminary results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will see from that, Mr Deputy President, that we have done our best to meet the requirements of the opposition in this matter. I understand why they are wishing to receive these assurances. As I said, within the spirit of this debate, we are all looking towards the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> best conservation outcome and it is a matter of us being satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I have decided that the precautionary approach is to accept the advice of the scientists. To do otherwise at this time would be reckless.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(11.52 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak on Senator Lees's disallowance motion. I commence my contribution by making three comments which summarise the opposition's approach to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the rezoning of a world heritage area demands closest scrutiny, particularly if the rezoning involves the opening up of previously protected areas to fishing. Secondly, the CRC Reef Research Centre proposed experiment would make an important contribution to our knowledge of the reef's fish stocks and greatly assist the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority develop a proper management plan for fishing on the reef. Thirdly, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), by not fulfilling his statutory responsibilities in ensuring the environmental impact of the proposal was formally assessed, as is required under the Australian Heritage Commission Act and the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, does severely jeopardise the future of this important experiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard much of the views of the scientists and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority who have argued that the rezoning of eight green reefs is essential to allow a proper assessment of the impact of line fishing on the Great Barrier Reef. Marine national park B zones or green reefs are used in the proposed experiment to set a baseline from which the state of the fish population on the surrounding open reefs can be gauged. The proposed experiment will also determine how unfished populations react to fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5160"> The experiment has in fact been justified on three grounds. It enables the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to measure the size, age and reproductive structure of populations of fish on previously unfished coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef. This informa tion will allow the authority to gauge how much fishing the reef can sustain. It will also give the marine park authority an indication of the effect of line fishing on the marine park to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experiment will enable the scientists to determine what annual rate of fishing effort causes a level of change in the fish stocks. It also allows the authority to look into the future to measure how the fish stocks and the fishery will respond to any future increases in fishing effort. By providing important information about how catch rates relate to the number of fish in the water, the experiment will allow reef managers to better interpret changes in catch rates and, hopefully, avoid the errors that have led to many of the world fisheries collapsing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scientists claim that the alternative research designs which involve closing and then reopening general use reefs would delay the experiment by some 10 to 12 years and that this would be irresponsible as the data is required urgently to develop a management plan for fishing on the reef. Without an independent assessment of the experiment by the Australian Heritage Commission to assess all the feasible and prudent alternatives, it is difficult for the opposition to properly assess the arguments for and against the two research designs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are over 2,700 reefs in the marine park and nearly 500 of those reefs are closed to line fishing. The experiment proposes to open eight of the 500 reefs for 12 months and close eight open reefs for five years. Only four per cent of the reef is zoned marine park B and opening up these green reefs to fishing for 12 months is a very serious matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does believe at a minimum that, given the world heritage status of the area, explicit monitoring mechanisms are in place for the duration of fishing on the green reefs to ensure irreparable damage is not caused. We believe there should be a commitment from the government that, as a matter of urgency, the information obtained from the experiment is used to develop a proper management strategy for commercial and recreational fishing on the reef.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that a guarantee is required that the reefs will be rezoned back to their current status at the completion of the experiment. We require an assurance from the Minister for the Environment that he will report to the parliament at the end of the first year of the experiment to inform the parliament of the preliminary results of fishing the green reefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the minister indicated, the shadow minister for the environment, Dr Lawrence, yesterday wrote to Senator Hill outlining these issues and requesting his assurance that these matters be addressed in due course. I acknowledge the fact that the minister has provided these assurances, firstly, by letter to Dr Lawrence this morning and, secondly, in the chamber during this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, the opposition objects to opening up protected areas. I must say, however, that the scientific benefits and the capacity of the knowledge gained to improve the long&hyphen;term sustainable management of fishing on the reef could make this temporary rezoning an exception, provided that proper processes are followed by the Minister for the Environment. Regrettably, it appears that the minister has not properly performed his statutory responsibilities and the matter has not yet been independently assessed by the Australian Heritage Commission and evaluated under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a letter relating to this issue under the signature of Mr Peter McGinnity, Director, Planning, of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, that has been communicated from the marine park authority to Dr Michael Mulvaney of the Australian Heritage Commission. In part, this letter says:</PARA>

I am not sure that this is, in fact, a legal requirement, given that the proposed amendments to the zoning plans do not, in their own right, result in any action in the Park, and in any case the amendment is a matter for consideration by Parliament. However, I believe it would be clearly necessary for the Authority to refer to the Heritage Commission a proposal to open an area to fishing prior to publishing a notice (written advertisement) implementing such a proposal. This later action would have an effect on the Marine Park, although the extent to which such an action would be significant is open to some debate.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate that this quite controversial issue has slipped through the system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>these are the words that Senator Lees used earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">without our normal process of consultation with the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, it is unfortunate that it slipped through the system. I think most of us would acknowledge that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the letter to Senator Hill from Dr Lawrence that Senator Hill referred to, Dr Lawrence stated that the opposition's position on the regulations tabled in the Senate was conditional on a couple of issues. They were: immediate government action to ensure the Australian Heritage Commission is formally informed of the proposed action, as required under the AHC Act, and given reasonable opportunity to consider and comment on its impact; and that it gives formal consideration to whether to designate the proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill indicated a little earlier in the debate what his response was to these two matters in the letter that he sent to Dr Lawrence this morning. I think the words here are very important&mdash;and I appreciate that Senator Hill has read some of those words into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and his formal response indicated this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr McPhail has confirmed that he will consider the application of the Australian Heritage Commission Act before any reefs are opened. He advises me that he has already informally referred the proposal to the Australian Heritage Commission. If the legislative test is triggered then the proposal will be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> formally referred to the Australian Heritage Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>And on the other issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr McPhail has also confirmed that he will give formal consideration on whether to designate the proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA>The position of the opposition on this is that at this stage the minister's response does not go far enough. We believe that the proposal should be formally referred to the Australian Heritage Commission for proper assessment and consideration of prudent and feasible alternatives. We are continuing to demand of the minister that he give that assurance on this matter. I must say to the Senate that, in the absence of a clear assurance on that, we do have very little choice but to support the Democrats' disallowance motion standing in the name of Senator Lees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point&mdash;and I hope this is acknowledged by the minister&mdash;that this exchange of correspondence has occurred over a relatively brief period and the opposition has not had an enormous amount of time to look at the correspondence that has been referred by Senator Hill. And I suspect that the minister has not had a great amount of time to look more closely perhaps at the issues that have been raised by Dr Lawrence, although we are pleased with some of the assurances that Senator Hill has been able to give on those matters, which I will not repeat but which Senator Hill has read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I say to the minister: if he wishes to take more time to consider the issue of a formal referral to the AHC and he thinks that would be useful, the opposition certainly would give it very favourable consideration. We would support a motion to adjourn the debate to a later hour of the day or a future sitting day if that was a useful contribution. Perhaps a fuller response might be forthcoming from the minister. From the perspective of the opposition, the issue of a formal reference to the AHC for proper assessment and consideration of prudent and feasible alternatives is, I think, the key one now that is outstanding. I think it is a matter of regret that Senator Hill has brought this matter to the stage of putting the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5162"> regulations before parliament before seeking advice from the AHC and the EPA. I think Senator Hill well understands that it is within his own discretion to refer these matters whenever he wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In the absence of referrals and advice from the two agencies, I think the opposition certainly finds itself in an invidious position&mdash;I do not know what the position of other non-government senators in the chamber is. I would ask Senator Hill to assure the Senate that, if the AHC or the EPA advise him that this experiment is environmentally unsound or inadvisable, he will accept that advice and not proceed. I hope he is willing to give that level of assurance to the Senate on this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I note in the minister's contribution his concerns about the difficult position that he might be placed in if he does not take the scientific advice that is available to him and if there is a serious deterioration in fish stocks on the reef. He indicated that a precautionary approach was appropriate. I thought the same precautionary approach was sadly lacking in the Port Hinchinbrook development on the Great Barrier Reef, and I am pleased to see that the precautionary principle is uppermost in the minister's mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again that the issue of a formal AHC referral is the outstanding matter. I ask the minister to give serious consideration to that and also give serious consideration to assuring the Senate that, if there is advice from the AHC or the EPA that the experiment itself is environmentally unsound or should not be proceeded with, he would in that circumstance accept that advice and not proceed with the experiment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.11 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been impressed by the arguments of Senator Hill and Senator Faulkner on the substantive issue. I am somewhat disappointed that Senator Faulkner, having agreed with the necessity for the experiment, has decided on procedural grounds to support the Democrats' motion at this stage, although I do understand that Senator Faulkner is saying that if there were certain further discussions about this during <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the day he may be able to come to a different conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I am not familiar with the procedures, so I really cannot comment on the matter that Senator Faulkner raised lastly. It does, however, seem that any further technical procedures that need to be done may well&mdash;as I say, I am no expert on this&mdash;delay the experiment to such an extent that it becomes not as appropriate. I would hope that Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party will support the first part of Senator Faulkner's argument&mdash;that is, the argument in which he clearly acknowledged the need, the necessity and the importance of the experiment&mdash;and will support us and vote against the Democrats' disallowance motion and not allow the procedures that others want to adopt to interfere with what is a most important experiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought Senator Faulkner and Senator Hill put the arguments against the disallowance very clearly&mdash;perhaps better than I could. I wanted to enter the debate for three additional reasons. There are a couple of things that I want to add to the substantive part of the debate. I also speak in the debate because the experiment is being operated out of Townsville. Of course, having my electorate office there and living in the area, I come in contact with the scientists who are doing the experiment and with the people who use the reef and use the fish stock of the reef. They have approached me and said, `Can you please tell the Democrats just how stupid they are on this particular issue and tell them to get out of the way of an important experiment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fishing interests, both the commercial and the recreational fishermen, initially were a bit concerned about the project because, as Senator Hill and Senator Faulkner have said, there are 16 reefs being dealt with. Eight of them are reefs that are currently open for fishing. Those eight will be closed for five years, but the ones that are being opened will be open for only one year. So the fishing interests were initially concerned about it because they thought they were getting the wrong end of the deal. But they eventually realised that the whole purpose of this experiment is to make sure that the fish stock is managed properly and that their industry is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5163"> viable for many years in the future. That is why they are very keen to see this, even though, in the short term, it will be at a net cost to their availability of fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons why I am speaking is that they have asked me to enter into the debate to say to the Democrats and the Greens that we support this experiment. The Cooperative Research Centre&mdash;the Reef Research Centre based at James Cook University, with Professor Chris Crossland, who is very well regarded&mdash;has also approached me to do what I can to ensure that this very necessary experiment goes forward. Professor Crossland is one of the recognised experts in this field. The CRC at James Cook University in Townsville is very well recognised and very well regarded. These people would not be doing this experiment if there was any problem at all. Speaking as a sort of representative of the scientific community and the fishing community in North Queensland, I enter into this debate to urge, particularly, the Labor Party not to support this motion for disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reason that I enter into this debate is to vent my annoyance at the noisy minorities who are trying to run this country. The Democrats and Greens concede that they have no scientific expertise, but they seem to say they know better than these very well qualified, very well regarded scientists. So, again, we have the noisy minority, the Democrats and the Greens, the people who, in the Lindsay by&hyphen;election, were shown to have three per cent support, now trying to interfere in things that the Labor Party acknowledges should be done, even though they are unhappy about the procedures; the government parties acknowledge these things should be done, as do the scientific community and the fishing community&mdash;everybody except the Democrats and the Greens. I am again expressing my annoyance that Australia is going to be held to ransom by this noisy minority without any significant scientific support to stop this very worthwhile experiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to reiterate what the experiment actually is so that people understand what it is all about. The experiment hinges on the exact measure of fishing pressures on 16 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reefs&mdash;that is 16 out of about 3,000 reefs on the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;over a period of just 12 months. Eight of the reefs are currently closed to fishing and will be closed again after the 12 months of measured fishing. So for 12 months they will be opened and then they will be closed again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other eight reefs have always been open to fishing, but after the 12 months of measured fishing they will be closed for five years. That is the problem the fishing industry initially had, before they worked out that this was very beneficial for the long&hyphen;term fish stock. So, after 12 months of measured fishing in those reefs that have been open, they will be closed for a whole five years. Effectively, through the life of the experiment, more reefs will be closed than are at present. At the end of the experiment all the reefs will revert to their current status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fish stock size is what is being looked at. Catch rates are often used as an index of the stock size. The assumption has been unavoidable in many fisheries but has generally been found to be wrong and has contributed substantially to fisheries collapses. One of the questions that the experiment will be looking at is how quickly fish populations recover following closure. Closure of reefs after fishing of known amounts will allow the experimenters to answer questions such as: how long does a reef have to be closed to fishing before populations have recovered and how do you measure the recovery? Does an increase in catch rates mean the abundance and biomass of fish has increased or just that the fish on a closed reef are easier to catch because they have not been fished for a while? These questions are central to evaluating any system of periodic or area closures as management strategies for the GBR reef line fishery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to emphasise that this experiment will never have to be repeated. Researchers will be able to model on computers with the data collected at this time to give accurate predictions of the level of fishing which the reefs can sustain. So it is a once&hyphen;only thing and involves a small amount of reefs. As Senator Hill has guaranteed at the request of the opposition, this is all going to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5164"> be reviewed in a year. That was part of the CRC proposal. After one year the experiment will be reviewed and if it is not delivering the expected results it will be stopped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public may well ask: why do we need to manipulate fishing pressure? The effects of the fishing experiment is the only way to find out how reef fish populations respond to increased fishing pressure. The traditional approach to fisheries management is to monitor the past behaviour of the fishery and, based on that history and biological information about target species, attempt to predict sustainable catches for the future. This is more guesswork than science. That is what the scientists say&mdash;it is just an informed guess; it is not a science. They want to move it into a scientific category. By the time the nation realises we are in trouble with these fisheries in the way we have done it in the past, there is too much fishing effort, too many boats, and costly action then has to be taken to reduce it to sustainable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want briefly to refute some of the arguments that the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland in the Proserpine&hyphen;Whitsunday area have been raising, which seem to be the basis on which the Democrats have moved this motion. I point out that the experiment will not, as alleged by the Democrats, result in fishing out of any reefs. Pilot studies have indicated there will still be viable populations of target species after controlled fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to emphasise that, contrary to the allegations of the Democrats, there will be no sponsored fishing nor will there be any spearfishing of every fish seen, as apparently has been alleged will happen on the control reefs. It is important also to emphasise that, contrary to allegations, the data collected from the total catch, including secondary species, will be analysed as part of the experiment. It is particularly important&mdash;and this is an objective of the project&mdash;to know the secondary effects on non-target species, particularly on the green reefs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Further, there is no evidence that the reefs in the general use area of the Great Barrier Reef are already severely overfished&mdash;as alleged. The fish stocks seem to be in reasonable shape, but the managers have no evi dence of their robustness or fragility. Fisheries collapse without warning, and that is why scientific experiments need to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, contrary to allegations from opponents of this experiment, it is not possible to computer model the effects of fishing on stocks when the critical data are missing. You can do it once you have the critical data, but you have to get that critical data. Models were purpose built to test and verify the design of the experiment, but those models will not be adequate to evaluate management options because they need information which is currently not available and which the experiment is designed to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary also to some of the more outrageous claims of the opponents of this experiment, the experiment is not&mdash;I repeat, not&mdash;being funded by the fishing industry. That allegation seems to have been thrown in to try to garner a bit of support. Further, the study of the reproductive biology of fish populations, particularly the coral trout, is an integral part of the whole study of the fishery. A lot of allegations have been made by the Democrats and other opponents. None of them stand up to scientific scrutiny, and they have been rejected by the people who should know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude by raising a couple of comments that various people involved in this matter have said. Senator Hill has already mentioned Dr Alan Butler, the president of the Marine Science Association of Australia. Dr Butler has given total support to the experiment and has published his support quite widely on behalf of the Marine Science Association of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked in an interjection across the chamber before why on earth these marine scientists, whose whole purpose in life is to protect the Great Barrier Reef and the fishing stock, are supporting this experiment if it is not important. Senator Margetts replied to my interjection by saying, `They have their own agenda.' I think she said they were in it for the short&hyphen;term money or something like that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember there was a time when the Democrats and the Greens were relying on some scientists&mdash;I must say they were pretty low order scientists&mdash;at James Cook University to support their opposition to the Oyster Point issue. Now they are apparently just going to ignore those world leaders in the scientific area who are saying, `Go ahead and support this,' because it seems they know better than the scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just give some examples of the comments in the newspapers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the scientists, from James Cook University, say the experiment is crucial to the protection of the reef and that the Democrats claims are emotive.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Project leader, Dr Bruce Mapstone, said the experiment was crucial if fisheries were to be managed sustainably in the future. His group had not received any funding from the fishing industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is another quote confirming something I have said before. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  reported:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Queensland Fisheries Management Authority also attacked Democrats Senator Meg Lees for her stance on the James Cook University line&hyphen;fishing experiment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">QFMA reef fisheries resource manager . . . said time was running out for efforts to manage the Reef fishery.</PARA>
<PARA>Another paper stated that a recreational anglers' organisation, Sunfish North Queensland, had also attacked those opponents for their:</PARA>

<PARA>I emphasise again that in the short term these recreational and commercial fisheries will be the losers because the reefs that they currently fish will be closed for five years. The new reefs that are being opened will be open for only one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all of these reasons, we really must get on with the experiment and reject this motion. I understand that some of the matters Senator Faulkner raised are being further considered, and he suggested to me that it would be better if this debate proceeded at a later time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The  fallacy that occurs because of the rich colour and the variety in reefs is that we have a rich and robust environment. That is wrong from a biological point of view: reefs are the equivalent of an undersea desert. The fact that there are so many varieties in this undersea desert is the outcome of being a very fragile area which responds very quickly to changes in nutrient levels and to a number of different environmental changes. One of the reasons why reefs and corals are being looked at around the world is to see the likely impact of things like bleaching occurrences and so on on further changes in the greenhouse levels around the world, changes in the temperatures of currents and changes in pollution levels. The reefs, if you like, become the canary of pollution and change in the world. That is very important to see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, reefs are very fragile ecosystems. Unfortunately, the government's contribution that we have heard today is fairly limited in thinking of reefs as only a source of fish. It is a bit like thinking of old-growth or ancient forests as a source of timber or, worse still, thinking of old-growth or ancient forests simply as a source of woodchips. It is not that. The reefs are fragile ecosystems, and they need to be considered as such when we are talking about the government's responsibilities in relation to the reefs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5166">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators may remember that I recently placed a notice of motion to the Senate in relation to the reef line fishing experiment. It stated `That the Senate notes, with concern, the recent decision' and so on. Then part (b) reads:</PARA>

<PARA>I have received some of that information back from the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), but my request was that that information be tabled. I am quite happy to table my copy. If by the end of this debate it is not tabled, then I am happy to table the copy that I have. I guess that would need to be copied so that other people can see it. We have asked for the information to be tabled. It is really quite important that this information is tabled. The information is nowhere near complete. However, the third page of the research outline entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Effects of line fishing: experiment, design and timing</EMPHASIS>  states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reef Line fishery is currently undergoing substantial changes, especially in the commercial sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>We have this little note here. There should be bells ringing that there are commercial pressures pushing this experiment. What are those pressures? Here we go:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, changes in marketing (the growth of the live fish trade) . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What we know is that the live fish trade is driving this experiment. What is this live fish trade? There are two elements to the live fish trade, and we need more information about which element is pushing this experiment. One is live fish for eating and the other is live fish for aquariums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are seeing a great deal of evidence that the trade in live fish for aquariums throughout the world is responsible for what is largely killing reefs throughout the world. We are hearing evidence of cyanide and so on being used in pushing for that trade. Is this a trade that the Australian government should be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> encouraging? Should they be doing that to the detriment of the ecological communities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reefs are not just a source of fish; they are a very complex ecological community, the parts of which are so intertwined that, when you remove one portion, other parts suffer. You may not only be getting rid of adult fish; you may be interfering with this complex ecological community, which may lead to the killing or changing&mdash;maybe forever&mdash;of aspects of the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why would you do this? It is really quite interesting because all around the Indo-Pacific region we have reefs which have similar ecological communities. If you wanted to find out what the impacts are of either overfishing pristine reefs or overfishing reefs to the point of extinction, you have many examples within the region. Experiments have been carried out again and again throughout the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has to be understood that the nature of the experiment conducted on the reef is very important. You cannot just put a cage around the reef and say, `This is a controlled experiment within the reef.' The reason you cannot do that is that what happens on one reef affects what happens on other reefs. It is not just within the Great Barrier Reef that changes within pristine reefs will have an impact&mdash;there is no indication that the rest of the reef will be monitored at the same time for the impact, only those areas within the study area&mdash;but also the reefs around the Indo-Pacific area for which things like coral spawn are carried from the currents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not fanciful. Coral spawning in one part of the world then becomes the basis for continued healthy coral reefs in other parts of the world. This is not part of the experiment either. There is no indication that we will have monitoring set up in those other reefs throughout the world which benefit from the healthy nature of some of our coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef. What controlled research will there be in the reefs elsewhere in the Indian-Pacific region? Nothing to indicate that that will be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The experiment has been changed from four years to two years. Is this change in timing `scientific'? No. It also mentioned in this outline that change from four years to two <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5167"> years is necessitated by the need to formally amend the zoning plans which in fact are driving this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ian Macdonald talks about the levels of fishing that the reef can sustain. That is what we are beginning to see. If we are saying that we need to make this experiment two years in length, we are talking about the desire not just to project the reef but to change the zoning so that, in the future, we can continue to have reefs which are not protected from fishing but about which we have some crass idea of assimilative capacity. If you want to know of scientists who have criticised the whole concept of assimilative capacity, I can get plenty of scientists to provide that kind of critique. It is a very odd idea about the precautionary principle that we are hearing today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is a national park? What signal are we giving to other countries in the region? It is my understanding that Australian scientists are working very hard in other parts of the region, including the Philippines and other places, to convince local communities that closing off reefs to fishing will be of benefit in many ways. It is happening successfully. What kind of signal will it give to those communities if Australia is doing what appears to be exactly the opposite?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot wait to see what happens when we close off the reef. We are in too much of a hurry, so we will do the exact opposite. We will either fish out or more intensively fish blue reefs. That is what is happening. The blue reefs will be more intensively fished, or perhaps come close to being fished out, and we will open our otherwise pristine reefs. That is exactly the opposite of what we and Australian scientists overseas are asking the fishing communities in other countries to do. We are asking them to take some care for the overall long-term benefits, yet we are doing the exact opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The research outline and methodology review process need very careful consideration. There has been all this talk about scientific analysis and processes. In the normal case of these kind of scientific experiments, you measure `effort'. If you were going to do this as a proper scientific experi ment, you would require, I would think, a log of what size and type of fish the fishing companies are catching. But are they requiring that? No. You have to wonder exactly how scientific this experiment is if you are only talking about the numbers of fish but not requiring even a log from those people who will suddenly be allowed to fish in otherwise pristine and protected areas. Comparative studies of live and dead fish are not valid in a scientific sense. We could find a number of scientists who could give reasons why this kind of comparison is not valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this all say about the future? It is not making very good statements about the current processes and attitude of the government. We have already seen the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) come into this chamber and say that the way to deal with the problem of bluefin tuna, which is very controversial, is to give increased access to it by fishing fleets. He believes that that would solve the problem. That is not giving us a very good signal of how this government sees the issue of depleted fish stocks and the whole marine ecosystem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, in the case of fishing, it is very difficult to isolate one area of the sea and say, `We can deal with this issue because it is in everybody's interest to take the same line.' In the north-west cape in Western Australia, you have a reasonably closed ecosystem. You can monitor those areas. If you have people with limited licences, there is a coming together of interests between fishing and other interests, such as pollution and so on. That happens when there is a limited number of licences and where under&hyphen;fishing or controlled fishing becomes the rationale for real sustainability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case where it is impossible to put a line around what is or is not part of a particular fishing area, this whole process becomes an understanding that fish stocks are threatened, that reefs may be threatened and that commercial pressures may bring extra pressures in the future. Each of those players might be looking to see how they can benefit in the short term if they know that there is no way of controlling the long term. That is the worst spin of it, but it has been asked why <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5168"> people would do such a thing. Perhaps the answer is to see how far we can get away with the level of exploitation that we would want to get away with. That is not the way to treat a national park. It is not the way to deal with such a precious and valuable ecological community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there has been any effort to see the wider scientific critique of this proposal. It is quite difficult, just as it is in Western Australia, for people to speak up and give alternative critiques. In Western Australia, it involves scientists from the Department of Conservation and Land Management. There are great parallels here. In Western Australia, the scientists from the Department of Conservation and Land Management have a number of conflicting interests. They include forestry and the demand to continue receiving royalties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also these conflicting interests within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. That is not something that is bad about the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, but it is the reality. You have tourism, fishing and recreational interests and you obviously have conservation interests. The reality is that there are conflicts of interest. There are people who would like to see whether they can do things in a different way instead of operating by the principle of actual conservation. They would like to see just how far they can damage an area and still get away with it. That is not a good principle or the message Australia should be sending to those countries where we are desperately trying to get communities to look at their long-term interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are species of fish within a reef that go to the reef only in their juvenile stage and which move off the reef later. There is probably a reasonable argument to say that the total level of fish will increase if you do lock out areas of reef. There are obviously types of fish that spend their entire adult life on reefs. If we are talking about coral trout and so on, maybe those fish can be gained in other ways, such as through carefully designed aquaculture.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, I wish to canvass an aspect of the euthanasia debate which I find profoundly interesting, given my outspokenness on that aspect, which has engendered considerable public comment. In my first speech in this place, I stressed the importance of having a truly federal system of government. Those who served with me on the legal and constitutional affairs committee of the Senate and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties would be aware of my continual concern at treaties impinging on the legislative domain of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In November 1994 I voted for the rights of the legislature of my home state of Tasmania against the views adopted by my party. In short, I believe that I have some credentials to speak on the issue of the impact of the bill introduced by the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996, on what has been dubbed territory rights. Today, I do not wish to canvass the merits of the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation. However, views have been expressed in the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5169"> community on the issue of territory rights. It seems to be used in the same context as states rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This appeal to territory rights in the context of the euthanasia debate is baseless and intellectually unsustainable. The rights of territories are simply that bundle of rights bestowed upon a territory by the goodwill of this the Commonwealth parliament. The foundation of the Northern Territory's alleged rights are rooted in the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act 1978, passed by the Commonwealth parliament. Therefore, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly only exists by virtue of the federal parliament's goodwill. What the parliament gives, it can also take away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in stark contrast to the states, which combined to form the Commonwealth and federal parliament for specific purposes. The states pre&hyphen;dated the Commonwealth. A quick read of our constitution provides the salient differences and exposes the shallowness of talking territory rights in the same breath as states rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 122 of our constitution was drafted by our founding fathers and democratically accepted by the peoples of the various states. It has been part of the legislative province of the federal parliament since the inception of the constitution and has remained so ever since. Section 122 reads in part, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliament may make laws for the government of any territory . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer. No highly paid QCs are needed for this one. It is crystal clear&mdash;literally black on white:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliament may make laws for the government of any territory . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is under that power that the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act was enacted. This act provides for the appointment of an administrator of the Northern Territory by the Governor-General. The same legislation under section 9 allows for disallowance of any Legislative Assembly enactment, once again, by the Governor-General. `Governor-General' in this context means the federal executive, or a simple cabinet decision.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under section 53 of the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen; Government) Act, the federal Industrial Relations Act applies in relation to industrial disputes in the territory. Each state has its own industrial relations regime&mdash;not so the territories. Under section 23 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act, there are matters specifically excluded from the ACT Legislative Assembly's power to make laws, ranging over numerous matters and issues, including the classification of materials for the purposes of censorship&mdash;a power enjoyed and exercised by each and every state. Given the behaviour of the ACT on this issue, it is little wonder that the federal parliament refused to trust the ACT with the power to classify and censor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Australian Capital Territory (Self&hyphen; Government) Act of 1988, I note that the Governor-General has the power to dissolve the ACT Legislative Assembly under section 16 and appoint a commissioner, similar to the power that the state governments enjoy in relation to local councils. But do we hear the state premiers condemning the interference by state governments in local government affairs? Hardly likely, given their quite high&hyphen;handed treatment, on occasions, of local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The premiers' response would undoubtedly be that local government is set up by state legislation and that the state governments therefore have a right to determine how local governments operate, and their electors in their various states will ultimately judge them in due course. I agree with them. But if that is&mdash;and we know it is&mdash;the response of state premiers, then they cannot complain about the Commonwealth parliament dealing in exactly the same way with creations of its own legislation, namely the territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I trust the point has been made: territories are hardly in the same category as the states, which the Constitution Act reminds us created the Commonwealth when its preamble tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth . . .  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5170">  </PARA>
<PARA>In short, to talk about states' rights in the context of a territory is to demean the currency of federalism. It is galling in the extreme to witness the Paul&hyphen;like conversion of commentators to the principle of states' rights when they have previously dismissed them. They supported federal intervention to take away land management decisions from a state&mdash;denying a clean hydro&hyphen;power scheme in favour of fossil fuels under the ludicrous guise of an international responsibility to the environment&mdash;or the interference in a state's right to determine its own criminal code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet on a subject dealing with the issue of life and death of Australian citizens, we are suddenly confronted by a frenzied breast-beating and chanting of not states rights but territory rights. Those who oppose the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill on states rights grounds look with absolute amazement at the disingenuous arguments and intellectual dishonesty of those now promoting the new found concept of territory rights whilst they retain a strange silence on states rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case for the states retaining their legislative provinces is a lot stronger, indeed overwhelming, given the founding fathers' drafting of the constitution and its acceptance by our forebears through referenda. The real effort ought be put into restoring the federal balance which has been so badly undermined by international treaty making, so-called international jurisprudence and our own High Court's desire to play politician legislator rather than judge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of woolly thinking has given expression to this claim of territory rights. In applying this concept in the context of states rights there has been a demeaning of federalism and a misunderstanding of our constitutional history and the role of the territories. Requests to uphold the integrity of the constitution and the federal balance are welcome but simultaneously severely undermined when those same requests embrace the territories for which the Commonwealth parliament has a clear and unambiguous legislative responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like state governments that can sack local councils, amalgamate them and foist their own planning legislation on them, this federal <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament must similarly determine whether or not to deal with a creation of its legislation&mdash;the territories&mdash;in a like fashion. That is an appropriate consideration and a matter which ought exercise our collective mind as a federal parliament. But in exercising our mind on this matter, we should not obfuscate the debate and our considerations by hiding behind an intellectually unsustainable argument by appealing to territory rights which have no basis in constitutional law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that this parliament has the clear and unambiguous right to legislate in relation to the territories, the only question remaining is whether it should exercise that clear and unambiguous right. I would assert to this parliament that it should only do so on the rarest of occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, when no other equivalent country or state has legislated in a similar manner and when the legislation deals with the most fundamental issue facing its citizenry, that of life and death, I believe we have the firm foundation required for justifying the exercise of the Commonwealth's clear and unambiguous power&mdash;a power granted not by dubious international treaties or contorted High Court decisions but from the power specifically crafted and provided to us as a parliament by our founding fathers and accepted by our forebears in referenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federalism and the role of the states in our Australian body politic are commodities too precious to be diluted by ill&hyphen;considered notions of territory rights. In short, territories ain't states. Let the debate continue on whether this parliament ought exercise its clear and unambiguous powers on the merits of the euthanasia issue.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian workers are really asking about their futures given the debate that is going on in this place and in the Australian community. They know that there will be a major upheaval in their working lives as a result of the major changes to the Industrial Relations Commission, the award system and the right to take effective collective action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5171">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent weeks we have heard how the Democrats have negotiated some changes to improve what is essentially a bad and regressive piece of legislation. I accept that the Democrats have negotiated in good faith and they have won some concessions. It is only reasonable to acknowledge that. However, it seems that, while concentrating on a number of well meaning principles, they have actually lost sight of the practical implications of making an already highly complex piece of legislation even more difficult to follow and certainly less accessible to ordinary workers. Mr McMullan has said in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change represents a threat to the security of working conditions for millions of Australian workers, particularly those who depend upon the award for their actual rather than merely their minimum conditions, which is about one-third of Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In case you thought that somehow or other the deal between the Australian government and the Democrats might have protected workers in this case, it is far from the truth. All that deal does is reduce by two the number of award conditions that will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers will lose access to dozens of current award entitlements . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He gave one example in the hospitality industry. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is evident, on the face of it, that at least 16 conditions provided for under that award will disappear as a result of this legislation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is even allowing for those concessions that the Democrats claim to have won.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the very time that Australian workers most need the guaranteed protection of the Industrial Relations Commission, the award system and their trade union, fundamental equity structures are being undermined. The Australian Democrats, to give them their due, have always in the past stood up for equity. I believe that, in negotiating the terms of the agreement&mdash;certainly Senator Kernot put in an enormous number of hours to get a deal, a resolution&mdash;the Democrats have had to compromise, and what they have done has made the practical implementation of this legislation an absolute minefield of uncertainty and contradiction. I believe the government is now <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wavering in its comprehension and understanding of precisely how its altered legislation will actually function.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of us in this place have made speeches in the past about a range of legislation. We have made them with good intent. We have been well&hyphen;meaning, as I believe Senator Kernot has been. But it is not until we get into the nitty&hyphen;gritty, the practicalities of what we have done with this legislation and how it will impact on the community, that some of us have been left red&hyphen;faced about our speeches on the second reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some constructive concessions have been won by the Democrats at the nitty&hyphen;gritty level but, because of compromise, it is now more complex. There are people who simply cannot answer basic questions about how some of the changes will impact on ordinary workers, particularly women workers, and how workers will go about guaranteeing their protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that the government is uncertain and wavering. Look at what we have seen in the last week or so: the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has been sitting in the advisers box, not quite biting his fingernails but looking very nervous as his advisers speak&mdash;not to the minister, not to the minister representing the minister but to the parliamentary secretary. I have no wish to criticise the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Senator Campbell). I think he is doing a hard job with his normal competence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are told that this is the government's major piece of reform legislation yet the minister has to sit in the box to make sure that the advisers get it right in order that the parliamentary secretary gets it right. Where is the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), the minister who represents the minister in this chamber? Isn't he able to come? Doesn't he understand the implications of the legislative changes as negotiated with the Democrats? Why isn't he in here? It seems to me extraordinary.

One of the reasons Senator Reynolds is speaking today rather than during consideration of the bill is to try to facilitate that debate. So I would say to Senator Abetz that I doubt that it is in the government's interests to try to make a debating point rather than a point of order.

However, I was simply making the point that when we are discussing indus trial relations it is important that we consider all of the issues that are being debated in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find as I go around the community that there are a number of issues being raised with me. Quite clearly, there is great confusion about the future nature of industrial relations entitlements in this country. I have some questions that have been asked of me by Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are asking, for example, about equal remuneration. They are asking: will workers have access to both the Industrial Relations Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and in what order will they have access to those two institutions? Will going to the Industrial Relations Commission to clarify a matter of entitlement preclude their going to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, or vice versa? That is very confusing. They are asking whether they will have access to both; in which order they will be able to appeal; how long that process will take and how they will be jeopardised in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to many part&hyphen;time and casual workers, one question I received the other day was about the introduction that Senator Kernot has won, in one of her conditions, of the predictability of the number of hours. The query was how that provision will operate. How will families access that provision at short notice in the event of child illness? Is `casual' merely another word for part&hyphen;time? Will the benefits of permanent part&hyphen;time work disappear as whole industries become casualised? Will Australia follow the United States where workers are having to take on not just two but three and four casual jobs in order to survive, because of the limits to their entitlements to permanent part&hyphen;time work?</PARA>

Will the Demo crats, for example, continue to support ILO convention 156 which does give workers with responsibilities special provision, special attention, to have flexibility and recognition by employers?

<TIME.STAMP>(1.12 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those senators who have been here for a while would be familiar with my interest in the regulation of financial institutions in Queensland. On previous occasions I have questioned the capacity and willingness of the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision to competently and diligently perform its regulatory responsibilities, especially in relation to the Queensland Professional Credit Union Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again want to draw the Senate's attention to the composition of the financial systems inquiry, which is being promoted by the federal government, and point out that one of the members of that inquiry, Professor Jeffrey Carmichael, is the past chairman of the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision. The Senate would recall that I have questioned the competence of that office on more than one occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an illustration of the problems which the financial systems inquiry has within it, problems which I believe are making it impossible for that inquiry to have any credible outcome. In response to calls for public submissions to that inquiry, some of my constituents have placed before the inquiry certain information based on the ineffectiveness of the watchdog and a request for Professor Carmichael to be discharged in the interests of procedural fairness. The information placed before the inquiry draws attention to alleged serious failures of the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision in relation to breaches of the criminal code and its failure as a regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The surprising thing is that my constituents who made this particular submission were notified that their submission was initially considered public and then they found it was withheld from public scrutiny, whereas 99 per cent of submissions were readily available. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5174"> The financial systems inquiry is dragging its heels in assessing the appropriateness of some submissions for public access. Some six weeks have passed and the particular submission which I am talking about remains hidden from public view. All of these tactics are applied under the guise of lack of privilege and the potential for defamation. I believe it is a disgraceful attempt to bury unfavourable information, and it renders the financial systems inquiry a farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats ask: is the financial systems inquiry simply a ridiculous rigmarole with a predetermined outcome? I am concerned that, given the inability of the inquiry to run a straight course, it will invariably run into a conflict of interests and deliver non&hyphen;credible recommendations. Financial institutions might well have a substantial investment in the outcome of this inquiry, but with this liability on board: they will be lucky to salvage the cost of their contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian depositors and investors have had enough of the deregulation sleight of hand of the past two decades and of the abject failure of watchdogs of banking institutions to raise a bark, let alone bite the bad practitioners. Given the enormous funds invested in superannuation savings, competent and diligent regulation of the financial sector is a must in the coming decades. The spectre of failures, similar to the US Savings and Loan fiasco or to the United Kingdom Maxwell superannuation fund, looms large in Australia without a diligent regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing is certain in my mind, and that is that the credibility of credit unions and building societies is diminished by the Queensland situation. No doubt there are parties in the banking sector that may benefit from all this, but we are all the losers when confidence, diversity and competition diminish. What is the big secret that the financial systems inquiry is perhaps trying to hide? My constituents have put it thus to the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Building Societies and Credit Unions should not be responsible for the management of superannuation funds in any form on the basis that the regulator of those institutions (QOFS) is not capable of acting on complaints from members and shareholders of these financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Matters that we&mdash; <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>my constituents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have raised go to the very essence of the rule of law in Australia; a person has been victimised by a financial institution following his giving of evidence to a Queensland Commission of inquiry and when confronted with this evidence, the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision did not act. Even though the financial regulation that it was responsible for may not have been sufficient to act (a possibility that is hardly tenable) there is an onus upon that organisation to bring the matter of a breach of the Criminal Code to a competent authority. The Queensland Office of Financial Supervision failed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With all of the publicity and promotion of the Australian Financial Institutions Code, we put it to you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I would put it to the Senate, on behalf of my constituents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that we have a legitimate expectation that the regulator will regulate in accordance with the law. It has been our experience that the regulator is a failure in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our contention that in the case of QOFS the foundation of regulation&mdash;being based on financial contributions from those that are subject to regulation is a farce. There can be no respectable arms length between the two. There is also a distinct possibility of the `revolving door syndrome' whereby professionals move between regulator and industry with the result that professionals are subjected to cultural pressure to adopt a blurred interpretation of their responsibility and erroneous client identification.</PARA>
<PARA>Senators may recall that, in 1993, a member of the QPCU gave evidence to the Senate Committee on Superannuation regarding irregular transactions in the Queensland Professional Officers Association super fund by four of its beneficiaries. At least one of the directors of the QPCU was also the beneficiary of the irregular pay&hyphen;out by the QPOA super fund. The Senate Committee on Superannuation discovered that the benefit request forms, which apparently contained misleading information, were missing from National Mutual, the fund manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same member who gave evidence to the Senate committee also gave evidence to the Queensland Cook inquiry. Thereafter, the member was dismissed as a member of the QPCU. This dismissal action was alleged to be a breach of the privileges of the Australian Senate&mdash;it was referred to the Senate Standing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5175"> Committee on Privileges&mdash;the Commissions of Inquiry Act of Queensland, the rules of natural justice and the rules of the QPCU. When the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges considered aspects of the QPCU behaviour, they found the explanation of the QPCU to be `disingenuous', and they reported that the committee had `little doubt' that such a withdrawal of membership was a `reprisal'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same member, Kevin Lindeberg, has never received a satisfactory outcome from the regulator of building societies and credit unions. This example illustrates the reasons why Australians are cynical about the underlying motives behind self&hyphen;regulation. This saga poses the question: does the current practice of regulation of financial institutions seek to exempt itself from the moral consensus of the rule of law in favour of that other principle of liberal democracy, the freedom of the individual? In so doing, they betray the legitimate expectation and trust of citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the current annual report of the QPCU, it appears that the general manager of that organisation is receiving a salary&mdash;including superannuation&mdash;in excess of $160,000 per year, and that a motor vehicle and expenses are provided in addition to that. The general manager's salary has risen from $110,000 in 1994 to $130,000 in 1995, and is now in excess of $160,000 per year. This is of the same order as the salary of the Premier of Queensland or that of the Prime Minister of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Such raiding of members' funds is extraordinary for senior executives in the credit union sector, and is an affront to typical wage earners. Members might recall that this was the same general manager who tried to convert his long service leave and annual leave to a direct superannuation deposit, in order to reduce income tax. I spoke of this in my speech to the Senate on 2 May 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really must ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) what his expectations of the FSI inquiry are. Given that that inquiry has now reduced itself to the status of a lame duck, will he now abandon the exercise and institute a process with parliamentary privilege and some semblance of procedural fairness and open discussion? The confidence of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> investors and depositors is paramount, if Australians are to respond to the call for increased savings. Without a credible process, any report from the financial systems inquiry will be devoid of credibility, providing cosy protection for powerful mates but doing nothing for those who do not belong to the ruling financial elite. Australians are sick of the ideology of deregulation which leaves them vulnerable to the kind of rip&hyphen;offs I have described.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(1.24 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments concerning female workers in the workplace. Mr Acting Deputy President, I have noted the earlier comments made by your predecessor in the chair, and I wish to address my comments in the context of principle, power and politics. I have had cause to review, over the past three or four days, the first speeches of a number of senators in this place: in particular, the first speeches of the senators who represent the Australian Democrats party. All of those senators made very high&hyphen;sounding and principled comments, as one would expect in their first speech; and, indeed, the same comments can be made of nearly all senators in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Almost without exception, however, the senators from the Australian Democrats chose in their contributions to address the issue of feminism and of females in the workplace, leaving the home and taking their rightful place in our community, in our institutions and in our structures. They all acknowledged that they had received considerable assistance from both males and females in their communities and in their parties in their formative years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, indeed, made a plea that as the youngest person to enter the Australian Senate she spoke on behalf of the youth of our country. Senator Stott Despoja said, in her first sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I rise in this chamber today as the youngest woman ever elected to a federal parliament. It is an honour that I cherish but for no longer than it takes other young women to be chosen by an electorate . . .  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5176"> </PARA>
<PARA>So Senator Stott Despoja clearly put her cards on the table. Senator Allison, in making her maiden speech only two months ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another reason why I am here is because of my passionate belief that women should share equally in decision making. I am immensely proud to be part of a strong team of women, so ably lead by women, and I am proud to represent a political party which finds its female majority unremarkable.</PARA>
<PARA>They are fine sentiments, high principles, and those persons are to be congratulated for achieving the heights that they have. But, as a necessity, allied to that achievement of power and the exercise of power is the exercise of that power in accordance with principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those speeches, those female senators outlined the principles that guide their life and that would dictate the conduct of their affairs in this place&mdash;principles no different, indeed, from those of a number of other senators. A number of senators on this side have a very strong union background and they have repeatedly articulated that they believe in the collective, they believe in trade unionism and they seek to put forward those objectives in this place. Senator Harradine has repeatedly made comments addressing the issues of abortion and family matters, and they are high principles also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be most disappointed if our union representatives in this place departed from their declared principles. We would be most surprised if Senator Harradine departed from the principles that he has articulated in this chamber over a period of 20 years. I have been surprised that the five female senators in the Australian Democrats have deliberately chosen to depart from the principles that they have articulated publicly, privately and on the public record in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make particular reference to the role of female workers in the workplace, by and large unskilled, by and large without high levels of education and often without the opportunity to progress through a career path. They seek simple things: a fair go, security in employment, guarantees of continuing employment, guarantees in the allocations of hours and regularity in rosters. These are not unremarkable demands and every other person in this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> place would accept them as the norm. Female workers, particularly those at the bottom end of the chain, need those things because they have a dual commitment. They have a work commitment that raises finances to fund their families and they have an obvious family commitment to their partners and to their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people suggest that that is in a process of change and that things will become much more equal over time. My view is that, much as the institutions and structures of society change, the role of females in the family will continue to be a caring and nurturing role. It might change and go into other areas, but that will still be a task that falls to them. Accordingly, if they are to enter the workplace, if they are to carry out tasks in the workplace, they need strong support in the family to carry out their caring and nurturing activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that female workers in the retail, hospitality, cleaning and service industries need is the knowledge of regularity of hours and the guarantee of continuing hours. It has been clearly demonstrated in a range of reports, and by every day observations, that these workers do not have a high level of skills, that by and large they are poorly educated and that they are confined to sectors of work that do not have a high wage. The flexibility that is sought by employers, and articulated by a range of interests in this place, is sometimes not the flexibility that they need. They need guarantees and securities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The litany of complaints that I had from female workers over my 15 years as a union official in the retail industry can be reduced to two or three basics. They were not significantly complaints about the award or about the levels of salary&mdash;although, more was always desirable, but it was not a pressing issue&mdash;but that, as casuals or non full&hyphen;time workers, there was no guarantee of hours and no maximum number of hours in their employment contract. They had no ability to plan into the future or the ability to determine their own future in both their family life and their work life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5177">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Female workers repeatedly said to me that they were unable to arrange finance from banking and finance institutions because they did not have set hours, a maximum number of hours, that they could guarantee as income to repay their loans. Because of that, as casual workers, they were unable to access building societies and banks, unable to purchase homes or to fund repayments of mortgage loans. They were denied a place in our community because they had no maximum hours and hence could not persuade a bank manager or a bank clerk that they were deserving of a loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the retail industry, the norm in all state awards and agreements, and federal awards and agreements was a minimum of 10 hours per week and a maximum of 30 hours to 34 hours per week, often converted to a fortnightly roster or a monthly roster to give flexibility. In all my time as a union official, representing tens of thousands of people, I never had a complaint that a maximum of 32 or 34 hours per week, or a minimum of nine, 10 or 12 hours per week was inadequate or oppressive or did not give access to sufficient income or could not be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The marketplace in that industry determined a result, by negotiation, of a minimum of nine to 12 hours and a maximum of 28 to 34 hours per week. This result was achieved over many years, not through arbitration and not through strikes, but by negotiation. It was a result that was acceptable to the work force, by and large a female work force, and it was a result that was acceptable to the major and minor employers in the industry. The only company that I ever recall seeking more than 32 hours a week was David Jones and that was for reasons particular to that company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that, in the context of looking after female workers, low&hyphen;paid workers and those who do not have great ability to advance their own interest, one would consult with those persons before seeking changes. Indeed, the theme of consultation, of talking, of setting up structures to facilitate those objectives is a recurring feature in many of the speeches given by the female senators of the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, it is a fine sentiment that is often difficult to convert to practice and, in a range of issues under discussion lately, it has been deliberately ignored. In fact, the word `betrayal' comes strongly to mind when describing the actions of those female senators in betraying their own gender and those people whom they profess to look after and whose interests they profess to advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a betrayal of their own principles; a betrayal of feminist principles. It is also a betrayal of the basic fundamentals that they say they stand for and would seek to advance in this place. But, when it comes to the test, when the power is there, they choose to avoid it and to use it for other purposes. The betrayal of those principles, in respect of female workers, by those female senators would be akin to Senator Harradine taking money to change his position on the abortion vote, and no&hyphen;one in this place would ever suggest that such a thing would occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, apparently, when it applies to female workers, the female representatives of the Australian Democrats&mdash;Senator Allison, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Kernot&mdash;do not think it is important. It was not important because two days of headlines in the national press were pleasing, and gratifying and showed flexibility. Sometimes those things are not sufficient and what is more important is attachment to principle and articulation of principle, particularly when it is those principles that have brought those persons into this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is entirely proper in this matter of public interest to address that concept of principle, power and politics and to make pertinent references to the role of the various parties in this place, as they address issues of public concern in the public forum. They have repeatedly said that they seek to attach themselves to that mast. Indeed, Senator Allison concluded her first speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look forward to the day when women will cross the floor in solidarity and when the strength of argument regularly influences the vote. Madam President, I look forward to my term of office.</PARA>
<PARA>In the first instance, when Senator Allison could have chosen to exercise her principle, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5178"> she failed. Senator Stott Despoja, in her first speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I can speak at all for the youth of this country it is to say that we want to respect our institutions and our leaders and we want to pursue change that makes individuals free and able to pursue their hopes and dreams whatever their circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Fine sentiments. When referring to the Youth Poll she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It shows a very caring generation&mdash;caring about employment prospects and concerned about their families and teenage suicide levels . . . However, it is true that young people show disdain for politicians and are cynical about the political process. The Youth Poll shows that only 1.5 per cent of young people trust us.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not surprising, when Senator Stott Despoja is leading the charge to betray youth workers in the retail industry and in the hospitality industry and deny them guarantees to maximum hours of employment, and deny them finance, banking and the opportunity to purchase homes. They are denying single mothers the opportunity to participate fully in our society and married couples the opportunity to plan their futures. That is the legacy that the female senators in the Australian Democrats leave with us today.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it plain at the beginning of my contributions this afternoon that I do not know Malcolm McGregor, a columnist reporter with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> . To the best of my knowledge, I have never spoken with him on a face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face basis or over the telephone so I do not carry a brief for Mr McGregor whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week, I referred to an article of Mr McGregor's that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 30 October, which was highlighted `Howard's shameful silence'. I also referred to other newspaper articles, something that I have done from time to time, in my period of serving in this parliament and in this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make those points because I am not getting up defending Mr McGregor, who was the subject of a very virulent attack by way of a letter in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> from none other than Senator Nick <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minchin, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. I found it extraordinary that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister should have time available to respond and react to the comments of Mr McGregor in that article. I found it a very useful article and I actually quoted from part of it last week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He will have plenty to do if he is going to respond to each and every article in the media during that period which called on the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Howard, to take a lead in the race debate that was abounding in the country then. Mr McGregor's article was but one article that appeared over that period calling on Mr Howard to say something, to take leadership in the debate, to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mike Seccombe had something to say about Mr Howard in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 29 October. His article, on page 9, was under the heading, `Howard softly strokes the wildcat of politics'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> newspaper, also from Sydney, had a commentary by Peter Robinson on 27 October under the headline, `It's time to speak out', which was a clear reference to Mr Howard. The article began:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE more John Howard twists and turns with the racism issue, the more he exposes his inability to understand exactly what the fuss is all about.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Minchin could have responded to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  newspaper, whose editorial on Monday, 28 October was entitled `The past may not be over'. The final paragraph of that editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On issues as sensitive as race, a Prime Minister cannot afford to be intimidated by those who stand for divisiveness rather than reconciliation. For the sake of all Australian, it is hoped that Mr Howard will find the courage to take the lead in opposing those who stand with Ms Hanson.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> , way back on 10 October, had an editorial under the headline `Howard has to reply on Hanson'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 8 October had a editorial entitled `Racism: time to curb rhetoric'. In the body of the editorial it said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5179">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Howard should have been clearer and firmer in his response to the comments of Ms Hanson, who has said that Aborigines are not the most disadvantaged group in the country, that Australia is in danger of being swamped by Asians and that our foreign aid and immigration programs should be stopped. Such comments are shallow, ignorant and contrary to our national interests. There was some logic in Mr Howard's initial refusal to respond to Ms Hanson since that could have elevated her views beyond their significance. But Mr Howard's strategy hasn't worked&mdash;despite his reticence, Ms Hanson has received a mountain of publicity.</PARA>
<PARA>These are but a small selection of many newspaper articles that appeared in the period leading into last Wednesday's debate in the other place and, indeed, in this place on a resolution that was carried unanimously in both houses on the subject of racism and reconciliation. I am very pleased to have been a part of that, although we did not have the opportunity to speak here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, though, that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister should take time out of what should be a very busy schedule. But, as Senator Evans said, native title is not going anywhere and there are a whole number of things Senator Minchin has responsibility for that are not going anywhere. So he responds to one particular individual whom I have never met but whose articles I certainly do enjoy reading from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder if Senator Minchin is also going to reply to what I think was a brilliant article by Alan Ramsey that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> last Saturday, 2 November. It was entitled `Replay of `88 to haunt Howard'. There was another article next to that one which related the events that occurred in 1988 and was entitled `Racist "missile" finds its mark eight years on'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something very disturbing in our society, which unfortunately, according to articles and for those of us that lived through the debates at the time, seems to be being repeated now. For example, Mr Ramsey has this to say in his article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing has changed in the latest debate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He is referring to 1996 as opposed to 1988. He continues:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither have the opinion polls. In August 1988 public support for less Asian immigration was 77 per cent in one published poll and 82 per cent in another. A Hawke government&hyphen;sponsored inquiry into Australian attitudes found, in part: `Racism is by no means excised from Australia. The potential for bigotry sleeps within most individuals and racism in many forms pervades our society.'</PARA>
<PARA>Malcolm Fraser was referred to in the article as well. Mr Ramsey says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Malcolm Fraser, now a critic of Howard's failure to be more forthright against Pauline Hanson's ignorance, was just as vocal against him eight years ago. So were three State Liberal leaders, a number of churchmen, a wad of newspaper editorials, umpteen pundits and all the ethnic groups. There were outbreaks of yobbo racism: cars sprayed, houses daubed, a garage burnt down in Adelaide, and wide media reportage of `ugly incidents' in which Asians were `abused and spat at'.</PARA>
<PARA>It is unfortunate that some things do repeat themselves in later years. With the carriage of the resolution in the parliament of Australia last week, with bipartisan support, I hope that many of the events referred to here will not recur in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is interesting to reflect on the events leading into last Wednesday's debate. The resolution was an agreed resolution between the main political parties. But it was an initiative of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, to have the motion put forward. He gave notice of it in the House of Representatives some two or three weeks before the actual carriage of the resolution. It was only when the thoughts of the public were expressed through the media&mdash;and I have only referred here to a part of that outrage&mdash;that the Prime Minister, possibly at the influence of his parliamentary secretary, though one would doubt that very much, actually came to the party and agreed to meet a representative of the opposition and to agree on a form of words acceptable to all parties in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of last Saturday, 2 November, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party's doyenne, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, former head of its National Women's Advisory Council had both blame and praise for Mr Howard and the Federal Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, for finally passing a bipartisan motion abhorring racism. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5180"> </PARA>
<PARA>Dame Beryl is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`At this stage I think what they have done is fine, but I only wish they had done it earlier.'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Beazley tried, but Mr Beazley does not have the numbers in the other place in order to press the matter forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we can claim a victory, and all fair&hyphen;minded people in Australia can claim a victory, by the passage of that motion last week. One reason I am very pleased it was passed last week in the House, and carried unanimously, is that when we refer back to the election campaign earlier this year, Ms Hanson is not the only member of parliament who was involved in making racist remarks before the election. Neither is Mr Campbell, a former member of my own party from Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We may recall one candidate for the National Party of Australia, from the state of Queensland, who made some not very complimentary remarks about citizenship ceremonies. I think he referred to them as `de&hyphen;wogging ceremonies'. He was criticised by his leader at the time but retained his candidature for the ongoing election. What was very disappointing at the time was that a sitting member of parliament, another National Party member, Mr Bob Katter, actually went public and defended Mr Burgess for the remarks that he had made. In actual fact, Mr Katter took the matter somewhat further with his comments, which I do not care to repeat in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note with pleasure that it would appear that Mr Katter supported the motion for the joint statement in the House of Representatives last week. I hope that is the case, that he has reflected on some of the earlier remarks that have been attributed to him and that now he and all other members of parliament can fulfil their obligations to the parliament and to the people of Australia, doing everything in their power to end this very damaging debate that is going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say `damaging', I am not referring merely to the economic damage that may be done to our trade with our partners in the region. I think the debate that has been happening, especially some of the contributions from some of the people that have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> participated in it, is damaging the human spirit and the human being. Overall and over time, that will be the greatest damage&mdash;far greater than any economic damage that might result from this debate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address an issue with regard to a matter of public interest. It relates to a commitment that politicians and parties give to people when they go to elections, and the factors on which people vote for individuals and parties in elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance I wish to address the credibility and the commitment of the Liberal and National parties and also the Democrats. Prior to the 2 March election they espoused commitments to the electorate, to the people of Australia. It seems that, once elected, parties take the opportunity to do exactly the opposite of their commitments&mdash;in fact, to renege and/or rat on what they have committed themselves to through their policies and public statements with regard to various issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it rather curious in relation to the Liberal and National parties, the coalition that was elected to government. During the election campaign, the so&hyphen;called `race for the battlers', Mr Howard said that those were the two parties which stood best to represent the battlers of Australia and the workers of Australia. Indeed, he said on many occasions that no worker would be worse off under a Howard led administration. Clearly, however, that is not going to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is worse is the position of the Australian Democrats, who have often claimed themselves to be the custodians of social equity, the party that `keeps the bastards honest', and who have proclaimed on many occasions that they represent those that major parties do not. I find it rather unusual that we now see an alliance between the Democrats and the coalition government on a particular issue that is of such fundamental importance to working and battling Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been addressed by two other senators earlier in the debate on matters of public interest, the question of hours of work for <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5181"> workers is of fundamental importance, particularly for female workers. Quite often, probably in the majority of cases, the families of the battlers have both parents working. Also, it has been put on many occasions that it is of fundamental importance that people have some idea of either the maximum or minimum hours of work that may be required of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen this arrangement put in place in the Senate. I must say that I have the utmost respect for the Democrats, in particular for Senator Kernot. I do have a view in so far as Senator Andrew Murray is concerned that, unfortunately, due to his lack of knowledge of industrial relations in this country and his lack of experience in so far as industrial relations is concerned in this country, he has been well and truly led up the garden path by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Reith. He has then, maybe inadvertently, led the Democrats into a trap that has been set by the government&mdash;one that I feel will at some point in time come back to bite them very severely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just hope that at some point in time, when it is proven that the position that they are currently adopting in supporting the government with regard to industrial relations policy and changes is wrong, when the time comes that they see the error of their ways, they will have the courage of their convictions and of the policy and philosophies that they have espoused, both in this place and to the public in general. I hope that they will have the commitment and the courage to get up and&mdash;if we are still in opposition at that time&mdash;to support us in moving changes to legislation that may ultimately be adopted in this parliament, to ensure that we restore the rightful conditions and protections for workers in this country and, indeed, look after the families of Australia in the way that they deserve to be looked after. That includes male and female workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It really is unacceptable, and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has on many occasions, in a number of speeches, said that the problem with the parliament, and indeed the problem with politicians and with the credibility of political life being so low, arises <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because there is a view amongst the public&mdash;and it is probably true&mdash;that politicians never, ever stand by their word. I think that has been demonstrated, and is being demonstrated in the legislation that is being debated in this chamber at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I appeal to the Democrats, especially to Senator Kernot, at some point in time to reconsider their position. I hope that, when it is proven that the position that they have taken is wrong, that they have made a fundamental error, they will not be frightened but will have a true commitment to the convictions that I hope, at least, that they hold and will assist the opposition in bringing about the changes to restore the rightful protection and conditions for workers in this country that ought to be in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sincerely hope that that sort of approach will not be lost on the Democrats. If they are to play a role, then they ought to play the role that they indicated to the Australian public they would play.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

Do Telstra's war room activities include the manipulation of media and public opinion to advance Telstra's business interests and the government's political interests as part of the privatisation process?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the election their standard variable rates have fallen from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent.

Lower interest rates mean more money for families paying off their mortgages and more money for businesses to invest, expand and employ staff. If banks can cut their variable rates by a bit more than the cut by the Reserve Bank, that is, they can trim their margins, standard variable home rates by the big four banks will be at their lowest level since the mid&hyphen;1970s.

The Prime Minister was saying that he understands that those who give may well be frustrated and disappointed <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5184"> by that. But he is not arguing that the giving should be affected. We try in the delivery of aid through our government services, and the NGOs do also, to minimise the extent of loss but it will, to some extent, occur. That is unfortunate.

For example, there is now one person in the $170,000 to $179,999 range, and one person in the $180,000 to $189,999 range where previously, prior to salary increases, there was none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the headlines, as you correctly mentioned, were totally inconsistent with the article itself. As you quite rightly pointed out, this is the sort of myth that gets perpetuated. I am certainly using every opportunity to refute that myth. I accept your suggestion that such myths should be refuted in the wider community. I am referring to many of the urban myths that seem to exist, such as the one that the Aboriginal people are not the most disadvantaged in our society. That myth should be laid to rest once and for all. Unquestionably, on any criterion, whether it be housing, health, education, employment or, particularly, life expectancy, the Aboriginal people are the most disadvantaged in our society. The longer and the more frequently that all of us within the Senate itself speak out in the wider community, the more we will get that message through so that the various myths that seem to be perpetuated can be overcome by bringing out the truth.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, funded by the Victorian government and substantially by the private industry. It is a critically important area. That is why we established an Information Policy Advisory Council, which had its first meeting last Monday, to bring together leaders in the industry and the community to discuss the future of our country in the information age. The main focus of the meeting was not only a discussion on the overall ongoing role of IPAC and its priorities for action but also a concentration on practical outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already given the council two references. The first relates to the investigation of on-line infrastructure and services development in rural and regional Australia. There is growing demand for on-line services and new network technologies in regional Australia. Telstra is upgrading its nationwide network and a growing number of Internet service providers are operating services to non-metropolitan users. Nonetheless, rural industry and users continue to be constrained in their access to services at affordable prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">IPAC will also investigate the deployment of information and communications services and technologies with the services sector of the economy. It will investigate and advise <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5193"> the government on the implications of network services and technologies for service areas on factors affecting their take-up by businesses within the sector, and steps which the government can take to remove impediments to the deployment of such services on the most productive basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very much looking forward to an early report from that committee, which is being very ably chaired by Dr Terry Cutler. He has provided a number of landmark reports, particularly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commerce in content</EMPHASIS>, which was available to the previous government some 18 months to two years ago. It is therefore very disturbing that Dr Cutler's introductory remarks to IPAC on Monday night effectively commenced with the following address to the members, who are a very illustrious group:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To begin with, we need to have a sense of urgency. We need to make up for 18 months of lost time. Our predecessor body NISC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Mr Keating's National Information Services Council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">met only once and did nothing. Many, many people have commented to me that we have to make up for lost time.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an absolute tragedy that even someone like Mr Keating, who pretended to have an interest in this subject, was only prepared to go to the point of establishing a committee as pure window-dressing and then to have no follow-up at all. To the extent that Mr Keating was not able to be involved, we had Mr Lee who chaired the telecommunications advisory panel. But whenever you asked any members of that panel how it was going, they said, `Mr Lee never says anything.' When Bill Gates was out here about 18 months ago, he spent about an hour with Mr Keating. On his way out he said to one of his aids, `Who was that little boy sitting in the corner who did nothing?' The bloke said, `Don't worry about him. He is just Michael Lee, the Minister for Communications.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is you are a standing joke in this area. You have no commitment to the electronic age. You are not interested in multimedia services. You were not prepared to bring together a body of leading talents in the industry. We are. We only have to have two meetings to double your achievement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party being the advocates for the AMA is a lovely turn of events.

She says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to our conversation of today's date I thought it necessary to confirm to you the reasons for the Committee's decision to, on this rare occasion, not include the Australian Medical Association on the list of those who will provide formal oral evidence to the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considered that the submission provided by the AMA was particularly comprehensive and that the AMA has stated its position clearly and unequivocally since the announcement relating to Medicare Provider Numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore believed that it was important (within the limited time available) to learn the views of other interested parties whose opinions have not had such extensive coverage. (The Committee has four bills before it for consideration in two days and has already sought the unusual step of seeking permission of the Senate to meet while the Senate is sitting, to accommodate the workload).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the time constraints [the Deputy Chairman] Senator Lees offered representatives of the AMA an opportunity to provide one witness who could appear before the Committee together with, for example, the NSW Resident Medical Officers Association.</PARA>
<PARA>I see Senator Lees nodding in agreement. It goes on:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5194">

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Tierney for his question. It deals with just one part of my portfolio that is of great importance to me as it is to other senators on this side of the chamber as it deals with a part of the community who are, unfortunately, some of the least privileged in our community. It is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> helpful to make known to honourable senators that, despite the budget position, left to us by the previous government, with the $8 billion Beazley bankcard black hole, we have maintained the level of funding for the training of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program, known as TAT, at the level equivalent to the previous government's forward estimates for this financial year. One important element of the TAT program is employment strategies where we join in partnership with enterprises to introduce special career development and recruitment arrangements. TAT can provide funding for agreements that put into place the sort of strategies that I have just referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Tierney's question is particularly timely because only today my department was involved in the launch of an important TAT project which is a major venture with the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation. This project, in which the Commonwealth will be spending approximately $2.7 million over the next five years on top of approximately $3.5 million which will be provided by the New South Wales state government, will create 110 positions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over that period. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the five&hyphen;year program, it is anticipated that there will have been created 16 cadetships, 60 traineeships, five apprenticeships, 10 professional staff positions, 15 clerical staff positions and three labourers' positions. The jobs&mdash;and these we anticipate to be real jobs as we are not talking about a 26&hyphen;week training program here&mdash;will be spread out through regional New South Wales in such areas as Dubbo, Orange, Tamworth, Grafton, Wollongong, Wagga Wagga and Albury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In addition to these jobs, the program also includes a range of measures to ensure that there are good retention rates achieved for these recruits and also to ensure that they are provided with training and development opportunities so that they can advance within the career structure. They will start with a real job and advance within the career structure and they will not simply remain at the entry levels within the department. The very important thing about this project is that it is not simply about training for training's sake. This <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5195"> is not a 26&hyphen;week turning mousewheel that we put people through. This is a real job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is working with a major employer to ensure that indigenous people get an opportunity to access employment with real, genuine, career prospects: in other words, these people&mdash;on the day they commence work under this strategy&mdash;are recruited to a real job. At the same time, we will ensure that the appropriate support is in place so that as many as possible of these recruits stay in the work force and progress in the work force. This is the sort of model that is very much consistent with the principles of this government. It is the sort of partnership that we will be pursuing in future years with employers and particurlarly with private sector employers throughout the country to advance the opportunities in employment for indigenous Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr this day, relating to the public relations activities of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>Three weeks ago, Elaine Brown, administrator of the war room at Telstra, in the commercial and consumer division, wrote to a series of executives outlining Telstra's strategy for public opinion manipulation and the identification of a number of journalists that were causing Telstra a few difficulties. She also identified critics and sought to marginalise critics of Telstra and in so doing establish not just a small question arising out of discussion about the Internet services but an opening of a window on the way in which Telstra is currently operating. It is operating in such a manner as to facilitate the government's political priorities and its political objectives while, at the same time, advancing its business interests in the lead&hyphen;up to privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everything that occurs in Telstra in the current environment is aimed at the ultimate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objective of privatisation. Already, without a motion being passed by this Senate and without a law being enacted by this parliament, the actions of this government are distorting all the actions of Telstra throughout its every business unit. This document highlights that all actions of a politically sensitive nature now have to be cleared with the minister's office. This document highlights the fact that, in the run&hyphen;up to privatisation, quite clearly they are concerned about the opposition. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the run&hyphen;up to privatisation the opposition will be seeking opportunities to demonstrate that Telstra's behaviour as a fully commercially focused entity will place commercial before public interest. It is therefore imperative that Telstra advises the minister's office in advance of initiatives that may be politically sensitive.</PARA>
<PARA>What we see from these documents is that, quite clearly, Telstra has entered into the political debate. A publicly funded corporation, run for public benefit, is involving itself in the political debate on the issues that are before this parliament in such a way as just not to present a public interest but to present the commercial interest of the statutory corporation and in a manner that seeks to identify critics, to marginalise them and to highlight&mdash;in a politically unethical manner&mdash;devices by which public opinion can be manipulated and the interests of Telstra and the government can be advanced in so doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It just so happens that they have identified four specialist journalists in terms of this particular document. John Hilvert of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Peter Young of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Computer World</EMPHASIS>, Charles Wright of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and Sue Lowe of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> have been identified. This document clearly sets out the strategies that are being pursued, seeking to isolate, to marginalise, to identify what they regard and this government obviously regard as unreasonable critics and to specify manners by which their opinions can be marginalised and corralled in such a way as to advance the interests of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document clearly demonstrates that Telstra has now entered the political debate in a manner that will seek to advance their position, often while inaccurate and misleading propaganda is being presented. Public <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5196"> attention is being diverted away from the issues which go to the effect of the business operations of Telstra, particularly within the context of privatisation. We are concerned that this now follows a pattern. We have already seen, in terms of the Senate inquiry, project mercury being established and followed through. We have also seen project straw man with regard to the research laboratories in Melbourne. We now have the war room.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A report in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun </EMPHASIS>by Clinton Porteous reveals that a secret strategy to counter the media and industry criticism has been established. A war room has been established to manage information and to seek to distort it in such a way as to protect the government from any action that might surprise the government during the Telstra privatisation debate. This article identifies that the war room is expecting not only to not achieve a full 100 per cent cessation of hostilities between Telstra and its Internet service providers but also to manipulate opinion in such a way as to marginalise any critics. It is singling out and diverting attention away from the key issues. For a public corporation to be involved in such practices is in itself totally inappropriate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by my colleague Senator Carr regarding the answer given by Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, to him at question time today. First, it was clear from the minister's answer that he either did not know, or he made out he did not know, of the existence of this document, which has come into the possession of the opposition and is now being made available. It is an interesting document. It is dated 22 October and is headed `From Elaine Brown, War Room Administrator'. If you were dealing with the Department of Defence, you might have a war room, or if you were an aficionado for the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dr Strangelove</EMPHASIS> , you may have one. However, there really is something culturally wrong in an organisation such as Telstra, which is government owned, creating something called a war room and naming an officer as the administrator of it. It gives quite <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an unhappy presentation to the public about how Telstra sees the way it should handle its public relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Carr said, over the last seven or eight months since the new government came into office, we have had these new developments of Project Mercury and Project Straw Man. They are projects aimed at overcoming a difficulty or promoting a new arrangement that advantages Telstra. They want to advantage Telstra by achieving the political, ideological end of this government, which is the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The document, though mentioning issues relating to the Internet, is really about marginalising those who criticise Telstra. Telstra may be somewhat successful, because they are a very big player in the communications network of Australia. They hold around 90 per cent of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston would say that that is what you get from a government-owned institution. He is the minister. He has the power to direct. You would have thought he would set out the ethics for the operation of Telstra when they start developing these sorts of projects. But, no&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the moment, they are briefing him. The document identifies the key stakeholders as the minister's office and Mr Paul Fletcher, the person who should be contacted and involved in discussions over Telstra strategy. This means that the minister's office is directly involved in commercial activities, which affects relations with journalists. You cannot convince this opposition that there is not a political intent in the involvement of the minister's office in these arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister were open and transparent, he would knock on the head these sorts of projects and say to Telstra, `Get on with developing your commercial interests in an open and transparent way with reasonable and decent ethics.' That is not what this minister has been about. He has been happy to be involved in the discussion about this. Certainly his office has been identified as being involved. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5197">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a further justification for maintaining Telstra in public ownership. If Telstra were privatised, with its dominant market power being around 90 per cent, and let loose with this sort of approach to running its business in Australia without reference to the Australian public other than through the Stock Exchange, the national interest would be seriously weakened. That is one reason why we strongly support Telstra being publicly owned. Because it has 90 per cent of the business of telecommunications in Australia, it ought to be responsible to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra should not get involved in the sort of grubby exercise that is outlined in this document, which refers to a war room administrator. It should not finger particular journalists who have to be lobbied or, if they are not successfully converted to Telstra's view, marginalised. It is not an acceptable level of ethics for any organisation in  Australia, particularly for a government-owned enterprise. We believe that this is one case where the minister should openly state that this is unacceptable and tell Telstra to get on with the job of running a successful telecommunications business in an open and transparent way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support my colleague Senator Carr in taking note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) at question time today. It is quite interesting to see this document that Senator Carr has circulated, because it really confirms all the fears about the privatisation of Telstra that have been expressed by both me and my colleagues in this chamber. It also expresses all the fears and concerns that were quite well articulated in the inquiry report that was completed only a few weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one issue that really needs addressing straight up, and that is whether the minister's ignorance of this issue is in fact feigned or real. This begs the question. The document states that the briefing to the key government and regulatory authorities, which are specifically listed in the document as including the minister's office as well as the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ACCC, the broadcasting authority, and the department, all occurred in mid&hyphen;September. I put on the record that there is still a question hanging over whether or not the minister's office has had the brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That takes me to the next point, which is if the minister's office has had a brief, has it taken the time and the opportunity to fill the minister in on these very important issues. My colleague Senator Schacht highlighted, quite correctly, what sort of culture has been bred within Telstra. Quite obviously, Telstra is in the complete mind&hyphen;set of moving towards full privatisation. You will notice that this document does not refer to partial privatisation; it refers to privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, this is nothing new to us, as members of the Labor opposition. It just confirms the position we have taken on it. But it really exposes the position taken by the government, that the partial privatisation is in fact, as we know, the first step to full privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of other issues that are worthy of extracting and highlighting from this document. With regard to this Internet strategy, Telstra not only is the provider of the wholesale bandwidth of the Internet service providers but also it has been positioning itself for quite some time as a retail provider. Telstra is looking to establish itself as an Internet service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document represents the re&hyphen;positioning they have had to do since they first got such a negative response in taking on the Internet service providers generally. It is a very interesting point that the ACCC is so high up on their list of briefings. In fact, straight after the minister's office you have the Department of Communications and the Arts. One would hope that they were considered important enough to be briefed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next one in line is in fact the ACCC. The ACCC would need to be dealt with pretty early on if this strategy were to be implemented, because it raises very serious issues about how Telstra positions itself with respect to competition policy. To have what is a public entity in the considerable position of market domination now manoeuvring itself in anticipation of privatisation to become not only the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5198"> wholesale provider of bandwidth to Internet service providers but in fact a retail competitor of such services, the endorsement, acknowledgment or approval of the ACCC is in fact quite fundamental to this whole strategy. This whole strategy, to me, is about Telstra positioning itself to make money, to make a profit, and to define and secure the market share of Internet usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no surprise to anyone in this chamber that Internet usage is on an exponential growth curve. Whoever positions themselves in quite a secure way over the next short period of time, particularly in the lead&hyphen;up to the July 1997 changes, will do so in the knowledge that they will secure a solid income stream from their particular service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, back to the question of where this leaves the Internet service providers, the current ISPs. The bottom line is that Telstra has got these service providers, these businesses that have set themselves up to on&hyphen;sell bandwidth, where they want them. This is unfortunate for them, and it is unfortunate that the privatisation of Telstra will lead to the reduction of competition in that sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), to a question without notice asked by Senator Neal today, relating to the appearance of representatives of the Australian Medical Association before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>There was some mirth expressed by Senator Newman in response to this question on the basis that she seemed to think it was somehow humorous that the opposition, the Australian Labor Party, should defend the right of the AMA to speak to a committee in relation to a matter that they were concerned about. Frankly, I find that amusement really quite out of place. It certainly has been the view of the ALP, whether or not they agreed with the views of those members of the community, that they should always have the opportunity <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to address an issue that is going to affect them quite severely, and certainly this is the case in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which is presently being considered by the committee, has a major effect not only on medical practitioners at large but particularly in relation to medical graduates who have undertaken their course and who, in future, may well have their right to practice adversely affected by the changes that are contained in this bill. I am certain that a number of practising doctors in this chamber, on both sides, would be very aware of that and would certainly be very aware of the anger and upset in the community, particularly by those trainee doctors and medical undergraduates. In fact, I understand that at the moment&mdash;and this has been happening throughout the week&mdash;industrial action is being taken in a number of places to express those views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of the very strong feelings that have been expressed through this industrial action and by way of submissions that a number of people made to me, I feel very strongly that it should have been appropriate for the committee to allow the AMA to address it. I was provided with a copy of the letter that was sent by the chairman of the committee to the AMA. I was grateful to receive that. But, in my view, it is not sufficient or satisfactory to say that an exhaustive submission in a written form to a committee is a satisfactory substitution for the opportunity for a group to put, in person and orally, their views and to express strongly their emotions about how it is going to affect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of dispute and different views expressed about the number of medical graduates who are going to be affected by this change. In my view, medical graduates are going to be affected. The change to this legislation means that graduates will no longer be able to do their intern year, then go out to practice and receive a Medicare provider number until they have done a general practitioner course, which will take them, in most cases, a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose on the face of it that is appealing. No-one would argue that further training is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5199"> inappropriate or would not assist patients at large, but the difficulty is that most medical graduates, after having spent six years training, will not be able to receive any remuneration unless they are able to obtain a position in a hospital. A position may or may not be available to them in their area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am of the view that these changes are particularly unfair in that they take effect immediately. The changes are not deferred until present medical graduates have come through and received their provider numbers. They take effect immediately. Just for one moment put yourself in the position of medical undergraduates who have done, say, five years study and are waiting to do their intern year next year and suddenly  discover that before they can practise they may have to do somewhere between three and five years further training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are three areas where it has particular impact. One relates to graduates who may want to supplement their incomes while they do their training. That is quite a common occurrence. They may fill in in out of hours clinics or with a doctor who is going away on holidays. They may also do late night sections. They cannot do that under the new regime. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond not to the substance of the legislation that Senator Neal was just talking about but to the question that Senator Neal put to Senator Newman at question time. It goes to the heart of why the Australian Medical Association was not on this occasion called to give evidence before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. I have been on this committee for eight or 10 years&mdash;I am not too sure of the exact time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> This would be one of the rare occasions, if not the only occasion, that the Australian Medical Association has not been called to give evidence on an issue that relates to the medical profession. The interesting thing is that, on this occasion, we have so many submissions in relation to not only this bill but also the other three bills that the committee is addressing in the next two days&mdash;and all the bills have been referred to the commit tee by the opposition parties&mdash;that we are trying to accommodate as many views as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke to Dr Woollard, the National President of the AMA, for 28 minutes yesterday. I told him that the reason we did not include the AMA on this rare occasion was that their submission was exceedingly comprehensive. It is interesting that Senator Neal is actually leaving the chamber and is not interested to hear the explanation that I am giving. The explanation is particularly significant. I have to admit that Dr Woollard failed to accept that explanation. As I said to him and as I said in the letter, the AMA provided a very comprehensive and detailed submission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I explained to Dr Woollard yesterday, the fact remains that his submission was exceedingly good and his views and the views of the AMA are hardly unknown to the committee. Therefore, the committee made a judgment that, given the limited time, we would actually seek the opinions of those that were less well known to the committee so that we had the broadest opinion on which to base the committee's decision and judgment. It was the view of the committee that it was important to hear as many voices as possible. To ensure that that is possible, we will hear from all types of students who may be affected, whether they be resident medical officers, doctors in training or others. There are so many who want to be heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, I have probably had six or eight phone calls from other organisations that also wish to be heard. Interestingly enough, the Australian Medical Association is the only <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5200"> one that has effectively said to me, `We will take this further and you mark my words.' The others have accepted the rationale that we cannot hear everyone and that it is important that we get the broadest cross-section of opinion possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am hoping that the Australian Medical Association, in the light of day, will see that this is one rare occasion when they have not been called. That does not mean to say that the committee will not take into consideration their excellent submission or the views that they have repeatedly expressed in every section of the media since the announcement regarding Medicare provider numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unquestionably a very representative body of the medical profession. It is in no way intended as a slight upon them in any way, shape or form. It is simply a fact that the opposition parties have seen fit to put bill after bill before one committee. There are four pieces of legislation for the committee to consider in two days. We cannot hear everyone. We are seeking to get the broadest possible representation and consultation available. </PARA></ANSWER>

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(3.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two points that are raised in this matter. The first relates to how a committee should be run. I think that is a matter for each committee to decide. I do not want to go into the pros and cons of what has happened on this occasion. However, having listened to Senator West, I think she was saying this: on a matter such as this, where medical students and medical people generally are very much affected, the AMA, which represents all those groups across the board, would be a good candidate to be considered as to whether or not they ought to give evidence. I leave it at that. I think it would be wrong for me, as a person who believes heavily in the committee system, to interfere in any way with the workings of a committee. I simply translate to the people listening what Senator West was saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the issue that has been raised about the provider numbers themselves. I must confess that I have a big personal interest in this matter. The deputy clerk has often said that financial interests are one basis upon <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which you might have a conflict of interest on things. I think other issues are as well. On this occasion the fact that I have a daughter who is in the middle of the situation that has been created by this legislation is a good illustration of how you can be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having declared my interest, I think it is a point that ought to be considered very much by all people who are approaching this issue, because the issue on this occasion seems to me to be driven not by interests in people's health, but by interests in the budget's health. This legislation does not prevent any of these people who will be deprived of provider numbers, in circumstances where they otherwise would not have been, from practising. It does not stop them treating people. In other words, it is not legislation which prevents the people it affects from treating patients. What it does is stop those patients claiming back from Medicare what has been charged to them by these people who will now be without provider numbers. That is something that ought to be understood by all those people who are considering this legislation. It is not legislation about health; it is legislation about money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that reason this may well have been a bill that could have gone to the finance committee instead of the committee to which it did go. It seems to me to be harsh that the people who will be affected by this financial measure are people who have in no way contributed to the financial problems, such as they are, within the health system. These are young students who have never had the chance to claim on Medicare, so they are being punished, as it were, for what other people have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been alleged that there have been rorts within the Medicare system. So what do you do? You do not punish those who have committed those rorts; they are left with their provider numbers. You punish the patients who will go to these people who are now coming through and who, until this time, have had the reasonable expectation of getting a Medicare provider number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude on this point: these people have gone through their courses, they have done their schooling, they have done up to six <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5201"> years of hard, slogging work. I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, it is hard, slogging work. At the end of that time, at five minutes to midnight, they are deprived of the expectation which they have reasonably had until now. That is the real problem in all of this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report deals with the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996, a bill that gives effect to a large proportion of the social security measures&mdash;largely harsh ones&mdash;announced by the coalition government in the 1996 budget. As mentioned in the minority report contained in the documents tabled by Senator Knowles, Labor's response to this legislation and, indeed, to all the measures announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, is based on how the measures weigh up against three principles: does the measure betray a promise; is it equitable; and does it contribute to national savings?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we looked at this bill in detail&mdash;particularly at the committee stage&mdash;we felt that, in a great many respects, the proposed legislation falls sadly short of meeting these three principles. Not only does it betray many promises, not only is it inequitable, but some of the measures contained within it will certainly not contribute to national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We pointed out in our report that the coalition went to the last election making very strong commitments to the people of Australia. In particular, John Howard promised that his government would protect the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. This bill includes measures that, far from fulfilling those commitments, specifically harm those whom John Howard singled out for protection. The removal of a massive $1.5 billion over four years from the social security safety net alone underlines that betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, we believe, is John Howard's most cynical broken promise because it was a promise that meant so much to the community and so many believed it. We in the Labor Party will not stand by and allow Australians to be betrayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Examining the proposed legislation in detail through the committee confirmed that certainly we in the Labor Party are not the only ones who believe that the proposed legislation is not equitable. Submissions received by the committee, and evidence given during the hearings, revealed that there is a great deal of concern in the community about the measures <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5202"> proposed. It was not just the peak groups such as the Australian Council of Social Service and the National Welfare Rights Network who made valuable contributions to the committee. Community neighbourhood centres, concerned citizens and small organisations whose resources are already stretched took the time to write to the committee and make us aware of their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A concerned individual, Mr Stephen Morrow from Newtown in Sydney, wrote to the committee about the measures affecting unemployed people. He commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that this Bill will increase penalties from two weeks to anything up to thirteen weeks, for alleged breaches of the Department of Social Security procedures by recipients of unemployment benefits. I believe this measure is unjust and inappropriate. It will obviously have a significant and serious impact on unemployed people, and it will in turn have a negative impact on the wider community in which these citizens live. The current economic situation means that there are increasing numbers of unemployed people. As a society, we have a moral obligation and an economic interest in ensuring that these people will remain within the bounds of community. The proposed Bill will impoverish these people even further and alienate them from the community. We cannot afford this.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are Mr Morrow's comments. I do not think I could have put it any better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measures contained in this bill, designed to cut people off payments and reduce their benefits, will have the effect of exiling certain people beyond the bounds of our community, relegating them to destitution and despair. While this may satisfy the ideologically driven Howard government, it will inevitably have a negative impact on the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposed legislation does not reflect a commitment to protect the poor, the needy or the most vulnerable in the community. In fact, it is an attack on many of those people. Many of the measures contained in the proposed legislation will actually worsen the plight of unemployed people and other social security recipients. Rather than addressing the issue of unemployment, the government has chosen to implement measures that will slash the range of benefits to unemployed people and income support recipients more broadly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we said in our minority report, the proposed legislation is based on the premise that unemployed people are seeking to rort the system. The reality is that the majority of unemployed people are honest, genuine job seekers. The excessive measures to tighten the activity test and expand the breach provisions, coupled with the abolition or tightening of a number of schemes that actually assisted job seekers, makes this bill very anti&hyphen;unemployed. Labor believes that the government's efforts should be devoted to reducing unemployment rather than cutting people off payments. However, this proposed legislation is attempting to do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is very little in the proposed legislation that the Australian community can be happy about. The concerns raised in many submissions to the committee have not been taken on board in the report. For this reason, Labor felt it was important to submit a minority report, and these views were shared by the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is determined to amend portions of the bill to reflect a commitment to equity and to attempt to fulfil John Howard's commitment to protect the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in our community. Labor cannot and will not stand by and allow the most vulnerable in our community to pay the price for the coalition's ideological obsessions. I thank the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we concluded last evening, I was in the middle of quoting from the Labor document Working Nation at page 33 and I continue:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a key element in the Government's strategy for achieving its overall objectives for enterprise bargaining and industrial relations reform . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This bill, I am sure the government will be horrified to hear me say, is far less radical in these respects than Labor's proposals with a much more extensive list of award matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit rich for the Labor Party to stand up and talk about how far awards have been stripped back when their own long&hyphen;term plan for the labour market had this clear and public intention. As I outlined earlier to the Labor ranks, it is the implementation that may differ; it is certainly not the intention between the two sides of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment which the government and Democrats have put, to which there are opposing amendments, is particularly important; it is the most important in this schedule. It does a number of things to change the content of awards. The government and Democrat amendment No. 19 firstly expands the list of allowable award matters in 89A(2) to expressly include skill&hyphen;based career paths, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5204"> rest breaks, notice periods, variation of hours, superannuation and outworkers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it further expands the operation of allowable matters in 89A(5) to pick up incidental matters necessary but not essential for the effective operation of the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, it clearly ensures that the commission has the power to set minimum consecutive hours that a part&hyphen;time worker can work and the regularity of such hours, thereby preventing the further casualisation of part&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, it allows arbitration outside allowable matters in 89A(6) for exceptional matters. The combined effect of these changes is to broaden the powers of the commission enormously and to ensure that the commission has sufficient power to prevent workers being disadvantaged in a harsh or unjust manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The list of allowable matters will now clearly pick up all important aspects of hours of duty, skill development and career paths and superannuation. The coverage of superannuation by awards may be reviewed again next year but only if the government's freedom of choice legislation clearly guarantees that industry super funds will not be undermined and that workers will not be made worse off under the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mention was made of superannuation. I am glad that Senator Sherry is in the chamber because this is his area of particular expertise. The Democrats have persuaded the government to include superannuation as an allowable award matter. We have provided a letter to the government outlining our position on superannuation. That letter has been released publicly and I would like to refer briefly to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have said that we can see some merit in having one piece of legislation dealing with superannuation. The situation where the first three per cent of compulsory super is award based and the other six per cent is by superannuation guarantee charge legislation is untidy. I do not think it is radical to state that we would be prepared to review this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we then go on in our letter to outline the preconditions the government will need to meet for such a piece of legislation to get our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support. Firstly, it must ensure that workers are not worse off. That affects, for instance, the award regulation of casual workers earning less than $450 a month or $900 a month under the coalition's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the legislation, particularly if it includes freedom of choice provisions or retirement savings accounts, should not be used to undermine industry funds. The Democrats are strong supporters of the industry funds which we believe provide good value for money for most award employees. Much of the argument which the AIRC hears about superannuation at present is about which union preferred fund super will be sent to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We make it clear in our letter that if agreement is reached on these issues, we will support the removal of superannuation from awards simply because it will no longer be necessary. The award coverage of superannuation ceased to be comprehensive in 1991 when the then ALP government moved to circumvent the 1991 national wage case outcome they did not agree with by implementing it in legislation. It was the ALP which chose to move superannuation advancement out of awards into legislation in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats supported the passage of the SGC legislation in 1992 because we felt that compulsory savings were essential to increase our declining national savings rate. The main people disadvantaged by the repeal of award super clauses would have been those exempted from the SGC, that is, those workers earning less than $450 a month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that, notwithstanding all the grandstanding by Labor in favour of those 20,000 to 50,000 workers affected, these workers were disadvantaged under Labor's super legislation. This is because the fees that super funds were taking out were bigger than the super money going in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, the government finally introduced its small  amounts legislation, but it was a paltry solution because, instead of moving small amounts to a single super fund with government picking up the administrative costs, it allowed the union sponsored funds to keep the money so long as fees were not higher than interest income. In nominal terms, the accounts do not go backwards, which is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5205"> an improvement, but, in real terms, they never go forward either. So award based super clauses are not the massive benefit that the ALP claims they are, and we will support retention of those conditions at this time but only because half a bird in the hand is better than none at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other remarks I wish to make about this award section are as follows. In lobbying about this section, unions have sought to pressure us to include issues such as accident make&hyphen;up pay, occupational health and safety and staffing. Accident make&hyphen;up pay, according to expert legal advice, is clearly covered under 89A(2)(j), allowances, and I will be asking the minister to confirm that interpretation. Occupational health and safety is, according to our advice, more properly dealt with under state law and specific federal laws dealing with workplace health and safety. Most occupational health and safety award clauses, such as protective clothing, would likewise come under 89A(2)(j).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Staffing issues, we believe, will be picked up under the exceptional matters orders. Staffing disputes shall be subject to the agreement in the first instance, as staffing is at first pass an issue for the business to determine. But where staffing is so inappropriate that the workloads are in themselves harsh or unjust, then the commission should have the power to intervene to remove that harshness&mdash;and these provisions will allow for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The part&hyphen;time employment provisions reflect the Democrats' view that part&hyphen;time employment must be encouraged. Too many awards contain too many restrictions on part&hyphen;time employment. These restrictions were often put in awards as part of bargaining deals, with unions wanting to preserve the bargaining chip of restricting access to part&hyphen;time employment to gain future advantages. We believe that the use of access of such work as a bargaining chip is inappropriate&mdash;and hence our opposition to quotas and maximum hours. But we do believe that part&hyphen;time work does require regulation of minimum hours to prevent employers seeking to casualise part&hyphen;time work with a minimum call&hyphen;in period. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Hours must also be predictable, and we have allowed for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have sought independent legal advice on the scope of section 89A. Two of Australia's most prominent and eminent industrial lawyers have advised us that section 89A clearly covers all of the most important employment conditions of current awards. The clause will give the commission the authority to actually proceed to develop a real and effective award simplification process&mdash;and that is something which we support. This amendment is an important part of accelerating Labor's completely log jammed 150A award modernisation process, and I commend it to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exceptional matters orders are a vitally important part of this new clause, and this clause has been inserted to make it quite clear that the commission does have the power to prevent harsh or unjust outcomes. Its arbitral powers will ensure that employers are unable to take advantage of the weak bargaining position of employees to impose their will in a harsh or unjust way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To access the exceptional matters jurisdiction, there are a number of conditions. The first is that the party has made a genuine attempt to reach agreement. The second is that there is no reasonable prospect of agreement from further conciliation. Those two basically are the pre&hyphen;conditions for arbitration now. The third condition is that it is appropriate to settle the matter by arbitration. That means that the commission has a discretion whether to arbitrate or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth condition is that the issues involved are exceptional issues. I do not believe that is a major barrier. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Concise Oxford Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines `exceptional' as `forming an exception'. `Exception' is defined as `thing excepted; thing that does not follow the rule'. The rule in this section is quite clear from 89A(6) where it says that 89A(1) does not exclude an exceptional matter. So the rule which is excepted is the rule that arbitration is limited to section 89A(2), allowable matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth condition is clearly the most important one, and that is that a harsh or unjust outcome would apply if the dispute did <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5206"> not include the exceptional matter. And that is really the key criterion in determining whether a party can access this jurisdiction. So it is quite clear that 89A(6) establishes a very important jurisdiction for the commission, a very important protection for avoiding harsh or unjust outcomes; that is a wide and important but still well targeted jurisdiction.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray indicated that occupational health and safety, which was one of the concerns of the Greens (WA) in the list of what is available as scope for industrial action&mdash;which, as I have said before, should be read as `limits to industrial action'&mdash;is more appropriate under state laws. I find it a nonsense to suggest that. If you actually have in the federal law that that is the limitation which in fact says that you cannot have industrial action for health and safety reasons, then what does that mean is going to be in this law? Does it mean that the state laws will overrule this? I do not think it is the case. Perhaps the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) or Senator Murray can explain that. It sounds a lot like the government speaking. It sounds a lot like what the government said to us: `This is more appropriately handled by the state government. This is not our fault. This would be the state government.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at occupational health and safety issues as they have been dealt with by the state government in Western Australia, I would have to say that the standards seem to be getting worse and worse. There are issues there such as what constitutes `disablement'&mdash;how much of a person's body has to be actually rendered inoperative before a person can claim proper compensation&mdash;and issues like the ability of the employer to sue someone when they get injured. Really interesting things are happening in Western Australia, and I would have to say that, if it is considered to be more appropriate to deal under state laws, it is a pretty scary thing for workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any issue that should be allowable under industrial action, I would think it is occupational health and safety matters, and sometimes that is the only thing that workers <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can do when they realise things have got too tough and that somebody may die or be seriously injured if those issues are not being dealt with immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment, which we will be dealing with, is to go back to paid rates awards and to get rid of this whole section which limits what can be allowable for industrial action and the scope of industrial action. Given the Western Australian experience, to say that it is more appropriate that it should be under state laws and to restrict the ability for workers to take action for valid health and occupational health and safety reasons I really think is an appalling step in the wrong direction and is really going backwards in terms of basic human rights.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect so. I make only one point on this, Senator Murray. You referred to the earnings of people in superannuation of between $450 and $900 a month. One of the factors&mdash;and it is a critical factor&mdash;that affects their accrual in superannuation, whether they are in an industry fund or an in-house employer fund, is that they started off with contribution levels of three <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5207"> per cent rising to nine per cent. It is currently six per cent. The administrative charges are generally fixed&mdash;they are a fixed money amount. So when superannuation first came in at three per cent, if it was $1 a week charge that $1 a week charge was a very high proportion of a three per cent contribution. As the contributions go up to nine per cent&mdash;I hope 15 per cent, depending on what the government does with the government co&hyphen;contribution and the employee contribution&mdash;that dollar a week, if that is the fixed charge, does not go up with it. Over time, the administrative charges are a declining proportion of contribution.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to ask Senator Murray if he would please answer the question that I put to him yesterday. I think in part he tried to respond by claiming that the Labor government, in its Working Nation policy and also in various speeches by the then Prime Minister and then minister, had expressed support for simplification of awards and, indeed, awards containing fewer clauses and covering only the essential elements of a contract of employment. No-one on this side of the chamber denies that the system that came into operation following the amendments by the Labor government was about award simplification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the point that you, Senator Murray, do not seem to wish to acknowledge and face up to is that it was a very different process&mdash;it was a process whereby that would be done by the commission&mdash;and that, as we know, the government itself has an unfettered right to intervene in any proceedings to make submissions to the commission about what can or cannot be in awards. That is the big distinction between the position that we adopted and the position that the government adopts and that you now support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I go back to my question: can you please tell us why it is that you quite correctly concluded that the 18 allowable matters was a severe limitation and a severe measure in terms of legislative prescription to remove award entitlements and you then went on to agree that only two matters should be added? What happened to all the others and why <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were you not prepared, if you were prepared to recognise the principle, to recognise that other award provisions could be included in the 18 allowable matters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also put to you: why did you not consider the proposition of leaving the act as it was&mdash;even if it required amendment&mdash;and recognising that the commission would be empowered and encouraged, and whatever words we could find, to bring about award simplification through the processes that it already has under the conciliation and arbitration power, rather than being prescriptive as to what is in and what is out?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask that deliberately because I deliberately read into the record my notes on this area and my understanding of the entire issue. I cannot give you a better answer to your first question than that I have already read into the record. We not only undertook to examine this from the point of view of our own understanding, but we took as much advice as we could from, as I mentioned yesterday, the ACTU, from various legal advisers in the area and others who are also concerned. So I cannot really add substantially to what I have already said. I am sure you do not want me to read that all out to you again. If the government with their advisers over there wish to substantiate what I have said, they may.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Your second question was why did we not leave the act as it was. This was not our bill, and this was not your bill. You took the decision at the early stage to oppose the thing pretty well outright and then came in with all your amendments. We took the decision to attempt to claw back as much as we could to make it a far more balanced, a far fairer bill, against a set of principles we laid out. We believe we have met that task as admirably as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5208"> we could in the circumstances. We are satisfied that we fulfilled our own brief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also agree, as strange as it may seem, with both you and the government that modernisation and simplification of the allowable awards area is absolutely vital for further progress and modernisation and evolution of our industrial relations system.

<PARA>Our amendment No. 6 is not our preferred option. We have just seen a debate and a vote which, if it stands, will result in it being illegal for workers to take action on such things as occupational health and safety, even if their lives are in danger or if they have been asked to conduct work in a way which they know will put their lives in danger. If you do not think it happens, talk to the people in Port Hedland and Karratha. Talk to people driving trucks and providing courier services who are being asked on a regular basis to carry loads that are too great. Talk to people who are being asked to operate equipment in a way that they know is contrary to the operating instructions of that equipment and see if it is not happening on a regular basis throughout the work force in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that, when an accident happens, find out how many employers are willing to accept the responsibility for requiring their workers to work in what is known to be a dangerous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5209"> way&mdash;that is, working with equipment that has worked beyond its ratings, working in a way which short cuts on safety procedures and so on. I talked to a number of people in a number of different areas. The areas that particularly spring to mind are remote rural and regional areas of Australia. In Western Australia, the mining industry also springs to mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about the ability to take legal industrial action on such basic things as vocational training and language and literacy. Included in that is occupational health and safety, the timing and method of the payment of wages, anti&hyphen;discrimination measures, equal employment opportunities and affirmative action, minimum ordinary time hours of work, distribution of hours or work, starting times, length of shifts, trade union training and accident make-up pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I return to occupational health and safety. This is the opportunity for both the government and the Democrats to retrieve what is an appalling situation. It is absolutely outrageous that workers in Australia may be threatened with fines or worse for taking industrial action for legitimate health and safety disputes. I invite any of them to stand up here and argue why that is a reasonable position to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be illegal for legitimate health and safety reasons for people to be fined for taking action. Tell me whether or not it is better for them to be injured or killed later or whether it is better and responsible for them to take industrial action when they know they are being asked to do the wrong thing or when they know that the activities in which they are taking place are likely to lead to injuries or accidents even if they fit into whatever codes that exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you think of the Western Australian situation, look at the adds on television. They say, `It is up to you.' Those ads are about putting the onus back on the worker: `It is up to you to say something. It is up to you to take action.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a farce it makes if you say, `It's up to you but, if you take action because you know it is dangerous, it will be illegal. You can be fined or worse.' What are we doing to the lives and the health of workers in Australia if <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this is the situation we are going to be voting on today? Here is an opportunity to change the situation. We have an amendment which puts some of those basic issues back into allowable issues that can be the basis of industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am waiting for an answer, perhaps we could get some definition of what `industrial action' is. It could simply be not doing those things which are dangerous. That, as far as I can see, could be classified as industrial action. Would that be allowable or not allowable? What if workers decide not to do those things which they believe to be dangerous; is that considered to be industrial action? Later on, we will come into the situation of whether people can be paid if they take some sort of industrial action. I am very keen to hear an answer from the minister. I would also be happy to hear a response from the Democrats on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

I will make the following points about our <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments Nos 1 and 2, because they deal with the issue of health and safety. I have to refer to Senator Murray again. I hope he does not call three or four points of order. Page 333 of the report&mdash;I assume Senator Murray contributed to the writing of this area of the report&mdash;states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats share the concern of the Majority report in relation to the restrictions on the content of awards. Awards must be capable of regulating all important conditions of employment. In particular, we believe that matters such as meal breaks, rostering, occupational health and safety&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise occupational health and safety&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">anti-discrimination, superannuation and training are fundamental parts of the employment relationship and should be capable of determination by the AIRC.</PARA>
<PARA>The next sentence states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we share the concern of the Government that the award modernisation process under section 150A of the current act has failed to deliver a more simplified and flexible award system.</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably by the Democrats doing a backflip on their views a couple of months ago, Senator Murray has come to the conclusion that, in the name of simplification&mdash;that is, that accidents are so much simpler than they used to be&mdash;there is no need for occupational health and safety to be covered in the same way. Presumably workers are a lot more flexible when they run up against a machine. Apparently the flexibility has not been enhanced enough under the old provisions, because they do not believe we should have reference to occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the Democrats' backflip to the attention of the Senate. It is a matter of great regret. I think Senator Murray will find, as Senator Margetts has outlined, that occupational health and safety is a very passionate area. On a number of occasions, I have attended at accidents. There is at times spontaneous industrial action, which is often very difficult to resolve. I know Senator Murray's approach to this matter should be condemned, because it is grossly irresponsible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am jumping in now because I want to respond to something the minister said. Perhaps we can then all get back into the rhythm. The minister referred to schedule <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5212"> 14, item 2, which I have immediately looked up. Subsection 4(1) of item 2 of schedule 14 states that, at the end of the definition of `industrial action', the following should be added:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or (g) action by an employee if:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the action was based on a reasonable concern by the employee about an imminent risk&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is not about a risk in the future or concerns about ongoing risks, but an imminent risk to his or her health and safety. What does that mean about uranium, asbestos and so on. They would have to prove imminent risk. It refers to the one, isolated employee. If there is a risk that somebody in the workplace is being asked to undergo risk, it does not necessarily mean that the workers around that person can think it is reasonable to stop work until that risk has been reduced, addressed or redressed. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction of his or her employer to perform other available work . . .</PARA>
<PARA>If people think the risk is strong enough that they should  stop work until it is being dealt with, they can be told to work in another section. In effect, they can still be told that they cannot choose to stop work if there is a risk that might affect some or all of them. It has once again isolated the worker. Section 2 of schedule 14 is not a remedy to what we see is being taken away under the scope of the limitation of industrial action. It is not a remedy. It does not mean that workers can support their fellow workers if they find that their lives are being put at risk or they are being asked to do something which is obvious to most of them will lead to future problems in worker health and safety.</PARA></SPEECH>

They persuaded us after many hours that, by and large, under all the state laws and specific federal laws dealing with workplace health and safety, they were properly dealt with.

Amendment 7 on revised sheet 217 replaces amendment 17 on page 183 and amendment 20, which were to be moved together. We delete the clause which states that the commission's power to make or vary an award does not include `the power to set maximum or minimum hours of work for regular part&hyphen;time employees'. This is an important area of concern for regular part-time workers who need to have some certainty in their lives in relation to either minimum or maximum hours of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5213">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commission should have the right to make or vary awards in relation to these issues. Experience from Western Australia has highlighted the manner in which part&hyphen;time workers can lose control of their lives and have their family life totally disrupted by employers who use individual contracts to impose totally unreasonable demands on employees, especially in the hospitality industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, in amendment 20, we add a provision to the section in the act dealing with the making and publication of awards, section 143, to the effect that the parties to paid rates awards are able to incorporate the terms of their enterprise agreements into the award. Proposed section 143(5) seeks to ensure that paid rates awards remain exactly what they say they are&mdash;awards reflecting actual rates of pay and conditions of employment. The commission would have the discretion to include enterprise agreements within paid rates awards. This would ensure that paid rates awards are easier to understand, are reflective of the conditions which the parties have agreed to, and are appropriate to reflect the terms of the award.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is consistent with, and further develops, decisions of the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the airline industry award, where paid rates awards have recently been adjusted by consent of the parties to include recently expired enterprise bargaining rounds.

The growth in part&hyphen;time and casual work in the economy began earlier than 1983 when we were elected to office. If you look at the statistics&mdash;I did not get a chance to do it overnight&mdash;you will find that the proportion of part&hyphen;time and casual workers has been growing since the late 1960s. In part, it is due to the areas of the economy that are growing most significantly. Hospitality is a very good example. Job numbers in the hospitality industry have doubled from 1983 to now. The employment in that sector is predominantly part time and casual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine made a very good point that it is very important that part&hyphen;time and casual employees have as much security and predictability of employment as possible.

He is quite right that this was an area of great concern during the hearings and he correctly itemised the concerns expressed in our supplementary report. There are a number of critical matters which we secured and which we felt were vital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first is that part&hyphen;time workers may not work full&hyphen;time hours. The second is that part&hyphen;time workers will get the pro rata entitlements of a full&hyphen;time employee, which was not the case under the existing act. The third is that they should get regular hours. The fourth is that they should get minimum hours. As you rightly said, we selected a percentage. We were persuaded in discussions with the government and their advisers that it would be better for the minimum hours situation to be identified on an award by award basis because industry conditions vary and therefore a particular percentage would not be appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA>I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to page 334 of the Senate Economics References Committee report. I think this is the seventh Murray amendment. We will move off Senator Murray's amendments soon and onto Senator Stott Despoja's amendments. We are again reflecting the Democrats' position on page 334 of that report under section II entitled `Powers of Arbitration'. The committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . even if section 89A is to be retained, the AIRC must retain the power to arbitrate on matters outside of the section 89A list where agreement cannot be reached and resolution of the matter by arbitration would be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>While there has been some improvement with respect to the government's amendments there are still 10 hurdles for the commission to jump over to determine an industrial dispute by arbitration. Our amendment simplifies that process considerably by presenting three criteria to be met for the commission to be satisfied with respect to determining an industrial dispute. We believe that that is a simpler, more effective mechanism for the commission to deal with disputes in the circumstances we outlined in parts (a), (b) and (c) of the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important that the commission should at least have the capacity, if it believes a matter is of such importance and there is a public interest, to deal with that matter in front of a full bench. I plead with Senator Kernot and Senator Murray&mdash;I almost go down on my hands and knees&mdash;and say that this is not an unreasonable position to take if the commission is of that view. There have been a number of test case provisions where the commission has recognised that there is a significant public importance and interest and that it should deal with the issue. Unfortunately, the Democrat&hyphen;government deal does not allow the commission, if it believes the matter is of significant public interest, to pick it up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very important issue. If an application is made, the president must make the determination. The president must conclude that the subject matter is of such importance that, in the public interest, it should be dealt with by a full bench, and the full bench must then hear and determine the matter. It is not a substitute for the exceptional matters provision. It is in addition to the exceptional matters provision. It really is a matter of very great regret and&mdash;I would have to say&mdash;astonishment that the Democrats did not include this within the package that they agreed to with the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the Senate to support this provision. It is very important and critical, particularly on any new and emerging issues in industrial relations as the nature of employment and the economy changes, that the commission have this power.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition opposes item 11 of schedule 5. Very regrettably, this bill repeals the provisions which would have prohibited the commission after 22 June 1997 from prescribing junior award rates. We wish to delete this repeal. The basic reason for doing this is that junior rates should be abolished next year because they permit discrimination between two workers, simply on the basis of age, even though they are doing the same work and have the same experience. Competency&hyphen;based rates are being developed in many industries which provide a more appropriate basis for wage differentiation between young people. We are particularly concerned about this aspect of the legislation and also the confirmation of this particular part of the act in the Democrat&hyphen;government deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not pick on Senator Murray on this occasion. Senator Woodley is here. It is a pity Senator Stott Despoja is not here because we call this the Stott Despoja amendment No. 1. We do that because Senator Stott Despoja has been roaming the country, a bit like Boadicea, trying to hold back the Roman imperial industrial hordes, trumpeting grand support for the youth of this country. I do not have any criticism of that; she does it very well. But I am critical of her duplicity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope she is listening to this debate. I would like to see her in the chamber and, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, explain why Senator Stott Despoja, who has taken up the title of the Boadicea of youth in this country, is not supporting this amendment we are moving today. It is because the approach of the Australian Democrats on youth wages is nothing more than a sell&hyphen;out. It is a sell&hyphen;out to everything that Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Kernot have said on this issue. I draw the Senate's attention to Senator Stott Despoja's speech in the second reading debate on this legislation when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is telling us and some employers have told us that junior rates are necessary to ensure that young people have employment prospects and that, if we get rid of them, more young people will be out of work, contributing to the 27 per cent youth unemployment level that we currently have. I still find it very difficult that people persist with this notion that there is some causal connection between lower wage rates for young people and increased employment opportunities. In fact, we have had little evidence provided to us that supports this assertion other than the prejudice of some employers.</PARA>
<PARA>Ah, she is here! Good to see. Senator Stott Despoja is here to explain why, after her contribution in the second reading debate, she will change her position in this chamber today when she votes for the government&hyphen;Democrat deal. Senator Stott Despoja went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are opposed to the continuation of junior rates.</PARA>
<PARA>They are opposed to the continuation of junior rates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe the parliament must amend this bill to make it clear that junior rates have to go.</PARA>
<PARA>We look forward, Senator Stott Despoja, to you voting with Labor on this amendment of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5218"> ours that we have named after you. We look forward to you crossing the floor and voting with Labor on this matter. And Senator Stott Despoja went on in her speech in respect to this matter on a number of occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats do have a capacity for a free vote. I remember at least two occasions when one of the senators from New South Wales did not vote with the Australian Democrats and crossed the floor. In fact, Senator Karin Sowada did not vote with us on those two occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are appalled that Senator Stott Despoja went on the record in this way. I am sure she will say that she has argued the case in the Democrat caucus, and I am sure she will say she has not changed her mind. But the fact is, if she does not cross the floor and vote with us, she will vote directly against everything that she has said on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, Senator Kernot herself went on the record on section 89A in a speech to the Australian Education Union that I referred to and enunciated similar sorts of principles to Senator Stott Despoja. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other areas in the Bill with which the Democrats are concerned include the abolition of paid rates awards and the maintenance of age&hyphen;based youth awards.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like Senator Kernot to come down here and exercise her conscience and her free vote and live up to the principles that she has been enunciating around this country time and time again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have moved no less than nine or 10 amendments reflecting Democrat positions. No less than nine or 10 Democrat positions have been clearly and publicly put on the record. It is about time that the Australian Democrats stood up for the principles they have been stating time and time again. We hope that on this occasion Senator Stott Despoja crosses the floor and votes with us on this amendment, which is directly based on Democrat policy in the lead&hyphen;up to the last election.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite seriously, this was exactly the decision that was taken by the previous government. The previous government could have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5219"> made the decision to oppose that three&hyphen;year period. Anyone who cares about trying to find an arrangement which will ensure that young people are not further disadvantaged in what has been over a number of years a very weak employment market for young people and that they come to an industrial relations system which is non&hyphen;discriminatory was hoping that, over that three&hyphen;year period up to 22 June 1997, some replacement that did not expose young people to risks that may be high or may be low could be put in place. That scheme, that framework, has not been found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of evidence out there. The Retail Council of Australia is of course but one voice in the debate, but it estimates that if we got rid of this there would be a couple of hundred thousand young people who would be lost to the industry if those junior wage rates were replaced. They may or may not be right, but I think it is a risk that a lot of people do not want to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are proposing is to extend these provisions and to constructively ensure that the commission is required to look into this and report to this parliament. We think that is a constructive approach, and that is this government's position. The previous government of course amended its legislation to put this three&hyphen;year extension to 22 June 1997 in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the members of the previous government, those sitting opposite, members of the Labor Party, that these junior rates awards have been in existence for, I believe, something like 70 years. The previous government, Labor, in power, did nothing, with the exception of the Brereton bill, which was then amended to extend it, to get rid of the junior rates. So it is a little bit rich for Senator Sherry to come in here and start attacking the Democrats or indeed the new government in relation to this issue. We believe we are taking a constructive approach. We believe that having the commission report to the parliament after a comprehensive review of junior rates allows all members of the Senate to make a contribution to how we move forward on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We ask Senator Sherry to perhaps address the following issue: after 13 years in power, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> during the last three of which he was on the frontbench, why do they consider that all of a sudden things should change after 22 June 1997? Why does this date have such magical importance, particularly considering that no&hyphen;one has proposed any sensible transitional replacement measures? That is exactly what the government, with the support of the Democrats, is proposing with this comprehensive review reporting to the parliament in two years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Sherry with respect to removing the repeal of the amendment that requires the extension of junior rates up until June 1999, as the government and Democrats have put. The Democrats have explicitly agreed to perpetuate junior rates, as opposed to moving to the competency based system that supporting our amendment would result in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment removes this provision to extend the period of time for junior rates and really highlights the nonsensical approach of the government&hyphen;Democrat agreement to just perpetuate junior rates without moving quickly and sensibly to a competency based system&mdash;a competency based system that has developed with the cooperation of trade unions and employers over the last decade. It is a competency based system that has had vast resources put into it&mdash;whether it be through the industry training advisory boards or through industry itself just getting together with the trade unions and nutting out the best approach to establish comprehensive and meaningful career paths for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only result of all of this of course is that the credibility of the Democrats in advocating on behalf of youth has been tarnished permanently in the eyes of young people. They have lost for good the opportunity to prove their commitment to young people. I do not think the Liberal Party had any commitment in the first place so they did not have too much to lose. We are opposing this amendment and we will remain the only political party which is not prepared to compromise the principle of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5220">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that employers have always used periods of high unemployment such as we have seen to press for reductions in rates of pay and conditions. What we are seeing now is no different. What we are seeing now, with respect to the Liberal approach with Democrat support on this bill, is the pursuance of one of the oldest industrial tricks in the book. What do you take? What is the ultimatum that is being put to the Democrats? Is it less pay, or is it fewer jobs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I need only refer to some of the comments about the outcomes of this bill and where the jobs are going to be arising out of this. It really raises the question of what comes first. The evidence of the trick that is being played out here is on the basis that quite clearly jobs are not going to come out of this workplace relations legislation, so the threat hanging over the heads of the Democrats and the one that has been used to secure their support is the fact that, if this provision is not removed and if it sticks around and junior rates are perpetuated, then somehow that will mean that employers will not be forced to sack many young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we are not even talking about some advantage to young people and the number of jobs they have available; what we are talking about is a threat by employers in stating their case and their argument that, if this provision is removed, that will result in fewer jobs, because we know that it certainly will not result in more if it stays in. And they have said that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had Ian Macfarlane, the Independent Governor of the Reserve Bank, say that the passage of the bill will not reduce unemployment, that it will not create jobs. That was endorsed by a leading labour market expert, Professor Bob Gregory. He said it in a nutshell, that what the bill really means is much lower pay without extra jobs. Access Economics, who are former Treasury officials and have quite a dry reputation, said that unemployment will go above nine per cent and remain that high into the next century if the workplace relations bill is passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even Mr Howard was forced in the end to concede that employment creation was not an outcome this bill was expected to deliver. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Essentially, that reduces this to a question of blackmail, hanging over people's heads the threat that `if you do not support this, the employers have said they will reduce the number of jobs for young people'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What good is a job if you cannot earn a living wage? That is my question. Young people at the moment are marginalised and forced, in many cases, to work a number of part-time jobs to survive. If they are undertaking tertiary education, they are required to take out part-time employment to supplement their incomes or to get an income. I do not believe this is fair. I do not believe junior rates do equate to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</PARA>

<TIME.STAMP>(5.44 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to continue my remarks and put them in context. What we are talking about here is the federal Industrial Relations Act. The workplace relations bill seeks to amend that act beyond <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5222"> recognition. It seeks to amend it in such a way that what we are debating right now, this issue of junior rates, is but one issue as part of a whole raft of amendments that undermine the whole status and basis of industrial relations and the rights of working people in this country. For Senator Campbell to make such points on this specific issue really is overshadowed by the overwhelming changes that this government is seeking to put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I am making is that the issue of junior rates is part of a whole structural change of workplace relations. It will now allow the transition from age discrimination based rates to competency rates in the context of the work the industry has done. It is the work that the industry has done in this area which has been treated with such appalling disdain and disregard by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising&mdash;it was interesting to hear a number of other senators refer to this, as I know Senator Stott Despoja did in her first speech&mdash;that young people regard politicians with such distain and cynicism. In the context of this debate we are seeing a fundamental change and, once again, be it young people, women, older people or migrants, certain people are being marginalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was interesting to note that Senator Stott Despoja, in her first speech, raised the notion of intergenerational equity, the notion that, no matter what your age, you have the opportunity to contribute to society in a way that gets a fair return. That is all we are talking about here. It is a matter of principle. Senator Campbell can argue the technical point all he likes but the point here is the principle of choosing whether we, as legislators, perpetuate junior rates which discriminate on the basis of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is clearly stating their position on this matter. We will not perpetuate it because it is not fair. We will not perpetuate it because there is an effective alternative. We will not perpetuate it because it is quite clear that this government's agenda goes far beyond some of the idiosyncratic technical arguments they have put in an attempt to substantiate this move. We will not perpetuate it because the line that employers are running&mdash;that they will sack young people if junior rates are not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perpetuated&mdash;is not a good enough reason for doing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all have a responsibility to make the choice of whether we take that view, not only on this technical matter, but also in our broader commitment to young people. Whether they like it or not, the Australian Democrats are faced with a dilemma. For as long as I can remember, they have stood on a platform of youth advocacy. But at the first opportunity to make a tangible difference to young people's ability to earn a living wage&mdash;a wage on which they can sustain themselves&mdash;at the first opportunity in the area of industrial relations to make a statement, they are choosing not to do it. The Democrats are choosing to back the government on this measure. To me, that does not say much about their commitment to young people. Once again, Labor is left to support what really counts under this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a range of issues here. As I said before, those issues demand consideration of their long&hyphen;term effects on working people. But few issues demand comment as much as this issue of the perpetuation of junior rates and age discrimination by the Democrats. I go again to Senator Stott Despoja's first speech&mdash;she is a great source of words when it comes to standing up for young people&mdash;where she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No group in society has been more consistently subject to structural change and its cruel and cutting edge, and for a longer period, than the young.</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the Democrats, here is one opportunity to follow through on those sentiments in a way that will mean something tangible to young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I want to raise one other issue. It has long been a platform of the Democrats that they are independent and not bound by the caucus position. On this issue, where the platform of the Democrats has so strongly been advocacy of young people, they should take advantage of an unbound caucus. Hopefully, with at least five of them, it might make a difference to young people in the years to come because this is the only tangible opportunity that the Democrats have with this bill <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5223"> to do something meaningful for young people. I urge them to take it up.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pick on three things to begin. The first is that we all know that sometimes the louder the voice, the weaker the argument and the weaker the case. I heard that a couple of times. The second thing is that I think I have just witnessed extraordinary Labor opportunism. They have said, `Aha, let's try to get some votes. Never mind the 13 years we were in government. Never mind what we did not do. Here's a chance to get some votes.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing I would say&mdash;it is not a criticism&mdash;is that this bill and the amendments are exceptionally complex. It is quite clear that some senators have not yet got across the full range of the bill. There are many areas on which they have made remarks where it is quite apparent that they have not fully grasped&mdash;this is the very point Senator Campbell made&mdash;that competency based wages are fully available and fully established.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original bill allowed junior rates to go without review forever. The Democrats have won an amendment to prevent that occurring. We are prepared to support the repeal of section 90AB in relation to junior rates only because of the new section 120B and 143(1D). We believe the exemption we supported in 1993 of excluding junior rates from age discrimination prohibition until June 1997 simply has not delivered the outcome which we sought. We wanted to see the parties, the unions and employers develop a non-discriminatory wages system for young people, and they failed.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why? At the end of last year all that a joint union, employer and Labor government working party came up with was to replace the current age based junior rates in awards like the retail industry with virtually exactly the same wage rates but with the references to age replaced by references to schooling and years since school. Very smart! Very, very slippery! So a 17-year-old in the retail industry no longer gets paid 30 per cent less than an adult because <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they are 17 years old but because they are the first year out of year 11.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That ingenious Claytons ALP solution would have had the young people of Australia dancing in the street. Do you think they are mugs? That was all that was going to be delivered as a result of section 90AB. The Democrats will not be party to a sham solution. We would prefer the transition to a non-discriminatory wages system for young people to take a little longer rather than not to happen at all. Section 90AB was destined for a sham solution under Labor. We have decided to terminate the process that was leading to that solution and institute instead a pro-active test case to progress the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While federal industrial relations law has been amended to act on wage discrimination against young people, no state industrial relations law has followed. Since 1993 the Arnold Labor government in South Australia, the Goss Labor government in Queensland, the Carr Labor government in New South Wales and the Labor Green majority in the Tasmanian parliament could have but have not abolished junior rates. Where is this sham passion of yours? Where is this great principle? For 13 years the Labor Party have done nothing and are still doing nothing even in the states where they have the power. The problem with them is that they do not have the soul and the philosophy they used to have. That is why they are starting to lose out in the political war. They have lost their soul.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could be left with a bizarre situation in 1997 where federal awards might have junior rates removed but state awards, under which the majority of young people are employed, would not. Further, employers in states deemed by the new federal act to have satisfactory vetting of employment agreements in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia could avoid the federal ban on junior rates by entering into a state employment agreement. In short, in the vitally important industries where young people are employed&mdash;retailing and hospitality&mdash;only a small minority would be likely to benefit from the provisions standing alone in the federal act. You are damned by your record in the states and federally.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5224">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most young workers are not paid on age related wages in the federal system. Some industries&mdash;that is, those involving physical or labouring work&mdash;pay young people standard award wages or full competency based wages. The 100,000&hyphen;odd young people who this year will commence apprenticeships or traineeships will be paid according to progress through their training, not on the basis of their age. Young people who finish training or apprenticeships move to qualified rather than age based rates of pay. In fact, junior rates apply to only about 220,000 of the 590,000 workers aged under 20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About 70 per cent of junior rates workers are employed in the retail industry. Full&hyphen;time employment amongst this category has not grown significantly in two decades. Virtually all new youth jobs are casual or part time, including about 80 per cent of retail jobs. This makes young workers even more vulnerable to the whims of employers. Only about one in six are unionised; a key reason why there has been no significant review of junior rates, even during the review of award salary systems under the award restructuring process. They just did not matter enough to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A test case will require employers and the government to put up or shut up on the argument that abolishing junior rates will cost jobs. It will allow interested parties outside the union who represent only one in six young people and employers to make proposals. It will allow the AIRC to fundamentally review the unwritten assumption in current awards that young people should always be paid less than adult employees. It will give the AIRC a clear instruction from parliament to give the industrial problems of young workers the priority they have been denied due to lack of interest from both unions and employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, the test case will develop principles for the replacement or modification of junior rates capable of adoption by each of the state industrial commissions. Then we will not have to rely on any Labor government who will not do it. Through the mechanism of a test case, we can achieve the review of junior rates in both federal and state awards. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> By way of precedent, in 1993 the Democrats moved an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act requiring the AIRC to commence a test case to examine the issue of leave to care for sick members of a worker's household.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That test case reported two years later. It was adopted by all state commissions and is now being implemented into awards. It was a highly successful process which offered a real and comprehensive solution to the then vexed questions of carers leave. We believe it can and will do the same on junior rates. It would have been easy for us to adopt the principled but wasteful and hopeless idea that we can just carry on as we were before. But we have taken a hard decision to go the right route to get this age discrimination overturned through a mechanism that we believe will work in both federal and state arenas, because we cannot rely on Labor and we have never been able to.</PARA></SPEECH>

I would ask both him and the parliamentary secretary about the propriety of 120B, given that the full bench of the commission is required to report to the minister in 1999 about its views on junior rates. It directs the commission as to what it ought to take into account in making its assessment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems extraordinary to me that a body that is meant to be an arbitrator or a conciliator&mdash;to stand above the fray, as it were&mdash;is now invited to express an opinion about matters which are absolutely germane to the sorts of things that might be brought forward in an industrial dispute. That is the first question. I would like an answer to that. It is a bit like asking the Federal Court or the High Court to give its opinion about a particular constitutional issue, and then have people go before that court to debate that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps I can explain myself further. If the full bench comes down in favour of youth wages, what is an employer going to think about it when he or she goes to this full <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5225"> bench? Or if the full bench says there ought not be full wages, what are the union or the employees going to do about it? In any event, where does the full bench get its jurisdiction on this point?

It is giving advice to government when that very government might well be a litigant before that very bench. It seems to be a most extraordinary process to undertake.</PARA>

Madam Chair, as you know and as your reading of my first speech and other speeches that I have made in this place attest, this is an issue which I have a great deal of interest in, a great deal of commitment to and one I feel very passionately and strongly about. Members of the ALP have referred to me on a number of occasions in the last half hour or <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5226"> so and have made it into a very personal debate. I am not surprised they are playing for the person in this debate, because they do not have the ball.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most disappointing feature of this debate is that, yes, like Senator Woodley, I have been waiting to hear alternatives being proffered. I too support the move to a competency based training system. I too support a shift in emphasis from people's age and rates to their experience, their training levels and their skills. I do not support the notion of youth wages; I do not support the notion of exploitation of young people simply because they are young; and I do not support the idea of proffering the notion of what Senator Lundy referred to as a living wage. Senator Murray has just countered that argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that government and opposition advisers as well as members are aware that, in effect, the national training wage&mdash;the scheme that has been put forward&mdash;is a de facto aged based system. It is one thing to come in here and do political and petty point scoring. No wonder young people are cynical about politics and politicians. The youth poll surveys that we conduct every year&mdash;I might add that no other political party surveys young Australians every year&mdash;show that 98 per cent of young people do not trust us as far as they could spit a rat. The point is that they do not trust sham solutions either.</PARA>

I do not for one minute imagine that the coalition government would incorporate my preferred position in law. What is the alternative in a political sense? The political alternative is that we&mdash;I suspect that the people on the sidelines, the ALP opposition&mdash;would see this nation go to a double disillusion, in which I have no doubt that the coalition would ram through legislation that would not necessarily treat young people kindly. So it is within that political reality that the Democrats have indicated they will oppose the amendment put forward by the ALP or support the repeal of section 90AB, and it is within that political context that they have done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats are in the same position that we were in in 1993. We are left with the responsibility of coming up with a workable solution. In 1993, we had to come up with a workable solution, or at least initiate a process that would see junior wage rates phased out and replaced with non&hyphen;exploitative wage levels. As Senator Murray referred to, in the last three years, we have seen very little action. We have seen a joint union&hyphen;employer&hyphen;government body. Perhaps the Australian Democrats should have been present on that working party. We might have <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5227"> then seen a solution that did not necessarily turn out to be a de facto age based system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that we get on record the disappointment we feel towards previous and current state and federal governments. As Senator Murray said, there are state governments, both Liberal and Labor, which have had an opportunity to do something about the issue of youth wages. We have had to acknowledge that, unfortunately, the transition from a junior wage rate system to a non&hyphen;discriminatory wage based system will take a little longer than we had hoped. We have pushed for a proactive solution through an AIRC test case. We are hoping that an IRC test case will, once and for all, progress and resolve this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Junior rate provisions in awards have never been reviewed. However, section 120B requires that the IRC conduct a full test case within two years; that is, it should report back to the parliament within two years on the feasibility of replacing junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives. This report will also include an assessment of the desirability of replacing junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives, the consequences for youth employment and the utility of junior rates for different types of employment in different industries as well as the school to work transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The particularly positive feature of such a test case, much along the same lines as the carer's leave test case&mdash;which was again initiated by the Australian Democrats&mdash;is that, when it comes up with a solution that is practical and fair, this will then flow on to state commissions. This will happen in the same way that the carer's leave case was adopted by all state commissions and is now being implemented. I imagine that the IRC case will pick up those state commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the majority of young workers, as we know, are employed under state awards rather than federal awards. Seventy per cent are in the retail industry and 75 per cent are in casual or part-time work. The federal abolition of junior rates would not necessarily have flowed through to state awards and agreements. No other state government, Liberal or Labor, has moved to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> abolish junior rates, despite the opportunity to do so and despite the fact that a majority of young people are employed under state agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the IRC time line. I have expressed my disappointment with that. I think three years is too long. I acknowledge that, for a test case to be done properly&mdash;such as the carers leave test case&mdash;it does take time. But I would hope that this parliament and individuals&mdash;certainly Senator Kernot has pledged that she will be writing to the IRC&mdash;urge that this determination be brought down as quickly as possible so that, finally, a workable and appropriate solution is implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned the political realities. This is the only reason that the Australian Democrats would agree to defer an amendment which was of their initiation. This proposal&mdash;Senator Murray used the word `sham'&mdash;actually offers a workable solution as opposed to a sham solution. It is about bringing about real change for young Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Sham' is an accurate representation. The proposal that we are talking about is a sham solution. By allowing the cut&hyphen;off date to exist as it currently does, there is no workable solution at the moment to ensure that young people are no longer exploited or that their wage levels are non&hyphen;discriminatory. You are merely taking away the reference to age but not providing young people with something that Senator Lundy referred to repeatedly, and that is the notion of a living wage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have secured benefits for young people in this bill. It was a draconian piece of industrial relations legislation. I do not shy away from that. The Democrats have made it marginally better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="5228"> There are a number of positive things that the Democrats have secured for young Australians in the context of this bill, whether it is requiring all enterprise agreements seeking to change apprenticeships and traineeships to be approved by the IRC or the Employment Advocate to ensure that the employees genu inely agree and that the employees will not be disadvantaged in comparison with their award; giving the IRC and the Employment Advocate an express duty to have particular regard to the interests of young workers in all their functions; expanding government reporting requirements on the impact on enterprise bargaining on vulnerable groups to include young people as well; or expanding the rights of unions to enter workplaces to investigate award breaches, such as under&hyphen;payment, without the need for a written invitation from a young worker capable of being seen by the employer. There are a number of references and I am sure that Senator Murray will continue to refer to them throughout the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have made and negotiated these gains within the context of a regressive piece of legislation. It is against this political backdrop&mdash;this political reality&mdash;that my party has agreed to the repeal of section 90AB. I understand this rationale and understand that it was the best and only option available to the Australian Democrats. Senator Murray, all my colleagues and I remain opposed to the notion of discrimination on the basis of age. For that reason, we find this decision a difficult one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think I found it more difficult this afternoon to listen to members of the opposition championing their commitment in this place to young Australians; to have one honourable senator say that this is the first and only opportunity to show a tangible commitment to young Australians. You could reel off a list of incredibly regressive and negative things that their party did for young people&mdash;whether it was cutting eligibility of the dole, introducing higher education fees, making Austudy harder to access or reducing those payments. It is just extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not the only opportunity that this chamber has had to do something tangible for young Australians. But what this opportunity is about for one particular party in this chamber today is petty political point scoring. It is about attacking individuals and attacking my party because we are trying, yet again, to come up with a workable solution in a position where the two parties have failed for the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> past 60 years, but more previously, in the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All my colleagues are opposed to discrimination on the basis of age. All my colleagues oppose the exploitation of young people, and that means that we oppose young people being paid 40 per cent less than adult workers simply because they are young. This remains our view whether you dress it up as a national training wage; whether you dress it up as CBT; or whether you do what Hewson did in advocating a regressive $3 an hour youth wage&mdash;and the ALP quite rightly attacked him for this&mdash;while at the same time advocating a training wage and training benefits that were 40 per cent of adult rates for the same work done as adult workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats remain opposed to discrimination on the basis of age. This is not the first opportunity that we have had to come up with a workable solution. It is not the best. I am not happy with the time line proposed by the IRC. But this is not about scoring political points. It is about a principle. It is a principle to which we are all incredibly strongly committed. It is a principle that requires a workable, appropriate and fair solution.</PARA></SPEECH>

But there is a second and much more important reason for my being passionate. I will explain this in some detail. It is in respect of the hospitality industry and the work that is being done in respect of competency&hyphen;based training in that industry, about which I have some detailed knowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, in terms of accuracy, Senator Stott Despoja, I think you should read 120B. Look at it now. Look at what it says, Senator Stott Despoja. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before 22 June 1999, a Full Bench must prepare a report for the Minister on the feasibility of replacing junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives.  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5229"> </PARA>
<PARA>You might think this is petty political point scoring, Senator, but it does not say anything about a test case. I do not know whether you understand the difference or not, but there is a pretty fundamental difference between a report from the full bench to the minister&mdash;who I do not think will do anything about it, necessarily&mdash;and a full bench test case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A full bench test case, once that decision is handed down, carries legal weight. It is a final decision. But a report from the full bench to the minister carries, we would submit, not a great deal of weight at all. When you talk about sham, Senator Stott Despoja, that is what 120B is. This is a sham provision. It does not mean very much at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give the Democrats a good reason why the hospitality industry, which is one of the largest industries in this country, should no longer have junior rates as of today. Seven or eight years ago the parties in the hospitality industry&mdash;and I was involved in this at a national level&mdash;sat down and worked out, with respect to federal and state awards, competency based training, career structures and training modules that were fully transportable and fully articulated. They commenced that work nationally seven or eight years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray keeps making the point that state awards are more important than federal awards in the context of junior rates. A lot of state awards have a nexus with state awards. This is true in the hospitality industry. Some seven or eight years ago we commenced the work in the hospitality industry. That work on career paths, training modules and competency based training for all employees was completed some three or four years ago. We took a set of outmoded classifications which referred to barmaids, cooks, breakfast cooks, bar attendants and cellarmen and ripped them up and started again and inserted a range of career streams with gradings based upon competency, training and skill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> What will happen in the hospitality industry as a result of this provision that the Democrats and government have agreed to? Even though this work in the hospitality industry&mdash;an industry employing some 250,000 or 300,000 people&mdash;was completed some two or three years ago junior rates of pay will con tinue. The important thing, Senator Murray, about the completion of that work with respect to federal awards is that state awards in the hospitality industry, which exist in restaurants and clubs and cover some hundreds of thousands of people, have a nexus with federal awards. The changes in the federal award flow through to state awards. We have an industry where all of the requirements that you want to see have been met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have talked about the retail industry. The difficulty is that when you keep moving the deadline unfortunately some employers take advantage of that. What happened in the middle of last year? The retail industry took what it regarded as a realistic view&mdash;and the election result subsequently confirmed this&mdash;that we were going to lose the election so they downed tools and went on strike. They did nothing. That is what happened, as I understand it. For doing nothing, the employers in that industry will be rewarded with at least another three&hyphen;year extension, and probably longer because of the industry by industry assessment by the commission, and a report from the full bench to the minister which the minister does not have to do a thing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it was a full bench test case which would be binding on the parties I would have a little more confidence in the solution, Senator Murray, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Woodley. You put that position to us three years ago. It was a reasonable compromise at the time. I remember former Senator Bell explaining it in the chamber. It was reasonable to say, `Give it another three years and let the parties get together.' It was not a matter of the then Labor government going along and knocking their heads together. It does not work like that. The parties had to sit down and try to work it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have given one example of an industry that did that. I can give you all the paperwork in the world to show you the work that was done there. I am happy to give you that and to show that what I say is correct. When you keep moving the goal posts unfortunately employers in some industries will take advantage of that. I am sure in three years time they will come back and do the same thing. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5230"> I certainly hope on that occasion that you do not give them another three&hyphen;year extension.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have looked carefully at this provision. I was looking at a speech in 1994 on the ALP government's proposal to change the laws to increase that deadline to 1997. I am on the record at that time as opposing that provision. It is amazing how a deadline can move people into action. The reality is that, if those deadlines are reached, it will be a requirement that an agreement is in place. We have not reached that deadline yet. The state of the current agreement should not be used as the rationale for why we will not be requiring agreement to be met by 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe the repeal of 90A and 90B should be opposed. If we repeal the exemption from the discrimination clauses we will at least by 1997 be able to have&mdash;and the parliamentary secretary may like to indicate if I am wrong&mdash;a test case. If by 1997 the agreements are still discriminatory then a real test case could take place. I am sure there would be one quick smart if that were the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is amazing how a deadline can move people to act. I believe that the election stopped the process. I said in 1994 that I thought the whole aspect of youth wages was based on the NIMTO principle&mdash;the not in my term of office principle. That is what we have done here. We have actually seen that a process which should have gained momentum by next year will now be pushed to a time outside the current term of office of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means it will not be an election issue again but it will be decided just after whenever the next election occurs. We will go through this process again. I think it is time we bit the proverbial bullet. I think all the arguments that were given in 1994 by the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition remain. Social needs are the same, youth are less productive and less competent, lower wages provide an incentive for young people to remain in training, increasing youth wages could cause an increase in youth unemployment&mdash;they have all been refuted. Those arguments are no less valid today than they are now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that whatever has been <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreed or not agreed today, in November 1996, is a reason for saying that we will forget about moving towards that deadline in 1997 is nonsense.</PARA>

What does that mean for any of the budget bills? What does that mean for any of the bills that are coming up that are so important, including those relating to the HECS provisions or Austudy&mdash;the ones that we will get to vote on? What does that mean for them if the basic reason is to avoid a double dissolution trigger? I can only wait with horror, if that is the major reason for a non&hyphen;preferred position being taken, a step backwards in this area, to see what we have to look forward to with the other bills coming before the Senate which, if people operate on that principle, could be used as a double dissolution trigger.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This small provision is a very important statement from the parliament to the AIRC to clean up its act.

It should aim to get to the nub of the problem, not cloud it in technical and legalistic difficulties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order 310 requires that all records relating to the tendering out and awarding of the advertising and public relations contracts made in the course of the national gun control public education campaign be laid on the table. The documents tabled have been identified as a result of a search of the office of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) and the department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the documents identified, the Minister for Administrative Services does not intend to table those which contain tender information, comments or assessments which could have a detrimental effect on the activities of the firms involved in the tender process. It would be unfair for all the firms involved, it could damage the tender process and it would be against the public interest. Nor does the minister intend, in accordance with well established precedents, to table cabinet documents, legally privileged documents, documents which are regarded as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence or advice prepared for him.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In tabling these documents, I am advised by the Minister for Administrative Services that they include a version of the proceedings of the ministerial committee on government communications which, in at least one area, is factually incorrect. In particular, the minister places on record the fact that the recording of attendees' votes is not accurate. Specifically, it errs in respect of the vote of Mr Grahame Morris and omits to record the vote of the proxy of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams). The person who wrote the note was not in the room when the vote was taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus stood up this morning and made further allegations to the effect that there has been some form of political fix. I believe he said it was of `Fine Cotton proportions'. The Minister for Administrative Services answered this forcefully in response to his first question on this matter in over a month of messing around by the opposition. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is absolutely amazing that in the Senate we have had these accusations of a political fix to look after mates. It is absolutely amazing that we must be so hard up to look after our mates that we meet in committee from 5.30 in the afternoon until 10 past midnight. We must be so stupid that we invite the New South Wales Labor Minister for Police to come along and have a vote . . . If you reckon we are trying to rig under those circumstances, frankly, you're a bigger pack of dills than I ever took you for.</PARA>
<PARA>As to the allegations of a cover-up, I have just tabled on behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services three boxes full of documents. The slight delay in complying with the order is solely due to the unreasonably broad nature of this order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In respect of the comments just made by Senator Kemp on the gun control campaign, there are several issues in a broad sense that we contest. First of all, there are exemptions being sought by the government which just do not stand up&mdash;exemptions which indicate that they are trying <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5233"> to conceal what has gone on in this instance and exemptions which indicate a cover up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not dills, Senator Kemp, because we can see that the firm that got the contract at the end of the day was not even on the list of 1,000 which the government would normally look at. We are not dills because we saw that the firm that was short&hyphen;listed was not even on that list of 1,000. We are not dills because we are the ones who maintained at the last sitting of the estimates committee that that firm, DDB Needham, would not have been on the short list had it not been for the intervention of Mr Morris. Senator Kemp, you and your officers are the ones who denied this, and you had to come back into this place very soon afterwards and eat humble pie and acknowledge that we were right and you were wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not dills because, having spent $90,000 on research to work out which was the best tender, the government, in a closed meeting&mdash;having kicked out the public servants at close to midnight&mdash;decided that they would change the focus of the meeting without any research in respect of that. We are not dills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say to you, Senator Kemp, in closing on this particular point because we are running out of time, that there are precedents for commercial-in-confidence documents. We insist that you apply them. There are precedents for legal advice. Flexibility should be given there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a very serious note, this report from the Family Law Council,  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Involving and representing children in family law</EMPHASIS>,  in recommendation 11 at 7.51 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should ensure that adequate funding is available to the Legal Aid Commissions for the provision of separate representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A specific, dedicated fund should be provided for the purpose of separate representation in each of the Legal Aid Commissions. The separate representation fund should be reviewed annually and existing legal aid funds should not be depleted to pay for separate representation.</PARA>
<PARA>This report has come down in the context where the Commonwealth government has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5234"> announced its decision to end the current funding arrangements for legal aid on 30 June next year. The Commonwealth will cut something like $111 million from its contribution to legal aid in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee has a wide ranging inquiry into legal aid matters in Australia with some nine specific points of reference. Point No. 9 is `the capacity of the legal aid system in the proposed funding arrangements to provide for separate representation of children where such assistance is essential in the pursuit of justice'. That inquiry is ongoing. The closing date for submissions is some time around the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Law Council at 7.43 on page 44 has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The rationalisation and savings option</EMPHASIS> .<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a matter of concern to Council that the question of legal aid funding for separate representation, which has been seen in crisis for some time, has not been addressed to date.</PARA>

Legal aid is a very big issue. We have a wonderful and very rich country. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legal system within which we operate is essential to the quality of life here.

Those people should be accommodated by the court in all sorts of ways, with a view to mending the relationship or to separating the relationship in the most humane way, so that those sorts of things are properly dealt with.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to make a few remarks about the annual report 1996 of Australian Defence Industries. The end of the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year marks the completion of Australian Defence Industries' six&hyphen;year restructuring program. This program was created to place the company, fully owned and operated by the Commonwealth government, on a commercial footing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the program started, ADI were losing around $300 million per annum. This year, they have reported an operating profit before abnormals and tax of $4.7 million. Whilst this is better than prior to 1989, it is still far less than in previous years. There was also a $34.5 million write&hyphen;off in abnormals this year. However, this is in line with ADI's budget and the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year was always intended to be one of significantly lower profits, due to the end of the corporatisation process. This is due in large part to the substantial restructuring of the munitions business, which culminated in the opening of the world-class new munitions plant at Benalla, Victoria, in August of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One query did strike me as I flicked through the report. I refer particularly to page 37 where, consistent with the corporations code, the remuneration paid to directors has been outlined. It is noted, for interest, that the remuneration to, presumably, the chief executive officer of the corporation is in the range of $460,000 to $469,000. I trust that the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) is aware of this; that there are good reasons for such high payments; and that he is aware that, particularly in a year when all indicators of the company have shown it to be performing poorly, the salary and other allowances paid to the CEO are so high. I just note that in passing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ADI is working on a number of important projects, the biggest of which is its building <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of six minehunter ships for the Royal Australian Navy. This project is worth around $1 billion in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of Australia's best assets is our human resources talent in research and development. ADI's employees are no exception, and this is reflected in their construction of the Huon class minehunter, the most advanced ship of its type under construction anywhere. It boasts a variable depth sonar system, remotely controlled mine disposal vehicles and an advanced tactical data system. The ship also has multifunctional control consoles which can deliver all navigational and mine warfare data concurrently to the command team operators. This is advanced technology indeed and a reflection of the worth of those who have been contributing to this very worthwhile development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ADI are also building a substantial export market. Recent defence export successes include: sales of ADI's live-fire training system to the USA, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a contract for installation of C3I&mdash;or command, control, communications and intelligence&mdash;software at the five&hyphen;power air defence headquarters in Malaysia; the sale of ADI's eye safe laser rangefinder to Canada, with units trialled in Malaysia and France; and the use of the AMASS minesweeping and support system by overseas navies, with a recent sale to the US navy for testing. Indeed, if that program should be successful in the US and implemented throughout the US navy, significant additional revenues can be anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I speak, ADI is completing the building and manufacturing of two of its most important contracts in terms of the contribution to Australia's continued security. These are the world famous Steyr rifle and the Collins class submarine, one of the world's most advanced submarines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ADI has also successfully moved into using its defence knowledge and capabilities for civilian applications, sold both here and overseas. These include: major sales of cellular telephone and trunked radio systems in China, India, Russia and Papua New Guinea; environmental clean-up operations in Germany, Australia and the Czech Republic; <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5236"> the successful completion of Papua New Guinea's primary cellular telephone network; the recovery and recycling of coal tar sludge at the Australian Gas Light Company's Mortlake site in Sydney; the emergency docking of MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aurora Australis</EMPHASIS> and work on MV <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Monarch</EMPHASIS>; the repair of soil contamination; and a contract to supply eight 140-tonne cylindrical reactor vessels for the BHP Port Hedland hot briquetted iron project in my home state of Western Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the opportunity, in noting the ADI annual report 1996, to say something about ADI Lithgow, formerly the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory. The annual report says about ADI Lithgow:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Company's small arms business was a good contributor to profits in 1995/96. There is a continuing demand for spares and components for Steyr rifles, as the contract to manufacture these rifles draws to a close. The contract to supply Minimi light support weapons to the Australian Army has about one year to run. Thereafter, ADI's continuation in the small arms business will depend on exports or on any further orders from the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA>ADI Lithgow has a very proud record. The ADI Lithgow facility was one of the assets sold to the company by the Commonwealth in May 1989. The property is now owned by ADI Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Lithgow facility was built in 1912 for the manufacture of small arms for the Australian Army and at that time the major product produced at the facility was the Lee Enfield 303 repeating rifle. Since then the company's primary purpose has been to manufacture small arms. It did so during both world wars and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years several attempts have been made to introduce other products to take up excess capacity when defence orders were down. Such products included golf clubs, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sewing machines, kitchen mixers and a variety of other products, but regrettably none were made at a profit. ADI's recent efforts to diversify into commercial products have not been successful for a number of reasons. The economics and competition from nearby centres such as Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong simply made their efforts uneconomic, which is a great shame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Defence and local, state and federal politicians in the area are aware that when the current production of the Steyr rifle ceases, which it will do shortly, there will be a continuing problem for ADI Lithgow in keeping its present work force of 200 people. I understand that, as the current contract has virtually ceased for the Steyr and there are only a number of spares to be produced and the continuation of the Minimi light machine gun, there is a great risk that the present work force of 200 will be reduced. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, ADI Lithgow had 2,000 employees. In 1996 it has 200 and I have very serious concerns about the number of people that will be employed there in 1997. It is a very important facility for the township and area of Lithgow. The small arms factory is part of our folklore and the continuation of the facility is vitally important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of possible contracts are in the wind. One is the Thai contract for the Steyr; another is the Philippine contract for the Steyr; and there is also the possibility of a service pistol for the New South Wales Police Force. The world of weapons manufacture is a particularly competitive one. No&hyphen;one knows whether the facility at Lithgow will be successful or not. I might say that we would have been much closer to getting the Thai contract had it not been for the rather clumsy footed efforts by the previous foreign minister, Gareth Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is regrettable that ADI has not been able to find further contracts and a further role for ADI Lithgow. It is a world&hyphen;class facility. It has a very skilled work force and work practices have improved. I do not know whether enough initiative has been shown in promoting it as a facility for its continuation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5237"> as a very important part of our defence infrastructure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In taking note of the ADI annual report, I also want to look at the small arms factory in Lithgow. The factory has had a significant history. The factory has made a contribution to the people of Lithgow, to the economy of Lithgow, and it continues to be of the utmost importance to the area. It is an industry that has a synergy with the other industries in the town and the history of the town.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lithgow was the first community in this country that had a steelworks. When we think of iron and steel production in this country we think of Newcastle and Wollongong, but we should be thinking of Lithgow because that is where it started. It is an area that has coal mining and there is a heavy emphasis on electricity production. It is only commonsense to have manufacturing industries in that area with the electricity that is there and the fact that the natural gas pipeline now runs to the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of people employed at the facility has been decreasing in the last number of years and that is of concern. What is of concern now is the future of the industry. That is something which the government has to seriously address&mdash;where do we go with ADI; where does ADI take its manufacturing industry in Lithgow in future? The work force of that community is capable of not just producing the Steyr rifle and the machine gun but of a lot of other things as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Lithgow is close to Sydney and is on the railway line. Therefore, it has infrastructure and transport is not a major problem. The facility has a very highly skilled work force. In recent times the work force has had to change its work practices because the old 303s were basically a metal and wood component and the Steyr is made of moulded plastic and is state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art. It has required significant changes in technology and in work practices for the work force to be able to change from the metal manufacturing and fabrication that they were doing for the old Lee Enfields through to the plastics manufac tures that they are now doing for the Steyr rifle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a rifle that is very popular with the Australian Defence Force and the armed services. Because it is shorter in length than the old 303 it has led the ADF to have to modify their drill and marching procedures and presentations because they are not able to perform the same manoeuvres with the Steyr that they could with the old 303. However, that was a challenge that the ADI took up. I have not heard one complaint from any officer or member of the Australian Defence Force as to the value of the Steyr rifle&mdash;the fact that it is a very lightweight rifle but is also capable of rapid fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community has a desperate need for this facility to continue. It is incumbent upon this government to work closely with ADI to look at other alternatives and to encourage Australian industry into its manufacturing area. But this government is cutting research and development. That will have an impact on all industry, particularly this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the chance to only briefly look at this report but I would request ADI to look carefully at the future of this plant. They need to continue to have negotiations and discussions with the local council. I know from my discussions with the mayor, Gerard Martin, that there is a number of options they can put to ADI from the people in the industry in that area. It is incumbent upon ADI to take up those offers and work in close consultation with industry in the area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to speak on abuse of parliamentary privilege and the recent tragic death of retired New South Wales Supreme Court judge, the Hon. David Yeldham QC. David Yeldham served the people of New South Wales in a long and distinguished legal career as one of the leaders of the Sydney bar from 1955 until 1974, and as a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales from 1974 until his retirement in 1990. Since his retirement, he has deployed his considerable skills as a mediator and as an arbitrator in private practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew and admired David Yeldham&mdash;the man and the lawyer&mdash;for over 15 years. I had the privilege of appearing before him as counsel during his tenure as a Supreme Court judge. He was quick and decisive, commercially astute, and impatient of humbug. Litigants appearing before him were treated fairly and without fear or favour. He embodied the maxim that justice delayed is justice denied, and developed a formidable reputation for hard work, and quick turnaround and dispatch of reserve judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David was also a widely liked and respected figure among his brother judges, the other members of the judiciary in New South Wales. I was gratified to see reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today expressions of affection for David Yeldham by former colleagues, including the former Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, the present Chief Justice Murray Gleeson, the present New South Wales Governor the Hon. Gordon Samuels, Justice Ian Sheppard of the Federal Court, and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Justice John Clarke of the New South Wales Court of Appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To those expressions I can add those of my husband, the Hon. Andrew Rogers QC, a former Chief Judge of the Commercial Division who is temporarily absent overseas. Eminent members of the senior bar in Sydney have added their voices in tribute, including Tom Hughes QC and Chester Porter QC. David Yeldham's former colleagues and friends will miss his humour, his enthusiasm and his professional approach to his work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David was a family man. I well remember his face breaking into a broad smile as he detailed the latest exploits of his beloved grandchildren or the latest success of one of his children. David was devoted not only to his own family but also to other people's families. His community service included work with the Child Accident Prevention Foundation Australia and for the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say this to his wife Anne, his children and grandchildren: as you grieve, may you be comforted by the high regard in which your husband and father was held by those who were associated with him. As a community, we are the poorer for his passing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, his tragic early death has provided a timely opportunity for debate on the proper use of parliamentary privilege. It is now useless to speculate on whether the naming of David Yeldham by Mrs Franca Arena in the New South Wales Legislative Council, under parliamentary privilege, as potentially the recipient of favoured treatment by the New South Wales Wood royal commission in its paedophile inquiries, was causally connected to his decision to end his life. The relevant inquiry, I suggest, is how to ensure that the important and fundamental right of parliamentary privilege can be used responsibly and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate provides an opportunity for a person who has been adversely referred to in the Senate to have a response incorporated in the parliamentary record without the need for exhaustive inquiry by the Privileges Committee or undue technicalities. This is one possible way to balance the competing interests <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5239"> of parliamentary immunity with the right of an individual not to be unjustifiably attacked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most effective safeguard, however, is for all of us who have the right to claim parliamentary privilege for our utterances to keep at the forefront of our minds the profound and irremediable effect such statements can have on those attacked. I believe that there is a line to be drawn between compelling evidence on the one hand and mere suspicion, rumour, innuendo and smear on the other. In the end, we parliamentarians have to sharpen our judgments on where to properly draw this line. Outside parliament, the law requires it. Inside parliament, the test of conscience should be no less rigorous.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I turn to the specific issue that I wish to raise tonight, I would like to congratulate Senator Coonan on her remarks. Where you have both the responsibility for enacting laws and the privilege of being able to speak freely in the parliament, you have to bear those observations in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rise tonight to speak of a matter of grave concern which, if not resolved, will severely impact, if not destroy, the operations of a significant airline company in New South Wales. Impulse Airlines is a medium sized airline company based in New South Wales which provides both passenger and freight air services to a number of New South Wales cities and locations in southern Queensland. It is a very successful airline. It employs over 220 people. Most recently it won an award from the Australian Federation of Travel Agents for its excellent service and the all&hyphen;round quality of its airline operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is therefore very disturbing to see that this company is threatened with closure by a major multinational company; namely, British Aerospace. The particular circumstances of this issue are these: in April 1994 Impulse Airlines entered into negotiations with Jetstream Aircraft, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, for the purchase of a number of aircraft, in particular, 29&hyphen;seater Jetstream 41 aircraft. These aircraft were intended to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> replace the existing fleet of Beech aircraft operated by Impulse Air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Impulse Air, as I said, operate both a passenger and freight service. During the day, they transport passengers up and down the coast of New South Wales and into southern Queensland and, of an evening, they run a very important freight service to many regional centres. I am advised, if you get a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in any major New South Wales country town, it will be because it has been delivered during the evening by Impulse Air. Some of us may not quite like reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> at times, but this is a very important service provided by this company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Between July and December 1994 some five Jetstream aircraft were provided by British Aerospace or by Jetstream, its subsidiary. All aircraft had to be returned because they suffered from mechanical failures and simply were not capable of delivering what had been contracted for between Impulse Air and Jetstream. I am further advised that so serious were some of the defects and problems with these aircraft that, on one occasion, there was a double engine failure on a regular passenger service carrying 12 senior BHP managers between Melbourne and Newcastle. That resulted in an emergency landing at Sydney airport and a consequent inquiry by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aircraft had to be returned, and Impulse entered into negotiations for the return of the aircraft and/or for compensation. At this time British Aerospace sold its Jetstream division to another European consortium. Impulse Air took legal action against British Aerospace and on 6 November 1995 was granted permission by the then Attorney-General Michael Lavarch to take proceedings under the Australian trade practices legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proceedings commenced and, whilst I do not wish to debate at length the complete saga of those legal proceedings as they are continuing, it is clearly on the record that despite many proposals for mediation between the two companies as well as proposals by Justice Einfeld, who is hearing the  proceedings, British Aerospace has simply refused to come to the table. It has refused point blank <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5240"> to negotiate any mediation of these proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we now have is a situation which unfortunately so often arises in litigation between small companies and large companies and, as I have said on other occasions, between unions and big employers. That is, the big company can simply outlast the small enterprise. It can drag the legal proceedings out and refuse to ever come to the party and mediate, as has been recommended on a number of occasions throughout the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We therefore have a situation where this company has lost substantial income. In fact, this saga had a disastrous impact upon the business of Impulse Airlines. Arthur Andersen, the major accounting firm, has estimated that the failure of the aircraft supplied by Jetstream to live up to what was promised cost Impulse Air in the vicinity of $4.2 million in profit during the 10 months that they operated with those aircraft. That contrasted with the promise through the business plan which British Aerospace presented to Impulse that they would in fact make a $2.4 million profit if they used those aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does all this have to do with the Senate and indeed the public? It has a lot to do with it, because here we have a very successful Australian enterprise providing a very necessary service to the people in regional New South Wales and Queensland. If the company goes under because of the procrastination and deliberate delaying tactics by British Aerospace, then many people in regional Australia will suffer besides the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, this same company, British Aerospace, is one of the major companies being considered by the Australian Department of Defence for the supply of equipment and in particular the lead&hyphen;in fighter project. A decision on which company will get to supply that lead&hyphen;in fighter will be made before Christmas this year. Whilst no doubt proper consideration will be given to the competing merits of the companies who are in the race to supply extensive defence equipment, it is a matter of grave concern that, at <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the same time, one of these companies not only has failed to honour its commitments made in the past to Impulse Airlines but also has treated a local enterprise with such contempt. The government needs to give very serious consideration as to whether or not this is the sort of practice that we want to see in Australia, where a company can literally drive a small or medium sized Australian enterprise to the wall in such circumstances and at the same time gain business from the Australian government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening in the adjournment debate to mention what will probably become familiar in this chamber as a hobby horse of mine, and that is the issue of employment and the issue of dignity of people. But, in particular, this evening I want to refer to the issue of casuals&mdash;casualisation&mdash;and part-time employment. I find that these two areas are very much misunderstood in the community at large and are very much abused by employers in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make particular reference to my lengthy experience as a trade union secretary in the retail industry&mdash;as the secretary of the SDA. Over a long period of time I was able to see the balance of employment tip from being full-time employment down to being predominantly casual. Whilst my association with the SDA went back as far as 1976, in the early part of that decade we saw the introduction of extended trading hours. I believe that, as a direct consequence of those extended trading hours, we saw the introduction in fairly large proportions of casual employees&mdash;predominantly junior casual employees&mdash;who replaced more senior people who were employed in the industry at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> When I joined the SDA in about 1976, the mix was about 60 per cent full time and 40 per cent casual; by the time I left, the mix had changed to about 20 per cent full time and 80 per cent casual, with the vast majority of those casuals being people who were under the age of 21. Of course, they were people with little experience of the world, little experience and little ability to bargain for their <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5241"> rights, and little experience and little ability to contend with the rigours of dealing with an employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interesting thing is that, over this period of time, we saw entrenched in the minds of management the concept of the use of casuals, their disposability and their inability to branch out and adopt any other form of employment. Ultimately, about 25 per cent of young people employed in the retail industry are under the age of 18. This is true in many other industries now, such as the fast food industry. If you look at other service industries, again you will find a predominance of young people being employed in those jobs. My concern is their ability to bargain and their ability to secure reasonable employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that we were able to achieve through the enterprise bargaining process was an undertaking from the employers for predominantly more secure permanent employment through part-time employment with daily minimums and maximums, weekly minimums and maximums and regular rosters, so that people could have some predictability in both their lifestyle and income and a reasonable expectation of income. This was very important because, to my knowledge, it led to a real distinction between part-time and casual employees for the first time in about 15 years. To make part-timers more attractive, they were given the right to flex up their hours. The employers accepted that this additional flexibility made them far more desirable than casual employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The unfortunate thing in this situation was that, whilst we went to great lengths to explain this to the employees and whilst senior management was able to grasp the concept, middle and lower level management were not able to come to grips with the concept. This is part of the problem within Australian industry. Senior people in management are able to grasp the concept, but they cannot necessarily translate it into the lower levels of management. Hence our very good concern to promote more permanency in employment through part-time employment and to offer additional flexibility was not necessarily taken up at the rate that it should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been. Instead, people were left hanging with casual employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst casual employment may suit some people, casual employment is a very demeaning form of work if one is trying to get sufficient income by which to sustain oneself. If one is given the certainty of employment through a part-time contract without the need to be constantly at the beck and call of the employer, and with a guaranteed roster and guaranteed hours, there is the chance that one can step along the road to achieving dignity. This is a very important factor in giving young people an opportunity to see that they are something worth while.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Casualisation was definitely not the responsibility or making of the trade union movement. It evolved over time, because the employers saw the use of casual labour as a very efficient and effective means of running their business. Whilst that was their short-term view, in the longer term I believe that many employers are now forming the opinion that part-time employment, where it offers stability, is something that people will take up. Just as underemployment, be it part time or casual, is a curse, it is necessary to have people see that, with the availability of permanent employment, there is an opportunity for them to obtain some form of dignity. This is a fundamental issue. However, neither part-time nor casual employment, unfortunately, will give people the opportunity to have a career or, in the end, a very stable lifestyle. When they go into a bank, credit union or finance corporation and seek to get some form of finance facility, they find that they are turned to one side because they are in part-time or casual employment. That is a sad thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst part-time employment is a step away from casual employment, it is desirable to make things better for younger and older people. The ultimate goal is full-time employ <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5242"> ment.It is only then that people will ultimately be able to achieve their dignity. The trend towards casualisation has shown no signs of stemming in some industries. This must be a grave concern for all in the community, because this will mean that created in our society will be an underclass with few rights or little ability to survive.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware of the March 1994 report by the Western Australian Department of Transport entitled `Cape Peron&mdash;Rockingham, Management of Siltation at The Entrance to the Boat Ramp Basin'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The beaches at Rockingham have always been very narrow with no dune and sand reserves. Consequently, considerable protection works have already been undertaken in the Palm Beach Hymas Road area since at least 1966.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The design of the road link from the mainland at Point Peron to Garden Island was a compromise between two conflicting requirements. During the late 1960s planning process for the causeway, which was completed in 1973, the Fremantle Port Authority favoured a full breakwater which would provide protection to a future outer harbour to be built on the southern flats of Cockburn Sound. For environmental reasons the Commonwealth favoured a bridge. The compromise design was of a rubble mound breakwater with two bridged openings to assist the movement of water into the sound. The opening closer to the mainland enables water flow to the southern shoreline of the sound.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the causeway construction the environmental impact of the structure on Cockburn Sound was assessed. A recently completed report commissioned by the Department of Defence titled `Review of the Impact of the Garden Island Causeway on the Cockburn Sound WA Environment' states that:  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5245"> </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> `The Cockburn Sound beaches, particularly those in the Rockingham area, were subjected to detailed analysis in order to determine any effects of the Causeway construction. All methods of analysis, including a statistical study of beach widths, comparison of aerial photographs (1954&mdash;1972), sediment tracking, sediment analysis and a calculation of the net yearly sediment movement, showed that the recreational beaches between Rockingham and the Causeway were dynamically stable. Dynamically stable means that in the short term (one to five years) they may show extensive accretion or erosion but in the long term the beaches will have basically a constant alignment, sand volume and cross section. The contribution of ocean swell wave energy to these beaches was always small and was eliminated by the Causeway.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The causeway has reduced the wave energy approaching the beach from the west and may have also reduced the amount of sand moving along the beach. It is suspected that this has a positive result in maintaining the beach width. Thus, there is no conclusive evidence that the causeway has affected the nourishment of Palm Beach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent severe storms in Western Australia&mdash;the worst for 20 years&mdash;have affected the whole coastline between Albany and Geraldton, and in all probability caused the beach erosion at Palm Beach east of the causeway to Garden Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, my Department advises that it does not agree that the causeway has been responsible for the erosion of the Palm Beach coastline and therefore will not be providing any assistance to the City of Rockingham.</PARA>
