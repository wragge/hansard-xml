<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remember that when we adjourned this debate last Thursday I was making some comments which I do not resile from. I was asking questions about how to reconcile the notion of being an independent in a chamber which is no longer operating as a states house. I wanted to pose the question: what would happen if all non&hyphen;government senators came into this place and said, `Well, my vote is contingent upon my getting the best deal I can for the state I represent or the region within the state I represent'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Constitutionally the Senate is a states house, but it has not operated as a states house for an awfully long time. I do not know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing, but the fact of the matter is that party politics has dominated this place. That leads to questions about the national interest versus parochial interests, sectional interests or geographical interests. When I was negotiating with the government on the workplace relations bill I certainly never had in my mind asking for $500 million for Queensland or $350 million for compensation for Victorians who had to live under Jeff Kennett's regime for all those years.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BOSWELL" NAMEID="YE4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator Boswell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ha, ha!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That might have been a reasonable thing to ask for, but the starting point for us was the national interest, the interests of all workers and employers and the fact that we had some starting points in common. If the agreements that have been entered into by Senators Colston and Harradine are to continue, I was making the prediction that we would see an American <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> style gridlock, pork&hyphen;barrelling kind of politics that I do not believe Australians approve of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of Americans have contacted me since I made those comments. In America before the election campaign newspapers published things like `Senator X got $500,000 for us. Senator Y only got $250,000. The better pork&hyphen;barreller is Senator X. Senator X deserves your consideration for voting.' That is not the way we have done things in this country. Maybe we are to do things that way in the future. We ought to look at what doing regional, parochial deals means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants to look down the track, it might find that every piece of legislation, no matter what the principle involved, will now have a big price tag on it. Is that the price you want to pay? Is that the future you want for Australian politics? I have said many times and I will say it again, nobody minds losing a debate in a contest of ideas&mdash;debates on principle&mdash;but people do mind losing debates which have huge national interest implications. They do mind losing those debates on two votes where there are huge question marks about the rationale behind those votes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the only point I want to make. I want to come back to this and say to Senator Harradine that the reason why people have fought so hard against the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra is that the history of privatisation in this country shows that the minute you sell one little bit of it, the rest is gone. There is no guarantee what the balance of power equation will be in future Senates. There is absolutely no guarantee that, if it is a Liberal/coalition government, it will not be lining up as soon as possible to sell the rest of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who are really concerned about that have looked at AIDC and the Commonwealth Bank and that is why we feel so passionately about what only seems a little bit&mdash;one&hyphen;third. I go back to the lack of accountability and the identity crisis that comes with something which is a little bit privatised and I use the example of AIDC. When something is just a little privatised, there are the competing interests of two different sets of board members. There are those who are there representing the interests of the one&hyphen;third <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private shareholders. Obviously we know what their main focus is and it is a totally legitimate focus. Then we have the board members who are there representing the majority shareholders, the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, when we get into questions, I will pursue what this government minister will do when there is a conflict to resolve between the wishes of the one-third board members and the wishes of the two-thirds board members, particularly with respect to salary increases for board members. The history of privatisation throughout the world has shown that one of the first things that happens is that board members vote themselves huge salary increases. I remember Senator Gibson and me asking Senator Peter Cook when he was the responsible minister: why did the government not use its majority shareholding position to have some influence on the decisions relating to executive salaries with respect to AIDC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One-third may sound a little bit, but it is the beginning of the end. No matter what assurances Senator Alston might want to give us, we know the history of privatisation. It is never going to be any different. The next argument becomes: `Sorry, there is a huge conflict between being a private one-third and a public two-thirds. It needs to be worked out. We need to make it 50:50.' Then the next argument is: `It is 50 per cent private and 50 per cent public, we might as well go the whole hog and sell the rest of it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Colston and Senator Harradine, who left one little tiny question mark in their speeches during the second reading debate: there is no way you can guarantee that the rest of Telstra will not be sold. There is no way any of us can predict what the balance of power equation will be in any future Senate. It is such a risk to say, `It is only a third and the government will have to claim a mandate for the rest.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know what happens in election campaigns. As I recall, there were 55 policies in 35 days&mdash;some, of course, more prominent than others. I readily concede that the Telstra&hyphen;environment fund link was a major issue in the election campaign. I also reassert that, in every opinion poll that was taken&mdash;and I will <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6876"> get back to that when we get into the questioning&mdash;the majority of Australians said that they did not support the sale of one-third of Telstra; they did not support the link between the sale and the environment fund; and over two-thirds said they supported the right of the Senate to vote against the sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see what is going to happen in a future election campaign. No matter what all the other issues are, if a coalition government is returned, it is going to claim that that is a mandate for the sale of the rest of Telstra. That is why those of us who believe it is the wrong thing to do have fought so passionately over a third, have not been consoled by it being only a third&mdash;what harm can a third do?&mdash;and have been at pains to point out that the money for the environment heritage trust fund could come from a whole lot of other sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why I have asked both those senators to think again about the loss of accountability that comes with a one-third private and two-thirds public board. The loss of accountability is something that we in the Senate should take very seriously. The government is still the majority shareholder. In whose interests are the decisions by that board going to be made? We should be looking at ministerial control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be asking questions about these jobs in Tasmania and in Queensland. I do not deny that they are important&mdash;every Australian deserves the right to work&mdash;but we must not overlook the 25,000 jobs that are going to be lost. What guarantees are there that these jobs that have been secured exist beyond the next two or three years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you weigh up and trade off the national interest on the future profit stream forgone against the interests of a couple of hundred jobs elsewhere in the country? I think they are very important and difficult questions, which I intend to return to.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="6876" TIME="12.43 p.m." SPEAKER="Ray, Sen Robert" NAMEID="UI4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME>
<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(12.43 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government's major slogan in the election campaign was `For all of us'. It should change that now to say `For all of us if you have political leverage', because that is exactly what it has done in getting this Telstra bill through. Unless you have political <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leverage, certain areas of Australia will get a disproportionate response to others; it does not treat all Australians the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the essence of the arrangements made and announced by Senator Alston. His release on Friday clearly demonstrated it. There was no trying to hide it. There was a bit of dressing up here and there saying that there were specific needs in particular areas of Australia. Nevertheless, there was not much hiding the cynicism in what Senator Alston was putting out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, which has been critical of political correctness, now has a new definition of `politically correct'. You are politically correct if you live in a regional area or you are concerned with Tasmanian environmental things&mdash;that is the new politically correct group&mdash;but you are not so politically correct if you live in other parts of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who speaks for the workers of Clayton and Concord in this country, who have been ignored in this particular deal? Are they to be disadvantaged because they did not elect an Independent at the last election or because I did not leave the Labor Party and cut a deal over this particular matter? Are they to be disadvantaged because I would not do things like that? They are being disadvantaged by this particular deal. We are not treating all Australians the same; we are being very selective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a lot of critical comment in the press over the weekend about the actions of two senators. As much as I might be cynical about them and as much as I might disparage the fact that they see their role as a senator as entirely different to mine, nevertheless, that is their attitude. They believe in being parochial. They believe in the politics of the pork barrel. I do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never regarded myself as simply representing the electors of Victoria when I was elected to the national parliament. You must represent all Australians here. We are no longer a states house; we are a house that should be interested in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not so much those who demand who create the sin; it is those who give who create the sin. No greater sinners are present <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6877"> here in regard to this matter than Senator Alston and Senator Hill, because they are the ones who are playing the politics of reward. They are the ones who are offering the reward. I have nothing more to say on those who receive it. It is about those who offer it. Maybe that partly explains the lack of joy that was there on Thursday. They knew deep in their own hearts that they were being most unfair to a lot of Australians and being very fair to some other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we now have is not for all of us but for all of those who can screw a deal out of this particular government from the bottomless pit of the one-third sale of Telstra. If you are a telephone operator in Toowoomba, you may have a good future. If you are a telephone operator in Sunshine, Victoria&mdash;bad luck. I can tell you that, at the end of the day, if Telstra reduces its number of employees, it will reduce them by exactly the same amount whether this bill goes through or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are talking about is the point spread. Where will the job loss come from? It will not come from those who have political leverage; it will come from those who do not have political leverage. Therefore, what we have seen here is jobs in Burnie, Toowoomba and elsewhere traded for jobs in the other capital cities and other regional centres. All you have done is redistribute the pain. Again, the fault is not that of those who ask. The fault is in those who give. The fault is with Senator Alston and Senator Hill, who cut this particular deal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point I want to mention is the great committee that we are going to have. I have not seen a logical exposition of what committee we are going to use. I re-read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> this morning. Senator Harradine in his first contribution talked about a select committee. We have four select committees at the moment&mdash;about to come down to three&mdash;none of which has really been set up by the Labor Party, so it is our turn next select committee. Senator Alston in his contribution made no reference to the actual committee&mdash;none whatsoever&mdash;in his speeches. I do not know whether he has by way of press release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, in a second or third round contribution, Senator Harradine says, `Well, it should <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> go to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.' I ask: why should it go there? It is not part of legislation. We are going to have the third reading of this bill before the committee would have an inquiry. It is going to have no influence on legislation. Why should it go to the economics committee?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PANIZZA" NAMEID="JI4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator Panizza</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should have gone there in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza intervened just when I wanted him to, because what a double-standard senator he would prove to be if he votes for this. I do not care which committee it goes to. You are the ones who made the great song and dance about whether this specific subject goes to a references committee or a legislation committee in all your plaintive speeches here early in May this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, if it were just being done on merit, it would go to the references committee. I do not care which committee it goes to, but it should go to the references committee. That might be a bit of a problem, because the committee system you imposed on us in 1994 leaves it with a Labor majority. So let's send it off to the legislation committee where at least there is a government majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why send the redeemable preference shares issue off to a committee? I have not had one letter on that particular issue. It is being done as a sop to Senator Harradine. Fair enough. You refer it off to a committee. You really expect our people on the committee to put in three months intensive work. The moment the report comes down, everyone knows what is going to happen to it. You will hear the clunk in Senator Alston's rubbish bin from this chamber. Because he knows exactly what he is going to do with it. He is going to chuck it away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the question of whether the bill is proclaimed in May to accommodate this ersatz fake committee means absolutely nothing. The issue has been treated with contempt by this government from the start to the finish. From the moment Senator Harradine raised it, from Mr Costello's comments, it has been treated with absolute contempt. We now face the position that as a let&hyphen;out, as a rat hole in the back of the whole <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6878"> deal, this has to go to a committee which has to work hard for three months to bring down a report. No matter what it says, it is going to hit the bin. Why bother? Get rid of the sham right now. Why put the Senate Economics Legislation Committee&mdash;which probably has a meaningful workload&mdash;through this sham inquiry, which is going to lead to absolutely no conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let's say the committee does get set up in the next two or three days. Let's say it can advertise before Christmas. That will be good. Let's have the first meeting on 6 January and see this minister come here and give evidence. You come along, Senator Alston, if you are serious about this. You give up your aardvark world tour and come along and give evidence to the committee all the way through January, and I will at least say that you are serious. But I bet you don't. I bet you don't treat the Economics Legislation Committee with any seriousness whatsoever. You would just go off on your world jaunt and expect everyone else to take part in a sham committee, to bring down a sham report that is going to hit your rubbish bin within five minutes of the ink drying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why do it? Why expend that amount of money on what is an absolute farce? Why not come out and directly say that this bill is going through on a cynical political deal and wear the consequences? The one thing we do not want you doing is going back and running all these platitudes before the electorate that you rule for everyone. You do not. `For all of us' is now `For all of us with political leverage'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other interesting development in all of this is that Senator Alston has spent the last six months talking down Telstra. In answer to question after question at question time we have heard Senator Alston talk this organisation down, saying it was inefficient, saying it was not world competitive&mdash;saying all these things. The tune changed as of last Friday. Now it is a great institution because you are trying to get the price of it up from $8 billion to $10 billion. I hope you do get it up to $10 billion. I do not want to see Telstra undersold. I do not want to see it undervalued. You have spent six months talking down the price of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telstra. You are going to have to do a lot of hard work to talk that particular price up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question has been raised, of course, as to whether this is the end of the sale or not. If this government had just come forward and said, `Look, we're going to sell a third of Telstra,' at least you could have regarded it as an honest approach. But, no, in a cynical electoral ploy, they had to link the sale of Telstra to the environment fund, to the natural heritage fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why link it to that? You could have linked it to any number of expenditures if you wanted to. You could have linked it to defence expenditure or expenditure on legal aid. Why the environment? What was the magic about that&mdash;apart from political opportunism? Absolutely nothing. The very principle of governments tying either the sale or the revenue raising to a specific expenditure item is one that has to be regarded with great distrust. I know how much it is distrusted in Treasury and Finance. It should not be established as a principle of government that you tie a particular disposal to particular recurrent spending such as spending on the environment. Nevertheless, we have it here. At this particular stage of the debate, there is a need for rigorous examination of precisely what the details of the deal made are and whether they be can sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People say that this government has a mandate. I also campaigned in the last election saying that, in government or in opposition, I would not support the sale of Telstra. So a mandate&mdash;as was proved again last Thursday&mdash;is a majority of one or two in this particular chamber, nothing more and nothing less. I am disappointed; I am disappointed because of the differential treatment that is being meted out. I am frustrated because people I represent cannot have their jobs protected or their environment enhanced simply because I did not have any political leverage in this particular matter. Because I did not have that leverage, they have to go out there looking for a job. While Senator Alston is enjoying his way around the world in January, some of my constituents will be walking the streets looking for a job that they might otherwise have had.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6879">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not worry this minister's conscience, because he has shown no conscience on this issue. If ever I have seen a cynical exercise, it has been this particular one by the minister. He must bear responsibility for it. It is no use the newspapers trying to shift blame to Senators Harradine, Colston or anyone else. It is the minister in charge and the government he represents that must be held responsible for these particular arrangements. If these particular arrangements say that if you happen to live in Dubbo or Toowoomba you are a better person than someone who lives in Annandale or Concord or Clayton or Sunshine, then I think you have got it absolutely wrong. There is no even playing field for these particular individuals. They are being marked down because they did not have anyone who was willing to desert their political principles or party or willing to roll over and support this particular legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston, you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself for putting forward an inequitable proposition instead of coming out and trying to get it carried on its merits. You did not. The statement you put out on Friday is absolutely explicit, especially that part that refers to Tasmania and to Queensland. I reiterate that the proposal to refer redeemable preference shares to a committee is a total farce. Everyone has made up their mind about it&mdash;not that that would stop you sending something to a Senate committee, I acknowledge that. But why have them flog themselves around the country in January, February and March when the report cannot and will not influence the legislation? I do not mind the fact that it was a promise made by Senator Alston to appease Senator Harradine, but I do not see why we should pay the price of having to go out and work to pay the bill for putting it on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite possible for us to say that there will be no quorum on this committee&mdash;that our two people will not attend&mdash;but we do not deprive committees of quorums, because it is a rather childish way to approach things. So we will have to turn up. Our two key economic spokesmen in this chamber will have to put in to this particular report. But we know the minister will not be there. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister will be lying on the beach at Waikiki, having had one&hyphen;third of a day at the conference, thinking, `Gee, isn't it great to be a minister, sitting here in the sun on the beach at Waikiki while all those dopes back home,' including his own backbenchers, `are serving on an economics committee.' They will be flogging their way around the country doing a report that you intend to scrap the next day.</PARA></SPEECH>

The electorate made its decision to support the government. I do not know how many would have voted on the basis of a sale of a third of Telstra for the redemption of debt and for the establishment of a natural heritage trust.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I just deal with that matter please. One had to make a judgment as to what the government would have done had we blocked the third sale of Telstra. My judgment was that the government would have used this as a double dissolution trigger. And if that occurred, if they pulled that trigger, then in the current climate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you would have a total sale of Telstra. The only other way that the government can get through a total sale of Telstra during this Senate is to gain the numbers in the Senate. As I read the numbers they are not there for the total sale of Telstra. I would certainly vote against a total sale of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Excuse me. I would have allowed it to happen had I voted against the third sale. I would have allowed it to happen because if it went to a double dissolution you would have had a joint sitting of both houses of parliament with this bill as one of those bills which the government could put before that joint sitting. We would have been overwhelmed by the numbers from the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I may have made a faulty judgment, Senator Kernot, I do not know; but I did consider that matter very, very seriously and I do not think I have been wrong on those questions over a number of years. But I could be wrong. But, nevertheless, coming back to the question of mandate, then you apply principles. In this particular case I saw that the Commonwealth would still keep, overwhelmingly on the board of Telstra, control and ownership of that instrumentality. It is all very well for the opposition to lambast us for what we have done. What did they do about the Commonwealth Bank? Flogged the lot of it! Qantas, flogged the lot of it! I suppose they can argue that the Commonwealth Bank wasn't a natural monopoly and I can see that is a possible argument. Nevertheless, that is what they did. I voted against the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let me come back to the questions raised in this debate: the statement, quite unfairly made, that the government is undertaking some differential treatment of Australian citizens over this matter. That is preposterous; that in some way Tasmanians are getting better treatment than they deserve in this matter. Mr Chairman, you would know as well as any of us that what has been happening&mdash;the government decided to get the money. Why did they want the money? They wanted to get the money to help redeem debt <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6881"> and other amounts would go to the Natural Heritage Trust. Wasn't it quite proper for the government to consider the question of Tasmania's pre&hyphen;eminence in that area. Nobody denies that. The government accepted that pre&hyphen;eminence and disbursements from the funds should recognise that, rather than be made on the basis of population. It is quite fair and reasonable; nothing underhand in any of this. I wrote to the Minister on 2 August and laid it out in the open.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing I was concerned about was that Tasmania, so far as Telstra is concerned, had become the tail end of the Vic-Tas country region, and we had suffered because of it. Was it not legitimate for the government to consider representations that that should be reversed? It did reverse it, and I congratulate the government for seeing logic in that particular regard. That is not treating some citizens differentially to others. That is just making up the leeway. We have been treated, in effect, differentially by Telstra.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to make a contribution to the committee stage of this particular debate. I, along with a number of senators, listened with interest to Senator Alston's summing up of the second reading stage of this debate last Thursday. I think his speech is best described as one of the most infamous ever made in the Senate chamber. He threw political bribes around like confetti at the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6882"> expense of the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the territories. That is the truth of the matter. Senator Harradine's contribution, which we have just heard, that there was no deal involved, is extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is a coincidence, Senator Harradine, that Senator Alston put out a media release headed `Telstra presence in Tasmania and Queensland'. He then went on to outline, paragraph by paragraph, the sleazy, cynical political deal that was done by the government on this issue. For you to be so naive as to come in here and suggest that we did not see a political deal or suggest that this media release and the government's announcement of the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund was just a coincidence I think is a most extraordinary flight of fancy on your part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For my part, I believe, just as I am sure the majority of Australians believe, that a political deal was done to ensure that one-third of Telstra was privatised. And what a way it was done. The deal was unexplained except at the last minute by Senator Alston&mdash;funds for regional employment, the details about which we know nothing, and mysterious extra dollars for the Tasmanian environment, probably worked out by Senator Alston on the back of an envelope the night before he came into the chamber to make his speech. Side deals&mdash;sleazy,  cynical  political  side  deals. D-e-a-l-s, deals&mdash;that is what they were. Of course Senator Alston, the government and those who were part of those deals stand exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No wonder Senator Boswell is here with one of his running dogs from the National Party. They are already in the media salivating at the idea of extra funds for National Party electorates. You can tell the National Party, Senator Alston. They sniff the pork in the barrels, and what rancid pork it is. The National Party, above all others in the parliament, can really recognise when due parliamentary process goes out the window, can't they? They know that there is far more chance that money will be paid out for party political purposes rather than targeting genuine funds to address social and environmental <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> problems in this country. The coalition's normal slogan&mdash;the Liberal slogan, the National slogan&mdash;is: slush before accountability. That is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here in the committee stage of this bill, without any sort of consultation, we have Senator Alston subverting the proper role of the parliament, announcing a committee to look at the issue of redeemable preference shares. That is what we have had. According to Senator Alston, the committee will `flesh out some of the arguments that Senator Harradine has put before the Senate and the public over recent months'. If you believe that you would believe anything. How naive!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time this committee is supposed to be meeting, Senator Alston will be off on his overseas jaunt, on his extended overseas holiday. He will be considering all these issues lying on the beaches of Hawaii, riding the waves, getting the information back on the progress of the committee via fax machines, if he can be bothered, while he expects Labor senators and other senators to be concentrating on the matters at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine has bought this absurd suggestion. Senator Harradine has swallowed hook, line and sinker that it is all right for this committee to meet and discuss these issues and they can report back some time after the third reading of this bill has passed the parliament. I am surprised that you, Senator Harradine, would be so easily conned by the government on this issue. It is so transparent. A school kid would not fall for that one, Senator Harradine. I do not believe you are not fully aware of the consequences of your support for such a course of action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were being fair dinkum, Senator Alston, you would do something about appearing before the committee instead of going off on your holidays in January, instead of getting out of the country. Perhaps the result of the Mansfield inquiry is something you might care to give attention to instead of bludging around in Honolulu, London, New York and all the other places you are going to. You should be explaining your intentions to the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the territories. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6883">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are being disingenuous in the extreme when you say that the redeemable preference share idea is certainly worthy of further examination. You know it has been bowled out of  court by the government. You have passed the buck to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and he has rolled the black ball on it. You know that the government does not think this idea is worthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the committee will do is nothing more or less than dismiss Senator Harradine's redeemable preference share option because redeemable preference shares, as you and other members of the government have said on so many occasions, do not happen to fit the ideology of your government. All you want to do is go through the motions and call up a few experts. As I said on radio on Friday, it is a fig leaf for Senator Harradine before the whole idea is unceremoniously planted in the waste paper basket in the circular file in your office, Senator Alston. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has changed his  rhetoric quite dramatically on this issue. You would recall when Senator Alston indicated that the full privatisation of Telstra was inevitable and highly desirable. What was the reaction of the Prime Minister at that time? He got his doormat, Senator Alston, to come in. He put his doormat through the ringer and Senator Alston was told to get out and change his rhetoric. Mr Howard said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not completely satisfied as of now that there is a public benefit in selling more than a third. I would like to see how the third sale goes before I turn my mind to the sale of any more. It may well be the best thing is to have a period where one-third is owned by the broader Australian community as individuals with two&hyphen;thirds being in government ownership and much further down the track considering something more. Now that has been our position all along.</PARA>
<PARA>Oh, really, Mr Howard. It has conned Senator Harradine and Senator Colston apparently. In the newspapers over the weekend the headlines read `Total Telstra Sale Unstoppable: PM'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard has told a group of senior lawyers that the full sale of Telstra is now unstoppable whether or not it retains government at the next election. In <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relation to further privatisation, it is really a question now of not if but when and how.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the government line that Senator Harradine and Senator Colston have fallen for. How extraordinary! How obvious! How transparent can you get? You were hauled over the coals as Mr Howard's doormat when you made that statement, but it is fine for Mr Howard to make it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fine for Mr Howard to make it, but it is naive in the extreme of you, Senator Harradine, to come into this chamber and seriously address other senators and suggest that on the government's agenda is not the full privatisation of Telstra. I find it incredible that you could actually put that forward as a substantive argument in this debate. It has been completely exposed not only by the responsible minister, Senator Alston, but also by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where you seriously put that forward in the chamber in a debate just a quarter of an hour ago. No-one would fall for that. You talk about the issue of mandate in the last election campaign. When Mr Howard was Leader of the Opposition in 1987, he simply dismissed any concept of mandate, saying that the mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney. He has argued long and hard about mandate since, but it never seemed to apply in any election that the Labor Party won from 1983 to 1996, let alone the elections that were won by the Labor Party in 1972 and 1974, when Gough Whitlam was the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mandate of the Labor Party on this matter is absolutely clear. We made very clear, as did every Labor member and senator, which included Senator Colston then, what our position would be. It is absolutely clear in our platform what our position is on any proposal to fully or partially privatise Telstra. We said, come hell or high water, we would oppose the partial privatisation or any other attempts to fully privatise Telstra after the election. We have honoured the commitment that we have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also said that we did not believe it was appropriate to see environment funding in this country tied to the partial sale of Telstra; that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6884"> environment funding should be hostage to the sale of Telstra. We actually believe it is important enough to fund off the budget in its own right, and we made those comments time and time again. We made that position absolutely clear in the election campaign. Now we are in the process of honouring that commitment that Labor senators, Labor members and those who signed a pledge of loyalty to the Labor Party at successive general elections have made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our national platform has been clear. Our commitments in the election campaigns have been clear, and we intend to honour them. Is this a proper way for a parliament to run? Is this a way to properly investigate a policy that is supposed to be for the benefit of all Australians? Is there an attempt on Senator Alston's part to distribute Commonwealth money in a fair and equitable way? The answer is no. It is a sleazy, cynical, transparent political bribe that the minister stands condemned for. It is the sort of pork-barrelling that has never been accepted previously in Australian politics and for which all those who are involved stand condemned. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an exquisite irony in today's debate. That irony is related to the fact that the deal that the government is making in relation to the sale of Telstra is `whatever it takes'. The irony is that the very passing of the legislation will make it impossible for directions to take place in the public interest, whether for Tasmania or Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine has mentioned that there will still be the majority public ownership. Senator Harradine, please consider that under the Corporations Act it is not possible for the majority owners&mdash;that is, the public&mdash;to get public interest as the main component of the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way Telstra will operate. Under the Corporations Act and with the Gambotto case for precedent, it is quite clear that the interests of the minority shareholders in maximising profits must&mdash;not can, but must&mdash;be paramount. Therefore, the very fact that you have the directional concern about whether or not there is broadband rollout in Tasmania, whether or not there is employment lost in Tasmania or Queensland, goes out of the agenda once there is minority shareholding. The very ability for this minister to even impose those changes without government direction, once there is a minority shareholding, is out of the window. That is the exquisite irony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irony also is that perhaps the concept of redeemable shares may be looking at that. But we had on the weekend Lenore Taylor saying to the media, `Well, Senator Harradine wants redeemable share options.' She also said that that is a pretty silly idea but did not give any details of that. There are two possibilities here. Firstly, Lenore Taylor may have looked at the legal, social and other aspects of redeemable shares&mdash;I doubt it. Secondly, she may have believed what the government spin doctors have been saying to the press gallery&mdash;and I think that is more likely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we know that all along the government has been saying those things about redeemable shares, so we know what the reality is. Once this bill goes through, the reality is that the interest of the majority of Australians&mdash;the public interest in providing telecommunications services equitably&mdash;cannot be enforced under this legislation with the way it has been drafted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, the opposition has circulated an amendment removing the ability of the minister to direct Telstra. Obviously, it will be interesting to see whether Senator Harradine supports the removal of that ability to direct Telstra. If he does not, then this whole deal, I would say, is worth nothing&mdash;nothing in the short term. There might be something right now, whilst Telstra is still in public ownership. But, in reality, this deal may legally be challengeable once this bill goes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the irony of what we are talking about today. We are trying to talk about <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6886"> realities. If Senator Alston can tell us why the Gambotto case is not applicable, I will be listening avidly. But that is not my understanding. Then there is the minority shareholders' ability to maximise their dividends and profits; if it is not considered to be the most profitable thing to guarantee broadband rollout to Tasmania, the minority shareholders have the ability to challenge that&mdash;and that is under the Corporations Law.

<STATE> (Victoria)</STATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, sits over there on the other side of the chamber in all his vanity trying to look as if he is not smirking. In reality, this deal demonstrates what a weak, sneaky and unprincipled government this is. This deal exposes the fact that this government is essentially amoral. This is a government that has no principles. We have seen it for months in here where one line of argument will be pursued and, for the sake of momentary political advantage, another line will be taken. That is essentially what we are looking at here with this sleazy arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For some years Senator Alston has made a political career out of alleging that other people have been engaged in deals. I recall a number of Senate select committees where he based a considerable line of argument on his belief that the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Keating, had been engaged in all sorts of immoral, underhanded arrangements. For instance, with regard to the ABC inquiry, all sorts of allegations were made about the way in which senior executives were behaving within that organisation. The same sorts of allegations were made in the print media inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see quite clearly what happens when Senator Alston gets into office. There is no doubt about this whatsoever; this is a government founded on deals. This proposition is essentially founded on a crooked deal. I recall what you said, Minister, at the time of the print media inquiry. You said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would also hope that all the dirty double deals of those opposite will no longer be tolerated and that, having been exposed and caught out in this instance, they will never ever try to do it again.</PARA>
<PARA>How weak and sneaky you now look. How hypocritical you are. How totally unprincipled you are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have in this arrangement is an operation that essentially deals out workers in the industry, particularly in my and your state. I suppose it is fitting, coming from the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party, that you see nothing wrong with that. We see the whole structure of the Liberal Party in Victoria&mdash;this is the Ronnie Walker approach to policy making; this is the Jeff Kennett approach to policy making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This deal essentially undermines the reasonable approach to public policy that one can expect. This is a discriminatory policy being pursued by this government which will directly disadvantage the people of the state you claim to represent in this chamber. It is a deal that essentially sells out city workers in particular. It is a deal that is cynical and flawed. Job arrangements already entered into with Telstra, which are founded on the presumption of privatisation, have been directed by CS First Boston as part of developing a prospectus aimed at securing benefit for the private shareholders rather than the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this proposition, we already know that of those job cuts 20 per cent will come from rural areas and 80 per cent will come from city areas. We already know, on the basis of answers given, that 70 per cent of those job cuts will be in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. You, in the most cynical of manners, suggest that somehow or other we could establish an infrastructure fund&mdash;to particularly direct money to pork&hyphen;barrel your way into getting a few votes in this chamber. It is a deal that fundamentally undermines research and development in telecommunications. It is a deal that fundamentally attacks the principle of accountability in terms of the way in which money should be expended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is beyond doubt that a disproportionate number of jobs will be lost in Victoria as a result of this sordid arrangement. Minister, I ask you a very simple question: is it not the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6887"> case that the operator jobs in Queensland and Tasmania that are supposed to be created by this arrangement add up to about 140&mdash;30 in Hobart, 70 in Burnie and 40 in Toowoomba?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it not the case that you are proposing a new product called call connect? Is it not the case that you will be seeking to maintain this on the basis of a charge of some 70c to a dollar to directly connect customers seeking directory assistance&mdash;directory assistance that we could normally expect to be provided free of charge&mdash;and introducing a new charge which will be distinguishable by the new number imposed from the current 013 number that was operating across the country? Is it not the case that this service will not affect the total flow of traffic in the directory areas? Is it not the case that what we are looking at is a refunnelling of some traffic into these new service directory categories?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the establishment of the new centres will not involve any new jobs at all. We are seeing a transfer of some jobs from some regions to new regions. The total number of jobs in Queensland, however, will not grow. There will not be an increase in the number of jobs as a result of this sordid arrangement; positions within the Telstra network in other geographical areas will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, in Victoria and Tasmania they will still be operating one pool. Operator assisted services will not necessarily increase, but jobs will come out of other parts of that region. There will be a disproportionate attack upon workers in Victoria to pay for this sordid arrangement. At which Victorian centres will jobs be lost to provide for these 100 so-called new jobs in Tasmania? Similarly, of the 40 so-called new jobs in Toowoomba, how many will come from other parts of Queensland?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposition is essentially founded upon that fraud, and that is what it is&mdash;a fraud. I would be very surprised if you expected anyone to see it any other way. Very experienced politicians cooked this little deal up. Now they are going to come in here and suggest to us that this is a matter of high principle. There is nothing high about this and there is certainly nothing principled.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a deal put together by low&hyphen;lifes to get their arrangements in place in such a way as to undermine the normal legislative program that one could expect from the Senate. We all have obligations to the people of this country to administer legislation and our duties on a normal constitutional basis. There ought not be discrimination between citizens in one part of this country and citizens in another part of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is at the heart of this deal and is so obnoxious is the fundamental discrimination inherent in it. You put together, on the basis of some pork-barrelling arrangement, a proposition that gives advantage to some people in Tasmania and some people in Queensland at the expense of most people in Queensland and Tasmania and just about everybody in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask ourselves: what was the arrangement before these matters were brought before this chamber the other day? Was it not the case that the business plan being considered by Telstra already had in mind these arrangements being entered into? Was it not the case that the business plan had already concluded that 22,000 jobs would be taken out of the system, that one-third of the company would be taken out the door? Wasn't that the direction of CS First Boston? Were those not the arrangements this minister had already entered into? Was is not the case that the project Mercury documents clearly identified the basis on which decisions were currently being made within Telstra&mdash;that is, that privatisation would proceed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to saving $600 million a year off the bottom line to give benefit to the private shareholder at the expense of those workers in Telstra, their families and those regions that have come to depend on not only the salaries and services provided but also the income to those towns, was it not the case that those arrangements were already in place? If that was not the case, Minister, why is it that for the first time in the history of telecommunications in this country the government is now paying Telstra for community service obligations? That is what is happening. This is a great innovation, isn't <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6888"> it&mdash;privatisation leading to a situation where the rest of us pay one of the most profitable companies in the country to provide community service obligations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Was there a sordid arrangement that had taken into account what the business plan already said, or was it a new arrangement entered into whereby this company was for the first time receiving money from the government to provide what we would expect to be its obligations to the community as a whole? Which is it? I put it to you in those terms, Minister, because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made it perfectly clear that what we are engaged in here is nothing more than a sham. He says the total sale of Telstra is unstoppable, as was illustrated by the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> `Total Telstra sale unstoppable: PM'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a proposition dissimilar to the one that you put forward, that you were carpeted for but nonetheless clearly spelt out. That is the policy of the Liberal Party. There can be no doubt that the implications of the actions this chamber is taking is that this government will seek to sell all of Telstra within five years. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS> article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole of Telstra&mdash;worth up to $45 billion&mdash;will be sold within five years now that the ball has been set rolling, according to Prime Minister John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howard has told a group of senior lawyers that the full sale of Telstra is now "unstoppable", whether or not he retains government at the next federal election.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Prime Minister's position that has been spelt out in articles. It is the position that you, Minister, have spelt out&mdash;or are you saying you have not? It is a position that is deeply held within the Liberal Party. I would find it extraordinary if any experienced politicians tried to pretend to us a position contrary to that. You must expect to enjoy a degree of gullibility. I am afraid it just will not wash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What will be the consequences of these actions? This morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> spells out the statistics, and even the National Party should be able to understand the discrimination inherent in&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak again in the committee stage. More details are becoming clear since the minister made his announcement in the parliament last Thursday at the end of his second reading speech. A subsequent statement was issued after the vote was taken late on Thursday afternoon, giving more details of the arrangements he had particularly reached with Senator Colston and Senator Harradine to obtain their votes and their support of the second reading. What an astonishing statement it is in its lack of detail, in its sloppiness and in its looseness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have seen&mdash;and Senator Carr has already mentioned this&mdash;the first area of `extraordinariness', and this is the way the fund of $250 million has been allocated around the states for this telecommunications infrastructure fund. Firstly, this is $250 million over five years. One should just point out that, in the same five&hyphen;year&hyphen;period, Telstra, as presently constituted, would be spending $20 billion on telecommunications roll&hyphen;out. Minister, I say that because you say in your statement on presence in Tasmania and Queensland that over three years some $12 billion has been allocated by Telstra. By extrapolation, that $4 billion a year over five years is $20 billion, give or take an odd billion here or there.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am saying is that, if Telstra is spending around $4 billion a year on broad capital works, that means that, over five years, the figure will be about $20 billion. In that same period, you are going to say that we are going to help fix all the problems in regional Australia for $250 <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> million or $50 million a year. Compared to what Telstra is already doing, your bid is minuscule. I am telling Senator Harradine and Senator Colston what the minister has done, and what is now becoming clear. He has had access to the Telstra business plan; he has picked a couple of eyes out of it and has said, `This is what we will offer Colston and Harradine.' You offered them what you were going to do anyway. Of course, they think that $250 million is a sizeable amount of money, and for ordinary Australians, of course, it is. It is over five years; it is not over one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what has been put. You have got hold of the Telstra business plan. As I understand it, you have had it before you now for several months&mdash;maybe a couple of months. The old board that you half sacked approved it, and I understand that the new board has not disagreed with it. That business plan for the next three or four years has been before you now for several months. You have picked the eyes out of the business plan and sold it to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston as something special for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the allocation of how you have done this to pay off these two senators. It is $250 million to be paid to the non&hyphen;rural residents outside the capital cities of each state, which has led to the most extraordinary misallocation on a per capita basis. Senator Carr has pointed out that New South Wales gets $16 per person, Victoria $22, Queensland $30, South Australia $67, Western Australia $57, Tasmania $208, and the Northern Territory $168. But the bobby&hyphen;dazzler of all is the ACT: they get $4 million for around 800&hyphen;odd people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McGauran interjects. I am glad you have because what they have given to the ACT on a per capita basis is about $10,000 per rural person&mdash;outside the urban area of the ACT. This is the party that has abused the ACT, has attacked it as a waste of time to say it is remote. And yet they have picked what we ought to call the lucky 800. The lucky 800 have got hold of $10,000 each under this per capita grant. They will be pasting dollar notes inside <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6890"> telephone boxes in the rural area to find a way to spend it. This minister, in trying to get a formula that is rorted to give a bucket of money particularly to Senator Harradine, has to come up with this convoluted formula which means that 800 get $10,000 a head in the ACT. Senator Harradine, that is what they get. You did pretty well to get $278 per head in Tasmania, but you didn't crack it like the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why this is a rushed and rorted job. They did not think of the ACT until the figures actually came out. I ask the minister this in this committee stage: when you reached the $250, and although you are giving it on the basis of a percentage of non&hyphen;capital city residents, in the raw figures, how could New South Wales get $37.4 million, Victoria $28.5 million, Queensland $53.1 million, South Australia $26.5 million and the Northern Territory $16 million and so on for the other states? The ACT got $4 million. Before you allocated it to the non&hyphen;rural area, how did you get the list broken up? This seems to have been done almost like throwing a dart at a dartboard: whatever number you hit, that is what you have got. This table clearly shows the rort, and the fix is on. Senator Harradine, if you do not happen to live in the rural area of the ACT&mdash;if you do not live down the back of the Brindabellas&mdash;you really have not done as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a number of people said around the chamber, this is a good question and it is a question that I am pleased to answer. I have seen evidence that supports the proposition that Labor left middle Australia far behind. For example, there were reports at the weekend that in a paper presented to the eighth national conference of the Australian Population Association Ann Harding suggested that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After taking full account of inflation, there were declines in real market and disposable incomes received by the average Australian household between 1982 and 1993&hyphen;94.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Harding continues by noting that the 40 per cent of Australians living in the middle of the income distribution faced a $12 a week real decline in their needs adjusted incomes during the 11&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are always caveats to studies of this kind. But the study is quite consistent with what most Australians strongly believe, that Labor was not about helping middle Australia. Frankly, I cannot recall a constituent of mine ever saying to me that Labor looked after middle Australia. In fact, they did not and that is well known and they paid a heavy penalty. Labor have confessed as much following their massive defeat at the March election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans, said that many Australian families earning between $30,000 and $40,000 felt badly treated under the Keating government. How right he was. In a report earlier this year a New South Wales Labor Party committee&mdash;which had Laurie Ferguson on it&mdash;stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor waged a back&hyphen;foot battle to convince the electorate that due to social wage gains poor Australians were better off. Insecurity was rampant and a central issue. Few believed that their conditions had improved. What they noticed was essentially wage stagnation.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over time the Accord forced wage earners to make a disproportionate sacrifice to the process of restructuring the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition recognises that middle Australians did it very tough under Labor. This government is not going to leave middle Australia behind and our policies are aimed at ensuring that middle Australia gets the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recognition and the support it deserves. For example, since coming to office families have enjoyed a $145 a month benefit on an average $100,000 loan through lower interest rates. The coalition is serious about securing a low interest rate environment and its policies aim to achieve that goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, recently the government passed legislation fulfilling its promise to provide the $1 billion family tax initiative which will help 80 per cent of all families with children starting on new year's day. The government has introduced a budget strategy which will turn around the $100 billion debt which Labor left behind for Australian families to repay. Of course, the workplace reform bill aims to boost employment and raise living standards. The coalition was overwhelmingly endorsed by middle Australia at the election after 13 years of Labor betrayal and is now delivering on its commitments to them.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It started from a story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  that referred to the draft management plan for 1996 of Kakadu National Park in which the current board and my department raised the issue of the definition of `wilderness' as a management zone within that park. The implication of the story was that, by addressing that definition <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of `wilderness' within the management zone, it might be permissible for mining to be a use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is misconceived. Under the existing law, mining in Kakadu park is illegal. We understand that. It is because a decision was made that it was the best way to protect the conservation values of the park. It is a decision that we support. That is not surprising because no government in Australia's history has been more committed to environmental values than the Howard government. No government in Australia's history has sought to set up a $1.1 billion fund to reinvest in Australia's natural heritage. No government will be able to ensure, through the proper application of that fund, that the state of the environment is passed to future generations in better shape than we inherited it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with a government that is committed to environmental values and is prepared for the first time to set up a massive natural heritage trust to reinvest in Australia's natural environment, yes, this story in its implication is totally inaccurate.

In recent years, as it has upgraded its range of products, it has been extending the products available to greeting cards and stationery, amongst other things. Concern has been expressed from time to time&mdash;I certainly get letters on this subject&mdash;about whether or not Australia Post is using its profits to cross-subsidise its activities in those areas. That has been a matter for examination by both the Auditor-General and the Prices Surveillance Authority. Indeed, each has given a clean bill of health to Australia Post practices in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, we do acknowledge that it is necessary to maintain continuing scrutiny. Therefore, we announced in June this year that, through the legislation review schedule, as part of our commitment with the states and territories under the competition principles agreement, there will be a review of the Australian Postal Corporation Act. That review will consider the remaining limits on competition to postal services. Currently, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6898"> Australia Post earns in excess of 50 per cent of its revenue from non-protected areas, even though it continues to have protection for the reserve letter service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles that will govern that review will be those determined by the National Competition Council, and the review will be conducted by the council. The terms of reference will include issues such as access to infrastructure&mdash;interconnection&mdash;pricing, competitive neutrality and regulatory restrictions on competition. The national competition reform principles agreement provides that legislative restrictions on competition should be removed unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits of such restrictions to the community as a whole outweigh the costs. So the review will examine issues such as the extent of the reserve letter service and Australia Post's continuing involvement in ancillary businesses, such as the one that Senator Boswell has quite rightly addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of that third inquiry in recent years, we will be able to put to rest the concern that some might otherwise have&mdash;particularly in the small business sector where they are in competition, either through newsagencies or other retail outlets&mdash;that a very large player is somehow using its resources to unfairly compete against the smaller players.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, none of the evidence to date has supported that proposition, but I understand the continuing concern that people would have. Therefore, we want it examined yet again to ensure that consumers are getting the best value for money, but not at the expense of small businesses. I think we can accommodate both of those concerns.

We need to improve the effectiveness of the system because, as the Labor Party found when it did its wash&hyphen;up evaluation of its position after the election, the concern about the social security system was one of the reasons people gave for why the Labor Party did not get re-elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly than that, if we do not have a social security system that people can respect, we have a problem for those who are genuinely entitled to benefits because people will consider them to be using the system. They will not have the respect that they are entitled to. Also, we have to give a fair go to the taxpayers who are funding the system. It has to be acceptable to the taxpayers as well as fair to those who are entitled to benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is that the taxpayers over the last 13 years really copped it from the previous government. Senator Kemp has already referred in question time to Professor Ann Harding's study which was released last week. That exposed exactly the results of the ALP stewardship in which Australians over the last 13 years have really changed their positions. The ALP trod water for 13 years, but an awful lot of Australians got very much poorer. The middle 40 per cent of Australian households lost $12 a week, but what happened to the top 30 per cent? They went up by 15 per cent. So while the middle 40 per cent were losing $12 a week, the richest 30 per cent were earning an extra $15 a week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Parer, for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that answer. But moving on to the matter at hand, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) to a question without notice asked by Senator Crowley today, relating to private health insurance premiums, and to a question without notice asked by Senator Lundy today, relating to funding for women's organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>I find that the answer given in response to my question on the best allocation of private health insurance dollars is a matter of grave concern. When people contribute to their private health premium, I do not think any of them understand that they are actually funding university scholarships or overseas trips to the value of some $8,500 in the event you are a prize winner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman said with great flippancy, `I'd like to win a prize like that.' That seemed to me to be one of the worst answers ever given by Minister Newman. I do not care whether the minister would like to win a prize or not. What I am concerned about is whether or not people buying private health insurance in this country are having their health dollars taken straight through their health insurance companies and put into assisting the subsidies of university scholarships. It may be that university funding is being pushed, particularly by this government, to look for other sources besides government grants and contributions, but that is a separate issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should people have to pay precious private health insurance dollars to subsidise university scholarships? Why should we have private health insurance companies coming to this government and saying, `We need your approval to increase the funding,' when they are actually taking some of those precious dollars and putting them straight into funding for scholarships in universities? That is an education dollar, not a health dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private health insurance companies&mdash;Mutual Community in South Australia in particular, in this case&mdash;say, `It's just part of the way in which we try to get access to the community and an alternative way of encouraging them to buy private health insurance.' <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6905"> They could have very likely done that without necessarily allocating any dollars. A university might be pleased to include a letter in its letters to the alumni&mdash;`There is no need necessarily to try to buy this provision,' or the enclosure. Maybe you could have paid for the postage. But why scholarships? That is an educational dollar through private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, these private health funds have complained bitterly that their premiums are going up so much that they now need a tax handout from this government&mdash;$1.7 billion over four years, as I recollect, to try to subsidise private health insurance. We have seen all that benefit completely gone because of the rises in private health insurance premiums. Partly those rises are going to deal with the administrative costs of all private health insurance companies, except Medibank Private. The administrative costs are about 14 per cent for most funds compared with about four per cent for Medibank Private. Most of the private funds cry foul about this. There is a distinct advantage because of the administrative efficiency of Medibank Private. That should be seen as an advantage to that company and not something that government should try to subsidise or write out as the private health insurance companies want it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I cannot possibly stand by and see precious private health insurance dollars go to university scholarships&mdash;in other words, for education&mdash;nor can I see them go to pay for overseas prizes. That is the sort of business you might get if you try to sell a car, but it certainly does not seem to me to be the way we should be trying to persuade people to buy private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very concerned that the minister said nothing very much in her answer, certainly of no substance. She did not even agree that she would seek too much information and whether there was anything further to provide. I sincerely hope she does. I sincerely hope the government takes a long hard look at what is going on in private health insurance, because it is not to the advantage of citizens who want to buy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's responses on funding for women's organisations leave and have left so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> many women's organisations in a state of terrible confusion and anxiety about their ongoing funding. Many of them will now have to compete within departments to see whether they can get an allocation of dollars to support the work they have been doing up to this point. I sincerely hope they will be able to achieve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe the minister assists those women's organisations by leaving them to hang out to dry for months&mdash;getting three months funding or six months funding. It may be in place now for a few more months, but those women's organisations need more support, more assurance and more direction than they have gotten to this point from this government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very disappointed in the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, because she has been very lacking when it comes to standing up and speaking on this area of her portfolio. She is the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women. I understand full well how difficult it can be in cabinet. But quite clearly this government is not committed to continuing the policies of the previous government with regard to gender policy development. I have spoken on a number of occasions about these issues and here is further example of the fact that the coalition is not committed to continuing policies in relation to gender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are these women's organisations expected to do? Senator Newman has made some announcements, but they are so general; they are not specific. When she was asked by Senator Lundy in question time today to be specific about the aggregate of funding that will be provided, she did not provide an answer. Do we assume that there will be more money available for community groups and for the Office of the Status of Women? Sadly we cannot assume that because this government is all about cutting expenditure to the community sector and certainly cutting expenditure to the Office of the Status of Women. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6906">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether honourable senators would be aware that on a recent occasion two women from China came up to me and asked, `Whatever's happening to women's policy in Australia?' This is extraordinary. After all the criticism that has been directed at China in relation to its policies and attitudes to women and the focus on it during the lead-up to the Beijing United Nations conference and after, here we have Chinese women who have already heard that there is a problem in terms of this government's attitude to a continuing commitment to women. In estimates we heard that the national agenda for women's grants program has been cut. Now we find that women's organisations are going to have to compete with all other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find the minister's comment about the sandpit extremely gratuitous. Of course there should be a place where 53 per cent of the population can apply to when it comes to priority funding. There is absolutely no problem with having an identifiable area that women's organisations can apply to. That has been the role for the Office of the Status of Women. But their funding has been cut back, and they are operating effectively with skeleton staffing and are unable to keep up with monitoring the government's plans for implementing the platform of action from Beijing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, quite clearly, many women's organisations will be extremely depressed and very unclear about what the policy of this minister and this government is. While they will be able to apply&mdash;there is nothing special about being able to apply through other government departments as they have always been able to apply&mdash;we still do not know what the minister considers to be a core group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the definition of `core women's group'? The minister mentioned women in agriculture, I think, and women with disability. Are these groups core groups? What about the National Council of Women? What about businesswomen? What about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women from non-English speaking backgrounds, young women, older women? What about the Older Women's Network? Are they considered to be core groups? Quite clearly, the minister has <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> raised many more questions than she answered in her statement on Friday.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to take note of the answer given today by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) in relation to funding to women's groups in this country. It was with quite a deal of amazement that I listened to the answer. As is typical of Senator Newman, we got only a quarter of an answer. One of these days she will give us a full answer to something that is in her portfolio area. A quarter or half of an answer for a portfolio she represents in this chamber maybe we will accept, but this government is a quarter of the way through its term and this minister is yet unable to fully answer a question that she is asked on her portfolio. That is pretty slack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know there is going to be funding for core groups. The word `core'&mdash;we have heard about `core groups' and `core promises'&mdash;seems to be the in word following the election of this government a quarter of a term ago, but the government is never happy or willing to define what is in its core groups. We now have the minister saying we will know what is in a core group when the government puts out the guidelines and the criteria for these grants in March next year. What do the women's groups do between now and March? They have a quarter of a year, three months&mdash;it may be nearer four months, depending on the date of the announcement&mdash;to work out or try to fathom whether they are a core group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How much money will be available for these groups? The budget will tell us that. When does the budget come down? It comes down in May. So the government is calling for submissions in March, and they will know in May how much they have to spend. The minister says, `But the money will be ready for them by 1 July.' This is a very interesting time frame. They are going to have to work out what groups are core groups, who is going to get funding and how much funding they are going to get. We do not know. The minister cannot answer that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister did say that the government will spread the funding between the Office of the Status of Women and departments, but we do not know how much will be available <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6907"> through the Office of the Status of Women and how much will be available through the ordinary departments. I do not have a great problem with some of the money being available through ordinary departments, because it does make those departments aware of the needs of women. But, if there is not going to be any guarantee of funding, then this is a farce of a program. It is not a good and adequate program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also made the comment that she was going to increase the role of coalition female members of parliament to act as intermediaries, advisers and consultants for women's groups. For many years now we have had what would resemble a bipartisan women's policy. There has been unity about issues that concern women. The Democrat women have concerns about issues that are specifically women. Women from the Greens also have concerns. So do Labor Party women&mdash;and I have to say that Labor Party women make up 33&frac13; per cent of all Labor members of the chamber, but the minister does not seem to notice that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is obviously an abolition of a bipartisan approach to dealing with issues that affect women. I have a great concern about this politicisation of women's issues and women's business, for want of a better word. It is to be deplored, and the minister is to be criticised very severely for this. What will happen? Does this mean that the female members of the government will be able to choose which women's organisations to support or think are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> worthy? It removes from women's organisations the assurance that they will be treated in a non-partisan way and that public servants will use an objective method to determine who gets funding.

<PARA>I want to spell out a bit more of what I have said previously on the various programs that Senator Newman has avoided answering questions about. One of the issues she talked about was who gets hit when governments tighten the criteria for unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt she has read this, or if she has not read it, she ought to. If she has read it, she must have ignored it. The submission from Welfare Rights, in a letter on 28 October 1966, on this very issue, in committee, pointed out very clearly who is subject to the tightening of criteria when governments use this method, so they say, to crack down on fraud. In fact, they do not crack down on fraud at all. People who are into fraud and who, in a very sophisticated way, are defrauding the system are not caught by these measures. Welfare Rights, in its submission, comments on the people who are caught by the measures. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been our experience that those individuals who are incurring breaches, and multiple breaches in particular, are those people with mental illness (usually undiagnosed or untreated), drug and alcohol dependency or literacy problems, and people with neurological or fatigue related illness. As can be seen from the case studies cited in the attached report, these people incur breaches because either they cannot understand or cope with the system or the system cannot understand them.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about people who sit in Canberra in some airconditioned bureaucratic office, or even in the minister's office, who dream up these schemes to push people who <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6908"> are already disadvantaged even further down the heap. We are talking about people who, day by day, face to face, meet with people who are disadvantaged and who try to help them. And their testimony to this parliament&mdash;to this Senate and to its committee&mdash;is that it is those people I have just described who are the people caught by these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say to you that over 18 months ago, I gave to the Department of Social Security a number of examples of real, sophisticated fraud. To date, those people are still at it. They have not been caught because these measures do not catch them. Senator Newman can answer questions until the cows come home but neither the question nor the answer today got at the issue, and the issue is that the methods that have been put in place by the government simply do not work and do not fulfil the purpose which they say they are going to put them in place to fulfil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you a bit more about what I have said in the press in the last couple of days. One of the effects of the policies of this government will be that these people whom I have described will go from an average of 3.7 weeks without income to 6.8 weeks without income&mdash;with no income at all. They will not be able to look for work because, without income, all of the evidence proves that you cannot go out and find work. They will have to go on to emergency relief, further straining the resources of groups such as Lifeline, St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you some comparisons. This also came from the submission by Welfare Rights. Let me just show you by using some comparisons how uncaring, how bad&mdash;I cannot think of another word without swearing&mdash;this government's tactics are going to be. Let me give you some of the fines for people who break the law.

<PARA>Senator Kemp's answer was a non&hyphen;answer and there seems to be a conspiracy of silence over this particular issue. Senators may well ask: what is this conspiracy of silence; what have the ministers got to hide?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The simple answer lies in the Minister for Finance and his incompetence and total disregard for both the taxation and corporation laws of this land. The edict in this case by Mr Fahey, ably assisted by Senator Kemp, is `Do as I say, but not as I do.' What we have is this bumbling Minister for Finance who has been caught out once again regarding the management of his personal finances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the substance of this issue and the systematic failure by Mr Fahey and his representative in the Senate, Senator Kemp, to provide any answer to the now number of questions and issues that should be of concern to both this chamber and the Prime Minister and the public. Mr Fahey established a company in 1978 called Lochreagh, which, for a number of years, received management which I can only assume was in relation to his legal practice.</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until 1986, as far as can be ascertained, Lochreagh for all intents and purposes was in compliance with the company law at the time. From 1986 to 1992, Lochreagh, of which Mr Fahey continued to remain both a shareholder and director, failed to lodge company annual returns in direct breach of section 335(1A) of the Corporations Law. Due to this failure to comply with the Corporations Law, Lochreagh was deregistered by the ASC in December 1992, at which time the current asset of the company was a one&hyphen;third equity interest in a property at 19 View Street, Camden, which would then have become vested in the ASC commissioner as is required by section 576(1) of the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that Mr Fahey was Premier of New South Wales at the time, obviously trivial matters such as compliance with the Corporations Law did not even raise a concern with him; otherwise he would have done something about it, and he did not. We move on four years later to 23 May 1996&mdash;with Mr Fahey now a minister of the Crown&mdash;to the House of Representatives pecuniary interest register where Mr Fahey indicates that he is still a shareholder and director of Lochreagh Investments Pty Ltd, a company that no longer exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That Mr Fahey could still make that claim is a real indication of his capacity. If someone in the position of Minister for Finance for this country could make such a stupid mistake&mdash;if it is a mistake&mdash;about his own personal finances, what is he able to do with regard to the $100 billion that he manages on behalf of the public of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the things that ought to be of concern to the public and certainly of concern to the Prime Minister. Outside of that there is this question of the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct. We have seen how it has been applied to Senator Short and Senator Gibson, although when you look at Mr Moore there has been a different application. It would appear that again it has a different application for Mr Fahey. Surely the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public and this chamber have a right to know exactly where the Prime Minister stands on these issues and why we have not received answers to some of the very important questions that relate to the fact that Mr Fahey is clearly in breach of the Corporations Law&mdash;and may quite possibly be in breach of the taxation law of this country&mdash;yet he is the Minister for Finance of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely the government and Senator Kemp have a responsibility to answer these questions quite categorically and clearly. If Mr Fahey is not in breach of the taxation law and Senator Kemp actually wants to clear the air on the issue, why does he not refer the issue to the taxation commissioner for investigation and report? Why not? That would clear Mr Fahey one way or another. That is a challenge for Senator Kemp, the government and the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister wants his prime ministerial code of conduct to have any integrity, then he ought to propose to Senator Kemp and the Minister for Finance that that happen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when huge cuts are being made to health, to education, to dental programs, when pressure is being put on migrants, aboriginals, workers and the poor, it is hard to justify continuing massive expenditure to the rich and powerful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the last few years, under the pressure of international "free&hyphen;market" competition, we have seen Australia become more and more divided between rich and poor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxes cuts have been touted as "benefits", though inevitably service cuts have followed. Despite the clear impact on revenue, it has been government spending which has been blamed for government budget deficits rather than a diminished revenue base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no evidence that public need for government services has diminished. Governments, Federal, state and Local are providing more of these services on an increased cost&hyphen;recovery or a full user&hyphen;pays basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Policy decisions to withdraw support for a tax&hyphen;funded universal public service, even if it means taxes go down, cannot be justified if the result is reduced outcomes or being required to pay for a more costly private&hyphen;sector alternative. It may result in pricing those who need the service out of the market. It may lead to the reduction of disposable income if the service, such as education, affect most people. A system of collective payment for a collective service may be a smart option, especially if payment is based on a sliding scale that increases <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6914"> with income level, therefore increasing overall social and economic equity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we shift to the private market, the winners are always the big income earners. If the price is flat, the same for all, it advantages those incomes well exceed the basic level needed to survive. Where there is an income&hyphen;based sliding scale, contributions will be greater from the rich. For those with less income, they may get a public service below cost. Fair is a relative term. An equal price seems fair, but is not fair when there are huge differences in income. Ultimately the measure of equity must be whether it moves society in a more equitable direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been skewing our economy in the direction of the rich for many years. Unlike many company executives, who appear to be under no salary constraints, ordinary workers have had their wages and services eroded in real terms, although the previous government made efforts to minimise the effect though measures and benefits delivered and targeted through Social Security. The current government is now moving in to take that cushion away, claiming it is "middle&hyphen;class welfare". It will uncover the structural inequities based on wage disparities, leaving them visible in all their stark awfulness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is cutting basic universal services to the public, and making cuts to areas like merit&hyphen;based education, government continues to subsidise the rich. The academic, the nurse and the teacher, working and returning value to community and humanity are penalised and under threat. The corporate executive, and the corporation he works for, remains a favoured son, although their agenda is to increase private profit and the concentration of wealth, though not necessarily in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the biggest single handouts in terms of "corporate welfare" is the provision of the diesel fuel rebate to mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each year, we hand out hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits from these rebates to corporations that are among the biggest and most powerful in the world. Over the last 4 years, BHP alone received over $300 million. Major recipients include BHP, MIM, ESSO, the Aluminium Company of America (ALCOA), or Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ) (which has recently ended the pretext that its Con&hyphen;zinc Rio Tinto Australia (CRA) subsidiary was actually a separate, nationally&hyphen;based corporation).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We give these corporations hundreds of millions of dollars in order to take irreplaceable high&hyphen;grade resources away from Australia forever. We give them these subsidies even though the income back to the government from royalties and resource rents is negligible, compared to the value of the resources themselves. We give them these handouts <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> although they mostly simply ship our resources away, leaving other countries to make the money from processing them, leaving Australia to buy them back as expensive finished products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We subsidise these companies to dig up and send away our coal, our iron ore, and our energy products. We allow other nations to manipulate the price of these materials so that the value on our exports is minimal, minimising the return in tax, resulting in downward pressure on wages. Anyone who follows the coal&hyphen;price negotiations with Japan will recognise this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These corporations we subsidise so heavily are also often precisely the corporations that push most heavily to push down wages and conditions of workers. RTZ/CRA and Robe River have been out in front of the battle to break unions, to use individual contracts to create discriminatory hiring, where non&hyphen;union workers are given offered considerably greater salaries for identical work, where workers are locked out if they attempt to bargain for even basic rights and conditions. Government changes to industrial relations law will exacerbate this, and this is almost certainly the intended result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The money to mining giants goes to corporations whose gross income is often bigger than the gross national product of many nations. These are corporations that play nations off against each other to reduce their costs, usually in part through reducing the value of raw materials. These are corporations that are usually vertically integrated, actually going from extraction of raw materials through to the sale of end manufactured products. Alcoa or Reynolds are product names familiar in grocery stores, as well as familiar to those interested in global mining corporations . They are also among the most often horizontally integrated, with oil companies heavily involved in production of oil alternatives; coal, gas, solar and nuclear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of these corporations operate as defacto cartels; for instance, the famous "seven sisters" of oil, or the "six sisters" of aluminium production. The problems of transfer pricing and undervaluing of the raw materials is also well known. OPEC was initially established to try to assure the nations producing the petroleum received a fair share of the value of their resources. Australia became a member of the International Bauxite Association when it tried to end the exploitation, predominantly of developing nations, producing this raw material, by tying the royalty to the final price of Aluminium, rather than the nominal price put on the raw material, which companies in most cases sold to themselves. The nominal price put on raw materials was often so low that very little profit was made on extraction and export, and so very little tax was paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To its shame, Australia violated its agreement with other IBA members, undercutting them with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6915"> royalties of about 60 cents per tonne, and now is the world's major source of bauxite and alumina, although it is still an inconsequential source of aluminium. In Victoria, where we do produce aluminium, it is partially because that state has subsidised Alcoa's electricity needs, at an additional cost of about $200 million per year to Victorian taxpayers and power users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995&hyphen;96, the diesel rebate hand&hyphen;out to the mining industry was $749 million. In 1996&hyphen;97 this was expected to rise to $794 million, although with the government's additional handout to the limestone quarries it is likely to blow out beyond that. By the year 2000, the cost to the public is expected to be nearly $1 billion, approximately what the commonwealth pays for technical and vocational education, and only slightly less than the projected $1.2 billion in basic payment for government primary and secondary schools. It is equivalent to the total amount government pays to ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're talking about giving highly profitable transnational corporate mining giants handouts, from this scheme alone, that are 18 times more than the cost of the Commonwealth Dental Program!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Diesel Fuel Rebate for mining is unjustifiable. It is a distortion of the price of non&hyphen;renewable resources, and a subsidy for global consumption and corporate profit, at a time when we are making Australian consumption more difficult by creating pressure on workers for lower real wages and conditions, and higher costs, especially for those services that used to be universally available for little or no cost. It is a measure which, by subsidising the depletion of our resources without gaining real value from them, undermines the ability of other nations to effectively seek a fair return for loss of their resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our amendment is fairly simple. It takes the level of the rebate indicated in the Acts, and halves it for the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year. In 1998&hyphen;99 it halves the rate of the previous year, and in 1999&hyphen;2000 and afterwards, the rebate is set at $0 per litre. In other words, there is a phase&hyphen;out of the rebate over three&hyphen;years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legitimacy of corporate profits in what are effectively large social activities is contentious, but their advocates argue that they are based on the risks taken. What risks, when we are basically paying people to take our non&hyphen;renewable resources away? Even from a market perspective, such massive subsidies can only distort the market and artificially fuel consumption, to the detriment of social justice, since the distortion is paid for by taxpayers who are having services cut as a result. Consumption, constrained by income and need, may involve choice, but there is little choice on tax, and less on deciding that mining giants should be the big winners in competition for the tax dollar. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environmentally, such distortion of the market through subsidising resource extraction, can only serve to artificially fuel global consumption of non&hyphen;renewable resources through creating unrealistically low prices. In development terms, such subsidised extraction and undervaluing of primary products has been identified for over twenty years as a major source of the bias towards the rich nations at the expense of the poor, and which keeps developing nations in poverty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many reasons to end the diesel rebate for mining. I have outlined several. At a time when government is crying poor, dismantling the public sector in pursuit of an ideology which is opposed to the notion that government exists to facilitate the goals of the people and to the notion of universal services provided through progressive tax, it is appropriate to end the massive bleeding of revenue by way of subsidies to transnational corporations to come to Australia, dig up our resources, and take them away.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BANKRUPTCY AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I am introducing a package of measures comprising three bills Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1996, Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Bill 1996, Bankruptcy (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 that give effect to the government's pre election announcement in `Meeting Our Commitments' in which it announced that increased cost recovery for the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia (ITSA) would be pursued by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bankruptcy administration has traditionally comprised three main areas, namely court registry functions, estate administration functions, and trustee supervision and law enforcement type functions. The Bankruptcy Act 1966 provides for statutory office holders and private citizens registered under the Act to perform these functions, and to some extent, the various functions overlap.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, in practice, is the administrative head of ITSA. The principal functions of the office are to oversee bankruptcy administration, to prepare a report to the Minister about the operation of the Act, to manage the Common Investment Fund in which all moneys held by the statutory corporation called the Official Trustee are invested, and to review various decisions of trustees relating to matters such as income contributions, and discharge from bankruptcy. The Inspector-General, as delegate of the Minister, also authorises Commonwealth funding of proceedings and inquiries in relation to bankrupt estates and bankrupt deceased estates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of the statutory functions performed by the Inspector-General fall into the category of supervisory and law enforcement type functions. As administrative head of ITSA, the Inspector-General is the supervisor, under the Public Service Act 1922, of all the Official Receivers and their staff. With the enactment of the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, the Inspector General will take over most remaining administrative functions in connection with personal insolvency from the Federal Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ITSA delivers a number of public interest services which support the personal insolvency system, including the development of policy advice, information and education to debtors and the commercial community, particularly financial counsellors and practitioners, the exercise of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statutory Official Receiver powers to assist all bankruptcy trustees, and regulatory and law enforcement responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these functions, the Official Trustee, through ITSA, administers approximately 92 per cent of all bankrupt estates. In many of these there are few, if any, assets so ITSA is unable to recover fees in respect of about 80 per cent of estates. ITSA performs an important public interest function in administering these non-fee paying estates on behalf of creditors. Without proper administration of all bankruptcies the credibility of the personal insolvency system would be jeopardised. Our credit system is reliant upon a credible personal insolvency system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Budget, the Treasurer announced that increased cost recovery amounting to an estimated $3.648M in the 1996/97 year and $6.248m in subsequent years would be achieved in the following three ways:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current basic charge of 3 per cent payable by all bankruptcy trustees in respect of amounts realised and credited to trust accounts in respect of estates administered by registered trustees and the Official Trustee will be replaced with a flat realisations charge of 8 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest earned on trust funds held in bankruptcies and Part X administrations which are administered by registered trustees will be payable to Consolidated Revenue; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The flagfall fee charged by the Official Trustee on estates administered by ITSA will be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined effect of these measures will place all creditors, whether their bankruptcy is administered by ITSA or by registered trustees, on a more equal footing in terms of contributing to the cost of the bankruptcy administration system. The increased charges and fees will only apply in those matters where there are funds. They will not have an impact on bankrupts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation that I am introducing today will also produce a simpler collection method for fees and charges that are taken. It will streamline practices for both ITSA and registered trustees and reduce the paperwork burden within the system. For example, registered trustees will no longer be required to open a separate bank account for each estate, nor to issue receipts in respect of each payment into estates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Official Trustee's Fees</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a person becomes a bankrupt or enters into an arrangement under Part X of the Act a trustee is appointed. This person may be either the Official Trustee or a private trustee registered under the Act to perform the duties of a trustee in bankruptcy. A trustee is entitled to be remunerated for work <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6917"> undertaken on behalf of creditors in administering the estate of the bankrupt or debtor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Official Trustee charges fees based upon the amounts that have been realised for the benefit of creditors. These fees are imposed by regulation under section 163 of the Bankruptcy Act. The fees comprise a flat rate `flag fall fee' plus a percentage of realisations made over and above $2,000. So, if realisations do not exceed $2,000, the fee is the flagfall amount. If they are between $2,000 and $50,000 it is the flagfall plus 15 per cent of realisations between $2,000 and $50,000. Over $50,000 the prescribed percentage is reduced to 10 per cent of the additional amounts realised in excess of $50,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to increase the flagfall fee from $2,000 to $4,000 to produce increased cost recovery for direct use of the work done by the Official Trustee for the benefit of creditors administering estates. This will be done by amendment to the regulations. The regulations will also be redrafted into a more easily understood and applied form. Fees will only be payable in respect of those estates in which sufficient funds are realised from which fees can be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the three bills involved:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sub rules 179(2) and (3) impose a charge on estates administered by registered trustees and rule 181 imposes a similar charge on estates administered by the Official Trustee. This charge is payable at the conclusion of the administration of estates. The fee is calculated as a percentage of amounts realised at a maximum of 3 per cent reducing to 1.25 per cent for amounts realised in excess of $100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that this fee will be increased to a flat percentage of 8 per cent calculated on the basis of amounts credited to trustees' accounts in a six monthly period. The charge is to be imposed in a new Act, the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act that will impose charges relating to the administration of all bankrupt estates. The charge will be payable six monthly in arrears within 21 days of the conclusion of the particular charge period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first charge period will commence on 1 November 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trustees will be personally liable for payment of the fee which may be paid from funds held in the estate.

However, interest derived from the investment of moneys in the Common Fund does not increase the amount payable under the Act in respect of any estate or fund. The interest is regularly paid to Consolidated Revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast, interest earned on monies invested by registered trustees on behalf of estates they administer does increase the amount available to the estate. It is proposed that this be changed to place all estates on an equal footing, whether they be administered by ITSA or by registered trustees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A registered trustee of an estate will be personally entitled to any interest earned, net of bank fees, in respect of monies held in trust accounts under the Bankruptcy Act.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No amount of interest earned will be subject to income tax as the whole of the amount that would have been taxable will be payable to the Commonwealth as a charge.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to provide a power for the Governor-General in Council to make regulations which provide for fees to be charged for use of the voluntary counselling and mediation services of the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is part of the government's overall budget strategy to reduce the massive budget deficit that this government has inherited. The essence of the government's response to the $8 billion budget deficit black hole has been to make sensible reductions in outlays and increases in user charges to ensure that the burden of the need to reduce the deficit is shared across the whole community. To <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6919"> ensure a fair distribution each area must play its part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will allow regulations to be made prescribing fees to be charged only for the voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court. At present those using these services often make no contribution to the running costs of the court. I remind Honourable Members that the cost of running the Family Court is now in excess of $100 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major considerations favouring the imposition of fees in this area is the fact that the commonwealth funds the Family Court to provide counselling and mediation services and-also funds community based service providers which provide similar services. The community based sector provides these services for a fee to those who can afford to pay. Those who cannot afford to pay are exempt from fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demand is such that it is not possible for all to have access to the Family Court's services, in these circumstances it is inequitable that a service is provided for a fee to some, often residents of rural and remote locations, but others, purely on the basis of geography, receive a similar service for free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of making some charge for the provision of these services by the Family Court was actively considered by the previous government as indicated in the Attorney-General's Portfolio Budget Statement for 1995&hyphen;96. The proposal was also considered as part of the review of fees and charges in Commonwealth Courts and Tribunals commissioned by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While counselling and mediation are important there needs to be an adequate contribution by those who use the services of all of our courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its 1994-95 Annual Report the Family Court indicated that "fifty percent of all cases seen came to the (counselling service) on a voluntary basis to use the Court's primary (alternative) dispute resolution service without having filed any application at the Court."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people, in particular, make no contribution to the running costs of the Court. It is proposed that the provisions which relate to the waiver of other fees will extend to counselling and mediation fees so that those who cannot afford to the cost of the service can continue to receive those services free of charge. Community based organisations also provide pro bono counselling services for those who are unable to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to assure the Senate that I and the government remain committed to encouraging the use of alterative dispute resolution services. The Family Court's counselling and mediation service is one of the oldest ADR services in existence. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not necessary, however, that services be provided without charge. There is extensive use made of community based services where moderate fees are charged. I expect that the services that the Family Court provides in this area will continue to be fully utilised providing that the fees charged are broadly in line with those charged in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to levy fees only relates to those services used on a voluntary basis. Where the Family Court orders or directs that counselling take place no fee will be payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment does not, of course, impose any charges of itself and any such charges would have to be made by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the government's intention to request the Governor-General to make regulations that would impose a fee equivalent to what we understand to be the average fee charged by the community based sector. This would be a fee of $40 per hour. No decision has yet been made on how the fee would be imposed, whether it would be an up front fee or collected at an hourly rate. We are currently examining, with the Family Court, the most practical way of effecting collection of such a fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government estimates that the fee will generate revenue of approximately $1.7 million in a full year. This initiative will make a significant contribution to the cost of providing voluntary counselling and mediation services in the Family Court rather than relying solely on community based services. It will also contribute to the achievement of the government's overall budget deficit reduction target.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS (REGISTRATION CHARGES) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 provides for Australia's international education and training providers to contribute to the costs of regulation of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensive national industry consultations earlier this year indicated universal support for the continuation of current industry regulation arrangements. These arrangements are based on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 (the ESOS Act). This act provides assurances of education quality and financial protection to international students studying in Australia. It does so by registering providers of international education and training, based on state or territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ESOS Act was introduced in 1991 to meet three main objectives, namely:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that international students in Australia are treated with equity and fairness;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to provide a positive basis for promoting Australia's international reputation as a provider of reliable high quality education and training; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that tax payers' funds are not required to recompense international students who may have been let down by individual education and training providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These objectives remain relevant. This is not just the government's view, but the universal view of industry representatives expressed in recent national consultations by an independent consultant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an industry which currently earns Australia $1.9 Billion in export revenue annually. The existing regulation of the industry adds value in the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> market place, with consumers willing to pay a premium for the assurances the regulation provides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Properly promoted such regulation can give Australian providers a marketing advantage over other international competitors. This advantage is recognised by the Australian providers who in the recent review of the ESOS Act particularly maintenance of the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are costs to the Commonwealth in maintaining this register. The Australian Government has maintained the CRICOS and related monitoring activities at no charge to the industry since the introduction of the ESOS Act in 1991. The current bill provides for a Provider Registration Charge which will recoup some of the future costs of maintaining CRICOS and the associated industry regulation and monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current bill proposes a sliding scale of annual Provider Registration Charges based on the numbers of overseas students enrolled in the previous year. The Charges range from $300 for providers with up to ten enrolments in five steps to $5,000 for providers with over 400 enrolments in the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For newly registering providers an Initial Registration Charge will be calculated on a pro rata basis from the number of whole months remaining in the registration year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these charges will be indexed against the All Groups Consumer Price Index.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In total about $1 million annually is expected to be raised by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current bill is complementary to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, which establishes administrative arrangements for management of the Provider Registration Charge within the existing ESOS Act. These administrative arrangements include a requirement for payment of the annual charge by the end of February each year and provisions for a charge to reinstate suspended providers on CRICOS and for a late payment penalty. The administrative arrangements also impose an obligation of providers to keep enrolment records and to produce them to the Secretary upon a written request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The international education and training industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major part of our growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade and diplomatic links, in addition to the $1.9 Billion in export revenue annually. This industry deserves continuing protection. This bill enables such protection to continue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensive national industry consultations earlier this year indicated universal support for the continuation of current industry regulation arrangements, based on the principal act which this bill will amend.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Properly promoted industry regulation can give Australian international education and training providers a marketing advantage over international competitors.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Veterans' Affairs 1996 budget package honours key pre&hyphen;election promises to the veteran community. It provides for simpler and more flexible entitlements. It is fair, with better access to services, and more assistance to help veterans help themselves. The government's commitment recognises Australia's debt of gratitude to our veteran community, who served us so selflessly in times of conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major initiatives cover the areas of health care, housing, rehabilitation, compensation and commemoration. In particular, a number of anomalies will be removed from the system, resulting in more efficient administration and simplified service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before discussing the bill in detail I would like to foreshadow a key initiative now under development in my portfolio to improve the delivery of services to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One group of veterans and war widows we have found to be disadvantaged, simply because of where they live, are those in rural areas. They are <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6922"> remote from the services that many in the city take for granted. Ready access to information and services is vital for all veterans but especially important to those in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to this particular need, I will announce in October a Health Policy for the Veteran Community in Rural and Remote areas. It comprises some innovative, cost&hyphen;effective ways to make more information, health and community services available in rural and remote areas. The policy will ensure continuing improvement in the provision of health care and support to the veteran community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of other health initiatives, which do not require legislative action will also be implemented as soon as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, veterans will now have a greater choice than ever before in the range of spectacle frames available to them. Multifocal lenses will also be available to those who prefer them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Veterans who require special footwear will find it more convenient to obtain their shoes and the necessary repairs. Veterans living in remote areas who need medical grade footwear can be issued with three pairs at one time. This will mean that they will no longer have to regularly travel long distances to get the shoes they need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligible veterans will now also be able to use any footwear repairer contracted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for repairs to their medical grade footwear. This means veterans will have greater access to repair services in locations convenient for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding will be made available to provide Australian merchant mariners with access to an asbestos screening program. This is designed to assist in the detection of illness related to asbestos exposure. Our World War II Australian mariners have not been eligible for an existing asbestos exposure screening program which is available to current and past members of the armed services and its civilian employees. This measure will ensure that all eligible veterans have equal access to the same services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The list of eligible drugs contained in the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be reviewed. This will ensure the best results from the pharmaceutical treatment provided to veterans and war widows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major review of the medication program for high risk veterans will also take place. The aim of this review is to reduce inappropriate prescription and medication use and improve their quality of life and health options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the measures contained in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition is committed to the fair and equitable treatment of veterans and will continue to ensure <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that inconsistencies and anomalies in the Veterans' Entitlements Act are removed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current asset value of allocated pension investments will be taken into account for the purposes of the assets test. This is how they have been treated under Social Security legislation for some time. It is unfair that some people could gain increased income support by entering into particular investment arrangements. As announced in the budget, these changes will apply to any allocated pension investment entered into after 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the other income support changes in this bill reflect similar changes being made by Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deeming rules will be changed to make them less complex. For money held as cash or on deposit, a deemed interest rate, currently 5 per cent, will be applied to the first $2000 for single pensioners and $4000 for couples. This change will simplify pensioner notification requirements because individuals will no longer need to advise about small interest fluctuations. This has been perceived as intrusive. For some pensioners the change will provide an opportunity to increase their overall income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will adjust the way lump sum compensation payments are treated. The calculation for the preclusion period for a pension payable to a person who has not reached pension age is to be changed. The compensation payment will be divided by the maximum amount of income that a pensioner can earn before the pension ceases to be payable. This will determine how long it will be before pension payments can be made. The partner of a person in receipt of lump sum compensation payments will no longer have a preclusion period applied to their pension payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very pleased that the Victoria Cross allowance is to be increased. A rate of $2700 will now be paid to our three surviving recipients each year. It is to be backdated to 17 August 1995 which was the date from which the British Government increased the VC allowance it pays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another anomaly we will correct relates to funeral benefits. A payment will be able to be made for costs associated with the transportation of the remains of a veteran who dies in financial need away from home when obtaining approved medical treatment. This assistance is available for certain other veterans who have died away from home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes several positive reforms that correct a number of anomalies in the Defence Services Homes Act 1918.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Veterans who have previously been assisted through the Defence Service Homes Scheme because of their own service, and who are widowers of World War II ex&hyphen;servicewomen, are currently <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6923"> not entitled to a second loan based on their status as widowers. On the other hand, World War II widows, who are also ex&hyphen;servicewomen can receive this assistance. This anomaly will be removed and these men will now be entitled to a second loan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of interest for additional advances under the Defence Service Homes Scheme will be reduced. This will allow new borrowers to use their full entitlements over time for purposes such as home repairs or modifications, without having to pay what is effectively a penalty interest rate. This measure will assist eligible persons to maintain their homes and remain in them as long as they wish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility for loans under the Defence Services Homes Act is to be extended to those who first enlisted in the Defence Force before 15 May 1985 and have not served more than 6 years but had operational service in Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia or Somalia. To date, this group of veterans has been denied assistance, even though their colleagues who enlisted later and served in the same areas have been able to obtain loans under the Defence Home Owner Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will make several other changes that will simplify administration of veterans' benefits and improve the service provided to veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A minimum variation rate, initially set at $1.00, will apply to income support payments. This means that variations in a pensioner's income and level of assets will not affect his or her rate of pension unless consequential changes in the rate of pension are at least $1.00 in either direction. There will be no need for pensioners to advise the Department about small changes in their income levels. This will eliminate unnecessary administration and also reduce the level of intrusion into veterans' lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Modifications will be made to the pension advance scheme which will also improve administrative efficiency. Applicants will now be able to receive one advance per year but will no longer be required to provide information about how the advance is to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes have also been made to correct an anomaly in the advance payment scheme. War widows and widowers who receive service pension or income support supplement at a `frozen' or `ceiling' rate will now be able to obtain the $500 maximum allowable pension advance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises the crucial role that veterans' advocates play in the repatriation claims system. Funding will be provided to ex&hyphen;service organisations so they can employ more staff. This will be additional to training programs already provided to ex&hyphen;service organisations on veteran entitlements and services. By helping to handle applications for review of pension claims to the Veterans' Review Board, these advocates will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> improve the efficiency of the repatriation claims process. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many other items in the Veterans' Affairs budget package that I have not mentioned. Another bill is expected to be introduced later this year. At that time I will provide Honourable Members with further details.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime, the initiatives outlined above demonstrate the strong and unequivocal commitment of this government to veterans and their families. These Australians sacrificed so much for their country and contributed enormously to the freedom and way of life we all enjoy today.</PARA>

<PARA>This is the second time such a motion has been before the Senate in as many months. A disallowance motion on these regulations was first brought before the Senate by me on behalf of the Australian Greens because of the enormous impact that export woodchipping is having on Australia's grand wild forests. The reasons which were pertinent then are as strong as ever, and they remain. I will come back to those in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since then the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee has had a look at these regulations and moved, through you, Mr Deputy President, for disallowance of the regulations. It did that for a series of reasons which were clearly laid out to the Senate. Last Friday, Senator O'Chee, on behalf of the committee, sought to withdraw the disallowance motion because he had been satisfied by reasons given by the government. I reject those reasons given by the government. The committee may have been satisfied, but they do not satisfy either me or the constituency which I serve. In particular, the committee found&mdash;it would, I think, have done well to have thrown its net a little wider&mdash;that these regulations do not allow for third party appeals. They certainly do not allow for adequate third party appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make out of this is that, when an export woodchip licence is issued to a company, the woodchip regulations as brought into this place by the current government give no right of appeal to landowners next door, neighbours, conservation groups or general members of the public. They are left completely out. There is no input from the Australian public about the proposed destruction of native forests for the voracious export woodchip industry once the minister has given the go&hyphen;ahead. It has been fine for the logging industry to get these regulations drawn up on its behalf by the government, but of course in doing so they have simply shown their lobbying firepower over this government; they are doing it in the face of an 80 per cent disapproval rate by the wider Australian public about the destruction of forests which comes out of the woodchip industry. It is interesting that, in the letter that the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister sent to Senator O'Chee, the first sentence says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a general note, the regulations were drafted in full consultation with industry representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Doesn't that say it all? The logging industry, in effect, drew up these regulations in its interest through the good offices of the minister. The public and the conservation groups were left out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to see recent NAFI publications to see, on the one hand, the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) giving a great wrap&hyphen;up in this place to the logging industry and its so&hyphen;called responsibility in terms of the way it goes about its business and, on the other hand, outright condemnation by the other minister involved in the handling of logging in this country, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), of the conservation movement. He even goes so far as to brand the Australian Conservation Foundation, for goodness sake, as `radical'. What you have is, on the one hand, a two&hyphen;pronged attack by the Minister for the Environment wrapping up the logging industry and, on the other hand, the minister for logging blasting the environment community. We are going to see that pattern set by this government all the way down the line as it pulls the rug from under environmental good sense and the environmental wellbeing of this nation, not least the forest environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We just listened in question time to the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) bucking the question of the future of the forests of Western Australia&mdash;which I visited again on the weekend. Of course, what will happen is that the mining industry will move in where the logging industry has let a very small section of the forest be protected. It is saying, `Well, we want to have a say here. If there's any chance of there being prospective minerals within cooee of these forests, we don't want you to protect them.' The Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, says, `That's okay by me. I'm not here to get in the way of anybody who wants to undertake destructive activities in an area of Australia under my control, no matter what the environmental excellence of it is.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6925">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hill might get up in question time and beat his chest about how, seeing the government have got some money out of the Telstra fund, they are the world's top environmentalists. But the fact is that money is not going to go within a bull's roar of meeting the repair that is going to be required because of the licensing of the destruction of Australia's forests when it comes to the need for future generations to try to recover from the greatest rate of logging in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that, since the issue of the licences, this government has moved to grant the big export woodchip companies licences for the export of 19 million tonnes of Australia's wild forests to the rubbish dumps of the Northern Hemisphere over the next three years. Let us look at the record of a couple of these companies who have been given licences under these regulations, which I submit should be and must be disallowed if we are really concerned about the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to the boycott woodchipping campaign put together by conservationists in this country to give the public a better acquaintance with some of these big corporations. I quote from page 10 of the document on Boral, one of the big operators in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. The document says that in November 1995, Forest Resources, that is Boral, said it would be laying 1080 in one of the private plantations near Weegena in northern Tasmania. Preliminary  surveys of the area by the Deloraine field naturalist revealed that an important regional population of the small marsupial, the bettong&mdash;already believed to be extinct in mainland Tasmania&mdash;was located adjacent to this site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite local protests the area was poisoned with 1080 by Boral. The parks service in Tasmania admitted to the field naturalist that it was possible the population of this amazing little creature, extinct on the mainland, could crash by as much as 50 per cent as a result of that poisoning by Boral. So much for their responsibility and so much for their input in designing these regulations which this government wants to push through the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to North Forest Products and a quote from the boycott woodchipping campaign on them on page 15. It says that breaches of the forest practices code in Tasmania by North Forest Products are numerous. It goes on to say that only recently contractors supplying North Forests Products Tasmanian pulp and forest holdings woodchip mill at Triabunna violated a streamside reserve, bringing in heavy machinery and building roads and log landings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the work was done without a timber harvest plan&mdash;that is, it was illegal&mdash;which should have been drawn up between North and Forestry Tasmania. In August, 1995, North Forest Products admitted the company had obtained pulp logs from two properties listed on the national estate. It had sent its chainsaws into the national estate. These were at Mt Vulcan, Simmond Hill and the Apsley Marshes. The Mt Vulcan forest provided a refuge for three rare and endangered plant species. Never mind, in went the company's chainsaws illegally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequent to North's admission, Forestry Tasmania&mdash;the government instrumentality that is supposed to protect our forests in Tasmania&mdash;said it had allowed logging to proceed in the non&hyphen;approved Douglas Apsley national estate area. It had given permission to override the illegal logging of national estate Tasmanian forests. The Australian Heritage Commission said it was probable that timber harvesting in any of those areas would have an impact on national estate values, and of course the Australian Heritage Commission is not unknown for its ability to engage in understatement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to Amcor. On page 22 of its corporate profile by the boycott woodchipping campaign we read that Amcor sponsors both political parties&mdash;Labor and Liberal&mdash;but the Liberal Party gains almost 250 per cent more financial assistance than the Labor Party. It also quotes from the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 23 August, 1996, which says that Stan Wallace from Amcor came out and said he gives more to the Liberal Party than the ALP because Labor has union backing. He said that everybody was now using that line. The story goes on to say that the Electoral Commission's <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6926"> latest report shows Amcor gave the coalition&mdash;the party of members sitting opposite&mdash;$217,000 and it gave the ALP $60,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see how influence just might work through companies like Amcor, North and Boral when it comes to&mdash;and I state from the minister's letter&mdash;the regulations being drafted in full consultation with industry representatives. That is why these regulations are faulty and lock out the public. This committee should have been concerned that there are no third party appeal rights for the public in these regulations. The committee was actually concerned that the regulations were not tight enough in giving the companies appeal rights to a ministerial decision; that is, that a  company refused a licence might be able to take action and have its appeal rights strengthened against that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter the committee was concerned about was the ability of the minister to delegate important regulatory functions to junior officers regarding the protection of the environment against woodchipping concerns once a licence is issued. The minister explained that away, saying he would not do that because he would be responsible. He said, `Trust me.' The committee apparently said, `Oh, we do; that drops our complaint there.' It was as simple as that. I submit that is not good enough. The environment does count and senior delegated expertise, and no less, ought to be in charge and supervising the woodchip operations of these corporations that have repeatedly broken the law in Tasmania, at least, in their woodchipping operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that the export woodchip licences which have been granted under these regulations allow for broadscale destructive logging of world heritage value forests in Tasmania&mdash;in the Picton, Huon and Weld valleys, in the Tarkine wilderness and in the Great Western Tiers. They allow for destruction of the habitat of rare and endangered species, like the white goshawk, which is down to 100 or 200 breeding pairs in Tasmania, and the Tasmanian wedge&hyphen;tailed eagle, larger than its mainland cousin, which is also down to 100 or 200 breeding pairs in Tasmania. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forestry Tasmania says that it looks after these nesting raptors and that it will stay 250 metres or so away. I have seen a picture of a coupe in the Tarkine wilderness in which an area was set aside because there was a tree with an eagle's nest in the middle of it. Forestry Tasmania allowed the logging of the forest at a distance from this tree, but right around it nevertheless. Then it set fire, in its regulation regeneration burn to the coupe around it, and burnt the whole copse with the tree in the middle of it, and the eagle's nest anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all shrug that off as the species move closer to extinction, as the forests go and as the wild environment, which is so important to human beings, is eroded every day. We sit here on our hands and, through regulations like this, divest the government of the responsibility, if not the power that it ought to have, to do the best thing by Australia's forest environment. This instead of the bloody approach to destruction of wildlife as well as rainforest, world heritage value tall eucalypt forests in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and now Queensland under the regulations that the minister has put through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was quite right to pick up on the deficiencies in these regulations&mdash;you could float a woodchip ship through them&mdash;and moved to disallow the regulations. The government's response to even the committee's circumscribed concerns is inadequate. Each senator who votes against this disallowance motion will be voting against the interests of any third party appellate in the country&mdash;that is, any ordinary citizen&mdash;who wants to appeal a decision by the minister responsible for woodchipping in the interests of her or his future, the future of their kids or, indeed, the wider future of the environment in this country. Each senator who votes against this disallowance is, in my book, voting in the interests of corporate greed, destruction and shortsightedness, and must shoulder the responsibility for their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I finally make an appeal, having read out Amcor's influence on the parties through the direct putting of money in the coffers of particularly the coalition parties, to the good <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6927"> probity of those senators who have woodchip shares, who failed last time but who might rise to the occasion this time, to consider the conflict of interest that comes through voting for regulations in the interests of the woodchip industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no getting away from it: to vote for these regulations is to vote for regulations which the minister himself has said were drawn up in consultation with the industry in which they have shares. There is no doubt that voting for these regulations is voting to enhance the value of those shares. There is no doubt that voting for these regulations is voting to line one's own pockets, if one has shares in woodchip corporations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make the  position of the government on this very clear. We do not accept the suggestion that the regulations that create these licences should be disallowed. We have heard from Senator Brown for some 20 minutes. In that period of time, his speech has been notable for an absence of fact. Now I wish to provide the Senate and those listening to this debate with the facts because we are pretty fed up with the sort of nonsense we have heard from Senator Brown. I will start with a press release issued by Senator Brown on 12 November 1996. This is really good. The press release starts with the words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The discovery of errors made by the government in drawing up regulations has cast doubt over the validity of woodchip export licences issued last month,' according to Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown.</PARA>
<PARA>The facts are that there was no question of invalidity. There were no errors. That was made very clear to Senator Brown in the media release issued by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on 19 November. This is some 2&half; weeks before he sought to prevent the protective notice of motion for disallowance over these regulations being withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, to my knowledge, has only issued two press releases in the 6&half; years I have been on this committee. The reason why the committee issued a press release is that it was disgusted with the distortion of the facts contained in Senator Brown's press release. I quote from the media release issued by the committee. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact this is not the case and the committee has never stated there were doubts about the validity of the woodchip regulations. The committee considers that the regulations are clearly valid.</PARA>
<PARA>You would have expected after that that Senator Brown would be too ashamed to continue with the nonsense that he did. You would have expected that if Senator Brown had any decency&mdash;and he lectures us on this side of the chamber about decency&mdash;he would have come into the chamber and apologised to the Senate and apologised to the committee for distorting in such a heinous fashion what the committee had done. But, of course, Senator Brown could not be bothered.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6928">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some other outrageous distortions contained in Senator Brown's press release of 12 November. I want to get on to those as well. I think it is important the Senate really understands that this is just the most deplorable political stunt. It is also important that the Senate understands that what Senator Brown is doing actually undermines the ability of this committee to work in a non-partisan fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate regulations and ordinances committee is charged by Senate with the oversight of regulations and ordinances. What Senator Brown is doing in politicising the work of the committee is making it harder&mdash;I will tell the Senate as chairman&mdash;for government senators to act in a non-partisan fashion because they have to start wondering what is going to happen if they put a protective notice of motion on a set of regulations. Is Senator Brown going to get up and pull another stunt again? That is what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown is not improving the scrutiny of regulations in this country; he is undermining it. But Senator Brown has a special regard for the truth. He saves it for special occasions. I do not believe that 12 November was one of them. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their haste to please the woodchip industry, Ministers Anderson and Hill have bungled.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile the government has allowed a massive escalation in export woodchipping to a record 19 million tonnes based on flawed regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>We have already seen that there were no flaws in the regulations. There was never a suggestion that there was a flaw in the regulations. The only reason why the committee put a protective notice of motion over this was to give them longer to correspond with the minister. If this is going to happen all the time, I will tell the committee and the Senate that I am going to have a lot of reluctance to put on a protective notice of motion because it undermines our capacity to deal with ministers in a fair, honest and transparent fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is that if these regulations are disallowed that will probably lead to an increase in the export of woodchips from this country because what these regulations do is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in fact limit the right of appeal of companies seeking woodchip export licences. So if these regulations are disallowed it will be open to the companies to appeal to the AAT if they are an aggrieved party; that is, if they do not get their licence they can apply to the AAT. So the AAT would be in a position to issue licences over the objections of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown says that he is concerned with the massive escalation in woodchip exports. This would increase the amount of woodchips exported from this country. That is what Senator Brown's motion of disallowance would do today. I find it particularly strange that Senator Brown should come in here, wring his hands and say how concerned he is about the environment. The facts are that Senator Brown's motion would have a deleterious effect on the management of the environment and Senator Brown's motion would undermine the environmental integrity of what we are trying to do because Senator Brown would have an open door to the woodchip export companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then came the most offensive remark of all. Senator Brown said that if honourable senators who had interests in woodchip export companies voted against this they would be voting to line their pockets. In fact, if one had an interest in a company that exported woodchips and one voted against this motion of disallowance one would be voting to prevent those companies having a wider right of appeal. Senator Brown has cast a despicable slur over the integrity of this Senate. That is what Senator Brown has done. But Senator Brown could not be bothered with the facts. He just could not be bothered. That is why I find it appalling that Senator Brown comes in here and lectures us on morality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the outrageous statements in Senator Brown's last speech really deserve to be repeated. He said that the woodchip industry was involved in the destruction of world heritage areas. He proceeded to talk about the Tarkine region. The Tarkine region is the Arthur&hyphen;Pieman region. It is the region, as Senator Calvert knows, between the Arthur River and the Pieman River. It is not a world heritage area. Of course Senator Brown might like it to be but it is not. That is just a little <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6929"> matter of fact, and fact has never been a big factor in the way Senator Brown makes political decisions. Nor is it a big factor in what he says to this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then Senator Brown says that there are hideous things happening in forests. The facts are that forest management practices are the responsibility of the state governments. Senator Brown could have played a part in forest management practices in Tasmania but Senator Brown decided to do a runner from the Tasmanian parliament and come to the Senate. So Senator Brown has abrogated his chance to play a role in responsible forest management by coming here and now he wants to do this stunt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I cannot understand is why Senator Brown has to be like Pavlov's dog every time it comes to an issue about the environment. You will recall that Pavlov trained a dog to salivate every time he rang a bell. All you have to do with Senator Brown is bring in woodchip export regulations and he starts salivating like Pavlov's dog in shirtsleeves and wants to move a motion of disallowance. This is just silly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown has already had one chop at these regulations and he was knocked back. So now he comes back for a second chop. When is the lunacy going to end? When is Senator Brown going to apologise to the Senate for all the things that he has said? Senator Brown has wilfully misled the Senate. He knows that he has wilfully misled the Senate, and I am quite disgusted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had other suggestions, such as those in his media release of 5 December 1996. It states, `The regulations have cut the public out from proper appeals.' If Senator Brown disallowed these regulations, it would do nothing to allow third party appeals. It would do absolutely nothing. The only way in which the public could appeal against the granting of a woodchip licence&mdash;and these are merely mechanisms to deal with the refusal to grant a woodchip licence&mdash;would be if they applied for a licence and were knocked back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Brown can indicate to the Senate any environmental group that has applied for a woodchip export licence and has been knocked back, then I will happily consider <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what he has to say. But I do not know many environmental groups who have made applications for woodchip export licences. What the regulations really deal with is curtailing the right of exporters to seek to appeal if they do not get their licence. So what Senator Brown is doing is making it easier to export woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there was the slur on the committee in Senator Brown's final paragraph of his press release of 5 December 1996. It states, `My move will force the matter to be debated properly rather than simply withdrawn after unspecified government assurances.' There were four pages of ministerial assurances provided to the committee. Senator Brown is obviously unaware, but most of the time the responses to this committee run to about one to 1&half; pages. This was one of the most detailed responses the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has had since March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown says in his press release `unspecified government assurances'. He almost but not quite goes so far as to suggest that there was some sort of improper influence applied to the committee. That is not the case. Honourable senators from both sides of the chamber are members of this committee. They look at the matters on a non-partisan basis. They felt that their concerns had been adequately answered. Senator Brown's response to that was, `The committee may have been satisfied but they don't satisfy me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown is now the self-appointed guardian of the conscience of the Senate. I hope that he is happy. Unfortunately, I do not think many environmental groups will be terribly happy with him when they realise what he is trying to do today, which is increase the avenues of appeal for woodchip export companies by disallowing these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe Senator Brown did not even bother to read the fine print or maybe this was just another exercise from Pavlov's dog. Whatever it is, I urge the Senate to maintain the environmental integrity of what the government is trying to do, not to increase the avenues open to woodchip export companies to appeal licences, not to destroy these regulations and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6930"> not to impugn the integrity of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all those reasons, Senator Brown's motion needs to be thrown out. Finally, I believe that Senator Brown ought to apologise to the Senate and the committee for the outrageous things that he has said.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that I think there is a sense of deja vu about this motion for disallowance. It was only a few weeks ago that the Senate debated a motion from Senator Brown to disallow the government's woodchip regulations. Back in October the opposition supported Senator Brown's motion, and we will support this motion today. We outlined our reasons for opposing the regulations in that earlier debate. We oppose these woodchip regulations because, firstly, they represent a major broken promise of the Howard government. Secondly, they seek to implement a seriously flawed and negligent forest policy. Thirdly, they are technically deficient in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns about the technical deficiencies of the regulations were later raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, which I understand through its chairman indicated a willingness to disallow the regulations. In fact, it was Senator O'Chee who wrote on behalf of the regulations and ordinances committee to Mr Anderson, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, outlining the committee's concerns. The letter outlining those concerns along with the minister's response were tabled in the Senate on 5 December.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer senators to my comments on Senator Brown's earlier disallowance motion. Because of my rather extensive contribution to that debate, today I will keep my comments to the technical flaws in those regulations. I will be brief, because I am conscious of the significant amount of work before the Senate in this last parliamentary sitting week for 1996. I hope others who are contributing to the debate can show similar discipline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to the committee has not allayed the opposition's concerns about the technical deficiency of these regulations. Even though it took the government three months to draft the regulations, they still simply could not get the regulations right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no definition of `degraded forest' and the environment minister is precluded from the process which will determine what constitutes a degraded forest. As the opposition has said before, we consider this to be a very serious flaw. Back in July when the policy was announced, the environment minister was to be consulted on what constituted a degraded forest. However, these regulations include no reference to the environment minister whatsoever. I think the environment minister's omission from the process really does illustrate the lack of balance in the Howard government on forest policy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no guarantee that forests which provide important habitats for native fauna will be protected. The regulations limit the classification criteria for `degraded forest' to the floristic composition of the forest. There is no acknowledgment in the regulations that a forest which could be judged degraded from a floristic point of view might be an important habitat for native fauna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's approval for unlimited woodchipping on privately owned land has significant biodiversity implications that the government is ignoring. The conversion of such forests to plantations, instead of regrowth forests, is a backward step in terms of biodiversity. Plantations are normally seen as additional to existing native forests, reducing pressure on them in forestry production terms, not physically replacing them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6931">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition voted against these regulations in October. The concerns originally raised by, I assume, Senator O'Chee in the Regulations and Ordinances Committee&mdash;that is not entirely clear to me, but I assume that that is the case&mdash;which were subsequently picked up by Senator Brown, further confirm that we made the right decision at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would say that this government's environmental record sinks to a new low each week. This week, of course, the government is seeking to open up important areas of forest reserves for mining and mineral exploration. I assume that the definition of what constitutes `an informal forest reserve' under the government's proposed new two&hyphen;tiered forest reserve system will be determined by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This development, along with the implementation of these woodchip regulations, represents a serious threat to Australia's native forests.

It is one that the previous government liked to see, and certainly this government obviously would now like to see, swept under the carpet somewhere and not raised and not discussed and debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not go through all I said on 14 October when we originally had an opportunity to vote against these regulations. But I simply will state  again very clearly, particularly for Senator O'Chee's benefit, that what we are looking at in this regulation is undoubtedly an escalation of the clear&hyphen;felling of woodchipping. In particular, I point to those parts of these new regulations that allow the movement now on to private land. I think, particularly for Tasmania, that will prove to be one of the nastiest aspects of these new regulations. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But today I would just declare a personal interest I have in these regulations. As a mother of two daughters, I believe that we should be preserving&mdash;indeed we have an obligation to preserve&mdash;these forests for future generations, the generations to come. We have an obligation as a developed nation, as a relatively well&hyphen;off country, to make sure that we do not continue the wholesale clearing of these unique forests. We have a responsibility to protect them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an obligation to future generations to stop wasting money propping up the industry in native forests. We have an obligation to actively encourage the move now to the plantation sector where this industry will be viable in the long term. We have an obligation to ensure that native birds, mammals, frogs, insects&mdash;all those animals that rely on these native forests&mdash;are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where, Senator O'Chee, do you suggest that the long&hyphen;footed potoroo, the powerful owl and many of those species, particularly those which are endangered in East Gippsland, go after their area of forest is clear&hyphen;felled? Some who obviously have never moved or walked around in these forests suggest that they simply move to another area of forest. I would suggest that those people take another look because already territory is well and truly marked out either by other species or other members of their own species in adjoining areas of forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at bird counts in particular, we see a steady decline in all areas where open&hyphen; and clear&hyphen;felling is allowed. Therefore I would state very clearly, yet again, that the Democrats will be opposing these regulations and supporting the motion to disallow them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I said in relation to Tasmanian forests&mdash;and Senator O'Chee was not listening; he got himself into a mess yet again because of his lack of attention to detail&mdash;was that forests of world heritage value in Tasmania are going to the woodchippers because of this government's activities and these regulations. Those forests of world heritage value are in the southern forests of Tasmania, south&hyphen;west of Hobart, in the Great Western Tiers, and in the Tarkine. They are not in world heritage areas, but experts who know what constitute world heritage values have pointed out that these forests would be given world heritage listing if they were nominated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not in the interests of the government opposite to recognise the world heritage value of Tasmania's rainforests&mdash;the eucalypts, the tallest flowering plants on the face of the planet, the vast array of wildlife, including marsupials, bird life, all nine species of bats in Tasmania, 15,000 to 30,000 species of insects, many of them as yet unidentified, whose stronghold is in those forests and who, without those forests, cannot continue to exist. These are the very forests which Senator O'Chee and his mob have targeted for roads, for clear&hyphen;fell logging, for fire bombing and then for 1080 poisoning in a process which destroys every living cell where these great untouched ecosystems currently exist. That is the process we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Chee comes in here and accuses me, quite wrongly, of wilfully misleading the Senate when he does not know what he is talking about. He should be ashamed of himself, and so should other members opposite, for putting their stamp of approval on the destruction of world heritage value forests in Tasmania which do not have the protection they should be getting but instead, under these regulations and through this government's policy, will be fed to the chippers in the coming months and years against the interests <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of every future generation of Australia, who will want that heritage as part of their life experience, as part of their variety of life and as part of their repository of inspiration, adventure and relaxation in an even more hurried, anxious and troubled world, devoid of more of its forests, devoid of more of its biodiversity, devoid of more of its naturalness as the years go by because of the actions of the woodchippers and the resource extractors who are currently plundering the planet at the greatest rate in history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, Senator O'Chee, I do not resile from bringing forward this disallowance motion. If he, as chair, has had reason through government correspondence to retract his disallowance motion, I am quite happy to take it over and to put it to the Senate to test once again whether there is not the commonsense and long&hyphen;sightedness in this place to make some sort of move, however small and however desperate, to protect our wild forests and to move this destructive woodchip industry across to the plantation base, which is, right now in 1996, already there and available to take its full cutting rates. We can have our forests and we can have our wood production too, but I suspect it is going to take a great deal more wisdom, sensitivity and commitment to future generations than we have heard from that contribution opposite before we get to that stage of enlightenment.</PARA>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(5.02 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before question time, when we were debating the sale of Telstra here in the committee stage, I was raising the issue of how the $250 million telecommunications infrastructure fund would be allocated between the states and the territories. I pointed out the ludicrous allocation based on a per capita arrangement. As I said before lunch, it is about $10,000 per capita for the 800-odd identified rural people in the ACT down to $16 per capita for people in rural New South Wales. I would certainly like to hear a justification for such an extraordinary inequity on the allocation per capita from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to hear from the minister in the committee stage how the lump sum figures for each of the states was arrived at. Although it is said that the money is allocated in each state for the non-metropolitan and non-capital area, that does not explain how, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6936"> for example, New South Wales gets 14 per cent and Queensland gets 21 per cent of the $250 million. Is that in some way related to the rural population? On that basis, it still seems a bit odd that the ACT could get $4 million for a percentage of its population, which is extremely minute in the non-capital and non-urban areas. I presume that in the ACT, all the known urban area, which is the Canberra urban area, is not included in the calculation. That is the first area of answers we would like from the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area relates to the $250 million, which, as I pointed out to the minister before question time, is spent over five years. In the same five-year period Telstra will spend $20 billion on capital works in Australia. Can the minister assure us that where the $250 million will be spent is not already in the Telstra business plan that he has had before him for at least a month or so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could the minister also provide information to the Senate in relation to how the $250 million will be spent once allocated to each state. Is the money going to be in the control of the Department of Communications, his own department, under ministerial direction or is it going to be provided to Telstra, and they will spend it and report to the parliament? Whichever way it is spent, will the parliament have an opportunity to review how the $250 million is spent over the next five years, particularly through the estimates procedures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the $250 million a year is provided to this fund and it is to go towards the developing of infrastructure in the regional area, will that money be paid to Telstra, as the predominant carrier in Australia, as a cash payment? If it is a cash payment, will that in any way affect the universal service obligation cross-subsidy that at the moment Telstra is paying at around $230 million a year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic that here we might have the beginning of the government starting to pay the universal service obligation of the carriers. Under the current legislation, the carriers pay the full universal service obligation according to a predetermined formula, according to the percentage of the market. There has been a great debate on this issue for several months <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now about the possible threat to universal service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Telstra does get most of the $50 million for infrastructure expenditure, will it be possible for it to deduct that from, or put it into the pot to pay for, the cross-subsidy. At the moment that is around $230 million, so in effect it is paying a cross-subsidy of only $180 million. I do not know whether this is true or not&mdash;I am speculating about this. Because the minister's statement as of last Thursday night is so unclear and imprecise, I think these are naturally reasonable questions the Australian public would want to ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also ask the minister: is there any consideration that some of the money will go to pay for a subsidy to reduce the cost of charges? The minister mentions in his statement the internet and the ISDN. He also mentions that some of these are issues for educational institutions. Does this mean that some of the money will be spent to subsidise the cost of those charges or is all the money going to be spent on providing telecommunications facilities in either hardware or software? If that is the case, can we in the Senate please get some indication today of what that equipment is, what that software is and how the money will be spent? Again there was no indication of that in the minister's 1&half;&hyphen;page statement last Thursday in which he announced the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, we would certainly like to know from the minister if he will personally administer the fund. Will Telstra administer it? Will the Department of Communications and the Arts administer it? That is an area where it is all very indistinct. It is very troubling that, at the very moment when the bill is being voted on, we still do not have those details for this proposal that the government has now been working on for nine or 10 months. Any other government proposal to spend $250 million in any other area of government activity announced in a very cavalier way like this was and with no detail would certainly be open to considerable criticism from the public about these arrangements. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6937">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, in relation to your statement about the special needs of Tasmania and Queensland that deals with the lobbying of Senator Colston and Senator Harradine to get their vote, will we get any details of the arrangements you have reached and will those details be tabled?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ALSTON" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Details of what?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Put simply, Minister: you put two statements out on Thursday night&mdash;one on the infrastructure fund itself and one on the special interests of Tasmania and Queensland, some of them dealing with infrastructure and some of them dealing with employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Colston in his speech during the second reading debate mentioned that he was still in negotiation with you regarding the employment arrangements. The statement deals with the employment of 40 extra people at a new operating centre at Toowoomba. If that is the only detail on the arrangement for Queensland, we would like to know how that is going to be announced and how it is going to be guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Has Senator Colston or Senator Harradine sought some sort of contractual arrangement to hold you and the government to the promises you have made about these jobs and about the funding? If you do not have some other arrangement which has not been yet announced in a contract, in legislation, in regulation or in a memorandum of understanding, I would be astonished that those two senators would provide their support on really a stab in the dark that this would come to fruition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once this legislation to sell a third of Telstra has passed, has been proclaimed and put into operation, how does Senator Harradine and Senator Colston hold you to what you promised them in your statement on Thursday night? If you or Telstra moves away from it, what remedy do they have to enforce the promise you made in this rather tawdry deal? If there is some arrangement, then surely the Australian parliament has the right to know what that deal is, how it is going to be enforced and what sort of contractual arrangement it is because this is public money that you are handing out of a rather large war <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chest to get the support of these two senators to sell one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I put those questions to the minister. I hope he can respond in some detail during the committee stage of this debate on the partial sale of Telstra. Those questions related to the infrastructure fund, but now I want to turn to the promise of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister said in his statement that the National Call Connect Centre in Hobart would be established and the operator assisted centre in Burnie would be expanded. He said that, in total, that would create 140 new jobs in the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000. Can you assure the Senate and the Australian people that those 140 jobs are not being transferred from some other already existing Telstra centre, particularly in a regional area, to Tasmania?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, is it not true that you had already had to admit to the chamber that you had misled it? You are already getting rid of 126 jobs in Tasmania. Therefore, all up, you are creating 14 jobs. A 14&hyphen;job increase for Tasmania is the best way you can look at this at the moment. I have to say to Senator Harradine: I do not think that is a particularly generous outcome for you. At the moment all you have are 14 extra jobs for Tasmania when you take away the 126 that the minister had to admit to the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we want to know is: were these jobs transferred from another state, not just Tasmania? Some other regional area may be suffering to pay-off Senator Harradine. Again, in Toowoomba in Queensland, I think there were 45 jobs for the second National Directory Assistance Call Connect Service Centre. The title is a bit of a mouthful, but that centre is to go to Toowoomba with 45 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I remember correctly, Minister, Senator Colston was particularly concerned about jobs in Roma. Were any of the jobs in Roma transferred to Toowoomba&mdash;or from anywhere else, particularly elsewhere in regional Queensland&mdash;to allow for these 45 jobs? How long will these jobs last under the arrangement? Are they there forever and a day? Once Telstra is sold and the management comes in, once you lose the power to direct the Telstra board, do these jobs just go and then you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6938"> wash your hands and say, `Sorry, Senator Colston, sorry, Senator Harradine. I can't direct the board. The whole world has changed in the operation of Telstra. The deal is all off. I can't do anything about it'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not if it removes the power to direct. It is all over red rover. The minority shareholders will probably insist it is all over red rover to improve their profit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second lot of 15 minutes is now nearly up. I have put a lot of specific questions to the minister. Subject to some of those answers, I have several more questions to ask. This is unfortunate. I do not want to waste the chamber's time, but the statement that was issued on Thursday night, trying to give some detail of the arrangements that the government entered into with Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, is totally unsatisfactory. It is not in any way transparent for the Australian people to see whether this deal is worth anything or whether the government is actually taking Senator Colston and Senator Harradine to the cleaners to get their vote for the second reading of this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WH4">Senator McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take up that interjection, because that is what we have been accused of. The previous speaker, Senator Schacht, who is normally quite fluent, has had two goes at trying to present a case. After speaking for fifteen minutes on both occasions, he just kept going around in circles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So now you are into the filibuster stage. Just admit that that is all you are doing here in this parliament. You are filibustering, and you do that very well. As far as constructive argument is concerned, you have not brought it to the chamber. Every speaker, from Senator Ray to Senator Schacht, has absolutely&mdash;incredible as it may seem&mdash;begrudged any help in maintaining the standards of the rural <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and regional parts of Australia. You have utterly begrudged the attempt to maintain the standards and to strengthen the universal service obligation. Instead, all you have done is dub this as a sleazy backroom deal when, in fact, it is nothing of the sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very false argument that you happen to have built up to sell the proposition that the regional areas were ever on a par with the city regions. The regional areas were never, and have never been, on a par with the city areas. In fact, during the last 13 years, when you were in government, they were on a sliding scale to the regional areas&mdash;and this is not just in the area of communications. Senator Ray talked about the poor old people, I believe, of Clayton in Melbourne&mdash;along with other speakers&mdash;equating the services in Melbourne and Sydney with those in rural and regional areas. It is a joke. It is a false argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rural and regional people are far from advantaged when it comes to comparisons with metropolitan areas&mdash;not just in the area of communications but in every way. For example, look at the prices they have to pay for petrol and simple shopping requirements. They do not have the types of shops and access to the larger shopping centres that those in the city have. Look at the prices of water. Look at television and communications in every sense of the word&mdash;mobile phones and faxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not come in here and try to equate the services of the rural and regional areas with those in Melbourne and Sydney, particularly over the decline of those services over the last 13 years. It really is an indication of just how hard it is&mdash;and it has been over the past 13 years&mdash;for the rural and regional areas to get on the agenda of the opposition. When they were in government, they certainly forgot about these particular areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There was nothing more evident of that than quite an infamous and notorious article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> by a former senator of yours&mdash;Senator Richardson. This needs to be said. Honesty has overwhelmed him now he has to write a weekly article. Nevertheless, he said that, when in cabinet, cabinet knew only too well that they were only ever going to get, at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6939"> best, one per cent of the vote from the rural areas by the farmers. So cabinet summarily dismissed any genuine concerns that the rural and regional areas had when presenting their concerns to the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that only too well because we had a four&hyphen;year drought&mdash;the worst drought this country has ever had. A major metropolitan TV station aired the disaster of that drought. It came to the stage where farmers were eating off the generosity of charities. It took all of this to happen before Paul Keating, the former Prime Minister, and his cabinet came to the aid of the farmers. Didn't the former Prime Minister say this? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I notice the National Party running around saying I should be standing in a paddock in some drought affected area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought is around now in Australia all the time so we have said let's try and cover this as a normal recurrence of rural life.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>That is how he dubbed the worst drought in this country. It was only a month or two later that his own minders got him out into those paddocks. It was just as the National Party requested that he have a look at the drought first hand. That is when the cabinet finally turned around. They only turned around when Melbourne and Sydney started to respond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make that point because the opposition has no credibility when it comes to speaking for or protecting the rural and regional areas. It takes others in this chamber to do that, particularly as far as Tasmania is concerned. Tasmania is a predominantly rural area. It has faced the downturns in commodity prices equally as much as the mainland has. Tasmania has had political decisions go against it; decisions that could have greatly enhanced its rural and regional areas. The Wesley Vale pulp mill, for example, would have been tremendous for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for my state of Victoria, we welcome the final draft of the legislation. We welcome the benefits that will come directly to Victoria through the National Heritage Trust for the areas in the Murray&hyphen;Darling project. There is $163 million there, Senator Sherry. Victoria will be the greatest beneficiary of that. The national vegetation initiative and the coasts <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and clean seas initiative are both $100 million projects which would never get off the ground unless we have the benefits of the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra. Victoria will benefit from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as Victoria welcomes the final draft of the legislation before the Senate, the National Party welcomes the improvements foreshadowed by Senator Alston. Clearly, the National Party is unashamed and unabashed. It is a sectional party. We represent the rural and regional areas. That has been our mission statement for some 76 years now. We are the second oldest party in the parliament. We have that mission statement and we have stuck to it in that 76 years, so why wouldn't we utterly support the final draft of the Telstra one&hyphen;third sale?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been utterly impossible to reconcile the rhetoric of the speakers from the opposition side against their actions. When the opposition was in government, weren't they the ones who sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas? More so the Commonwealth Bank: they made commitments that they would not sell it, and they did. Where were the great defenders of the Commonwealth Bank from the socialist left faction when the Commonwealth Bank was put up for sale? I do not think one of them came into this chamber and made a speech on the final sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The difference between your privatisation&mdash;which we supported&mdash;and ours is that there is a strategy with our privatisation. We are not going to waste the billions of dollars like you did. Where did the money for the Commonwealth Bank go? Up in smoke in deficit and debt. Our strategy is to use the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra to reduce debt and to establish the National Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there are the attacks upon the two Independent senators&mdash;not that they can't look after themselves. They have been in this chamber for a very long time&mdash;both of them for over 20 years. The accusations of sleazy deals is emotive rubbish which is unbecoming of the reputation the senators have. Quite frankly, the discussions have been transparent. They have been open&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have been, Senator. They are utterly transparent so that the Australian public can see them and judge them. The government has accepted the moves that were put forward. `Slush fund' was another emotive term used in this debate. Nothing could be more false when you consider that, when the opposition were in government, they were the masters of the slush fund. The most infamous of them all, of course, was the sports rorts incident. It will go down in political folklore in this parliament. When we are long gone the sports rorts incident and the whiteboard incident will stay as examples of the greatest slush funds of all. There are others. There was the better cities program&mdash;hundreds of millions of dollars, a lot of which ended up on Lower Plenty Road in Melbourne. That road just happened to be in the electorate of the former Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, the man who oversaw the better cities program. Lower Plenty Road is now a much&hyphen;improved road. There was something very sectional about the divvying up of the better cities program.</PARA></TALK.START>

I see that, from time to time, when you sit in front of him. He can't see the look on your face half the time. Sooner or later you are going to have to shake him off. You missed the perfect opportunity. When Christabel Chamarette was here she would never have allowed this opportunity to slip by. But, because you have been caught up in Senator Brown's net&mdash;it is almost Senator Brown's dominance of your faction&mdash;you have allowed the most perfect opportunity to slip by you. You can't continue for the rest of your term&mdash;your last and final term, it seems&mdash;to be hell&hyphen;bent on just running a political agenda. Sooner or later you are going to have to vote on the environment agenda. You lost a perfect opportunity here because you listened to Senator Brown, who has delivered nothing for the Tasmanian environment. You missed a perfect opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make some final points as far as the government strategy for the one&hyphen;third sale <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Telstra is concerned. It is part of a strategy. It is linked with a balanced budget. It is linked with the privatisation. It is linked with the national Heritage Trust. All of it benefits the rural and regional areas. Nothing seared the soul of the rural area more than the damage done by the previous government during the eighties and nineties in regard to high interest rates. You absolutely bashed the living daylights out of the rural and regional areas through your high interest rates program. The one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra, linked with a balanced budget, will have a downward pressure on debt and deficit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not spoken in the Telstra debate to date, so I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring to the debate what I believe are some thoughtful comments. I earnestly hope Senator Harradine will take notice of them. I know the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) will not take notice, and Senator Colston will take some notice. There are some aspects of both the national deal that the Liberal and National parties presented to the electorate and the more recent deal that Senator Harradine and Senator Colston have entered into that I want to draw to their attention and highlight to the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I do that, I want to touch on a couple of matters that Senator McGauran, on behalf of the National Party of Australia, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6941"> raised. He maintains that the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, with $1.1 billion, is great for the Australian environment. Senator McGauran, I hope you are listening. You said that $163 million out of this $1.1 billion would be committed to the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. I hope that Senator Alston can confirm whether or not that is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran, you said that the clean&hyphen;up of the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin would never get off the ground. I would like to draw your attention to Budget Paper No. 1, page 3&hyphen;142, which gives the primary industry forward estimates. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Murray-Darling Basin Initiative&mdash;cessation of additional funding to improve natural resource management</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McGauran, in the last Labor budget&mdash;obviously in your National Party hype you are not aware of what occurred&mdash;the Labor government committed some $98 million to the cleaning up, in part at least, of the Murray-Darling Basin. This is but one area where we see quite significant reductions in expenditure for the environment to be offset through the partial sale of Telstra and the establishment of this National Heritage Trust Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator McGauran, when you said that funding for the Murray-Darling clean&hyphen;up would never get off the ground, it was already off the ground. It is your government, in your Budget Paper No. 1, that will cut $98 million out of that program over the next four years. You can smile. It is the old pea and thimble trick: you take the money out of one area and switch it over into the other area. I would suggest that next time you read the budget papers a bit more closely. What we have here is a con.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the aspects I want to comment on is how the government has redefined recurrent expenditure as capital expenditure in the guise&mdash;it is really only an excuse or a dressing up&mdash;of selling one-third of Telstra. Before I get on to that, I refer to the contributions of Senator McGauran and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Senator Boswell), who is without a ministerial portfolio&mdash;we know why that is. Look at the contributions <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you have made to an analysis of why Telstra is being sold and what the benefits are. You talked for some time about drought. That is an important issue, but it really has nothing&mdash;very little&mdash;to do with the sale of Telstra. You talked about a range of other issues, like the poor provision of services in rural and regional areas and about petrol, shopping, water and TV. But that just highlights the reason why we are 100 per cent committed to 100 per cent Telstra ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is one of the few commercial operations in this country which has delivered, in a very effective way, a very decent level of telecommunications service to all over Australia. Telstra has delivered a telecommunications service to the outback, to rural and regional Australians, to almost everyone in this country who has wanted an effective and efficient telecommunications system. Here you are supporting the one-third sale of Telstra&mdash;inevitably it will be all of Telstra&mdash;and you are arguing that it has not delivered an effective service to those areas. It has.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston, if we consider the enormous size of Australia&mdash;it is the same size as continental Europe and the US, excluding Alaska, and we have a much smaller population with a much lower urban density&mdash;generally, Telstra's efforts at delivering an efficient, modern telecommunications system at a reasonable cost to the vast majority of people in this country, particularly those in rural and regional areas, is second to none in the world. Yet here you are advocating a position where over time that effective, cost efficient delivery of telecommunications throughout the entire continental Australia will be eroded. Senator McGauran, that is the position you are supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran said he would speak ever so briefly. He did speak ever so briefly about the sale of Telstra. I note with some embarrassment that the National Party Whip had to try to wind him up twice, either because the content was so poor or because your own Whip is getting concerned about the time you have been wasting in contributing very little to this Telstra debate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6942">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very sad reflection of the modern&hyphen;day National Party when you and Senator Boswell, in your contributions to this debate, are nothing more than a doormat. It is follow&hyphen;the&hyphen;leader. You are the real tail, but you are not the tail wagging the coalition any more. You are the real doormat in policy terms of this government. You really are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran, you have had no major wins and no major, great new policy initiatives on behalf of the National Party, and you are devoid of any influence in this government. If that is the best you can do, if you cannot maintain any more relevance that you displayed today, then you will not be the second oldest political party in this country but you will certainly be the party that will disappear very quickly over the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to deal with the issue of the broader package. Up to the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) following his holiday, when he hit upon this magic repackaging of using part of the proceeds from the one-third sale of Telstra, it was very clearly Liberal-National parties' policy to use all income from the asset sale to reduce debt. That was your policy very clearly up to that point in time. As shadow finance minister, I would have to say that that is a policy perspective I agree with. So long as I have any input into that, I will maintain that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, Senator Alston, you redefine capital expenditure in recurrent expenditure terms by devoting just over $1 billion in recurrent expenditure. In the budget&mdash;I have already highlighted one area&mdash;we had allocated $98 million of recurrent expenditure off the budget in the primary industry portfolio, which you have cut. You have cut recurrent expenditure, yet you make it up by selling capital and calling it an investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you can get away with that, you can get away with selling anything, any part of Telstra, and redefining it as capital expenditure. You could come up with $1 billion worth of road funding on this principle and say that it is an investment. You could even fund the dental health program on the basis that money from the sale of Telstra is capital investment in people's teeth! If you follow that logic through, you can sell any capital <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> asset and redefine it as an investment, decrease recurrent expenditure and offset that in part or in whole, which is exactly what you have done here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is wrong in principle. It is particularly wrong in principle when it is little more than a bribe to the environment movement in the context of the package that was announced at the election: sell one-third of Telstra and take $1.1 billion over four years in order to try and minimise the opposition of environmental groups at the last election. That is the national package. I will come very shortly to the bribe at the regional level in respect of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, who, regrettably, is not here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other point I make in relation to the danger of using what is effectively money from an asset sale for recurrent expenditure is: what happens in four years? Senator McGauran, even on your figures of $163 million, what is to happen in four years? I understand that the Murray-Darling basin will need billions of dollars to repair the environmental damage there. Where is the money going to come from in four years time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran, I would suggest to you and to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston that when the Prime Minister said in relation to the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, `We will consider our position much further down the track,' that time will be in about four years. When the current government says that it will not increase taxes&mdash;it has in a number of areas, but that is another argument for another day&mdash;when it comes to the election in three or four years time, it will have to look around and find other areas of money and it will sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra and redefine that in terms of redirecting the money into some sort of capital expenditure, whether it be highways, dental health or any number of other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw to the attention of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston to page 3142 of the forward estimates. The Murray-Darling basin was not the only area of environmental expenditure that was cut. That was cut by $98 million. There was a cessation of the national landcare program&mdash;$201 million taken out of the forward estimates.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we have here, Senator Harradine, is the creation of 170 new jobs and, at the same time, the loss, I understand, of 160 to 180 jobs over the next two years. I put it to you that at least some or perhaps all of these jobs were probably in Telstra's forward plan for the next three years anyway. So what is the net gain?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would make, Senator Harradine, if we look down this list of the alleged bonanza&mdash;a $10 million tree planting program, $10 million on revegetation and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fencing, $6 million on threatened species program, $5 million on land for a wildlife integration scheme, $5 million for the heritage track upgrade&mdash;is that all of those areas of expenditure were in the forward estimates anyway under Labor, at least in part if not in whole. Some $450 million worth of expenditure on the areas, Senator Harradine, that you argued for were already commitments of a Labor government four years ahead of time.</PARA>

She was never ever hoodwinked in that way. The reality is that the bill was never about the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has indicated, and Senator Kernot and I made this statement very early in the piece, that this never was a big spending package. The indications were that the rug was being pulled out from under the environment even faster than you were putting up this false front of care and concern. In fact, what is happening is a shifting of resources from the environment portfolio, some of which are going to the primary industry portfolio and out of the control of the environment portfolio. The whole thing has been a ruse from beginning to end, but a vast number of people were aware of this all along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I resent any indication that I need to take directions from any other senator in relation to the way I place my vote. I certainly made my own mind up in relation to whether or not this bill stinks. I believe, quite frankly, that this bill stinks. Therefore, whether or not there are concerns about the link to the environment package&mdash;and I mentioned that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6944"> right from the beginning&mdash;it was my own decision. I resent being patronised in that I have to take somebody else's direction to work out what is the right and wrong thing to do about the sale of an asset like Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McGauran said&mdash;and I thank Senator McGauran for giving me these extra points; I am sure the government really does want to speed along the debate on this bill but that is not going to happen when you have Senator McGauran winding people up in this way, but I am happy to oblige&mdash;that I should vote for environment not politics. What a load of hypocrisy! If anything has been a political ploy, an ideological ploy, a cynical ploy in this place it has been the link between the sale of Telstra and this shoddy package, this shoddy connection that we have seen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want to talk environment, let us talk environment. Let us talk about each of the issues of concern in terms of ecological sustainability in Australia. Let us see where the coalition has stood and see where the Greens have stood and then judge people on their performance and what they should be doing for the environment. What the coalition has been doing is cutting programs and divesting themselves as fast as they can of their responsibilities on the environment. In the end the community knows that this is happening because they can see it. They can see it in their own sphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian government is making every opportunity count. When responsibility is divested from the federal government they take every opportunity to put planning and corporate concerns ahead of the environment. In the end what it means is that nobody ends up with the ability to look after the environment. You have federal government pulling money off the states. You have federal government divesting itself of responsibility and pulling money out of the states or not giving any extra resources so the states can take that up even if they wanted to and, in the case of Western Australia, they do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do need in the end to be looking at these responsibilities&mdash;and I have mentioned this on several occasions&mdash;in terms of a full community debate about having a constitution which makes ecological sustainability the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> right of every citizen of Australia, so you do not have this handballing of environmental responsibility from one level of government to the other.

I listened to Senator Harradine this morning as he tried to justify the fact that he has not done a deal. There is no other way to describe what Senator Harradine has done. He has done a deal. The more he protests, the sillier and the less convincing it sounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine says, `I had to take mandate into account. I had to take into account a mandate of what the people of Australia said in my deliberations.' I understand that you might have taken a lot of things into account, Senator Harradine, but what part of what mandate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, the government went to the people promising, in an area in which I have a particular interest, that they would not in any way remove the operational subsidy in child care, that they would not in any way cut back public child care, that they would not reduce child care assistance, and that they would not means test the child care cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every single one of those promises they broke almost immediately. Where is the mandate in that argument, Senator Harradine? Why were you not assisting the opposition in holding the government to what it promised to do? What is different about the mandate in Telstra from the mandate in other areas of government policy? I would like to hear your words on that, because I find that your argument that `I have a mandate; therefore, I have not done a deal' is totally unconvincing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6945">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht has just explained, I think very persuasively, that the deal Senator Harradine has done is for about 14 jobs in Tasmania. It might be 30, it might be 16, or it might be 15. As for the infrastructure, Telstra was already going to spend that money. So it is a very small deal that you have done. I would like to ask what else is part of your deal. Is it part of further reductions to the family planning funding that this country spends? Is it your view on IVF, which you so curiously publicise at exactly the same time as the Telstra deal goes through?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people in Australia are very concerned. Thousands of us are very concerned about what it is that you are negotiating with this government and how much of it is related to your done deal in Telstra. You would not really want to do a deal for just a few jobs, would you, Senator Harradine? I will come back to the issue of family planning in a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine says that he is very concerned about jobs in Tasmania. What is the difference between a Telstra job and a child&hyphen;care job? Why do you seem to have no regard at all for the way this government is cutting back its funding to child care and dramatically reducing the number of people employed in it? Or is it that there are women working and you would prefer to see them at home?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why are you prepared to support 14 miserly jobs in Telstra as part of a done deal but you are not prepared to stand up and support jobs in the child&hyphen;care industry, for example? Do you not know about them, or do you not think they are as real or as important as Telstra jobs? Or is it that some other package of agreement between you and the government does not come if you defend child care but it does come if you defend Telstra? Perhaps that gives the government more to manipulate with, more promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find your argument very unpersuasive. It is a deal. There is no other word for it. Some people might want to say that it is a sleazy deal. I think it is a pretty unattractive deal. But there is no doubt that it is a done deal. Your arguments in putting your case today are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> totally unconvincing. If you go the mandate argument, then there is a very good case to ask, `Why this bit of the mandate and not any other bits?' Why are you not holding this government up to honour its promise to continue and totally protect its commitment to public child care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why, when you so often speak about the importance of family, do you not support the maintenance of that tier of child care which has done so much to establish adequate and important quality standards for child care? If those are not important issues for you, then it is a very hollow argument that you make about mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to hear you explain what it is about a Telstra job that matters as compared to a child&hyphen;care job that seemingly does not matter. It cannot be that it is associated with a very big contribution by the government, can it? Or is it that it is part of a broader package and that you do not want them associated? In the minds of lots of people, they are associated. You write letters to this government, which you leak or have publicised, about your preference to see family planning funding, a contribution under the aid budget, reduced&mdash;and so it has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just returned from a visit to New York, where I was able to have a number of appointments in the United Nations, including with the United Nations family planning authority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot be persuaded by Senator Harradine's arguments in this place today. I listened to them very closely. What were his arguments to justify why, having opposed the sale of Telstra, having been a speaker in favour of public sector involvement, he would now change his mind? `I have to consider the mandate,' he says, but apparently not the mandate that the voters voted for when it came to this government's commitment to maintain all their promises in child care. They went out the window, and they seemingly did not trouble Senator Harradine one iota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government lied to the people of Australia about what it intended to do in child care. I have letters from the then shadow minister, Mr Kemp, dated 28 February, getting pretty close to election day, promising in writing to not attack or do anything to the operational subsidy and to do nothing to reduce their commitment to public sector child care. They immediately reneged on both of those promises. So what is the mandate? Only a selective mandate, I would say, and I say that to Senator Harradine. I have to also say that it is not persuasive in his arguments to me. I am very concerned that Senator Harradine's deal on Telstra is part of a broader package. It is part of a package that has seen a reduction in funding to international family planning by this government by one-third of its aid budget. That is a matter of great concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are looking at the economic development of countries, if you are looking at what is proven already to be the best advantage of those countries, then it is providing opportunities for the women as well as the men in those countries. You cannot talk about advantaging families if you do not talk about advantaging women. That is exactly the same as what the Labor policies were in terms of child care, education, training and family <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support&mdash;all its policies for families also took account of the importance of assisting women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, that is true of our commitment through the aid budget to assist women through development programs, through contraceptive advice and through provision of services to assist women in Third World countries to make those choices. Senator Harradine has actually persuaded this government to dramatically reduce its funding and to deny women those choices. Was that a mandate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did this Howard government go to the people of Australia saying, `We intend to cut funding to family planning.' Did they intend to rearrange the provision of in-vitro fertilisation programs or any of those things that Senator Harradine now puts out into the public airways as part of the Telstra deal&mdash;part of this sordid little exercise that Senator Harradine has brought into this place? That is what it has to be: a done deal, because Senator Harradine is not persuasive. His arguments are not convincing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You should be distressed and uncomfortable, Senator Harradine. After having tried to take the high moral ground over the years in this place, you have just brought your own reputation significantly into question. Senator, the blood of the women of the world who might have to seek abortion instead of contraception will be on your hands in relation to Tasmanian telephones. That is how it will be. As part of the deal with the government, you will be responsible for that revolting choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot possibly justify this deal with the argument that you have put in this place. It is a deal much broader than the Telstra deal. We know that from what has been spelt out by opposition speakers on this bill and by a clear analysis of what Senator Alston announced by way of the final arrangements. With a grin on his face, he stated, `We've fixed it, we've stitched it up, we've got the deal done&mdash;$350 million is all it took to buy the votes we needed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, I do not know what feedback you got over the weekend; perhaps you speak to people who are pleased about deals like that. But everywhere I went on the weekend&mdash;from the fruit and vegetable shop to the butcher, to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6947"> Coles, to the supermarkets&mdash;everybody I met, very ordinary Australians, were at pains to tell me that they thought this was a done deal, a bribe, a buy&hyphen;off or a payback, whichever: $350 million to get the votes of two Independents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, the high moral ground that you might have established in the past is gone for all time. Senator Harradine, if you are going to argue mandate, argue it with consistency. You have not done that. You are not voting with consistency. I am not persuaded by what you say. I am extremely disheartened and disappointed that you should stoop to this public betrayal of your own principles.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  today there is a simple paragraph in an article by George Megalogenis, which says, `Under the deal which is skewed towards Tasmania and Queensland'.

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA>Another article was headed, `Dial D for deal done'. Senator Harradine does not like to hear this allegation of a deal, but nothing he has said has been able to convince most of us listening that it was anything but that. The <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6948"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>  `Candid Comment', by Peter Robinson, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Howard deals in pragmatism and not principle. He worked out a deal with the two independent senators, Tasmania's Brian Harradine and Queensland's Mal Colston, which will ensure their States get special benefits from the $10 billion or so which the Telstra sale will bring in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Somewhat lost in all of this is the little matter of national benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what a deal is. A deal is when you make some special arrangement to advantage a few people in Australia at the expense of the rest of Australians, and in this case Australian workers. I really hope Senator Harradine, whatever he is doing, can listen to some of these comments, not because I think they are brilliant but because I would really like him to answer some of the comments being made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beyond what is now publicised, I have not lost sight of the fact that when we were all asked to vote on this matter on Thursday we knew practically nothing. We knew nothing about the terms of reference for the committee. We were told, `Oh, but have faith. I'm going to delay the proclamation date of this bill.' We knew very little until Senator Alston's second reading speech, but even at the end of that we knew a great deal less than what we found out in the press release late on Thursday night, well after we had voted in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not call that a transparent deal or arrangement, which was what Senator McGauran was referring to. In relation to however many pages were in the document that was published in the arrangement between the Democrats and the government on the industrial relations bill, everything was up front before the debate began and every detail of the change was tracked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When is an unspoken deal a deal? When is influence or things hanging around in the ether part of a current deal or a future deal? Senator Harradine expressed some surprise when Senator Crowley raised the issue of family planning and linked it to Telstra. I think the reason she did that is the article from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> by Paul Daley, which certainly came to my attention. It says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Independent Senator Brian Harradine, who last week indicated crucial support for the Federal Government's bill to sell one-third of Telstra, has made a new bid for restrictions on IVF technology.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the next part that I think is interesting in terms of answering the question of whether or not deals have to be overt and clearly linked with the issue in question. The second paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Sunday Age' has established that, in the lead-up to the Senate's vote on Telstra last Thursday, Senator Harradine met or otherwise lobbied at least three senior ministers&mdash;the Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams, the Science Minister, Mr Peter McGauran, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer&mdash;about challenging the legal status of patients on key IVF technology.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well&hyphen;placed Government figures told `The Sunday Age' that Senator Harradine's concerns were being treated seriously from the office of the Prime Minister down. They said he could expect to get concessions on tighter rules for couples entering the IVF program, and on the patenting issue.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like Senator Harradine to tell us whether or not it was just a total coincidence that this was raised last week in the final stages of negotiations on the Telstra sale bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a Herald AGB poll conducted last weekend nearly two-thirds of voters said they opposed the sale of any part of Telstra.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was 31 January 1996. The point I want to make by reading out more polls is that they did not change significantly throughout the entire election campaign. The government can bleat all it likes about mandate. On this particular issue they are wrong, and that is why they have not rushed into a double dissolution on the sale of Telstra. They know how the Australian public <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> feel about the privatisation of Telstra, of one-third or the lot of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second poll I want to quote is a Newspoll conducted on 14 February, two weeks later. A newspoll survey conducted for the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian</EMPHASIS> found 39 per cent in favour of the policy of linking the $1 billion environment program to the sale of a third of Telstra, 48 per cent against and the remainder undecided. On 20 February, deep in the heart of the election campaign, a Morgan poll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An overwhelming majority of electors in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>  Morgan survey decided that, when asked if the Senate should have the right to prevent the coalition from selling part of Telstra, 64 per cent agreed and 29 per cent did not.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: 64 per cent. That is a figure which held firm throughout the campaign. It was not something the government liked. I recall headline after headline talking about how this was the big dud in an otherwise successful election campaign. This was the big dud. The article about the poll of 20 February goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Howard cannot even claim support for the sale amongst coalition voters. Fifty per cent of coalition voters believe the sale should be blocked, while 44 per cent believe the Senate does not have the right to stop it.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition is facing an uphill battle with the community even to get the proposal to the Senate at all. Sixty per cent of electors do not want Telstra sold, while 33 per cent of people believe it should be.</PARA>
<PARA>On 26 February, not long before election day, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  stated in relation to another AGB McNair poll:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition's plan to sell a third of Telstra and to use some of the proceeds to fund a $1.1 billion environment package has lost support during the election campaign&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>If this was just one of the little details, the fine print, of the 55 policies released in 35 days, we might be able to say that there is a mandate in there somewhere. But it was not an obscure detail. It was measured. It was <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6950"> debated passionately, and the government did not win its case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this debate on the partial sale of Telstra more in sorrow than in anger. I must admit that last week I was pretty angry and a number of people on this side of the chamber were extremely angry about it. One of the major things the Tasmanian non-government senators had been arguing was Tasmania's special case. I say to Senator Harradine with respect that I do not believe this is a good deal for Tasmania. I genuinely mean that: I do not think it is a good deal for Tasmania. I appreciate the difficulties that Senator Harradine found himself in, but in the long term I do not think he will get many accolades from Tasmanians in relation to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot and others have adequately covered the issue of mandate. Certainly in relation to the campaign that the Labor Party ran for the election of Tasmanian senators, our opposition to the partial sale of Telstra was made very clear. Senator Bob Brown's campaign was similarly clear. Senator Harradine was not up for election this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been previously indicated, the job gains in Tasmania that appear to have been made in relation to this deal, arrangement or whatever people wish to call it&mdash;I think `deal' is still the most appropriate word&mdash;are largely ephemeral. That is the reality. Telstra has already confirmed eight per cent job cuts in Tasmania; that is, 116 job losses in Tasmania so far. With the deal came the announcement of the creation of 140 jobs&mdash;clearly a net gain of approximately 24 jobs&mdash;by the year 2000. What happens after the year 2000 is anybody's guess.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> As every Tasmanian senator would have read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, the CPSU has already predicted approximately 500 job losses. The CEPU in Tasmania has predicted a similar figure. So I do not believe it is a good deal job&hyphen;wise for Tasmania, which has an ailing economy that requires remedial action, genu ine planning, a genuine industry plan and, above all, a viable communications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can these jobs be guaranteed? I do not think we can get away from the fact that when the one-third sale of Telstra goes through&mdash;and we have had indications from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that within five years we will have the full sale of Telstra&mdash;there will be no guarantee that in the long term those jobs will remain. As has been alluded to by previous speakers, under the Corporations Law majority shareholders cannot make decisions that will disadvantage minority shareholders. If minority shareholders do not agree to jobs in Tasmania because it is not economically viable or the underpinning infrastructure is too difficult, then those jobs simply would not happen. They would be located somewhere else. So we cannot guarantee for the long term, or even for the short term, those jobs in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than the jobs aspect, there are several very fundamental questions that I want to talk about in relation to my home state and they go to the issues which have been raised consistently by Tasmanian senators. The first one that I want to talk about is cross&hyphen;subsidisation. The amount of money that Tasmania gets because it is the most ruralised state in Australia is approximately $9 million per annum. The cross&hyphen;subsidy actually assists people. I could go through all the figures but I will not. For example, most people in Launceston get a subsidy of approximately $730. There are subsidies in most places in Tasmania.

The cross&hyphen;subsidy in Burnie is $850; Devonport, $600; Flinders Island, $4,930; King Island, $2,220; St Marys, $910; Queenstown, $1,250, and so on. There is no guarantee in this legislation that that cross&hyphen;subsidy will remain. There's not!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words used in the legislation under the universal service obligation are `as efficiently and economically as practicable in terms of the application of the USO, in relation to that cross&hyphen;subsidy.' As the minister has said, and as the Prime Minister has clearly stated, what we are looking at now is not a one&hyphen;third privatisation of Telstra. We are looking at a three&hyphen;thirds privatisation of Telstra. If you can do something to strengthen the USO in terms of the cross&hyphen;subsidy that applies to Tasmania, I think it will make it a lot clearer to everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in the long term that areas like Tasmania, which are largely unprofitable for privatised telcos, will not get those sorts of services. The subsidies will not remain and we will leave ourselves open to the vagaries of the market. That is what will happen.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the mandate, I agree entirely with Senator Kernot.

What we have instead is 160 job losses at the University of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another debate which I think Senator Crowley referred to earlier, which is coming up this week, which has a deleterious effect on the Tasmanian economy and families in Tasmania and that is the one in relation to child care and the subsidy in relation to community based child&hyphen;care centres. I genuinely hope that Senator Harradine supports us in relation to this because it is going to have an enormous effect on family lives and working&hyphen;class Tasmanians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To move on: the bottom line is that the reason that none of these things can be guaranteed in the long term is the lack of ministerial control in relation to the privatised telco, which has been talked about a lot. There is no ministerial direction, so the profit bottom line, and this casts no aspersions on anybody, is for the shareholders&mdash;and I have already talked about the provisions in relation to Corporations Law and minority shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sum up, my contribution is more in sorrow than in anger. I do not think you needed a crystal ball to predict&mdash;certainly, Senator Alston let the cat out of the bag several months ago&mdash;the inexorable movement from the sale of one&hyphen;third to the sale of three&hyphen;thirds of Telstra and the effect that is going to have in Tasmania. I do appreciate <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6952"> the pressures that Senator Harradine was under in relation to negotiations with regard to our home state. But I think in the long run the only way to guarantee the technological innovations that we have talked about&mdash;the cross&hyphen;subsidies, the retention of untimed telephone calls and a genuine state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art communications infrastructure in an island state which is desperately in need of that communications infrastructure&mdash;was to keep Telstra in public hands. That is the only way that that could have been guaranteed. The jobs issue, whilst it is not a bad try, is ultimately ephemeral and, in terms of social justice initiatives and the needs of the state of Tasmania, in the long term it is a bad deal.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the problems I have with this legislation is with the provisions that have been inserted to help with the consumer protection, which is already there. You may think that perhaps it could be done better. Schedule 1, item 5, amends section 38 of the Telecommunications Act. That, in turn, has some fairly severe enforcement provisions&mdash;civil penalties, not criminal ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government are putting in item 5 at the end of section 38, I was wondering why they were not putting in the matters that are set out in clause 87E. New division 6 talks about the customer service guarantee. A new section 87 has been suggested. That deals with the periods which will be taken to connect customers to specified kinds of telecommunications services, the periods that carriers may offer to customers when making those arrangements, the keeping of appointments and so on. There have to be standards made in relation to those matters, which Austel will make at the direction, as I understand it, of the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a reasonable proposition that timed periods should be given for providers to make arrangements to connect their customers and so on. The provision whereby the customers can enforce those seem very clumsy indeed. Those provisions are set out in proposed new section 87F. To enforce what the government proposes in 87E, a person will have to take a common law action&mdash;they will have to go off to a court of competent <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jurisdiction. Yet he or she can recover no more than $3,000, and perhaps less than that. Even if he or she recovers it, they cannot recover it in terms of money, only as a credit. That would mean that to make any use of proposed new section 87F, a customer could not effectively change the supplier because the only way he or she can recover anything under 87F is through a credit given in the account that the customer has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that you do have the makings here of a regime which could help customers. But I think the effect of it as it now stands is that it will make things very difficult for a customer to enforce, unless you are willing to provide legal aid or to provide aid in the same way as the Employment Advocate is treated under the new workplace relations act. At some stage I would like the government to outline why this new division is set out as it is. It is clearly aimed at helping customers but it is divorced from other sections of the act, such as section 38, which tries to deal with customer protection. A discrete part of the act is made by 87E and 87F. Why that is so, I am not sure. Why it is so clumsy would be very interesting to know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If any of those provisions are breached, it is not a criminal offence as set out in 87M. The only thing left to a customer is to go to some court of competent jurisdiction to get an amount of money, which might be quite small, and certainly no more than $3,000. It might well be thought that, if that is the position, nobody is going to take that sort of action, and you begin to wonder why division 6 is put in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on that subject, I look at 87H of proposed division 6 and notice that an evidentiary certificate issued by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is to be taken as evidence in the courts. I would be interested to know what opinion you have about that, given the Brandy case and other such cases. It seems to me that the provisions that you have here for customer protection are not as suitable as they could be. You might want to do something about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now go to the issue of the Commonwealth ownership of Telstra. I ask how the government is going to keep the sale of one-third of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6953"> Telstra to that level. The amount of Telstra that is to be sold might well go beyond one&hyphen;third. I notice proposed section 8BX states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Act is not invalidated by the fact that it constitutes an offence against this Part.</PARA>
<PARA>If the wish is to reduce the amount of Telstra sold to one&hyphen;third should it get beyond that, you will have to go through a whole series of actions, involving injunctions and other proceedings, which again is quite clumsy. I am interested to know what the government is going to do about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing I would like to know is: what will the prospectus that will be issued for the sale of one-third of Telstra contain about future matters? It has been much debated here today whether one-third or, ultimately, three-thirds of Telstra are to be sold. I would have thought that that was a vital issue, particularly in the preparation of a prospectus, because someone who is going to buy a third of Telstra now might be very much affected by the knowledge of whether or not the whole of Telstra or even two-thirds of Telstra will be sold in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the point Senator Margetts raised in this context does need looking at. What are the minority shareholders, the people who hold the one-third of Telstra, going to be able to do?</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at clauses 8AB, 8AC, 8BH and 8BI, then the sorts of things that Senator Harradine is talking about do become interesting. Clause 8BI says that, if Telstra contravenes subsection (1), it can be fined up to 500 penalty units, but there is nothing there that says that what they have done is invalidated. Clause 8BI creates an offence, but the offence itself does not invalidate anything that is done under the relevant part&mdash;part 2. It seems to me that, at the very least, there is some tightening up to do.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that was what I was saying before. The only way you can do it is to go through what may be a very protracted exercise and make use of injunctions and other proceedings to see whether you can redress the balance. Clause 8BK says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The object of the section is to allow the regulations to reduce the ownership limit percentages in the event that the Commonwealth's one-third equity interest in Telstra is transferred in 2 or more tranches.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to talk about regulations being made. So there are regulatory provisions. But, if you look at the whole scheme, it is very hard to see how this scheme presents a fairly expeditious and inexpensive way of keeping the Telstra sale down to one-third.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the sorts of things that ought to be looked at if a prospectus is going to be issued&mdash;as it must; it will have to be issued within the next few months. What is the future of Telstra? What rights will minority shareholders have? As Senator Margetts said, are you going to deny these minority shareholders the rights that other minority shareholders have in other companies? If you are going to use Telstra to perform community service obligations or if you are going to use it to fill in an area where no other carrier will go, are you going to tell the people this when you put it out for shareholders to purchase? I think that is a real problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will also have a position as to the winding up of Telstra. Telstra could be wound up by 8BY. So there is a contemplation here that Telstra, in fact, might be wound up. In other words, it is not guaranteed that this company will continue into the future.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6954">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I want to raise is the expenditure of money that will be allowed under these provisions to discharge Telstra's debt to get it into a better position than it presently is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address a particular issue in relation to the telecommunications infrastructure package that we heard about last Thursday for the first time and that we are now beginning to see leaking out in dribs and drabs. There is an article by Lenore Taylor in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  entitled `MPs question rural Telecom fund numbers'. It explains that the breakdown for this telecommunications infrastructure package has been done by working out the percentage of each state's population that live outside the non-capital areas. That is fine, but it is not as though the state populations are equal and it is not as though the size of the states is equal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article quotes one of my National Party colleagues, the member for the electorate of Parkes, Mr Michael Cobb, who is very upset about what is going to happen here. According to the figures, funding per capita in New South Wales is going to be $15.99. Mr Cobb's electorate of Parkes is bigger than the state of Tasmania, yet the constituents in his electorate are going to get $15.99 a head. People living in Tasmania are going to be worth $208.41 a head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something is not right here because we know&mdash;according to the figures from Lenore Taylor's article&mdash;that about four per cent of the non-capital city population of Australia is accounted for by Tasmania. New South Wales has a non-capital city population of 2,399,000&hyphen;odd people. Tasmania has a non-Hobart population of 278,300. You are not measuring apples with apples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In New South Wales, the most populous state&mdash;one of the bigger states; a state that does have rural and provincial areas and remote areas&mdash;we are being ripped off. There are no other words to use but the words `ripped off'. We are not getting a fair deal out of this. Not even the National Party members are getting a fair deal out of this. They have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been walked over by their Liberal Party colleagues. It is an appalling state of affairs that this should be allowed to happen. Why? I am not going to go into the whys. There have been plenty of newspaper articles as to why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at a few of the communities in Mr Cobb's electorate. Let us look at Tibooburra. It is about four hours drive from Bourke. It is about four hours drive from Broken Hill on unsealed roads&mdash;some of the worst roads in this country. They have a population of about 1,000. On occasions their electricity still comes from generators. They have a distance education centre. They are actually servicing the education needs of children who come from the far north&hyphen;western corner of New South Wales. It includes children in Queensland in the Nappa Merrie and those areas, and it goes across into South Australia and its upper reaches. That is the closest area for those children to get education from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So Tibooburra has a population of about 1,000. It might be 1,200, but let's say it is 1,000. Because it is in New South Wales, that community would be attracting $15,999. If it were in Tasmania, a community of that size would attract $208,410. I am talking about a community that, in driving time, is almost further away from anywhere than anywhere in Tasmania is from Hobart. Maybe if you have a snow storm up the Midlands you will not be able to get through in four hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also talking about an area that does not have all-weather roads. It has to rely on the Royal Flying Doctor Service for its medical emergencies and for its medical services. I am talking about a place where children who require education in secondary school have to go away and board. These people are going to be attracting less than $16,000 for their telecommunications needs. Do not tell me they do not have telecommunications needs, because they do. I have been there. I am one of the few members of parliament who have actually been to Tibooburra&mdash;</PARA>

They do have a lot of decentralised communities up the coast&mdash;I recognise that&mdash;and that poses a problem. South Australia will be getting $26.5 million.

Actually, it is not in New South Wales. They have some pretty significant telecommunication needs, because that is now becoming quite a popular tourist area. It means that people are driving through in four&hyphen;wheel drives. They are in danger of having accidents or whatever. But, if it is actually in Queensland, they will only attract $29.70 each. If it is in South Australia, they will attract $67.60 each. It does not make sense. It is ludicrous. The words that I want to use to describe this are either unparliamentary or I can't think of them. I just find it appalling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sixteen million is going to be spent in the Northern Territory. Per capita the amount will be $168.42. With the very sparse population there and the huge telecommunications needs, one has to question whether that is going to be anywhere near adequate for the provision of a telecommunications service to the out&hyphen;stations and remote communities. There are a lot there. The ACT will get $4 million when 0.4 per cent of the population lives outside Canberra itself. That is $10,000 per person. I do not begrudge the people in the Brindabellas an adequate telecommunications service because they can be cut off by snow or by floodwaters. Senator Harradine wants to have a go at me about the cost of providing a telecommunications service in Sydney. I would suggest you look at the cost of providing a telecommunications service in Canberra in the ACT. It beats Sydney hands down. You have got all the embassies, for which you have got to provide secure lines in and out. There is the hire of that technical equipment, and research and stuff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot get away from the fact that the per capita model for per capita funding in New South Wales is going to be so low. I think it bears repeating again and again that a place like Tibooburra, with a population of 1,000&mdash;it might be 1,200, but I will say 1,000 for ease of maths&mdash;will attract $15,999 because they are in New South Wales. We may as well say $16,000. If the same community of 1,000 people were outside Hobart in Tasmania it would attract $208,410. The Central Darling shire, because it is in New South Wales, attracts $64,000. If it were in Tasmania, it would attract $825,640. This is a shire <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that is struggling to provide a sewerage service for the residents of Wilcannia. They are having difficulty providing basic needs. Because they live in New South Wales, they will not even be able to make the most of this infrastructure program to make sure that they have at least a telecommunications service which is second to none. They are being discriminated against because they actually  happen to come from New South Wales and not from one of the other more privileged states. I think that is an absolute atrocity in this day and age. The government is to be condemned for it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I particularly want to address my remarks in the second reading debate on the Telstra bill to matters specific to Tasmania. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has made much of Tasmania's situation. The deal that is supposedly so great for Tasmania as a result of the government getting support for its legislation has been reported to varying degrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read with interest a letter that Senator Harradine circulated earlier tonight in the chamber. It is addressed to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. In the last two paragraphs, he makes two pertinent points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why I am unwilling to see the economic development of my State prejudiced by anything which could leave its people stuck on a telecommunications dirt road. That is why I am interested in universal service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have not made up my mind on the Telstra sale legislation and I do not propose to do so until I have heard and considered all the arguments and have been satisfied that all options and all implications have been carefully examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect the Government to consider carefully anything raised in the Parliament or in public discussion, including the use of hybrid securities as a financing tool for Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA>They are very interesting comments. I do not necessarily disagree with any senator striving to get a better deal for their state. In fact, it is something that we all do. Whether we are in opposition or in government, we have an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6957"> obligation&mdash;most of us, if not all of us, carry out that obligation&mdash;to lobby on behalf of our respective states, and always with an overriding view to the national interest and to equality throughout this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be the first to agree with Senator Harradine that Tasmania suffers. I find it very interesting that the minister has made some comments to that effect. It suffers from some rather unique problems, not the least of which is the 200&hyphen;odd kilometres of water that separates it from the mainland. As to telecommunications, I do not think we suffer any greater inconvenience or lack of service than do a lot of other regional areas throughout Australia. That is not to say that Tasmanian senators should not lobby for something better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, it really raises the question of why we need to sell Telstra to get a better deal in telecommunications for Tasmania. I would have thought that, no matter what the persuasion of the government or the opposition, we all&mdash;in this place, at least&mdash;have a responsibility to ensure that communications and the application of services relating to communications are meted out equally throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that that in part has not been the case. We certainly know it is a fact that in the past the now government when it was in opposition argued and pursued very strongly the issue of the treatment of rural and regional areas. It said that Telstra, and, indeed, all other public enterprises, ought to be free from government interference. Take a look at what has happened and what the minister, in his press release of 5 December, announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past few weeks I have been working with Telstra to identify some of the implications of their current three year business plan for Tasmania and Queensland . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some $12 billion has been allocated by Telstra over 3 years to create a world class telecommunications infrastructure and to improve its level of customer service. This upgrade will include full digitisation of the network, expansion of GSM mobile services and improved Internet access. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That says it all as far as Telstra is concerned. Then I thought about their plans. Further, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its Australia&hyphen;wide plan to speed up network modernisation and ISDN availability, ISDN services in Tasmania will achieve a 70% customer penetration by June 1997 and 90% by December 1997, creating an additional 30 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, I would be interested to know whether that was part of their three&hyphen;year plan prior to your coming to some arrangement with Senator Harradine and Senator Colston involving their support for your legislation on the partial sale. You continued to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition local call access to the Internet will be provided for all Tasmanians and Tasmania will benefit from an Internet for Schools package to be offered nationally early next year.</PARA>
<PARA>I come back to the national context of this whole issue. Of course we want Tasmanian schools, people and businesses to have access to the Internet. There is no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to you, Minister, that there are a lot of other telecommunications services that Tasmania would like to have fixed up. We would like to have telecommunications technology as it comes on stream, as it advances, as quickly as possible, which is not unlike all other Australians. You are one of the people who in the past had acknowledged that there has been a tendency for the major competitors in telecommunications to provide services in the most profitable areas. That is why Telstra has been able to provide the cross&hyphen;subsidies that it has provided to rural and remote areas. That is a fact of life. Further in your statement you say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of Tasmania, Telstra is planning to establish a new national call connect centre in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, when did they plan that? The impression you get from your statement is that it was part of the deal you came to with Senator Harradine and Senator Colston. If that is the case, then I think what Senator Ray said is very true. What we have here is not government in the interests of the people but government by the political power that you can come into this place with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put something to Senator Colston and Senator Harradine. If there were <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6958"> two other Independent senators from other states and they were the ones who came to this arrangement with the government with regard to support for Telstra, and they were the ones who were able to attract to their states a greater portion of the benefits that might be derived from this sale, what would the view of Senators Harradine and Colston be then? I know what Senator Harradine's view would be: no different from mine; that is, you should treat the people equally. Senator Harradine has been a strong advocate of that. Senator Alston said in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But significant problems remain, and I acknowledge today the particular difficulties faced by Tasmania. Not only does Tasmania suffer from all the isolation problems arising from being divided from the mainland by a large waterway, but also it has more than half its population located outside the capital city.</PARA>
<PARA>There is probably no other state that sits in that same position, but a huge portion of the Australian population lives outside of capital cities and I think they deserve to be treated equally, as much as I will support and push for everything that I can get for my home state. The minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has suffered for too long from the problems of an inferior telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to Senator Alston: I remember sitting on a committee that looked at telecommunications services throughout Australia. I remember distinctly your colleagues Senator Panizza, Senator Ferguson and Senator Crane arguing very strongly. We went to King Island, and there they said, `King Island's problems are no worse than those in other areas in Western Australia, South Australia or somewhere else&mdash;maybe the Northern Territory.' They were the arguments that were presented then, so why are you taking such a different position now that you are in government? I will deal more specifically with something you said in relation to the extra $100 million to the environment package. You said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rising water tables, salination, erosion, degraded creeks . . . so much so, we have decided to increase the contribution to the fund&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Natural Heritage Trust&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by another $100 million. The capital contribution from the sale to the environment will be $1.1 billion.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>The minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responding to Senator Harradine, we accept his argument. Tasmania is pre-eminent in natural heritage. One third of Tasmania has been committed to national parks or conservation reserves, a much higher proportion than anywhere else in the country. To maintain this to the standard that all Australians expect is very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA>That is dead right, but there are two walking tracks alone that desperately need repairs costing somewhere in the order of $11 million. If we got even 10 per cent of the $1.1 billion&mdash;I assume that is over five years&mdash;that would not be anywhere near sufficient funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the commitment of the government to the environment on a national level, you really have to ask yourself: where is it? There is no commitment outside of this potential $1.1 billion. There are no ongoing funds. What happens after the five-year period expires and the $1.1 billion is gone? Where is the ongoing commitment to the environment in terms of budget measures? If you cannot fit it into the budget now, how will you fit it in the budget later? The minister said further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can therefore assure Senator Harradine that these special issues which apply to Tasmania&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>talking about Tasmania's special issues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be taken into account in the distribution of trust funds.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind Senator Alston of the Tasmanian package launched by the now Prime Minister, John Howard, on 7 February 1996. In that you said very similar words. You said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has a unique place in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we do, too&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government has a special responsibility to achieve equality for Tasmanians in developing opportunities for their state.</PARA>
<PARA>You go on to outline a number of things that we took as promises, but they did not quite fit into the core promise category, because we did not get them. You said, `We had this black hole,' of some unknown figure that you claim to be $8 billion. The reality is that the sale of Telstra had nothing to do with the budget. You made these promises on the basis <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6959"> of the budget and the dollars in terms of that being there as they were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even with the sale of Telstra, you have not committed anything like what you promised. If we added up what you took away from Tasmania per the last budget, we would see that it is somewhere in excess of $140 million. I do not know how much you intend to give back. You said, `We need to look at some infrastructure development for Tasmania.' You are going to flog the railways and flog the airports, and you promised nearly $50 million in a ferry subsidy but we will be lucky to get $22 million. You took away $15 million from the AMC/AME. You took away $10 million from the university. You took away $3 million in the wheat subsidy and possibly $13 million in terms of our freight subsidy. And you have the audacity to come in here and speak about the difficulties that Tasmania  confronts, let alone the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just say to Senator Harradine, if he is listening, that I hope he will reconsider his position because this is the greatest con of all time. There is no need to sell Telstra to get a better communications service for Tasmania. If he combines with opposition senators we ought to be able to get a better deal for the whole of Australia from one of the biggest profit making public enterprises Australia has. That is what we should be doing. We should not be flogging it off to put a few million bucks into this or that. That is not even a short-term solution; it is no solution. That is what we have to change. I hope Senator Harradine will reconsider his position. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take that interjection that we must be filibustering. I remind you, Senator, that this is an important bill. I also say for the record that the Labor Party should not have that accusation made of it. I pulled my speech on the second reading and now in the committee stages I intend to refer to the appropriate parts of that speech that relate to the committee stages of that bill. I think it is <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important that some of these things go on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since you have reacted to my accepting the call, perhaps I should start with the theme with which Senator Murphy concluded. This is a states house. The Senate is made up of people elected from the states. Senator Murphy was rightly raising issues as a consequence of the carriage of the second reading of this bill that affects Tasmania. Senator Murphy is a very strong advocate for his own state. There are some matters that affect my state as well. Some of those need canvassing too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My state, Western Australia, is particularly interested in what the federal government's view now is as to how the $1.1 billion package will be disbursed for the environment. The chamber may well know there is a state election campaign going on in Western Australia at present. The incumbent Liberal government, under the leadership of Richard Court, has made several promises on the environment. The most significant promise is that he will institute a $300 million program aimed at redressing the problem of salinity&mdash;a problem that is encroaching upon the eastern wheat belt of Western Australia more and more and a problem that is attacking the basis of one of the best agriculture crops the state can export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt there is a problem there. There is some argument as to the best way of handling it but that argument should be set to one side in favour of getting on with the job rather than having an academic debate about which is the best way of getting on with the job. Premier Court has made this undertaking, were he to be elected next Saturday, as part of his commitment to the Western Australian community about how he intends to get on with the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6960"> The key issue here is though that he has not got $300 million to pay for it. The key issue is that he believes that the Commonwealth government is going to pay for it and that it is going to come out of the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra. In fact I understand that he has written a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) which specifies this specific point. He believes that the under standing he reached with the Prime Minister about funding, or shall I say in the true sense of the word pork-barrelling his election commitments in this case, means that the Commonwealth will fund that salinity remediation problem for the state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do know that if it is in the $1.1 billion package, as the package has now grown to be, then other areas of the package that are promised will have to be reduced or cut out. We know that if this undertaking were to be honoured by the federal government then the cost of the package would be $1.4 billion not $1.1 billion. If it were to remain at $1.1 billion, commitments made by this government to various other states for pressing environmental problems in those states would have to be cut back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like a comment from you, Senator Alston, confirming that the understanding of the Western Australian Premier Richard Court is right, that the agreement that he did reach with the Prime Minister, John Howard, confirms that out  of the $1.1 billion to be set aside for environmental works $300 million is to go to the state of Western Australia to fund the election promise that the Liberal Party in that state has made. That is the first question I would like a comment from you about. I do not want a vague comment and one of ambiguity and maybes but rather one that actually answers the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question is: can you please confirm if the package then becomes $1.4 billion? But if the package remains at $1.1 billion, can you tell us then in which other areas of that package that have been publicly committed by the government are there to be amendments and changes and what other programs in that package will be reduced accordingly? I think that is an important question. I think it is a question that Australians generally want to know. It is certainly a question that Western Australians, in particular, want to know the answer to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is incumbent upon this government to dispel the argument and to put clearly and openly on the table exactly what the deal is. Otherwise what you are trying to do in the state of Western Australia is creep to electoral <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> victory under the guise of ambiguity. What you are trying to do at the federal level is not answer the question and keep all of those who were told they are recipients believing that they are and dud them at the end of the process if the funds come out, as I suspect they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, by any measure, a bill that has gripped national attention for some time. It is an important issue. I want to say this though: when you take a public authority like Telstra and you privatise part of it you introduce into a corporation that exists to provide a service to the community a new motive and a new direction&mdash;a new motive of making a profit. When it comes to conflict, the conflict is obvious. You cannot provide a high quality service of communications in a nation like Australia with far flung cities and towns fairly and equitably within reasonable degrees of tolerance while at the same time trying to make a profit for your shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those two concepts sit in mutual antagonism to one another. That is basically at the bottom of all of my concerns about this bill. I know that the government has pat answers for this and, to the uninitiated, those answers are convincing. To those of us who have had experience in running statutory authorities or government business organisations, they are as shallow as a puddle. They are not convincing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, I cite the case of the AIDC, the Australian Industry Development Corporation. Under the former Labor government, we made a decision to partly privatise that instrumentality, which we did&mdash;up to about 18 per cent of its shareholding. As soon as you do that, you confer on the majority shareholder and on the minority shareholders exactly the same rights. On this occasion you will say, `We will cover that by putting them beyond the reach of the Corporations Act so that the standing of the minority shareholders and their entitlement to access information and their participation in the decision making as it stands under corporate law in Australia for all other organisations won't be the same in the case of Telstra.' That then sounds a warning bell to those who may invest that, if they do, their rights are different.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6961">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest that in the practical world their rights will not be different, nor could the government reasonably expect them to be different. When minority shareholders insist, as we found in the case of the AIDC, the government can be refused by the corporation overall not to be told relevant information. If you want then to conduct a due diligence study to realise your ultimate dream of selling the whole lot, unless the minority shareholders approved of that, you would not be able to carry it out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So in the case of the AIDC, because we had partly privatised it&mdash;which is almost an oxymoron; it is a bit like being partly pregnant&mdash;what the Commonwealth had to do was buy back the private shareholding in order to take control of the whole organisation. It had to become the single shareholder, then have access to a due diligence study and then consider the whole of the authority for sale. This will be a similar situation that will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It arises because under corporate law, quite rightly, after the corporate crooks of the eighties ran riot in this country, a revision of corporate law was needed to prevent the Bonds, the Skases and et al doing what they did then. So we encoded the rights of shareholders quite explicitly. Those rights stand as fundamental rights. As soon as you introduce a minority shareholding here, shareholders who are entitled to a return on their capital investment&mdash;that is, to make a profit&mdash;will assert their rights. Whatever flimsy barriers or Chinese walls or paper partitions you put between them and their rights, they will find a way around it, over it, under it or through it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think the explanation that the government has given the Australian community about that is at all satisfactory, nor do I believe that it stands up to scrutiny. If it is to be the case that there is to be a part sale, much more work needs to be done to ensure that the commitments that the government has made can be delivered on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to another matter which is central to my concern, dear to the hearts of many Australians and fundamental to future prospects for employment. The fastest growing industry in the world and now the biggest <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry in the world after the motor car industry is the information technology and telecommunications sector. It is the fastest growing. It is one set to grow at a much more rapid pace with convergence. When we talk about the superhighway, about electronic shopping and all the rest of it, we are talking about the sort of thing that Bill Gates is on about in the future: the convergence of various technologies to create a virtual world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications is central to that. If Australia does not manufacture its own inputs into that new technology, it will import foreign made goods to provide those technologies to the Australian system. The telecommunications industry that we have in Australia is by world standards a small industry but which, despite its size, is also a refreshingly imaginative and innovative industry; a strong industry and an industry which from time to time has given Telecom&mdash;in its former guise before it became Telstra&mdash;a market edge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do things differently here and often we do them better, although you would go a long way frequently to find Australians ready to admit it. But that is the truth of it. Under the privatising proposal, the same monitoring and the same encouragement will be given by the government for Telstra, as indeed it will be for Optus, to continue to source in Australia. But, once again, what has occurred is that you have fundamentally changed the direction of the enterprise. You have made it into a profit maker as well as a service provider. Those two things are mutually contradictory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By loading the new enterprise with community service obligations, as you are bound to do, in order to answer the profit making part of the equation as well, Telstra will be forced more and more not to invest in Australian industry, not to develop the technology onshore, not to encourage the many fine examples of Australian communications companies and companies that are to do with the new virtual world&mdash;that is, to contribute new technology, new inventions, new ideas, new ways of doing things to the frontiers that are emerging in communications and information science&mdash;and will be forced offshore to source from the majors overseas.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6962">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once you do that, you take intelligent jobs out of Australia. You take jobs off people who are highly skilled, highly trained professionals. You also take out of Australia the ability to produce our own needs in telecommunications equipment, and you provide those jobs to foreigners, to other economies and to other companies offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra is such a big corporation that it requires positive encouragement to make sure that those jobs are kept here. In the present environment of changing from being a service provider to a service provider/profit taker&mdash;no matter what I think about the contradiction in those terms&mdash;more than monitoring is required and more than encouragement is required. Positive commitments are required from the government to all of those small&hyphen; and medium&hyphen;sized Australian telecommunications companies with their thousands of employees and the major regional and rural centres of Australia where they develop their operations, employ people and are central to the local economies. A real message needs to be given to them that Telstra, as a first priority, will be directed to source its equipment and supplies from Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that means a slightly higher charge in order to get the economy of scale in those companies to produce, through a long run of production, goods at the end of the process more cheaply, so be it. We can then start selling overseas. We ought to become an exporter of this technology. We are so damn good at it, we can export it and make a quid for this nation and provide better jobs for Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What came out of the public inquiry that we all spent months working on? Many things came out of that inquiry. Despite grand efforts by the government representatives on the Senate committee inquiring into the partial sale of Telstra, some very useful information came forward. Some of that useful information related specifically to jobs and what Telstra had in mind for jobs in the context of impending&mdash;or what they hoped was impending&mdash;partial privatisation. Now they have got it or have just about got it. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard during that inquiry and during the second reading debate that jobs will go. Those jobs will now go. The reality now is that 22,000 jobs&mdash;200 of them here in the ACT, but many of them from regional Australia&mdash;are now at risk. Despite any of the cosy deals that have been done in this place to secure the passage of this bill, with a few jobs here and there perhaps being saved, it means that the general path down which Telstra now will go is one of downsizing, rationalisation, squeezing the last possible cent out of their profit margin and increasing their dollar bottom line. That will become the prime motivation for this company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad time for not only the people who will lose their jobs but also the people in Australia who have relied heavily on the services which have been provided by Telstra. First of all, I will dwell on Telstra as a mechanism for government to institute sound social policy, whether it be with respect to access to and equity of telecommunication services or whether it be to the standard universal service obligation that takes as basic a simple phone to families right across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It did not take someone like Bill Clinton to come here and raise the importance of telecommunications to Labor. I think we have always known of their importance, and our views were vindicated by the outcome of the public inquiry report which stated quite clearly, based on evidence from the witnesses, that the majority of Australians were not comfortable with the sale of Telstra. Also, we did not find the substantive evidence, whether on an economic basis or a service provision basis, to justify its partial sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Cook touched upon research and development in the telecommunications sector. Australia really is at the forefront of development of this technology for the whole Pacific region. I believe that it is quite important for Australia to develop its technological base&mdash;and not only in industry. If you look at some of the studies that have been carried out, it is quite clear that if you have a high standard of technological uptake within the community, that trend reflects the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6963"> ability of that economy or society to be to the fore in developing industry and technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying to you, Minister, is that there is a direct link between the uptake of those technologies within the community and a country's ability to be able to establish itself as a leader in the export and the industry development of those particular technologies. Unless those bases are covered now, we will lose what I believe is quite a strong position in this area. Also, unless those bases are covered in a way that will foster future growth, it will be an opportunity lost&mdash;and it is too important an opportunity for our economic future to allow it to go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, with respect to that opportunity, despite many of your quasi policy statements of recent times, I do not believe that this government is doing enough to ensure that all Australians have access to that high level of technology. By partially privatising Telstra, you are giving away the opportunity to further enhance the ability of the community to take up new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I have been listening very carefully to your numerous statements and to your responses to questions during question time from your own people about what you are doing as a government in this regard&mdash;whether it is Internet access for rural people, expanding the band width generally, or whatever&mdash;all I see is a Telstra business plan being rehashed and reworked into government policy. I do not think that is good enough. It is not good enough because Telstra will be motivated not by what they can bring the Australian society; they will be motivated by the fact that they need to provide a greater return for their investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I can hear you asking, `Well, isn't that a good thing?' I do not believe it is a good thing. Unless there is some gain or some benefit to the Australian community per se and unless there is a mechanism for governments to be able to influence the direction of our dominant telecommunications carrier, those opportunities will be lost forever. As a policy tool, whether it is partial privatisation or full privatisation does not make a scrap of difference. You only need look at some of the areas of the bill, particularly 8AX and 8AY <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which show the fiduciary responsibilities of directors, to see that it makes no difference whether it is partially or fully privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I would like to know whether it is true that a partially privatised Telstra, by virtue of clauses 8AX and 8AY of the bill, renders the responsibilities of the directors to being no different from that which would apply to a fully privatised Telstra and what distinction, if any, exists by virtue of the fact that it is only a partially privatised Telstra as opposed to a fully privatised Telstra. These questions are quite important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the past certainly, one example comes to mind in relation to the responsibilities of directors of a former publicly owned asset becoming a privately owned asset and the role of Commonwealth government representatives on the boards of partially or otherwise privatised corporations in guiding, directing and steering some of the policy issues that might be close to the government's heart. Minister, I put those issues to you. Hopefully I will get a response as to what distinction there is or in fact, as I suspect, whether there is no distinction whatsoever between the responsibilities and roles of the directors of a partially or fully privatised formerly publicly owned corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect of the report that I would like to touch on in the context of this committee debate is the services through telecommunications that are provided to people. One thing that becomes painfully clear, and which became very clear through the inquiry process, is that at the moment there is a lot to be desired with respect to services and there is real concern in this current context that those services will be further downgraded. It is not that in some areas the services are not terrific. With all due respect, the FMO project and some of the strategies that have already been outlined by Telstra in improving ISDN access, Internet access, data access, high speed data transmissions and so forth are all well and good; but they will be applied in a way that gets the greatest return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern through all this process is that it will not just be this path of deregulation that this government has embarked upon in the hope that competition and privatisation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6964"> will deliver the outcomes of equity across the level of service provided to users of these telecommunications carriers. It will be driven by where the greatest returns are. The only way the government will be able to ensure equity and access to the higher grade services will be by re&hyphen;regulating&mdash;and re&hyphen;regulating in a way that tightens up the consumer service guarantee and redefines the universal service obligation to pick up the new areas and regulate to a greater degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen it already in this bill, with the restatement of the consumer service guarantees. That is the clearest indication that all of those things are at risk. It is quite paradoxical that this government on the one hand talks about deregulation and competition coming to the fore in providing these services, but on the other hand finds it very necessary to restate, or redraft or introduce new regulations to achieve that equity of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, let us look at the US. Some recent statements by the just re-elected President, particularly during his campaign, made it quite clear that they were the directions precisely in which they were moving in the US. They have been down the path of massive deregulation, obviously with privatisation of the national communications carriers. You have seen a fracturing of those services. Now the US government, because of the inequities in provisions of services, is having to step back into the picture and re&hyphen;regulate to make sure those services are accessible to all Americans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can learn from this. This government should not trip down the merry path of where the US has been and get to a point down the track where it finds out that we have telecommunications haves and have-nots and information technology haves and have-nots. The government should put in place a structure that can deal with that now. My argument is that privatisation&mdash;partial or otherwise&mdash;is not conducive to achieving that equity of access, particularly to the faster services, the higher grade bandwidth and so forth that are required to have effective information technology services within the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area I want to touch on relates to where Telstra is going. In the first instance, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the role Telstra played in this campaign to get itself privatised is quite concerning. It is worth stating quite unequivocally that it was unusual in the least that Telstra almost led the debate. If you heard the submissions put before the inquiry, you would know that the Department of Finance and the department of telecommunications were floundering around with dubious arguments with respect to World Bank studies which were certainly not comparable to the situation in Australia. Telstra were the ones that obviously put in the resources and prepared the arguments for their privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who are the beneficiaries of privatisation? One document that we got during the inquiry shows that certainly the chief executives of corporations are major beneficiaries. Certainly the workers on the ground aren't, because most of them, or a fair proportion of them, will lose their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see through that whole inquiry process that Telstra, playing the role it did, is moving in a direction that squeezes the research dollar, the long-term investment dollar and the dollar that is not going to provide a great return to the company within the immediate future. It is moving to investments in projects that turn a quick dollar. That is a very short-term vision by this telecommunications carrier, which has a reputation of being very far-sighted. It has positioned itself to reap the benefits in five years or 10 years time. The investment that occurred with optic fibre technology has now positioned Australia at the very forefront of the development of that technology globally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the government prepared to give away what little policy control or involvement they have in steering Telstra in a direction that at least provides some benefit to the community? I think this point has been lost in this debate, whether it is in the context of what we have heard about the environment or what we have heard about what the government is going to spend the money on. It is a shame that in this whole argument the value of Telstra in private hands has almost become a non-issue. What is more important is how many dollars the government are going to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6965"> squeeze out of it and pump into this bit or that bit of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us not forget that this was a bad strategy to start with. It is one of the most cynical, political ploys that has ever been invented. The saddest irony of all is that the people it was targeted at, the Greens, who had the balance of power at the time, were rendered impotent in this argument, and this government got away with this strategy with the help of two Independents. That is the saddest irony of all, and it is quite a telling moment in relation to this government's approach not only to policy but to public assets that have the ability to deliver a sound social access and equity strategy on telecommunications. That has been given away in this process, and the credibility of this government has gone with it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I want to deal with part 2C of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. Clause 8CN, headed `Re&hyphen;affirmation of universal service obligation', reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Parliament re&hyphen;affirms its intention:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that all people in Australia, wherever they reside or carry on business, will continue to have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to standard telephone services and payphones; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the universal service obligation described in section 288 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telecommunications Act 1991</EMPHASIS>  should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the losses that result from supplying loss&hyphen;making services in the course of fulfilling the universal service obligation should be shared among carriers on an equitable basis, namely, in direct proportion to each carrier's share of the interconnect time between those carriers' trunk and international networks and all local access networks; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> that the information on the basis of which, and the methods by which, those losses and those carriers' respective shares in those losses are determined should be open to scrutiny by those carriers, and by the public, to the greatest extent possible without undue damage to a carrier's interests being caused by the disclosure of confidential commercial information.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>That passage in the legislation was referred to by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) on 10 October in an answer to a question which I think has been noted in earlier debate in this chamber. It is the two per cent answer, where the minister said that the reduction in employment by Telstra in Tasmania would be two per cent. Subsequently, some 42 days later, he had to correct the answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somewhat cheaply the minister suggested that Senator Schacht was going to move an amendment to this clause, implying that the opposition was somehow opposed to the universal service obligation. Of course, that is nonsense. In relation to that, the minister said on page 3819 of the proof <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 10 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anyone who has read the Telecommunications Act&mdash;I suspect that not too many have&mdash;would know that there is already a provision entrenched in that legislation which guarantees that, to the extent that services in rural and remote areas are uneconomic, they must be cross&hyphen;subsidised out of a universal service fund contributed to by all the carriers on a pro rata basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That will continue unless, of course, the Labor Party is proposing to move an amendment to open the system up. I am not aware of that. Maybe Senator Schacht has it up his sleeve for later on. But I would not support it . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Minister, the Labor Party does not support it, and that is inconsistent with the position that is put. The element of the debate that the minister referred to is further referred to on page 3827 of the same proof <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . In answer to a question by Senator Panizza, the minister said in referring to broadband services:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is more good news because, from July 1997, 93.4 per cent of customers will be able to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about Tasmania&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">obtain an ISDN service within 90 days of request. That will mean that both business and domestic users will be able to dial up fast digital connections as easily as making a phone call. Those sorts of new services will include multiple phones and faxes on the same line; much faster access to fax machines; fast EFTPOS links; fast access to the Internet for educational, cultural and information services; small&hyphen;screen video conferencing; shared screens; and virtual production groups, so that people in different locations can collaborate and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6966"> produce high fidelity sound and fast text and graphics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these will be available only because of the actions that the government has taken.</PARA>
<PARA>I will repeat the minister's words: `only because of the actions that the government has taken'. Isn't that the very point that the opposition has been making in this debate about the expansion of services beyond the very basic universal service obligations that the legislation lays down? This bill does not give any guarantees beyond the provision of standard telephone services and payphones. The minister has made the point on the record that expansion beyond those services in the state of Tasmania, particularly for ISDN services, which, I must say, most households would never access&mdash;the minister shakes his head, so I look forward to a response to that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the minister says&mdash;and I am happy to engage the minister in debate now&mdash;perhaps some will require that service. I will go on because the Labor Party has been strenuous in its opposition to this bill and, from the state of Tasmania, Labor senators have been strenuous in their opposition to this bill because there were no guarantees beyond the basic services. The only guarantee that the rural and remote areas have is the fact that the government owns the major provider and is currently able to direct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to what might happen to these services without direction, in the earlier answer the minister said, talking about broadband services, on page 3820 of the same proof <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is basically the suggestion that Tasmanians will lose access to broadband systems. The fact is that there are already a number of regional carriers that are providing these sorts of services&mdash;Paynet Telecommunications in Cairns, Northgate Communications in Ballarat. Austar is very keen to cable up rural areas and Optus has indicated an interest that will extend to Tasmania. I have no <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doubt that if Tasmanians are interested in the service Telstra will be looking at it as well.</PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, of course, the minister made no guarantees and it is very interesting, in the context of what we have learned since this time, that the government is putting forward $250 million on a curious basis to deal with concerns about the provision of these sorts of services. If that is not an admission of the deficiency of the bill, then I do not know what is. There is nothing in the bill that deals with the issue of the extension of services beyond those basic standard telephone and payphone services. There are no assurances and no guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look across Australia&mdash;and the Senate inquiry looked at this very issue&mdash;you look at the question of existing cross&hyphen;subsidisation of regional areas. I had a look at appendix 8 in the report and that indicated the federal electorates within each state which attracted no cross&hyphen;subsidy. The situation was that in Tasmania every electorate&mdash;obviously some more than others&mdash;attracted a cross&hyphen;subsidy. In the minister's own state of Victoria, 21 of the 38 electorates attracted no cross&hyphen;subsidy; in New South Wales, 24 of 50; in Queensland, I think only seven electorates required no cross&hyphen;subsidy; in South Australia, eight electorates required no cross&hyphen;subsidy; in Western Australia, six; in the Australian Capital Territory, two out of the three; and, of course, the Northern Territory, the only electorate, required cross&hyphen;subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in the context of the present parliament, a majority of the seats require a cross&hyphen;subsidy, which is probably similar to the coalition's current numerical strength in the House of Representatives. If they require a cross&hyphen;subsidy in relation to standard telephone and payphone services, as is provided for in the bill, what is the case going to be in relation to services that are not dealt with by the legislation? What do we have to deal with that? We have $250 million over five years allocated in a way which is advantageous to my state, but extremely disadvantageous to the more populous states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might say that it is strange for a senator from Tasmania to make this point, but I really do not believe that any state wants to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6967"> be seen to be garnering favour in the way that my state will appear, to many people in this country, to have garnered favour in this debate. In any case, I do not believe that $58 million over five years or $11.8 million per year is, in any way, going to address the needs of the state in relation to the provision of the services required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does anyone seriously think that the extension of the broadband cabling services to all the people in Tasmania can be achieved with $11.8 million per year? Bear in mind that the most profitable routes for this sort of service will be in the areas of the country where there is no cross&hyphen;subsidisation required. The majority of Australia is in a situation where a cross&hyphen;subsidy is required. And how unfair is this package in these circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So 8CM of the bill is deficient and maybe, Minister, we ought to be moving an amendment. Maybe we ought to enshrine in that provision in the bill something more than the basic cross&hyphen;subsidisation of telephone and payphone services. Maybe it would be more equitable to put the whole box and dice in there and to talk about a cross&hyphen;subsidisation of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will definitely be a disadvantage to all parts of Australia, including Tasmania, arising out of this bill, just as we have been saying all along. To the extent that the deal that is being done ameliorates the position for Tasmania, one would have to say that Tasmania is very fortunate. To the extent that it deals with the real need, we would have to say that this package of measures is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister is suggesting that we should throw in the extra $100 million for the environment, I thought that this government was committed to the environment. I thought that that is what this package was about and there was a case to be made, as Senator Harradine said, for an additional payment to the state of Tasmania, bearing in mind the sacrifices that the state has made in relation to setting aside important parts of the wilderness areas of the state for preservation and the restriction of the logging industry and the mining industry. Those are the issues which I understood would be compensated for in regard to this <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> measure. So I exclude those. I would be interested to hear from the minister whether he thinks I am unfair in not counting that $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, we have a pretty shabby and inadequate  package. I am pleased that the minister is here because I will be very interested to hear his comments. I suppose I could very cheaply say that perhaps he should be very careful this time because the last time he responded to one of my speeches, he did not quite get it right. Minister, I do look forward very seriously to your comments on these matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(9.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is common ground in this debate that it is vital to Australia's economic future that we have an efficient telecommunications sector. Telecommunications is Australia's second biggest business input, so by lowering costs, we make our businesses more competitive. However, it is also common ground that cost is not the only factor. By providing a quality telecommunications sector which takes full advantage of, and even promotes, innovations, we can make our businesses more productive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telecommunications is the fastest growing sector in our economy, with revenue increasing from $9.5 billion in 1989-90 to $20.3 billion in 1994-95. The sector grew by 17 per cent in real terms in 1994-95. The telecommunications industry has undergone rapid growth in employment and size since micro-economic reform started back in the early 1980s. The market has grown so fast, in fact, that Telstra's business has actually grown, despite Optus gaining a sizeable slice of the market, with revenues of almost $1.5 billion. This growth is due to lower prices, new products, value adding, better service and increased marketing&mdash;all results of competition. It is evidence that the introduction of competition stimulates growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, a Bureau of Industry Economics study has shown that since competition was introduced to the international call and mobile telephone markets, they have risen rapidly and they are currently just below world's best standard. However, another study from the Bureau of Industry Economics showed no <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6968"> association between performance and the type of ownership of the main enterprises in the market. The world's lowest telecommunications prices were in Iceland, which has a state monopoly, and the highest revenue per line and per employee was in Switzerland, which also has a state monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was evidence to indicate that corporatisation and the introduction of a competitive environment provides efficiency and cost benefits of the same level as privatisation of a state&hyphen;owned telecommunications carrier. It is therefore wrong to say that simply because an enterprise is privately owned, it is going to be more efficient and deliver cheaper prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to look at Telstra from an industry policy perspective. The Australian electronics industry is one of our growth industries, particularly important when one considers the global growth of telecommunications. The electronics industry has gone from $50 million worth of sales 10 years ago to over $1 billion now. By the end of the century it is estimated that the industry to be worth $1.5 billion. That sort of growth simply will not occur with a privatised Telstra. Telstra is vitally important to the Australian electronics industry because it invests more in research and development than any other company in Australia. When Telecom New Zealand was privatised, the electronics industry practically vanished overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra purchases over 70 per cent of its equipment, materials and services from Australian companies. This is a deliberate policy set by the government and is of major assistance to the development of our own indigenous electronics industry. It also has the added benefit of allowing the government to assist this industry without having to provide any direct funding. The result of this assistance is that a number of companies have been established in the electronics sector. With high growth, exports and value adding, this is a strategic part of our economy. The government could not tell a partially privatised Telstra where it could purchase its products, nor should it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> The Community and Public Sector Union conducted a study of the effects of privatisation on state&hyphen;owned overseas telecommunica tions carriers and found that a vast majority of them made significant cuts to their research facilities. Telstra has already shown that it is heading down this path, with 44 per cent of employees at the Telstra Research Laboratories to be made redundant in preparation for part-privatisation. This will obviously have a major impact on innovation in Australia. Telstra Research Laboratories, or TRL, is a world-class research facility. To quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has fostered intellectual vigour and know-how in telecommunications, helped spawn generations of outstanding engineers and allowed for cross-fertilisation of ideas.</PARA>
<PARA>TRL have a strong record of research and development success. Last financial year alone they developed a video&hyphen;on&hyphen;demand system for the Internet, `watermarks' for video images to ensure their security, and a new device which enables higher bandwidths in optical fibre. They have also developed a number of products which are either about to enter the marketplace or have already found export markets. These include: mobile network performance monitoring software, which Telstra is negotiating to license to Ericsson; radiation hazard software, which has been licensed to Motorola; electronic directory software, which was chosen by IBM from an international field for its Eurescom X500 international directory assistance trials; a distributed traffic monitoring system that has already been sold to Thailand; and an optical fibre fault&hyphen;finding technology that is expected to return up to $2 million in exports this financial year alone. A number of international companies have expressed interest in this product, including AT&amp;T, Sprint, MM Cables and Alcatel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last month the Economist Intelligence Unit released a report which said that the major factor preventing foreign investment was the lack of a consistent industry policy. A good example of an effective strategic industry policy is the US government's fostering of the telecommunications and information technology industries. This policy directly benefited companies such as AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories. Over their history Bell Labs has invested the first transistor, solar cell, laser, light-emitting diode, communications satellite, electrical <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6969"> digital computer, cellular mobile radio and artificial larynx. It made the world's first long-distance television transmission, brought sound to motion pictures and invented stereo recording and digital switching.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since Bell Labs was founded, it has received over 26,000 patents, an average of one per day since it was established. Seven researchers from Bell Labs have received Nobel prizes and five are recipients of the USA's National Medal of Science. This outstanding research and development record would have been severely limited without a decent industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Telstra is sold&mdash;which, as I have already outlined, is likely to lead to significant cuts in research and development&mdash;what innovations and inventions will Australia not develop? Since innovation is a major contributor to productivity growth, what effect will this have on Australia's standard of living in the long term?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A post&hyphen;budget study by Deloittes found that 34 per cent of companies were considering taking their research and development offshore as a direct result of the R&amp;D tax incentive reduction. With no industry policy and with the part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra, one has to ask if there will be any research left in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the global level, as put forward by a number of speakers already, the large telecommunications carriers are undertaking mergers and acquisitions and are entering into strategic alliances to strengthen their competitive position. This is resulting in a small number of very large mega&hyphen;alliances. The foreign telecommunications companies are competitors to local firms. These foreign companies will want to supply Telstra from within their own companies or alliances, not from independent Australian companies. These alliances are also active in telecommunications overseas, making their competitors Telstra and other Australian companies. This would result in these companies attempting to make Telstra and its Australian suppliers reduce their exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Studies cited by US Secretary for Labour, Robert Reich, indicate that, when foreign companies take a controlling interest in an <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> overseas firm, the strategic parts of that firm are moved to the home country of the foreign company. Telstra has entered into research alliances with overseas companies. This was fine for a public enterprise which had an interest in ensuring core research stays in Australia. But, if Telstra is privatised and Reich is correct, the core elements of this allied research will be done overseas. We can prevent this from happening whilst Telstra is in public hands, but, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to stop a privatised Telstra shifting core research overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one-third of Telstra were sold, it would represent around three per cent of the total market capitalisation on the Australian Stock Exchange. Due to the size of the Telstra float in relation to that of the Australian capital market, the government has no choice but to allow overseas investors to acquire a key stake. If the investment in Optus, other privatised carriers around the world and German Telecom within the last two weeks is an indication, plus the recent tendency towards mergers and acquisitions in a global telecommunications market, these foreign investors will primarily be telecommunications companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition accuse us of only arguing against the sale of Telstra because we are in opposition and point to the privatisation which occurred under Labor as evidence. There are two fundamental differences between the privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, and the proposed part&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra. The first one is the share of the market. The Commonwealth Bank services around 20 per cent of the Australian banking sector. Qantas has about 50 per cent of the domestic air travel market and under 40 per cent of the international air travel market. Both are in sectors where there are strong competitors, ensuring market forces prevent anti-competitive practices. Telstra controls almost 90 per cent of Australia's telecommunication services with no strong competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second difference is the provision of capital. The Commonwealth Bank and Qantas used governments funds to expand their businesses. I agree that it is more beneficial <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6970"> for the government to pass this risk and expense to private investors. However, Telstra raises its own investment capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although Optus is making a substantial investment in building a subscriber network through its broadband roll-out, it still uses the Telstra network for the majority of its local calls and extensively for long distance calls. This puts Telstra in too powerful a position for it to be privatised. In telecommunications, overseas experience has taught us that competition is determined almost exclusively by access to the main carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra has a far stronger asset backing than other telecommunications carriers. This will allow privatised Telstra, which is&mdash;rightly for a private company&mdash;concerned more about profits than industry development, to lower prices and start a price war. Due to its size, it could sustain losses longer than its competitors, forcing them out of the market. This would then leave Telstra with an absolute monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government often uses world's best practice indicators to show how poorly Telstra performs and how overstaffed it is. For example, in terms of lines per employee, Telstra ranks 26th out of 30 countries, almost 25 per cent below the average and around 50 per cent below world's best practice. This is the most common measure of efficiency, but it does not take into account the CSOs of Telstra and our unique geographical situation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very large and sparsely populated country with long distances between major population centres. This means it takes more employees to look after phone lines than a telephone company which deals only with the highly profitable sectors, does not have to concern itself with servicing pay phones or answering free directory assistance calls, and covers a large population in a small and defined geographic area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One suspects the current valuation of Telstra is far too low. It would see our most profitable public asset sold for a price far below its real worth. If one assumes Telstra's cash flow will be in line with current GDP growth&mdash;around 3&half; per cent per annum&mdash;until 2001 and steady thereafter and then <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> applies a discount rate of six per cent, Telstra's value would be around $37 billion. These assumptions are highly conservative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since competition was introduced to the telecommunications market, Telstra has managed to increase both its profit and market size. Every major economic forecaster is in agreement that telecommunications will grow rapidly over the next decade. Therefore, the assumption of cash flow growth at 3&half; per cent for five years and steady after that is highly conservative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the US inflation rate is expected to be two per cent per annum over the next decade, making bond rates six per cent per annum and interest rates four per cent per annum. This again makes a six per cent discount rate a most conservative estimate. Even this conservative valuation figure of $37 billion is still almost 50 per cent more than the government's valuation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arising out of those points on research and development, industry policy and valuation of Telstra, I have seven questions to direct to the minister. I will seek a response in due course. Firstly, what guarantees are there that the core strategic research that Telstra undertakes will be retained in Australia? Secondly, what will the government do with any surplus of up to $4 billion or $5 billion that arises from the one-third float? Thirdly, will that surplus be used to retire debt or will it be allocated to recurrent expenditure? If so, in what areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, what long-term programs and policies will be put in place to assist mendicant states like Tasmania? Fifthly, will the government offer similar subsidies to regional Western Australians as in Tasmania? If not, why not? Sixthly, will the government offer identical job guarantees to Western Australian Telstra workers as in Tasmania? If not, why not? Finally, will the government offer $300 million to assist the proposals of the Western Australian government to recover land degraded by salinity? If not, why not?</PARA></SPEECH>

<TIME.STAMP>(9.15 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments this evening and ask some similar questions of the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. Since the announcement of the deal that was made between the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6971"> government and Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, my phone in Queensland has certainly been running hot with people asking precisely the same kinds of questions that Senator Bishop was asking about Western Australia. When we come into this place, we assume that there is an equity about the way in which decisions will be made. We come in specifically to represent our states, but we do so in the interests of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns relate specifically to jobs and to the universal service obligations, particularly as they impact on my state of Queensland. Queensland, as I am sure honourable senators know, is one of the most decentralised states. We have a very large population living outside the capital city. Yet, apart from some mention of a few extra jobs in Toowoomba, I have not heard the minister speak about any aspect of the deal that has been done with Senator Colston, who is a Queensland senator, to recognise the special needs of Queensland and to guarantee rural services and to ensure jobs in all those decentralised towns and cities right up the coast and in inland centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am particularly concerned about jobs for women in Queensland. The minister is shaking his head. I know we get a lot of paper in this place, Senator, but I have not seen any guarantees of the kind that were offered to Senator Harradine and Senator Colston about the jobs of women in Telstra. Queensland women working in Telstra in regional centres from Cairns to the Gold Coast and inland fear that they will suffer disproportionately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are aware that there have been ongoing rumours. Maybe they are only rumours, but that does not assure the women who are relying on Telstra for their jobs when there are documents that reveal that a partially privatised company hopes to export many of its jobs to the Philippines. A partly privatised Telstra wants to establish operator assistance services in places like the Philippines. Philippine workers, who would be on substandard wages and conditions, who could speak acceptable English would replace women in regional Australia. If that is still nothing more than a worrying rumour, would the minister please categorically, in writing, give the same kinds of assurances to women workers in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Telstra that he has been quite happy to give to Senators Colston and Harradine?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I note and I am surprised that Senator Alston is able to be with us tonight, because I understand that he had to meet with his own backbench communications committee to seek guarantees about the universal service obligations on the Telstra sale legislation. I understand that Mr Bob Katter, a Queensland colleague, is understood to be concerned that the USOs&mdash;cross&hyphen;subsidies to ensure continued services in rural and regional areas&mdash;are not watertight. The deal with Senator Harradine and the deal with Senator Colston appears to be absolutely watertight. Minister, are the deals in relation to the universal service obligations absolutely watertight? Have you been able to assure that backbench committee or have you perhaps not been able to meet with them yet? An article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> written by Lenore Taylor reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National and Liberal Party backbenchers from rural areas plan to raise questions this week about the State breakdown of the Government's $250 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund and about the effectiveness of universal service obligations in the Telstra sale legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>What we find when we do some analysis of the deal that was done last week is that the deal actually does this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This gives independent Senator Brian Harradine's State, Tasmania, where around 59 per cent of the population live outside Hobart, more than 20 per cent of the money, despite the fact that Tasmania's non-capital city population represents only about 4 per cent of the non-capital city population of Australia as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, are you happy? Can you go to sleep at night knowing that you have disproportionately favoured one state merely because you were so determined to get your legislation through in the form that the government has chosen? I find it totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All senators would be very happy to go to individual ministers and do deals on behalf of their regions. I am sure Senator Gibbs would be very happy to do some deals in relation to jobs in Ipswich. I am sure Senator Schacht would be happy to do deals on jobs in South Australia. We on this side of the chamber do not have the luxury of being able to persuade <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6972"> you, Senator Alston, that we can have this kind of disproportionate funding, which is just as necessary in North Queensland, Central Queensland, southern Queensland or any other part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, my first loyalty lies with Queensland. As a senator, I see the important thing about policy making in this country is that all areas of Australia are treated equitably: when it comes to jobs, all Telstra employees should have equal access to the retention of their jobs and, when it comes to service delivery, all Australians should have equal access to a sound communications system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Continuing with these concerns that have been raised within your own ranks, I am advised that, based on the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics population figures, the allocation to New South Wales of $37.4 million represents about $16 per rural residence&mdash;$16, Minister&mdash;and that Victoria's $28.5 million equates to around $22 per person living outside Melbourne. This compares with Tasmania's allocation, which represents more than $200 per non&hyphen;Hobart resident. This is not acceptable. It is not fair. I think that you should be re&hyphen;examining the terms under which you have been able to attract the votes of the two Independent senators. In the ACT, where $4 million is to benefit the estimated 400 people who live outside Canberra, the per head allocation is around $10,200. This is policy making on the run. There is no consistency in the manner in which the minister has guaranteed to give certain assurances to people in rural and regional Australia, because it is on an ad hoc basis. It depends purely on the necessity to do deals in order to get the legislation through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, I am extremely unhappy with your public comments to date. I can assure you that, throughout regional Queensland, people are asking why it is that the minister has chosen to offer a few jobs in Toowoomba. That is fine for Toowoomba, but what about the jobs in other parts of the state? I am sure that I am not the only person who is concerned from a Queensland perspective. I know that other honourable senators are very disturbed about the impact of your <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision making processes on jobs and the guarantee of services for all Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak again because I did not finish what I was saying last time. I ran out of time. There was a lot more to say on this notion of mandate. I heard Senator Alston say from his seat that my interpretation of mandate is unique in the world. And yet I have been able to put on the table the only measurements that have been taken in this country, in an election campaign, of an issue which was an important election campaign issue. All of them show that around 60 per cent of Australians do not like the sale of Telstra, do not like the way it was linked with the environment, and believe the Senate has a right to block it if it wishes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not regard that as some `unique in the world' interpretation. But let me add to it. I have heard so many members of the government claim that the Lindsay by&hyphen;election gave them another definitive measurement. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> poll of 5 November 1996. Again, the voters were asked exactly the question that we wanted to know the answer to. They were asked whether the Lindsay victory gave the government a mandate to sell part of Telstra.</PARA>

They were asked specifically. Having denied the reality of what the voters said when their views were measured all the way during the election campaign, we then had the assertion,  `Well, here's the definitive test.' They were asked specifically whether this gave the coalition the right&mdash;on the back of this Lindsay by&hyphen;election victory&mdash;to sell Telstra and whether this meant they were endorsing its right to sell Telstra. Fifty&hyphen;four per cent said no and only 33 per cent agreed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6973">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">  I love the way you twist this notion of mandate. I love the way you think that because you can assert and assert and assert what you think Lindsay meant, you are right. But here is another measurement: it is exactly the same as all those polls which measured the Telstra issue and its connection with the environment fund all the way through the election campaign. That does not happen very often. I do not think you can just dismiss out of hand what we read into how people voted on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would add is that three per cent of people who voted Liberal in the House of Representatives on 2 March also voted Democrat in the upper house&mdash;a huge number of those specifically because of views on Telstra. When you look at the balance between election to the House of Representatives and to the Senate, you will see that 56 per cent of those who were elected in the Senate had a public anti&hyphen;privatisation of Telstra position. Australians knew what they were doing. They wanted a change of government&mdash;there was no doubt about that. But they were not saying to this coalition government, `And you can do everything you want to do.' They were specially saying, `You can have government, but you're not going to sell Telstra.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was really interested in Senator Harradine's interjection when I asked him what his interpretation of mandate was. His explanation was that they went to the people on the issue of Telstra; therefore they have a mandate. I said to him, `They went to the people on the issue of industrial relations, too. But for some reason, Senator Harradine, you did not interpret that as mandate.' He interjected, `It was a matter of principle.' He might say that about the migrant waiting periods, too&mdash;a different principle but a matter of principle. For some reason, the issue of principle does not loom large with respect to Telstra and its future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might remind Senator Harradine, on the matter of principle, of some of the things he has said in the past about privatisation and public monopolies. A lot has been mentioned about the example of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Senator Harradine can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> probably recall when 30 per cent was sold. Then they said, `It is not private or public. We need another 19 per cent.' We remember the Treasurer and the government of the time telling us that it would remain majority owned by the Commonwealth. `Be assured,' they said. Senator Harradine voted for the first sale of 30 per cent and the second sale of 19 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But then in 1995 the Labor government decided to sell the rest of the Commonwealth Bank. Senator Harradine kicked up a bit of a stink. I was quite impressed by what he said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You might say that I have failed to recognise that the Commonwealth Bank is operating as just another bank. I do not fail to recognise that but I had hoped that whilst ever the Commonwealth was the majority shareholder in this enterprise the principles upon which the bank was founded by Andrew Fisher might have been enforced upon the bank and might have prevailed. It is obvious that the representatives of the major shareholder, the Commonwealth, have not pursued these principles for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor government of the time hoodwinked a great many people about what majority Commonwealth ownership means. It told everybody that it would make a difference. It did not. As we know, it had to be run under the law and in the best commercial interests of all shareholders. Then history says that the government&mdash;contrary to all assurances&mdash;said, `We are going to sell the rest.' And it happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of remembering a little bit of this history is that I do not want to see history repeated. I do not want to have the assurances of how you balance majority and minority shareholders' interests. We all know that if the sale proceeds, the floodgates will be opened&mdash;one per cent, two per cent, 33per cent. We know&mdash;I do not care what assurances are made&mdash;that that inevitably means that the rest of Telstra will be sold. That is why we resist this sale so strenuously. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is on the record as saying that it will be fully privatised within five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that I want to refer to, which has a history and evidence of selective application of principle and understanding of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6974"> mandate, is accountability. I believe that enormous accountability problems are created within AIDC by having a private minority shareholding. Perhaps Senator Harradine is aware that directors of public companies are required to act in the best interests of all shareholders and that, from a commercial point of view, you could probably argue that it makes very little difference, then, whether a company is 10 per cent or 90 per cent privately owned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will see. Perhaps Senator Harradine is aware that, even with 67 per cent public ownership, the government can have no influence on company policy, other than in relation to appointing or removing its directors. Perhaps Senator Harradine is aware that, given the enormous market power of Telstra&mdash;the natural monopoly powers that he has so often talked about&mdash;the company directors will be required by their fiduciary duties to use these to the fullest extent possible to maximise shareholder returns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDC instance was very instructive. The board of AIDC was 81 per cent government owned, and it awarded increases in salary of 200 per cent to its senior managers. We all asked the Labor government, `Why aren't you doing something about it?' The government said it opposed the decision but it went through. The government's appointed directors were not even present at board of directors meetings at various times. At other times, they were the government's own directors, the majority shareholders' directors. They were forced to leave board meetings because the board perceived a conflict of interest between their role of representing the government and their role of representing the shareholders, even though 81 per cent of the shareholders was the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is going to protect us from a repetition of this? That is why I say that a third is as bad as 100 per cent. You are not going to exercise that majority shareholder control that you ought to. I want the minister to be able to answer this in the committee stage: what guarantees can he give that this is not going to be repeated?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The accountability problems of AIDC have a likelihood of being repeated on a grand scale. There is no ministerial direction. We do not even know what responsibility this government is prepared to take on behalf of majority shareholders. Are they going to ask board members representing them to leave the room every time they think there is a perceived conflict between a government decision and a private decision that they do not want to face up to? Minister, it has happened before. Why should it not happen again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Harradine: are you absolutely, 100 per cent convinced that the regulatory regime that the government is putting in place is strong enough to restrain a privatised Telstra and strong enough to manage properly the competing interests of a complex identity that I call the `two-thirds, one-third board'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just finish by saying that we ought to be looking at the future here as well. We are not just talking about one-third; we are talking about the lot. We are talking about enormous economic power, just like the banks. We are talking about the possibility of a huge telco, a privatised telco with huge economic and political influence. You tell me how a government of the day is going to say no to timed local calls or to directory assistance charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston, you can shake your head all you like. You can put anything you like in legislation. It is only as good as the numbers. It is only as good as your political will to honour what is in that legislation and not come back here and seek to change it, like we have seen in media ownership policy in this country&mdash;a little bit of a representation here, a little bit of a private meeting there and we get a change in policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can assert to the Australian people all you like: `Oh, this is okay. We can protect against foreign ownership levels. We will not have timed local calls or directory assistance charges because we have guaranteed it in the legislation.' I do not think people have a great deal of confidence in the political will of any government to maintain those things indefinitely. Because you do not have ministerial direction in your model, then we are all the less entitled to have confidence, in my view.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6975">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been won and what has been lost out of this deal? What has been won? The passage, perhaps, of this bill. A couple of hundred jobs. Mind you, we cannot discount the jobs that are being lost through privatisation and downsizing, and we do not yet know whether these really are new jobs or whether they are jobs that are being shifted from some other section within those states or from other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is being forgone here is a future profit stream which in the past has been invested for the benefit of all Australians. We did not trade that off across Australia, saying that Tasmanians are more important in this instance than are Western Australians or South Australians. Also, what we are giving up in the long term is a guarantee of Australian ownership because you and I know that we do not have the pool of capital in this country to be able to afford for Australians to buy all of Telstra when you get around to privatising it. Senator Harradine cannot guarantee that the other 66&frac23; is going to be kept in public ownership either, because he may not have the balance of power. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I say that none of what we have in mind is designed to disadvantage anyone. It is designed to assist those who are currently disadvantaged either by location or by their lack of access to services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to that point in a minute. Let me give you a classic example. Every capital city except Hobart is looking at either having received the cable roll&hyphen;out already or receiving it in the not too distant future. There are no plans on the part of either of the major carriers or indeed the cable consortiums to roll out any broadband interactive services or cable television to Hobart or Tasmania. If that in itself does not indicate a very significant level of disadvantage when you are wanting your kids to get on to the Internet, when you are wanting to learn, when you are wanting to entertain yourself, I do not know what does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just another example of the extent to which Hobart, to use Senator O'Brien's term, is a mendicant state. There is a world of difference between Tasmania and Victoria or New South Wales, where you are close to capital cities which have world&hyphen;class telecommunications facilities, where there are enormous incentives by virtue of the population size for the carriers to keep on providing world best services. Those states and their citizens are immeasurably better off than those in a place like Tasmania where you are very lucky to even be able to make a phone call if you live in some parts of the west coast; even if you are in the capital city of that state you are very much a second&hyphen;class telecommunications citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about treating all Australians the same it is a wonderful principle. You normally berate us for using that terminology because you immediately go on to say that not all citizens are in fact equal and that we ought to recognise particular disadvantaged groups. We do that and we do it particularly having regard to the fact that there are some states where the bulk of the population reside outside the capital cities and who are therefore almost by definition unlikely to get <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access to those services. That disadvantages them significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not looking at any US gridlock type situation. This is I think a unique opportunity with the prospect of the proceeds of sale providing the funds that would not otherwise be there. That is why we went into the election campaign promising the best environmental package in history&mdash;but only because it could be afforded through the proceeds of the sale of Telstra. Otherwise you would be just plucking the money tree and the money is not there. You have heard us say ad nauseam that there was a budget deficit of the order of $8 billion. It turned out to be closer to $10 billion. The money simply was not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As much as you might wish to do it, you cannot simply act responsibly by contracting with the Australian people to spend another billion dollars when you do not have the money, when you are already in debt, when all the economic indicators suggest that you ought to be tightening your belt. It was a unique conjunction of events. It certainly is not US gridlock and in those circumstances it was reasonable for us to then explore further areas of particular disadvantage to see whether it might not be possible to address those in the same context; in other words, from the proceeds of the part sale of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come to another point. It is something that Senator Kernot has gone on about for quite a significant proportion of her contribution, that is the term `mandate'. Mandate usually gets a run when people say, `You didn't mention this before the election. You didn't tell us about this. You don't have a mandate.' That is how it is normally used. In other words, you have to put up a proposition. You have to argue for it before the election to have a mandate afterwards if you win.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS>, which has nine definitions of `mandate'. I am not about to use the one that says, `an order issued by the pope' much in all as I have great respect for what the pope has to say on many matters. There is one definition that particularly addresses politics. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the instruction as to policy given or supposed to be given by electors to a legislative body or to one or more of its members. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6977"> </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, by voters&mdash;not by respondents to polls. That is a fundamental difference. Otherwise you would have someone being elected to government and it would not matter which party it was. It would not matter who the individuals were. You would say, `Right. Just sit there for a moment. I will tell you what your mandate is. I will call up the computer. I will work out what all the majority positions were on any issue you like to name and that is your mandate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though we might have won the election, you say to me, `Look, here it is. The population is in favour of a return to capital punishment. They are sick to death of all that is going on. They want capital punishment.' We say, `We were opposed to that.' Senator Kernot says, `I'm sorry. The mandate means you have to reintroduce capital punishment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say, `We believe migrants have a role to play. They make a significant contribution to Australia.' You happen to dig up a research poll that shows that the majority of the population does not want any more migrants so you simply say to us, `Sorry, sport. You haven't got a mandate. You've got to do what you're told. The polls tell you.' We are not poll driven, Senator Kernot. If you think the role of a government is to simply do what the polls tell you to do then you have a very different concept of democracy from the one that I have.</PARA>

There is no inevitability about anything in this life or in this field. The fact is that unless you somehow think this parliament is about to change beyond recognition, and I do not think it is, it would mean that the Democrats or the Labor Party would have to change their position in order to repeal a provision of this very bill that is before us because this bill does not allow the parliament to go beyond the sale of one-third of Telstra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are doing it unrelated to privatisation. Senator Harradine is absolutely right. It is purely and simply designed to ensure that they are competitive. After 1 July once that regime comes into place&mdash;not the one that Senator Lundy thinks we are introducing; the regime that you committed us to and which you supported: in other words, full and open competition from next year&mdash;and once players with much lower cost structures than Telstra who do not have the work practices that you lot think are terrific come in, they will cream Telstra unless it is efficient. And we will not reap the benefits. What we want is a Telstra that can compete, that can undercut, that can deliver the goods, that can have lower prices and better quality of service. So that is what that is all about. It has nothing to do with privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was suggested that somehow the National Party was salivating at the prospect of funds for National Party electorates. The fact is that anyone who represents a country electorate would appreciate the very great importance of proposals that provide very significant benefits through the fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She said that Queensland has a large proportion of the population outside the capital cities and that we ought to be able to make special arrangements or take that into account. Well we have. Fifty&hyphen;four per cent of the state population is outside the capital cities. As a result, Queensland will get 23 per cent of the fund&mdash;$53.1 million. That is a very  substantial sum of money that recognises the fact that Queensland is the second most decentralised state in the federation. That is precisely why it gets that sum of money.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right. I just want to remind him, Senator Harradine. First of all, how was the break&hyphen;up of the $250 million calculated for the various states in raw terms before you looked at the percentage figures of the numbers of people living outside capital cities? Does the minister have a comment on the quite extraordinary results in terms of per capita? If you look at the ACT, with $4 million it ends up on a per capita basis of around $10,000 funding for those living outside the Canberra area. That is what is creating some concern. There is $4 million for the ACT, and our advice today is that there are only about 400 to 800 people living outside the urban area of Canberra. If you make that calculation, you end up with $10,000 per capita.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that was being raised by Senator Reynolds and other senators&mdash;which again I want to emphasise, Senator Alston&mdash;is the disparity in the per capita arrangement. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator West, for example, pointed out that in far western New South Wales the average, on your figures, will be $16 per resident. Yet those in the outback of New South Wales, just as do those in the outback of South Australia, have very difficult problems with telecommunications. We would like information on how the allocation within the state will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would also like to know&mdash;and I asked this when speaking on two occasions&mdash;how the money is to be spent. Will it be spent on subsidising charges, or will it be spent on providing equipment? Additionally, if it is to provide subsidies for charges, will that mean that everybody will get subsidies or will only some institutions, some type of local residents or particular business? You imply in your statement that educational institutions will be singled out. That is commendable but, if that is to occur, does that mean that other people will then miss out? So far, those things have not been answered by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are even questions associated with equipment. What sort of equipment will this fund be able to provide if over five years it is $250 million, or $50 million a year over five years, when in that same period&mdash;as I have remarked before&mdash;Telstra's capital works program alone for five years is $20 billion? It is an extraordinary comparison: Telstra, irrespective of the $250 million over five years you have collected, will spend $20 billion. In that $20 billion, are they themselves, irrespective of any pressure from you, going to cover and provide services to regional and rural Australia? I have to say that $20 billion over five years is much more attractive to look at than $250 million over five years or $50 million a year. I have raised the point before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think perhaps Senator Harradine did not realise what the minister may have done. I want an answer to this: what have you taken out of the business plan for the next three years, that was put before you in the last month or so, of the $250 million? Did you take something out, or were they already going to take something out of it? Then there is another question that I have raised: will the $50 million be paid overwhelmingly to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6980"> Telstra anyway because they are the ones who provide the service to rural areas; and is that amount to be added on to the universal service obligation so that they have to pay less on the cross-subsidy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are questions we just do not know the answers to. Before this bill comes out of the committee, even if it will take us a long number of hours&mdash;and I do not want to delay the Senate&mdash;these are reasonable questions to be answered.</PARA>

So the short answer to your question is that these moneys are over and above any capital expenditure program that Telstra might have in place over the next three years. Indeed, this is a five-year program; Telstra's is a three-year program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra will not be running the fund. Indeed, Telstra will not be automatically asked to <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> undertake any of this work. It will be a matter for identifying the most effective and cheapest means of delivering service. To the extent that that involves putting it out to tender, that will be a matter of decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So the communications department will run the fund?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mechanics of it will be announced later. But essentially it will be administered by the department; that is so. It certainly will not be the plaything of Telstra; it certainly will not be in substitution for any of its current or future planning proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not affect the universal service obligation. As you know, the USO is a separate exercise of providing the standard telephone service&mdash;in other words, a minimum level of services that are required to be provided on a reasonably accessible basis to all Australians. The cost of that is assessed annually, and Telstra currently is the nominated universal service provider. It is our intention to broaden the choice so that, once the service itself is identified, that could be put out to tender. So there could well be others, apart from Telstra, who would put it into effect. But the universal service fund will remain intact as it is now. I think it is clause 8CM which reaffirms current arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that a lot of people in the chamber seem to think that somehow this will all change with privatisation, the fact is&mdash;as I know Senator Schacht understands&mdash;the world changed back in 1991. Since that time the board has had an obligation to act in the best interests of all shareholders. It is required to act commercially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the extent that you want to superimpose social obligations, you do not do it by asking Telstra to somehow do the right thing; you do it by legislation and by imposing social obligations. In part, they are contained in the CSO arrangement of USOs. They are just as much contained in untimed local calls and all those other non-economic&mdash;if you could call them that&mdash;or non-profitable concepts that are enshrined in legislation, just as they are in many other countries around the world where telecommunications carriers have never been publicly owned. I would have thought that is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6981"> what gives the lie to the suggestion that somehow we are going down the American path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the Americans invented the USO. They have the fund; they have had it for years. They have the levy; we have simply mirrored it; and they have had it against the background of fully privately&hyphen;owned telecommunications companies. They have been able to live with it for all those years. We would live with it simply because, if for no other reason, the public would not have it any other way&mdash;and we would not either because we think that it is necessary to ensure a continuation of that arrangement. Carriers will play by the rules of the game. If they can continue to make decent profits, they will simply accept that the government sets the legislative environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the priorities of the fund are concerned, it is an infrastructure fund. So we are prepared to commit $250 million to create a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to improve the quality of telecommunication services and to enhance employment opportunities in regional areas. The fund will directly improve the quality of telecommunications infrastructure in rural and regional areas, including the expansion of mobile phone coverage. It will create employment opportunities in areas of high rural unemployment by assisting the establishment of customer call centres. It will assist community managed profit and non-profit communications projects in regional areas and establish additional Internet points of presence in regional areas to reduce or eliminate the STD charges associated with Internet access. In other words, these are all matters that will be available to be pursued via the fund mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be people presumably all around Australia who will have their own priorities and who will therefore make applications to the fund. It will be a matter of judgment as to what those priorities ought to be. But they can cover a whole range of infrastructure proposals that would not otherwise be available in rural and remote areas. That is why this is such an important initiative, because particularly in places like Tasmania you would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whistling dixie for years to come. The USO would not deliver the goods because the USO simply delivers the standard telephone service. If you want to go over and above that, then as far as Tasmania is concerned there will be $58 million available to address those special needs. Because Tasmania has a large proportion of its population outside the capital city, it is clearly a deserving case and it therefore will have a significant sum of money available to address those telecommunications needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I have dealt with this issue of mandates. Let me make it perfectly clear that, in the absence of legislation as before this chamber, none of these moneys would be available. So, when it is suggested by some that this is at the expense of Australian workers, it is in fact going to be very much to the advantage of those people in regional areas who would not otherwise have access to these services at all. Of course, inevitably there will be very significant employment created by those sorts of projects. So it has a double benefit to rural areas. It provides access to services that would not otherwise be available and it delivers very significant job creation opportunities. None of those would be there in the absence of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no question of whether or not Australian workers are going to benefit or that somehow they are going to suffer, as was suggested. The fact is that those in areas where there is particular disadvantage will be significant winners and it will not be at the expense of anyone. It will be funded from the proceeds of that sale of one-third of Telstra. So those who are prepared to buy the shares will be making funds available out of their own pockets. They choose to invest. They will be putting the money on the table and part of that money will then be available to provide these benefits. I do not think I need to say any more about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay said that there was no guarantee the cross-subsidies will remain. As I have said time and again, no-one on our side of the chamber is proposing to dismantle universal service obligations. I would be very surprised if anyone in this chamber is proposing to. They work very well in other countries <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6982"> where they have fully privatised regimes. It was said that subsidies will disappear because of the vagaries of the market, as happened in the US. This is just mythology; it simply is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of timed local calls was raised. Again, the legislation does not allow you to remove the option of an untimed local call. In fact we are extending that to businesses in the telecommunications package. Once again, no-one has ever argued that you should not have the option of a timed local call if you want it. But you have the right to retain an untimed local call, and that will be there in legislation. Who would want to repeal it? Say Telstra, or Optus or anyone else, thought that they would love to have it repealed. I suppose they all have their wish list, but who is going to accede to that? It would not stand the light of day. So there is absolutely no reason for suggesting that a partial privatisation puts these things at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney asked about consumer protection. The fact is that the legislation does provide for the ability to recover damages for non-compliance with performance standards. But that is designed to act as a last resort. In other words, we would be very disappointed, and we would probably take corrective action to deal with it, if we found the carriers thumbing their noses at consumers and saying, `Sure, we're supposed to connect you within three days; but it's only going to cost us X dollars, so we'll cough up the money. Better still, take us to court and we'll put you through your hoops.' We would not take a favourable view of that. If it does prove costly or complex to enforce your rights, then I would certainly be very interested in improving the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not correct to say that you can recover the funds only by way of a credit or otherwise. Clause 87E does provide for a recovery of money by way of judgment, but it also allows the additional option of discharging that liability by credit or other arrangements. So you have all of the choices on the table&mdash;subclause 87F(4). Senator Cooney also asked what would happen if, despite the legislation, those issuing the prospectus and, I presume, Telstra and others colluded in what would be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a clear act of illegality. The answer is that anyone who bought shares in a company on that basis would do so at their peril. Any agreement that they entered into would be void against public policy, and ultimately, of course, there is the ability to obtain an injunction to restrain the breach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just not real life. What you are really suggesting is that one of Australia's largest companies is going to flout the will of the parliament&mdash;it is going to act illegally. I do not think anyone would tolerate that for very long, and I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams why any company would want to even attempt to do that. No broker, no investment house and no mercantile institution would want a bar of that sort of conduct. They would all be very much at risk of being sued. They would have all sorts of legal problems. As I say, it is just not real life. If that is the greatest of Senator Cooney's concerns, I can assure him that it is simply not going to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a suggestion that New South Wales is not getting a fair deal. I simply say that, if New South Wales has 38 per cent of its population outside rural areas, it therefore gets 16.24 per cent on a pro rata basis and it gets $37.4 million. That is a very good deal that it would not otherwise get. It is, I think it is also fair to say, one of the more prosperous states of the federation, if not the most prosperous. In its capital city there are very many people who can afford to be part of a state government regime that addresses issues outside the capital cities. I do not think the same could be said of Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were very critical of it, and it became a matter of considerable controversy. But you are saying to us that you are setting up a fund to be administered almost in the same way&mdash;no detail, no advisory body. I thought you would have suggested to us that at the very least there would be an advisory body made up of people with the appropriate expertise and experience in telecommunications and from regional Australia to look at the applications each year to allocate funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what you have partially set up as far as the Natural Heritage Trust is concerned, although last week you did reject the committee's recommendation that a specialist advisory board be set up to advise the two ministers on how the funds should be spent in that area. I put it to you, Minister, that it would not be unreasonable for us to get information in the next 24 hours of a similar structure. Otherwise, this is just a wide&hyphen;open slush fund. You will give a nudge and a wink and a nod to the head of your department or to some officer in DOCA, who will have a long list&mdash;that will probably stack up about a foot high&mdash;of applications each year for the $250 million broken down into states, and away it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that Senators Harradine and Colston would be a bit further up the queue than the rest of us, because they were the ones who did the deal to get it done. It is extraordinary that since your announcement last Thursday we have had no further detail on how this fund is going to be structured and administered. I might talk to my colleagues overnight and tomorrow morning and we may want to move an amendment to the bill to actually put in a bit of structure. This is not going to be a travelling magic pudding slush fund for you or somebody else to hand around.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Magic Pudding</EMPHASIS> ; it never seems to disappear. You can eat as much as you like and then have a bit more. That is how the government is treating the sale of Telstra: it is a magic pudding to provide funds. By the time we come back to this bill tomorrow, the opposition would like more detail&mdash;decent detail&mdash;on how this is going to be administered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would also appreciate information on how you arrived at the figure of $250 million. That seems like a very round neat figure, give or take a bit here and there. It was as if you threw a dart and it landed on $250 million and then you worked backwards and divvyed it up amongst the states. You worked out a formula that meant Tasmania in one way or the other could be justified in getting a very large amount. Was the figure set after discussions with Telstra or was it set after discussions with your own department or any other advisory body in telecommunications? Why was it not made $500 million? No&hyphen;one is going to convince me that $250 million over five years is going to bring all rural telecommunication services up to the same standard as for cities. That is just preposterous! And Telstra is spending in the same period $20 billion. It is just a drop in the ocean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I want to ask about Tasmania. Telstra and Optus have no roll&hyphen;out plans for Tasmania. I know Senator Harradine has raised this issue publicly before. It is one of his concerns. Will the $58 million allocated for Tasmania be used to subsidise Telstra or Optus in rolling out a broadband cable, because it seems that they have no plan to do so at the moment? If that is the case, will that be eligible for USO or is it just going to be a straight subsidy to those two carriers or to any carrier? Does that guarantee that, by the middle of the next decade, Tasmania will have the same level of access to broadband <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6985"> services as Sydney or Melbourne? Well, of course it won't! If you put the whole $58 million into one joint cable, it would not provide broadband services to Hobart and Launceston, let alone to the rest of Tasmania, compared with the cable now going out in Sydney and Melbourne, irrespective of the other argument that people do not like the cable hanging on poles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a question that we would like answered: can the money be used anywhere, not only in Hobart or Tasmania? You say, `We are going to pay the carrier to do this.' Why don't you put it on the carrier to do it in the USO? In regard to the consideration of the post&hyphen;1997 regulatory model, there are already recommendations to upgrade what the USO should be, away from being the standard telephone handset. Our Telstra committee recommended to you in July or August that it be 64 kilobytes per second of capacity as a minimum as a universal service obligation. Isn't that a relevant thing that this money could be used for? Or is that going to happen anyway? Or does it mean that, no matter what you give Tasmania, it will not achieve what Senator Harradine claims he wants and that is that Tasmania not be the `arse end' of the Victoria Telstra regional area?</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On television, you did, Senator&mdash;not actually in the chamber. I am a bit more robust, I suppose, about where I use the words. I have to say that I was rather startled, Senator Harradine, that a gentleman of your standing used the phrase. But I thought it was effectively put. Again, Minister, these are very serious questions about how that money is going to be used&mdash;the $58 million for Tasmania. It will not give Tasmania equality in broadband services or as up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date telecommunications as Sydney or Melbourne. It just will not happen out of $58 million over five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then you talked about the priorities of the fund. You said that it would help employment in regional areas. Is this employment in telecommunications or employment generally? If it is employment in telecommunications, does this mean that you will subsidise Telstra, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Optus and the other carrier to establish work depots or whatever they may be, or is the money going to be used to retrain displaced telecommunications workers in the regional areas? What happens when the money runs out and they still do not have a job? There is no answer to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You mentioned&mdash;I think I have this right from my quick notes&mdash;that the money will be used to create customer call centres for Telstra. Is this not a subsidy to Telstra that you are paying them? Are you are directing them or have you lent on them in the business plan in one form or another? I hope I got the word correct, but in those remarks about the infrastructure fund, you said you would create customer call centres for Telstra, or customer call centres for a carrier. Again, how do you achieve that? Do you ask Telstra, Optus, Vodafone or anybody else to make an application and say, `Well, here's a way we can get a quick quid for ourselves; we'll use it to establish one of these centres'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are any of these centres that you have mentioned&mdash;Senator Harradine got one off you for Tasmania and Senator Colston has one in Queensland in Toowoomba&mdash;being funded or subsidised out of this fund for Telstra to go and put those operating centres in Launceston, Burnie, Hobart and Toowoomba? Is that out of the $250 million or have you lent on Telstra or Optus to go and do it? If they are doing that, was that actually an official direction from yourself? Did you lean on them and suggest that if they did not play ball, you might sack another director or something? What level of communication did you have with Telstra to make that decision that these particular places were established?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me an extraordinary activity for you to be encouraging Telstra to have a particular number of centres at the operational level. We do not know whether you have bribed them by giving them access to the $250 million, whether you have threatened them in another way or whether they have suddenly fronted up to you and said, `Lo and behold, Minister; hallelujah, you are saved. After getting the figures wrong for employment in Tasmania in the last month or so, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6986"> here we have something for you; it is Burnie, Launceston, Hobart and Toowoomba.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked in my first remarks whether any of these jobs are being transferred from any other regional centre&mdash;there was an implication in your remarks that they were new extra jobs&mdash;or whether they are being transferred from somewhere else. If they are being transferred from somewhere else, where from? Secondly, I asked: how long do they last for? You keep telling all of us that telecommunications is changing so rapidly with technology. How can you guarantee that in two years time those jobs are still going to be there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What guarantee have you given Senator Harradine and Senator Colston about these jobs? How long will they last for? Once this bill is through&mdash;there is nothing written in the legislation about the deal with Senator Harradine and Senator Colston&mdash;they do not have a leg to stand on. There is nothing they can do to ensure that the deal stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because there is no legislation, each year in the appropriation you can change this figure of $250 million and reduce it to $150 million. You can say that it is all going to go to Western Australia next year&mdash;they have a bad election coming up&mdash;or it is all going to go to Queensland and your old mate Borbidge. You can change this fund any time you like each year in the budget because there is nothing in the legislation to say how the money must be spent and in what proportion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just wonder what the deal is. How did you convince Senator Harradine&mdash;who, in my view, has been so loose and friendly towards you&mdash;to let this money be in a pot that can be changed each year in the appropriation because there is no legislation? There is not even a guarantee apparently; it is a one line in the appropriation. It is administered by you and your department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So next year or the year after the magic pudding shifts around a bit further. It may be helping out the National Party government in Queensland or your mate Jeff Kennett in Victoria. How do you give a guarantee to Senator Colston and Senator Harradine that for the next five years this money, as laid out here, will stay the way it is if it is not going to be in legislation? There is no way you can <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> guarantee it. You might give it to them personally but you have just indicated that you may not be a minister in six years time. That is another range of questions. I hope I can get a few more answers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it is suggested that we are not going to bring all regional services up to the cities' services, that is the very point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem you face is that you know that the current cable operators are committed to rolling out every other capital city and that they are not committed to Hobart.

They will operate commercially, as they have been required to do ever since 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whether it is spending $2 billion a year, $4 billion a year or whatever, it will not necessarily deliver the sorts of social goods and social outcomes that we might think are important. That is precisely the Hobart and Tasmania problem. They are out there spending $3 billion or $4 billion each over the next few years and they do not have Tasmania in their plans. So how do you address that disadvantage? You do it via a fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fund is not a substitute for the universal service obligation. That is designed to ensure that moneys are available to deliver minimum services; in other words, the standard telephone service. You can argue that that can be upgraded in various ways. I think it can be upgraded in terms of quality, but I will be getting a report on 20 December that will give us some specialist advice on the issue. But it will not go to providing such things as ISDN on a mandatory minimum basis. That is your 64 kilobits per second. That is the ISDN approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We take the view that that ought to be demand driven and that exchanges ought to be ISDN capable. If you want it and if you <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are prepared to pay for it, you can have it. But it should not be mandatorily available to every citizen. I think it was Senator O'Brien who said, `Why would people want ISDN services?' He may well be quite right, but he proved the point that you simply would not want to build it into the standard telephone service and impose obligations of many millions of dollars, perhaps quite unnecessarily if the demand is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the concept of the universal service obligation is to do with a standard telephone service as a bare minimum. It has nothing to with providing funds over and above the USO, over and above the carriers commercial cap ex plans to ensure that a range of other services are available that might not otherwise be there. So you provide the infrastructure to develop those services. The matters I mentioned earlier were simply examples of the ways in which those sorts of services might be selected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about customer call centres, we are not necessarily talking about telecommunications carriers at all&mdash;let alone Telstra or Optus. In other words, Ansett has recently established a customer call centre.</PARA>

If they think that having a commercial call centre for an insurance company or a bank or any other commercial institution is their top priority in telecommunications infrastructure, so be it. These are all choices that will be made, in the first instance, by the applicants and, ultimately, by the fund administrators in determining how those moneys ought to be spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let's make it crystal clear. I have no interest, and nor do any of my political colleagues, in somehow being involved in the day-to-day administration of the fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me be crystal clear. It has nothing to do with the $250 million. That will be available quite separately, on application, administered at arms length to ensure that people in regional Australia get services and infrastructure that they would not otherwise be likely to get. They are not going to be out there wanting to subsidise Telstra to do something. That would just encourage Telstra not to do certain things and then to dip into the fund. That is not our intention, and I would not have thought it would be the intention of people applying for these funds. They will be identifying services that they do not expect would be otherwise available on a commercial basis. They will be looking to have new infrastructure put in place in those regional areas to provide the telecommunications benefit and, ancillary to that, the jobs that flow from putting those services in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You ask: how long will the jobs last? It is in the context of Telstra's current three-year corporate plan that the decisions it has announced are in place.

It was not clear whether they were in the old business plan, but then they were in the business plan for the next three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So at some stage or other it seems quite clear that either the minister or his advisers have had access to the business plan. What they have done is found within that business plan that there were three centres. Whether someone in Telstra read the tea-leaves pretty well over the last couple of months and said, `Gee, we might be able to help the minister out here by helping him with his negotiations with the two critical votes in the chamber. Here is something for Toowoomba that Senator Colston might be interested in. Here is something for Burnie, here is something for Hobart or Launceston&mdash;help them out.' They may have put it in.

At best, you might have actually indirectly encouraged a Telstra official to put them in the business plan over the last couple of months or the minister has been able to use his influence on your behalf or&mdash;the other way round&mdash;there was no influence; they were already there and you have been given something as a deal that was already going to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

You set it on the road to inevitable full privatisation for something that was going to happen in Tasmania anyway. If that is not what was going to happen, the minister has contradicted himself already by saying, `I didn't have any influence over the business plan.'  If he didn't have any influence over it, you were going to get it anyway. If you did have influence over it, the minister has interfered in the business plan and put pressure on Telstra.

But, Minister, I have to say that, every time you give us more information, what you are doing here becomes more unsatisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You said in your remarks that this bill does not have an amendment in it establishing the trust fund for the telecommunications infrastructure fund. But at least on the other side in environment there is a fund. There is another separate piece of legislation. At the very least one would have thought you would now be giving notice to us that you would bring in, under legislation, the equivalent of the Heritage Trust Fund. Your government has trumpeted about that for the last nine months. How the money would be disbursed is on the list to be debated this week in the Senate. There is a structure about how that money would be disbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why haven't you at least given us an indication that you will parallel that structure for the Natural Heritage Trust Fund with a national infrastructure fund? No, not this minister. He wants to get, by one way or the other, his hot little hands on the $250 million to be disbursed at his desire, at his initiative&mdash;wink, nudge, nod&mdash;down to someone in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the department. He can't even give us an indication about who the administrator will be. It is supposed to be some mythical person who will not in any way be susceptible to influence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are you trying to tell us that, once this fund is established, every National Party member and every Liberal member in a rural area of Australia will not be out there telling their local council or their local regional development board, `Here's the slush fund. I can talk to Richard tomorrow. I'll give him a ring. We'll put our submission in. I'll give him a bit of a kick along in the communications committee room and we'll get it?' If anyone suggests to us that that won't happen, that there will not be that lobbying by members of parliament, they are deluding themselves. The minister has had more than enough strife with his own party's communications committee over cabling issues. They are running all over him. He has had to change his plans three times. Finally, the Prime Minister had to come in and go over the top of him again.</PARA>

Does he suggest to us that there is not going to be consistent lobbying once his backbench finds out that there is a fund of $250 million  which is separate from legislation, has no legislative independence and is administered by some mythical administrator responsible to the minister? As I said before, he hasn't answered the question. Each year the money from this fund can be shifted around between the states. The only way you can stop that, Minister, is to put it in legislation; put it in legislation so that the parliament can keep you honest. That is what you have got to do to stop any suggestion that, from year to year, you will change the relativities to different states to suit a political purpose.

We still do not know, after several hours of debate, the details of the arrangement between Senator Harradine, Senator Colston and this government. It is a disgraceful arrangement. Of course the people of Australia now have every right to say, `This is a dirty sneaky deal.' There is no evidence to the contrary. There is no transparency about it. It has been a buy off.

<STATE> (New South Wales)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.00 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to address the new funding arrangements for women's groups recently announced by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Newman). There appears to be a number of misconceptions concerning this funding, which is a great pity. These initiatives represent real and palpable gains for women. I believe the initiatives are very good news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that women and women's groups do not fall for misleading information and half&hyphen;truths about what these arrangements entail. In essence, what is proposed is that, firstly, funding of up to $50,000 will be made available for core groups of national non-government women's organisations. The criteria for selection will be announced in the new year. Applications will be called for in March and will be processed, to be taken up on 1 July 1997. Groups receiving core funding will have certainty and continuity, and the drip&hyphen;feed will be over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the national agenda for women's grants program&mdash;currently funding only 22 groups which share $1 million&mdash;will cease at the end of the month and be replaced next financial year by a different approach. The <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> majority of women's organisations will be encouraged to apply to individual departments, to statutory bodies and to any other government departments which reflect the area of interest to the particular group. For example, women's health groups would apply to the department of health instead of to the grants program; women's sporting groups would apply to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories; and Australian women in agriculture would apply to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we can recognise the value the grants program had in the past in identifying areas of need for women, the time has come when women's issues no longer occupy special interest areas. They no longer are areas of special need, niche areas or of marginal relevance. Women's issues are mainstream. Women's issues are entitled to access the whole gamut of possible assistance in a relevant portfolio area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A major component of the shift in approach&mdash;one that has been either deliberately misrepresented or carelessly overlooked; I do not know which&mdash;is the transitional arrangements&mdash;namely, the government will be extending interim funding to women's organisations currently in receipt of operational support grants until the new arrangements commence from July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say this slowly, and I hope it sinks in: interim funding will be available for six months from 1 January 1997 to 30 June 1997. There is no suggestion of these groups being cut off at the knees. Claims that women's groups will have to fight to survive till next March is fanciful nonsense. In fact, they are more likely to survive as a recognised, legitimate mainstream provider of services for women dealing with ordinary portfolios, and portfolios that are aware of and respond to women's needs, than they are if they lurch from year to year jostling and fighting for a slice of a centrally administered and limited fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mainstreaming of funding for women's groups has other advantages. It heightens awareness of women's issues across portfolios. It provides Australian women with <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6993"> more points of contact between federal governments and women's groups. It has the potential to deliver more money in a more focused and targeted way from more sources than if administered from a central pool. It provides a better opportunity to reflect the broad impact of women's issues across government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The initiatives also include opening up for women the channels of communication with the federal government. The minister has announced a range of special measures to assist in this way. The new consultative measures that have been announced include an annual two&hyphen;day meeting of national women's groups with the minister, to be known as the Australian women's round table. That two&hyphen;day dialogue will take place in Parliament House on 26 and 27 August next year. Of course, it will deal with a vast number of issues of critical relevance to women, including domestic violence, censorship, balancing paid work and family responsibilities and dealing with women in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also publish an annual report of the achievements of national women's groups. This is something that is very important. It will promote the valuable work which national women's organisations are doing to raise the status of Australian women. You just have to think for a moment of the sorts of groups that will be affected&mdash;nursing mothers, older women, sportswomen, business women, rural women, women from a culturally diverse background, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women in education and women in a myriad of other areas of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have their interests represented in a number of non-government organisations at present. In fact, there are currently about 65 national women's NGOs in Australia. Rarely is the work of these groups&mdash;important though it is&mdash;recognised beyond their immediate constituency. To highlight the work of these groups, the government will compile and publish the annual report of the achievements of national non-government women's organisations. It will provide a very useful window to the work community organisations <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are doing in order to help improve the quality of life for Australian women in almost all sectors of our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another initiative is the operation of a communications network between non-government women's organisations, which will be paid for by government and selected by competitive tender. This initiative is to recognise that women's organisations also play a productive role in promoting interest and debate on important issues. The federal government will shortly call for tenders for the operation of a communication network to provide information electronically to national non-government women's organisations. The government will look to putting together a communications package to help facilitate dialogue between women's groups on a number of important issues and to let women share properly their information, ideas, contacts and experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet another initiative is the establishment by the minister of an advisory group, comprising a parliamentary representative from each state and territory, to provide feedback to the minister on Commonwealth issues affecting women in their respective states. I am very proud to say that I am the New South Wales representative on that advisory group. Having represented women's interests for some 20 years, I am not about to sell them down the river. This advisory group will be very important to facilitate ideas, to facilitate contact and to be a conduit for women to be able to voice their concerns and to have a say in policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another initiative is the release of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting the message through</EMPHASIS>, an information booklet aimed at assisting women's organisations. It is a step in an effort to assist women to gain greater access to the parliament and the parliamentary committee system. An interesting thing about this booklet is its totally non-partisan nature. Every single woman in parliament, irrespective of whether she is an Independent, from the Labor Party, a Green or  <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6994"> from the Liberal Party, is listed in this booklet. It is an even-handed attempt to allow the public to access women in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These initiatives are ones to which the women of Australia ought to look forward. The initiatives include opening up channels of communication in a way that has never quite been done before. They have allowed women to be regarded as mainstream. Women no longer have to be regarded as just marginal, just off in the Office of the Status of Women. Women will now be able to access portfolios just like any other relevant group in the community requiring assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women have no need to have any great concerns with this government. The initiatives taken and announced a couple of days ago will ensure not only that the needs and interests of women are adequately heard and adequately represented but also that there will be appropriate responses to these needs through this range of initiatives. Certainly, women no longer need be concerned that their funding will just be cut off, because the interim funding very clearly is to tide the organisations over. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 October 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget measure to limit psychiatric services to 50 sessions per year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Was psychoanalysis deemed by the Minister to be a rort, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  on 11 September 1996, contrary to the views of expert medical opinion; if so, on what grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) What is the legal basis by which the Minister can force doctors to provide treatments that are only subject to payment through the Commonwealth Medical Benefits Schedule (CMBS).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) What is the legal basis by which the Minister can discriminate between different groups of psychiatric patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) If doctors cannot provide necessary treatment (for example, psychoanalytic treatment for patients with chronic symptoms associated with developmental personality abnormalities) under Medicare, what are they to advise patients to do, given that general practitioners and public sector psychiatry cannot or do not provide this treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) Can the Minister confirm whether the patient, quoted in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  on 11 September 1996, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7009"> who claimed 747 consultations with a psychiatrist in a year was not submitting forged claims to Medicare; (b) is it the case that this is not psychoanalysis which has 150 to 250 consultations per year; (c) has the Minister investigated the case; (d) can the Minister confirm that this is a real case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) If a patient sees psychiatrist A for 50 sessions and then consults psychiatrist B without telling him or her about A, can doctor B be charged with giving false CMBS item numbers; and (b) what are the second doctor's professional and legal responsibilities to patients who have lied in this way during their assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Why is it that individual psychoanalytic treatment is limited to 50 sessions, but group analysis and family therapy are exempted, given that the latter is still drawn from psychoanalysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Is the Minister aware that psychiatrist psychoanalysts have undergone a further 4 to 8 years of formal clinical and theoretical training to master psychoanalysis at considerable expense and at low incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9)(a) Is the Minister aware that Appendix I of the McKay report states that the most unsatisfactory type of psychiatric service to consumers is the short session super clinic psychiatry which the 50 session limit will promote; and (b) how can the Government promote services deemed unsatisfactory by clients. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) Why is intensive psychiatric treatment of some patients being targeted when they are the most disadvantaged and other treatments have perhaps not worked for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) Has the Government evaluated the impact of the 50 session limit to an average psychoanalytic practice; if so, what is the average impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12)(a) Does the Minister support a situation where only rich ill people will be able to pay for psychiatric services; and (b) does the Government support the mass servicing of individual clients in an inadequate fashion.</PARA></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Psychoanalysis itself is not considered to be a rort, but the unlimited coverage under Medicare can lead to rorts and excessive numbers of services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The Commonwealth has no control over the services doctors provide. Doctors are free to provide services which are not included in the Medicare Benefits Schedule&mdash;and do so (eg cosmetic surgery), however there are no Medicare benefits payable for these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) There is no discrimination between different groups of psychiatric patients. The measures apply across all the psychiatric attendance items and not just to particular illnesses or diseases or to particular patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Psychiatrists will be able to continue to provide as many out&hyphen;of&hyphen;hospital psychiatric consultations as they consider to be clinically necessary, only the Medicare rebate will be reduced for the fifty&hyphen;first and any additional consultations in a twelve month period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) There is no reason to believe that forged claims are being submitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The type of treatment provided during the consultation is not known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Yes. The case has been investigated by the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Yes. The case is a real case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Doctors will not be charged for inadvertently billing patients under the wrong item numbers, however the level of benefit paid to the patient will be adjusted accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The Government does not have any significant concerns regarding access to these services or regarding the pattern of usage of the Group therapy items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The Minister is aware that psychiatric psychoanalysts undergo additional post&hyphen;graduate training in the chosen field, as do many other practitioners. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7010"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) It is hard to envision that 50 services, usually between 45 and 75 minutes in length, a year (which is the pattern for many patients) constitutes "short session super clinic psychiatry".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) The intensive psychiatric treatment of certain patients is not being targeted:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the measures apply across all the psychiatric attendance items and not just to particular illnesses or diseases or to particular patients;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> there is no restriction on the number of out&hyphen;of&hyphen;hospital psychiatric consultations for which Medicare benefits are payable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) The Government has not analysed the impact of the measure on particular psychiatric practices. The impact will depend on factors such as their current billing practices and whether practitioners reduce their fees. However it is expected, following the introduction of a price signal, practitioners and patients will review their treatment plans and that the price signal will provide a greater incentive for private psychiatrists to widen their lists to more patients, thereby increasing access to private psychiatric services to new patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12)(a) No. However as it stands, the majority of patients currently having over 50 out&hyphen;of&hyphen;hospital consultations in a year are clustered in just the seven electorates around the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne and North Eastern suburbs of Sydney. These 7 electorates have a median income of $41,126 or 20% above the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the other end of the spectrum, there are 22 electorates with no patients having more than 50 out&hyphen;of&hyphen;hospital psychiatric consultations a year. These 22 electorates have a median income of $27,913, or 19% below the national average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, under the system as it exists, people from wealthy electorates already appear to have disproportionate access to these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agri-Food Council was the food industry consultative body of the former government. Further, the Minister's Department is unaware of any contract or agreement between the Agri-Food Council, the Meat Industry Council and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for funding a trial of company meat inspection. However, under the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism's Food Quality Program, the Meat Industry Council was successful in a grant application which led to an agreement between the Department and the Meat Industry Council for a Food Quality Project known colloquially as MIC2 or the MIC2 Project.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 4 November 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) With reference to the Minister's media release, dated 21 October 1996, in which it was stated that there are a small number of rural phone users, estimated at less than 20,000, who currently receive an Analogue Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) but would not necessarily be within the radius of Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) coverage:  where are these rural phone users located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Under proposed arrangements for analogue mobile phaseout, will these rural phone users be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7011"> able to use their analogue handsets when they travel to the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Has advice been obtained on the legal implications of retaining the AMPS spectrum in specified rural areas; if so, what are the legal implications.</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) has advised that the carriers conducted joint studies to quantify the extent of the coverage deficiency. Telstra has advised that the estimate of 20,000 users who may not be covered by GSM when AMPS ceases is derived from broad knowledge of the extra coverage area of AMPS, the population density, and the take&hyphen;up (as a proportion of the total population) of the cellular service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra is currently working with the Spectrum Management Agency, on a case by case basis, to identify the particular locations of these rural phone users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Rural phone users would not be able to use their analogue handsets when travelling to the city after 1 January 2000. AMPS spectrum will only be retained in specified rural areas if a review in 1999 of rural planned services areas identifies areas that do not have mobile coverage from an alternative technology which is reasonably equivalent to AMPS coverage. The analogue service will be closed down in all other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) I have obtained advice on the legal implications of retaining the AMPS operation in specified rural areas and those implications are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMPS phaseout policy is implemented through Optus' and Vodafone's Public Mobile licences which prohibit them from installing or operating an AMPS network; and a condition under the Telecommunications Act 1991, (Public Mobile Licence) Declaration (No. 1) of 1992 stating that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> no licensee would be permitted to install or operate an AMPS network after 1 January 2000, with the limited exception when:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Minister and all mobile carriers agree in writing, or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the Minister agrees in writing after consultation with each mobile carriers, and determines that the installation or operation of the AMPS network will not erode unduly the practical value of a mobile carrier's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any retention of spectrum in specific rural areas would operate as a qualification to withdrawal of the last 2 x 5 MHz of spectrum on 31 December 1999. Any continued operation of an AMPS network would need to be in accordance with the provisions of Declaration 1/1992 cited above. The three carriers have given in principle consent to this aspect of the AMPS phaseout, and are discussing formalisation of this agreement. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
