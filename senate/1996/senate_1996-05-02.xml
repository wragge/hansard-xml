This is a moment of opportunity for us as a Senate to put forward a proposal to advance the cause of public information in relation to the uranium debate. There is an opportunity at the moment, in the existing committee structure, to use the Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste, although it has officially dissolved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government has already made an announcement about its decision to open up uranium mining. Therefore, the time is right to bring information together for the public interest and for public debate. There are limitations on public input via the environmental impact statements. They relate to what is and what is not available to be mentioned on an environmental impact statement. What is not available to be used is the history of the last 20 years within the industry. It is therefore well overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fox inquiry, which was not a parliamentary inquiry, was held nearly 20 years ago. It may have been excellent for the time but it was limited.

<PARA>Whilst I mentioned that there was an excellent inquiry around 20 years ago, namely the Fox inquiry, and that there is to be an environmental impact statement on the first cab off the rank in relation to uranium mining&mdash;the Kakadu mining proposal&mdash;there is a limitation in both the process used and breadth of the coverage of such inquiries. The Fox inquiry originally looked at the Alligator Rivers region. Two reports resulted. They looked carefully at the implications of uranium mining as they were seen at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth mentioning that the proposals for the Office of the Supervising Scientist were, contrary to many people's belief, never set up to protect the environment from radioactive waste. The Office of the Supervising Scientist, from reading about that inquiry, was there to monitor the dispersal of radioactive waste <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="197"> from uranium mining at a regulated pace. That is, it was always assumed that there would be radio toxins leaking into the environment. The assumption that radio toxins in the environment were safe was the basis of that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, whilst some people would argue, and have argued in the past, that the very position of the Office of the Supervising Scientist is a safeguard of the health of, and the environment for, workers and the community, it is very clear right from the very beginning that it was never set up to be a safeguard for the community from the radio toxins in air and water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it: in Western Australia there is a list of over 14 proposed or prospective uranium mines and I believe in other states there would be a considerable list to add to that. The breadth of an environmental impact statement for any new proposal, whether it is Kakadu or any other proposed uranium mine in Australia&mdash;which, of course, is a useful thing to do&mdash;has limitations because each environmental impact statement can only look at the proposal as put forward by the proponent. So if the proponent says, `We will maintain the highest levels of environmental safety and standards,' then it is a bit like a court. You cannot necessarily then go back and say, `Well, in the past people have said similar things and they just have not been able to come up to scratch,' or, `This is the way it has worked over history, these are the licensed conditions under which other mines have operated and this has been the outcome.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other issues involved in relation to uranium mining, of course. We know the concern within the Australian community in relation to French nuclear testing. We know that there were statements made by the French government at the time that Australia was being naive to hide behind assurances in relation to the security arrangements for the nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty in relation to the use of Australian uranium. That is, they admitted to us publicly&mdash;as have Australian government officials in inquiries&mdash;that there is no way of guaranteeing that Australian uranium is not used in the nuclear weapon cycle.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are security implications not just for our present uranium exports but for any increase that may be based on the current increase in price in uranium oxide ore. The reason is that if people are seeking markets there is an extra problem in that, in areas where in the past we might have been very circumspect in arranging sales and exports, there may well be the temptation to get into markets that we would never have touched for security reasons before. The more uranium mines that open in Australia, if we find that a number of those uranium mines are marginal&mdash;depending on what happens to the price and depending on how much uranium there is on the market&mdash;then there is the temptation to maintain that structure. Once the status quo has been established, the temptation is to get into markets or to promote markets that normally you would not touch with a barge pole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are especially concerned about regional security implications. We pointed a finger at China. Everybody was concerned about Chinese nuclear testing and the fact that the Chinese government has not yet promised to suspend their nuclear weapons testing program, but it is rather hypocritical of Australia and the Australian parliament to point the finger at China and say, `You must not continue your nuclear testing,' if we are prepared to export uranium to South Korea, Japan and to other countries in the region which might create concern for countries like China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">China joined with the countries of the world in assisting to defuse the dangerous situation that was developing with worldwide pressure on North Korea. It always seems strange to me that the pressure was on North Korea in relation to the build&hyphen;up of nuclear materials and not on Japan. However, that is what the western world community decided to do: they would concentrate on North Korea. It was a very tricky situation and China joined with the world community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="198">  China, if you like, was the most important factor there. They joined with the world community to convince North Korea to accept the compromise positions and to accept funding to change their nuclear power pro gram to a different method which does not produce the same enriched materials. But if we are expecting China to participate in that kind of strategy now and in the future, then it is hardly the right thing for Australia to do to be negotiating prospective contracts for uranium sales to South Korea.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely not. Senator Cook asks whether I am apologising for China's weapons testing. Absolutely not. What I am pointing out is the sheer hypocrisy of any parliament pointing the finger at China and at the same time being prepared to supply nuclear materials to South Korea. As I said, even France admitted that they had no way of guaranteeing that Australian uranium was not going into their weapons program because you cannot determine what is an Australian uranium atom compared with what is a uranium atom supplied by another country which has not signed the nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, if Australia provides uranium to countries which have or are developing a nuclear weapons program and if other countries are also supplying uranium to the same country, then all it means is that there is an increased pool of uranium. There is no way that you can guarantee where the Australian atom is going. All there is is an accounting procedure which says that a certain amount of uranium comes in, a certain amount of uranium goes out. Therefore, the assurances are nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The broader implications of uranium mining on local communities have been of great concern. It is not just the implications on local communities' environmental health and safety and the issues of the control of land and land use. That is extremely important and obviously extremely important for indigenous communities in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just about the situation of local communities in and around uranium mining and milling. It is about communities on transport routes. It is about communities living around ports. I am sure that, if the Yeelirie mine were to go ahead, the people of Esperance in Western Australia  would be appalled at the prospect of being a port for the export of uranium. I am not sure that the people of Port Hedland in Western Australia would be terribly thrilled about the prospect of being a uranium export port for the Kintyre deposit. As I mentioned before, there are around 14 prospective uranium mines in Western Australia and some that do not even have a name yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee that I mentioned&mdash;that is, the Senate Select Committee on Radioactive Waste&mdash;has already looked at some aspects of the effectiveness of waste management. But, so far, that committee has not had the chance to look at the impacts of radioactive waste management from uranium mining because, by the choice of this chamber, that was excluded from the terms of reference. That always was an anomaly of the original inquiry and that is why it is important that we now address the problems, if they exist, in relation to the handling and storage of radioactive waste from uranium mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are social impacts of uranium mining&mdash;and this has been mentioned by the coalition. In many instances, they have emphasised the economic benefits for communities. If people want to argue for the economic benefits, perhaps this is the opportunity when they can put those ideas forward and others can talk about the counter argument. If there are economic benefits, there may well be social and environmental costs, and even economic costs if one activity precludes others. It is the time to put those ideas on the record. It is also the time, with a secretive industry, to ask the questions which for so long have been denied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the ongoing argument about mining in national parks. Contrary to Senator Parer's assumptions earlier, the Greens have always talked about the values in mining. The Greens do not have a no&hyphen;mining policy. The Greens have a policy in relation to the social <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="199"> and environmental impacts of mining. That has been the approach we have always taken. Therefore, if you are going to look at the environmental values&mdash;whether they are World Heritage values, national park values or the impact of environmental pollution&mdash;this is the time to bring that information together. That information should be not just from one mine, but from all the experiences that are occurring. Either the mines that have operated in Australia or examples from the various proposed mines in Australia should enable that information about the possible impacts of mining national parks to be brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not speak for long because many of these kinds of issues have been canvassed in the public arena. I strongly urge the Senate to support this inquiry. It certainly is timely for it to take place. I believe the community expects that any new decisions in relation to such an important issue are looked at carefully, and are seen to be looked at carefully, in a process that involves people. The environmental impact process is one where people can have an input; they can put in a submission. But, often, it is a case of a lot of people putting in a submission and the decision, as originally stated, still going ahead. There might be some variations, but it does not give people the chance to have a two&hyphen;way process with the parliamentary system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the important thing that we are asking for now: firstly, that there is the opportunity to bring that information together; to be able to ask those questions of the bodies who have been involved with uranium mining for so many years and to have those questions put on the public record; and then for the chance to test all of those assumptions and statements that have been made in the past about uranium mining. It is important to have those questions put on the public record, and it is important that those statements have a chance to be aired. I therefore strongly urge support of this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. Senator Margetts said that the Office of the Supervising Scientist was there really not to care for the environment. That is patently not true. If you go to Ranger, and you should go to Ranger, you will find you have a total work force in Ranger of about 200 people. Of that 200 who work for that particular company, 30 people are involved specifically in environmental matters. In addition, there are 55 people from the Office of the Supervising Scientist measuring just about every effect of mining and milling that you could imagine, whether it be radon in the air or whatever you want to think about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mine itself has won awards for its successful environmental management and for landcare research, and I do not think you would disagree with that. It is one of the best&hyphen;run mines in the world. I am not specifically supporting a particular mine; I am just giving you the facts as they occur in a mine that has been in operation for 16 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Office of the Supervising Scientist has reported over the period, quite publicly&mdash;you can read the reports any time you like&mdash;on 46 incidents. If you read the report of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, you will find that in not one case, either individually or cumulatively, did those incidents have any effect on the environment. The sorts of things that occurred are the sorts of things that happen really in any industrial situation. I noticed in some of the discussions we had with some of the environmental groups that one of the things they talked about was a spillage of water. A spillage of water did occur. It was held within the bund wall, if you know what a bund wall is, and I am sure Senator Sherry knows what a bund wall is. But do you know how much water was actually released that caused the great furore? It was about half the size of a normal backyard swimming pool. That is the sort of thing you are talking about. This experience shows that uranium mining can be undertaken safely.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an emotive statement from Senator Margetts&mdash;`radioactive water'. It had no effect on the environment whatsoever. Experience shows that mining <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can be undertaken safely, as with any mining operation. Any sort of operation, whether it be mining or industrial, has its particular hazards. In mines that have similar plant requirements, you need to manage mine and mill waste. We do not disagree with that. It has to be done in a proper way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Radiation hazards, of course, are relatively minor and not unique to the uranium industry. Another example, of course, is mineral sands, where you do have some radioactive content. The government has clearly stated that all proposals for new uranium mines will be subject to stringent and comprehensive environmental impact assessment processes. We have not budged one inch from that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also ensured that where projects are approved there are adequate measures in place for monitoring and reporting for the duration of the mine's operations. Clearly, we have the technology to conduct mining of uranium responsibly. I think that is shown by 16 years experience of very little impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reference (b) of the terms of reference would examine the role of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. Senator Margetts, I do not know if you are aware just how many people from the Office of the Supervising Scientist are on the Ranger site. I mentioned there are 30 people within the work force of ERA concentrating entirely on environmental matters and another 55 people from the Office of the Supervising Scientist. They measure everything, as I indicated, even things like nuclides that are used for the filtration process through dam walls. Every single thing you can possibly imagine is being done by the Office of the Supervising Scientist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next terms of reference that Senator Margetts is proposing is again, I believe, a waste of resources. The health and safety implications of mining and milling uranium and transporting it are well understood. There is no need for a Senate select committee or anyone else to inquire further into these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To give some perspective to the idea that people working and living near uranium mines will be exposed to radiation, all human beings are exposed to low levels of ionising <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="202"> radiation in Australia. AGSO actually surveys the whole of Australia with regard to its radiation levels. The whole country, to some degree, is radioactive. The exposure comes from traces of radioactive elements in rocks, soil, the roads you drive on and building materials.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bricks&mdash;you are quite right, Senator&mdash;and cosmic rays and minute amounts of radioactive elements which are naturally present in our bodies. I am not saying you should not be stringent in everything you do, but there has to be a sense of balance in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The typical dosage from this background radiation is two millisieverts per annum. Nevertheless, it is important to minimise the additional radiation received by the community and by people working in the industry. No disagreement there. The standards that apply to protect workers in Australia are based on internationally agreed approaches which have proven effective in protecting community health. As I mentioned earlier, uranium mining is really no more hazardous than any other mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know this is an emotive issue. I do not disagree. It is emotive because people have abused what, I believe, is a gift to use something for the generation of power, but they have abused it by making bombs. We were most stringent in our opposition to the nuclear testing by the French in the Pacific. That is an abuse by humankind, if you prefer non-sexist language, of what is used in many parts of the world to help people improve their standards of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be pointed out that the Ranger uranium mine is the only mine in Australia with a five&hyphen;star safety rating from the National Safety Council. That is pretty impressive. You cannot walk away from that. Hazards are not unique to uranium and are effectively managed in all types of mining where radioactive materials are present in the ore body, and in certain industrial and medical operations. People often neglect the benefits because they talk about bombs a lot. They do not talk about the radioactive isotopes used <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within the medical profession which contribute to human health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Health and safety requirements apply to all these activities and are based on internationally accepted codes of practice. For example, public and occupational radiation dose limits were recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and published in 1991&mdash;that is, ICRP 60. These new lower dose limits were reduced from five to one millisieverts per annum and from 50 to 20 millisieverts over 50 years. The background figure, as I gave you before, is two. The new limits were jointly adopted as the voluntary Australian standard by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council and the National Occupational Health and Safety Council in June 1995. Relevant state and territory regulations have been or are being updated to reflect those new standards. The Ranger and Olympic Dam mines are operating well within these limits and any new mines will also be required to operate within those limits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let me say more about the important issue of the health of uranium workers. While this is a matter that falls more within the health portfolio, I have sought advice on the current position in the context of my responsibilities for uranium mining. A national radiation dose registry is being established by the Australian Radiation Laboratory, ARL, as a national database of personal radiation dose records of all Australians occupationally exposed to external ionising radiation. This covers people working in the radiography fields across the board. This will provide from a single source a complete history of individual radiation exposure throughout the working life of individual workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Routine collection of data commenced in February 1996 and the system is due to be operational by July 1996. I understand that some privacy concerns have been raised and that these will be addressed in legislation being drawn up for the establishment of an Australian institute for radiation protection. So far as internal radiation exposure is concerned&mdash;that is, through inhalation&mdash;dose records are held by state authorities and employees. The ARL has requested dose <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="203"> records from state authorities and where these are not available for privacy reasons it will be necessary to negotiate with employers and employee organisations. I would like to emphasise that the current health and safety requirements relating to radiation exposure are based on internationally accepted codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As regards the transport of nuclear materials, again, safe practices are well understood and recognised internationally. There is no need for concern for the health or safety of workers involved in such transport or for people who live near the routes along which the material will move. As an aside, for Senator Margetts's interest, in the first 10 years of my working life I worked with X-rays and radioactive isotopes in the industrial field. We were very conscious of the health effects but nothing like we are today. That was over 20 years ago. I believe people were very aware of the fact that one had to take very careful safety precautions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As regards bilateral safeguard agreements&mdash;the opposition cannot disagree with this because it was instrumental in putting some of these into place&mdash;why inquire into their effectiveness? They are on the table and everyone knows about them. They are clear for everyone to see. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that any Australian nuclear material and material derived from it covered by such an agreement has ever been diverted away from peaceful non&hyphen;explosive purposes. I have heard the opposition say that over and over again. If my memory is correct, I think it was repeated ad nauseam by former Senator Gareth Evans when he was in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our safeguard agreements are the most stringent in the world. No other country has as exacting a set of requirements. Hence the ALP's policy. As we have such stringent agreements, we should encourage the export of uranium because we know what it is being used for. Australia has 14 such agreements covering AONM in 24 countries. Each is a treaty level document with the recipient country giving guarantees about AONM within its borders and in transit.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The starting point for our safeguard agreements is careful selection of countries with which we trade uranium. Countries which are not nuclear weapon states must be members of the nuclear non&hyphen;proliferation treaty and subject to NPT full&hyphen;scope safeguards. That is, IAEA safeguards apply to all existing and future activities. Nuclear weapon states with which we trade uranium, that is the United States, France and the United Kingdom, must give a treaty level assurance that AONM will be used only for peaceful purposes and must have arrangements in place for AONM to be covered by IAEA safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our bilateral safeguard agreements contain the following main conditions. The AONM can be used only for peaceful purposes and IAEA safeguards will apply. None of the following can occur without Australia's prior consent: transfer to AONM third parties; enrichment to 20 per cent or more in the uranium 235 isotope; or reprocessing. Adequate physical security will be applied to AONM in the country concerned and detailed arrangements will be established setting out the procedures that will apply in both countries to account for AONM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will provide just a little detail on these accounting arrangements administered by Australia by the safeguards office. In each customer country, ASO's counterpart organisations ensure that detailed records are maintained, that there are regular reports to ASO and that transfer and receipt documentation for AONM is provided. The ASO's accounting is based on those reports and documentation plus calculations of process losses and nuclear consumption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts suggests that the committee inquire into the volume and location of Australian obligated plutonium currently in existence. `What form is it in?', asks Senator Margetts. She makes it sound as if there is some sort of big secret&mdash;that it is hidden, that the Australian government does not know about or must be hiding this information about plutonium. When she gives that implication it is not just about this government but about the past government. That is absolute paranoia. It is just not true. If you want your question about plutonium answered, all you <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="204"> have to do is read the annual report of the director of safeguards. It is all there, tabled in this place and publicly available. I do not understand the whole point of the exercise. The information you claim to be seeking is already publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you what the last report says about our obligated plutonium. It tells how much is irradiated plutonium&mdash;that is, spent fuel&mdash;and how much is separated. It tells what countries the material is in. We know what its end use will be: it can be used only for peaceful purposes&mdash;for power generation&mdash;because that is what Australia's safeguard agreements and the IAEA safeguards system guarantee. So all Senator Margett's questions about plutonium are answered every year by the director of safeguards. I do not think anyone questions the integrity of the director of safeguards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be fascinating to hear what Senator Faulkner has to say in view of all that he has done in the past.

It is essential that we care for the environment and meet social needs. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, in the last 10 years something like $115 million went to the Aboriginal people from the Ranger mine alone. When I was up there I spoke to a number of the traditional owners and they were very supportive of these mines. One of the reasons they were supportive is that the mines provide infrastructure that would not normally be provided. Out of that infrastructure, they get roads and they develop their own tourism industry. If you go up to Jabiru you will see a magnificent motel owned by the Aboriginal groups which, as they told me, would not be there if it was not for the Ranger mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the point that these mines have a relatively short life and they cover a very tiny area. I know the pickies on television may not show that, but, if you look at the amount of material moved in one year by the Ranger mine, it is about 100,000 tonnes. Compare that with one of the open&hyphen;cut coalmines in the Bowen basin. One of those mines moves that amount of material in two days. That gives you an idea of the size. The mines are relatively small. They do not cover a big area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just conclude by saying this. I think this is where we need a sense of realism in the whole picture. As I indicated, we have no problems with extending the inquiry because most of the information is already known anyway. The inquiry will just reinforce what I have been saying. Uranium is a source of power, and a very important source, especially if you have a power station in a country where you do not have indigenous reserves of other energy materials. To give you an idea of volumes, 2,000 tonnes of uranium is equal to 32 million tonnes of coal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are already over 450 nuclear power stations around the world, with more being constructed, notwithstanding the fact that people say they are not. Those nuclear power stations supply 17 per cent of the world's power. Nuclear power, by its very nature, requires stringent safeguards. No-one disagrees with that. The benefit of nuclear power is that there are no greenhouse gas emissions, no CO2. That is why the French&mdash;who we criticise for letting off bombs in the Pacific and who generate 80 per cent of electricity by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="205"> nuclear power&mdash;are in a position to take a very high moral ground in regard to greenhouse gas emissions. They sell their nuclear power into adjoining countries who will not put in nuclear power stations. There is some irony in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has around 30 per cent of the world's economically recoverable reserves. We do not have the lot, but we do have 30 per cent and we supply about 10 per cent of the market. Canada, by comparison, has 10 per cent of the reserves and supplies 30 per cent of the market. This has occurred because of this ludicrous ALP three mines policy. I know that the Greens say, `Let's supply zero.' That would not affect one iota the number of nuclear power stations generating electricity around the world or the growth of that. There are lots of other sources. That in itself is not just a reason for going ahead, but I think I have made the point that it is no different to any other mining. They are relatively small mines and it can be done safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a window of opportunity to increase our sales under stringent safeguards from around $250 million a year to $1.2 billion by the year 2002. This came out from an Access Economics report printed last year. That is not insignificant in addressing our current account deficit and foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition has not varied its position in respect of uranium mining. We have taken the view that we would abandon the ludicrous ALP policy. We have already announced that. Our policy has not changed, but we have changed the previous government's policy. It will be done under stringent safeguards. Proper EISs will be carried out and the uranium itself will only be used to generate electricity for peaceful purposes. We understand that the government does not have the numbers in regard to this particular motion so, inevitably, we also understand that the select committee will continue its work with the enlarged terms of reference suggested by Senator Margetts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The continuing policy of the Labor Party is that no new uranium mines should be allowed to open. There is a very clear difference between <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ourselves and the government on this particular issue, one that was the subject of considerable debate during the recent election campaign. This policy that the former Labor government had meant that a significant number of new uranium mines in this country were prevented from opening. That included potential uranium mines in the Kakadu National Park, a World Heritage area. The government's position&mdash;very eloquently put by Senator Parer, at extraordinary length but, as he said, what do you expect from a statesman&mdash;is simply open slather uranium mining in this country. It is a position that we do not and will not accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with other senators in the chamber who have expressed very great concern about the health hazards of uranium. Uranium ore has a low level of radioactivity. Although contaminants are always present, the dangers to workers in this particular industry come mainly from dust and radon gas and can be accumulated in the lungs. Radioactive materials escaping from mines, tailings dumps, spills or wastes can certainly accumulate markedly through the food chain and endanger both wildlife and humans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position that the opposition has taken in relation to this particular inquiry is that we believe it ought to be targeted to that area which is being very closely examined right now by the new government to open uranium mines, particularly in the Kakadu World Heritage area. The new government is committed to moving helter&hyphen;skelter to open uranium mines in the environs of Kakadu National Park. That is a very great concern not only to the opposition but also to many people in the Australian community. Let us put it clearly on the record again: the opposition absolutely totally opposes any plans to open any uranium mines and we are particularly concerned about mines in the environs of Kakadu.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a very fine record in government in terms of our commitment to protecting the values of World Heritage areas in this country. This proposal to open mines near Kakadu completely violates the principle of World Heritage protection. As far as the new government is concerned, it is a very clear indicator <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="206"> of their lack of commitment to the protection of the environment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The comparison between the previous Labor administration and the new coalition government on this issue is very obvious. We went to great lengths to protect World Heritage areas. We opposed the opening of any new uranium mines in this country and we are happy to work with others in the community to ensure that no uranium mines are opened in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Australian environment groups have called for a full public inquiry under section 11 of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act in relation to uranium mining in Kakadu. Senator Hill has rejected that on behalf of the government but Kakadu deserves the highest level of protection and warrants the closest possible scrutiny in relation to the Jabiluka and Koongarra proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particular focus is an important one for the Senate to reflect upon as it determines to establish this particular select committee. For that reason, I move the following amendment to Senator Margetts's motion:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of paragraph (3) add the following words "with particular emphasis on the impacts of uranium mining in and around the Kakadu World Heritage area".</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the preferred option put forward by the opposition&mdash;a tightly focused, targeted Senate inquiry&mdash;could get to the heart of the key issue, the issue that is right up there in the public mind and right at the top of the government's agenda, which is to expand the Ranger uranium mine. That would be the most sensible thing that the Senate could do. The Senate would need to consider seriously the alternative proposition to a more targeted and focused inquiry because it would have much more bearing and influence on the approval process for that mine at Jabiluka. That would have been the most effective approach for the Senate to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have a situation where the Liberal government is clearly indicating that it will take less account of and be less concerned with an adequate level of environmental scrutiny for proposals than the previous Labor government. That adds weight to the argu ment that a focused Senate inquiry is the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very broad&hyphen;ranging inquiry dealing with all the issues that Senator Margetts has addressed in her motion and in her contribution in this chamber would be a very useful addition to the debate on these issues in this country. But I would not want to see that mean that we could not concentrate on the real agenda of the new government. We genuinely believe that a broad&hyphen;ranging Senate inquiry is a risk because on the line at the moment is uranium mining and its impact in and around the Kakadu World Heritage area. That is top of the pops with the government. That is what the government wants to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to be part of any process, be it a Senate process or otherwise, that will in any way assist the government in the clear objective that it has been very willing and happy to state time and time again and has made clear again today. I suggest to senators in the chamber that the amendment I have moved is a sensible and constructive one and is likely to have a very positive impact. It certainly embraces the approach that the opposition has taken because of our concern with the way the government is tripping over itself to open up these uranium mines near Kakadu. I think the amendment is worthy of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated many times in this chamber, the Labor Party does not fall over itself to support either new committee references or the establishment of new select committees. Obviously, we need to be able to look at proposed terms of reference and to ensure that the Senate's resources and energies are best directed to those key issues of public policy that senators have a responsibility to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the urgency in relation to Jabiluka. I accept many of the arguments that have been put forward by my colleague Senator Margetts in relation to her concerns with that proposed uranium mine. I commend this amendment to the chamber. I understand that the substantive motion will be agreed by the Senate. It is not the opposition's intention to oppose this committee reference but we are keen to ensure that the work of the Senate is <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="207"> well directed, well focused, well targeted and most effective in derailing the outrageous plans of the new Liberal government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to spend a lot of time looking at the issues which I believe the Select Committee on the Impacts of Uranium Mining and Milling in Kakadu National Park will be inquiring into, but I do want to pick up on a couple of points that the minister has raised. I would like to begin with a comment about the committee itself, the committee that is just about to lapse and which we are trying, before it is too late, to see continue. This committee has not had any opportunity to look at this issue before. As my colleague Senator Bell has said time and time again, it really did need this additional reference. It was deliberately omitted, apparently. But it is a natural derivative to now move on and have what is really the rest of the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another issue Senator Parer raised was in regard to the traditional owners being supportive. A couple of weeks ago I also spent some time in Kakadu meeting with some traditional owners and with a range of different people. I know there are a few traditional owners who are still supportive, but I was not able to meet any of those particular people. The people I spoke to raised a wide range of concerns about what is now happening at Ranger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, they are obviously benefiting. The Aboriginal people are seeing a small amount&mdash;a very small amount&mdash;of the profits flowing in their direction. But, unfortunately, that money is going into services that the rest of us take for granted. For example, that money is going into providing a health service, a health service which really should have been provided by the former Commonwealth government; it is also going into providing services&mdash;the infrastructure&mdash;which one would have expected the Northern Territory government should have put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, rather than really enjoying what are the fruits of their land, they are in many cases forced to spend this money in areas that will at least guarantee them some housing, although not adequate housing by any standards. Indeed, some of them are living in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appalling conditions, and the public housing possibilities in the Northern Territory are so limited that that is where some of the money is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, it has gone into tourist ventures but, as they have explained to me, that is also to get profits to spend on basic infrastructure and services that most people in Australia are able to tap into through either federal or state programs.</PARA>

As for the jobs that are available in the two major tourist ventures that they operate, again, there are a few jobs, but unfortunately they are very low paid intensive jobs&mdash;for instance, in the laundry. Indeed, one of the key traditional owners, a senior member of the local people, who will be making one of the major decisions on Jabiluka, works in the laundry. I believe those jobs could be far better allocated or open to Aboriginal people than they are at the moment. Of course, they are pleased for any jobs that they are able to access, but it is still&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motel is actually partly managed by Aboriginal people; they own the motel. But, unfortunately, the job opportunities have not flowed to the extent that many of the local people had hoped they would. So, to say that the Aboriginal people are benefiting in some additional way from the extra royalties that are flowing, beyond the standard of living the rest of us enjoy, is not correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To move on to a couple of other issues, I make a general comment on the fact that the government would like to push this aside as being a not terribly important environment issue. I am sure the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) would recognise that, for the environment movement, this is one of the key issues. For him to say, `Don't you worry <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="208"> about that; we will have an inquiry; everything will be fine' and simply to push ahead, basically already agreeing that North Ranger will go ahead, leaves many questions unanswered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to hear that the government is in fact going to support this motion. The minister had been assuring us that all was well, but he really did run out of excuses for not supporting this. We have to have an open, thorough and public look at what is actually happening now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to one of the concerns that I will raise today and that is the release of contaminated water&mdash;whether it is accidental or intentional. I do not believe it is reasonable to push this aside as being something that does not matter terribly much. In particular, I do not believe it is reasonable to suggest that the long&hyphen;term effects are negligible when we simply do not know. The Office of the Supervising Scientist, for all the work that it is doing, is doing virtually nothing to look at the health of the local people and the impact of their exposure in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I refer to what has been happening as far as the mobilisation of water off the Ranger site is concerned. As we know, that is a high rainfall area, as is the area where Nabarlek was, as is the area where Jabiluka and Koongarra are. That presents us with a whole range of very specific problems. The tailings from uranium extraction contain more than 70 per cent of the radioactivity of the original ore. We simply cannot suggest that a small leakage is basically nothing when we may be talking about very highly concentrated leakages of water, as happened at Nabarlek where some five kilos of tailings slurry sprayed well outside the restricted release zone. We simply cannot push it aside and say, `Sorry, we are not really going to worry about that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During 1995 there was a very heavy wet season. This was one of the first issues that was raised with me when I was talking to the traditional owners and to other people up there. The Aboriginal people had always believed, when they agreed to Ranger, that they would be involved in the processes of making decisions that were going to affect the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> environment. But they were not consulted. Ranger applied to release the water from retention pond No. 2 and it would have gone out into the Magela Creek system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The traditional owners had to fight this all the way. They eventually ended up in the Northern Territory Supreme Court, which heard the matter on 16 March. Unfortunately, there again, they lost. The wet season ended rather suddenly and the flow in Magela Creek reduced very rapidly. Eventually the Office of the Supervising Scientist said, `Alright, it is really getting too late in the season. There is not enough water; we won't release it.'  That is the only thing that saved the Aboriginal people from having to put up with a substantial release of water, although I would argue any release of water would have been bad enough. It would have been a substantial release of water out into that wetland area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is one of the concerns that the traditional people raised with me when I was there. They are having no say in decisions that affect their environment. They were promised a say. They were supposed to be involved. They do not even have any regular contact with the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The occasional meeting and the occasional briefing are all too few and far between. So for the minister to suggest that traditional owners are in favour of this is simply not correct. They have many, many concerns about what is now happening at Ranger. To then suggest that they are going to agree with the new mine is a bit premature. The meetings are still going on. I believe it is going to take at least a month or so before any final decision is reached. Surely we at least owe them a thorough look at what is happening now and a look at all the plans for Jabiluka and particularly for Koongarra where most of the deposit is not only inside the national park outside the current lease area, but is also in the world heritage area. That presents a whole new range of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether the minister visited that particular art site while he was there. The site just near Koongarra is the only site that is accessible all year round. To have people visiting a world heritage area to look at traditional Aboriginal artwork within hearing <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="209"> of mining activities&mdash;Koongarra would be going ahead only a kilometre or two away, just over the nearby hill&mdash;will put at risk the tourism industry in the Northern Territory. As I say, it is the only all&hyphen;weather accessible art gallery. All the bus tour companies insist, when they come to the point of making travel  arrangements, that their tourists visit that particular site. For most of the year, if you want to visit Aboriginal art you have to go there. While you talk about jobs in the mine, you may be looking at a loss of jobs and a loss of tourism opportunities in Kakadu. That is what the Aboriginal people are very concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This brings me to the opposition's amendment. I really do not think it is needed. If the opposition is very enthusiastic about just looking at Kakadu, they are quite able to encourage submissions on that issue from those people who are also concerned, including traditional owners. We could look at some of the findings of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and some of the concerns they have raised just as a start. If we begin to narrow down the reference to referring just to that particular area of the Northern Territory, we lose the opportunity to look in depth at issues in my home state and also in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition amendment, largely for the reasons that we did not support the Labor Party's motion in the first place. That was because we believe we need a far broader inquiry. We should not quarantine it. This amendment begins to bring it back into a fairly narrow area of just looking at the specific problems that we have at Ranger. Rather than go through what I could spend most of the day talking about&mdash;specific problems and some of the comments from the Office of the Supervising Scientist&mdash;I will finish here. I hope that we will see all parties in this chamber agreeing to this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

We, as always, respect the view of the majority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our policy is well known. It was taken to the people at the last election; it is clear and unambiguous. We believe in uranium mining as a legitimate activity to create wealth for the benefit of all Australians. But any uranium mining must go through a very strict and transparent set of tests before it will be approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, as I have said publicly&mdash;and I will repeat it here&mdash;those tests that I will apply as environment minister will include all my obligations under the environmental impact act and, in the cases where it is relevant, under the World Heritage Act, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, in fact, all pieces of Commonwealth legislation. If and when any particular application for a new uranium mine reaches my desk, those laws will be applied with all proper vigour. That is a responsibility that we obviously accept as a government because we are committed not only to further development in this country, particularly the creation of jobs that can come from further economic development, but also to environmentally responsible policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a major plank at the last election. We took it up-front. In fact, we have committed ourselves to establishing a $1 billion natural heritage trust for the benefit of the Australian environment. We will apply the environmental principles, as I said, with vigour. Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Senate and any outcomes that might come from this inquiry, the Australian people can also have the confidence that, in relation to any application that might reach us for a new uranium mine in this country, it will only be approved if it can be conducted in an environmentally safe way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question I want to ask is: why choose this particular committee and why choose this motion over the newly converted Labor Party's? It seems to us that this committee does have a track record. As was said by Senator Margetts, its secretariat is in place and it can be seen as an extension of its previous inquiry. That seems to us, therefore, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="211"> to be the better of the two options that have been presented to us. Whilst we start from the position of believing that it is unnecessary, that there is sufficient material on the public record already for the Australian people to make judgments and to feel secure in these matters, nevertheless we accept the numbers in this place. We will give whatever support is necessary to ensure that the committee can carry out its functions in order to produce the best possible report for the benefit of the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly to the amendment moved by the opposition. The government will not support the opposition's amendment. I think it is an example of the utter hypocrisy of the Labor opposition in the Senate. As Senator Hill pointed out, for the past 13 years Ranger has operated under Labor governments. It has been defended, over the years, by people such as former senator, now member of the House of Representatives, Gareth Evans, in response to various questions raised by the Greens. I may be wrong. They had the opportunity over the past 13 years to do exactly what they are proposing today. One has to ask why they did not do it then. It is hypocrisy in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his response, Senator Faulkner talked about how good their policy was and how they were limiting it to three mines; in fact there are two mines. He did not say that recently, in the last year, they extended the operations at Olympic Dam. Again, I have no particular problem with that; in fact, I would support it. But, as Senator Hill said, they are saying it is all right to have two big mines but not three or four little mines. For that particular reason, and I simply base it on the hypocrisy of the Labor Party's position, we will not support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

There is obviously a great deal of community interest in the inquiry that will be set up as a result of today's vote.

It is extremely important that the inquiry takes place. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perfectly reasonable that the committee be able to set its agenda. If in the first instance there is a wealth of concern in relation to Kakadu, I am sure the committee will go to Kakadu and listen to those concerns. If necessary, and if there is a particular urgency, it can make a brief report to the Senate in relation to that urgency. That is always in there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I thank the opposition for their proposed amendment, I believe that it would not be helpful in this debate. If we are talking about international security arrangements, we are not just talking about international security arrangements in relation to Kakadu. Therefore, the particular emphasis is redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Kakadu is extremely important and I can guarantee that the Greens will fight tooth and nail in relation to that particular consideration. That does not mean to say that limiting the inquiry to specialise in Kakadu will be of major assistance in this regard. I believe that the general arguments ought to be put. Kakadu obviously will receive a great deal of attention by the community because of its symbolic nature. It is extremely important to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to agree with Senator Parer that the decision to continue mining in that area has been with the previous government for so long. It is very nice to see that they have rediscovered this concern. However, creating a smokescreen on the general issue&mdash;that is, continuing or expanding uranium mining opportunities&mdash;is not helpful. There is nothing at all in the terms of reference which preclude the committee responding to the community's particular concerns. Therefore, whilst I thank the opposition for their support now for the general terms of reference, the WA Greens are unable to support their amendment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you would be aware, Mr Deputy President, in what I might describe as an inadvertent consequence, the effect of an order of the Senate of 29 November 1994 is that the new government does not have the opportunity to have legislation debated in this place unless the Senate is prepared to agree that that particular order should not apply. That order was put in place to encourage an orderly process of legislation in this place and we accept, as I said yesterday, the principle behind it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it does create an impossible situation for a new government that is anxious to get on with the legislative program, to get on with the chance of implementing the policies that it took to the community at the last election. It is, therefore, our argument that it certainly should not apply to all bills that are introduced within the first two&hyphen;thirds of this first sitting session, but that is a debate we still have to conclude. Certainly, in relation to the three bills before us today, it should not apply.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hazardous waste bill was before the Senate under the authority of the last government. It is very familiar to senators. In fact both the Labor Party and the coalition had indicated their support for it on the last occasion. It would have been carried on the last day of the sitting but the Western Australian Greens indicated that there would be an extensive debate and there simply was not time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will remember, Mr Deputy President, that the then Labor government had got itself into an awful mess with the program. As I recall, some 40 packages of legislation were sitting there on that last day. In some ways, what we are seeking to do is to clean up the mess, for which no doubt the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) will express gratitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this instance, the hazardous waste bill had been through an extensive public consultation process. An exposure draft was put to interested parties. Furthermore, a reference group of interested parties was set up to assist the then government in the drafting and finalisation of the bill. What I am saying is that the bill is very familiar to senators; therefore, any argument that senators have not had sufficient notice will obviously not have merit. I argue, therefore, that the order of November 1994 not apply to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill presents a slightly different situation. It is, as I understand it, a new bill. But there is urgency in relation to it. The original legislation was passed by the parliament in 1993, but it was subject to a sunset clause. The clause was inserted by the parliament after the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs expressed concerns that the broad&hyphen;ranging powers provided for in the act offered officers of the Health Insurance Commission scope for corruption and abuse of delegated authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clause allowed for a reasonable period of time, roughly two years, for the parliament to make a considered judgment about whether the powers had been abused by the Health Insurance Commission in any way. The Australian National Audit Office has concluded that the requirements of the sunset clause have now been met satisfactorily.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="213">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, what we are seeking to do by this bill is to continue the operations of the principle act, which would otherwise cease on 1 July 1996. In other words, it would cease at what was going to be the end of the sittings but now might be even before the end of these sittings. That is the urgency of this matter, and that is why we want to deal with it during these sittings. Again, the same principle applies: this is not new business in the sense that the Senate is unfamiliar with the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was the Senate that inserted the sunset clause. It has been addressing this issue for a very long time. So there can be no suggestion that, by our seeking that it be debated in this session, it is in any way putting the Senate at a disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third bill, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1996, is also very familiar to this chamber. It was fist introduced by the former government in early 1995. Senators will recall it was initially part of an omnibus bill, which was subsequently divided on by this Senate. This is the path that incorporates and reintroduces the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1995, which was passed by the House of Representatives on 28 September of that year. It was still awaiting consideration by the Senate when the parliament rose at the conclusion of the 1995 sittings. It has been around for a long time. The Senate is well familiar with the arguments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that, as a result of the delay, over 600 applications for listing particular products for supply in Australia have had to be delayed. These applications comprise relatively simple, low&hyphen;risk products&mdash;vitamin,  mineral, herbal, homoeopathic and sunscreen products. Producers have been sustaining financial losses because of the current heavy backlog under the existing processing system. As a result, there is urgency in dealing with it. Because of its long history and the familiarity of senators with the bill, we would also seek that this bill be exempted from the cut&hyphen;off clause and that it be debated in the course of these sittings. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate that the WA Greens support the motion put by  the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) with a proviso on one of the bills that is under consideration.

I will speak to that motion when it is before the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to respond in passing to comments made by Senator Hill and Senator Harradine. It is not quite accurate to say that a new government is not able to have any legislation to debate in this place, for the very reason that is demonstrated by the motion that is at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, unfortunately, a myriad of pieces of legislation from the last session of parliament where there was already demonstrated bipartisan agreement on the content of the bills by the major parties. This new government has legislation which is quite familiar to members of this chamber and also to the community. Regardless of whether a government is a new government or a continuing government, the principle of the cut-off motion is still valid: it provides the opportunity for community scrutiny and for checking <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="215"> that legislation has been able to be assessed adequately.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I was having difficulty hearing myself. For the benefit of Senator Hill I will repeat my remarks. The principle is still valid. In a new government, community scrutiny may be even more valid and necessary and a good government will demonstrate, right from the beginning, its commitment to public consultation and scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no grounds for saying that a new government can suddenly push through legislation within the first two-thirds of its first sitting and expect to have it passed in the Senate when it opposed, when it was in opposition, that exact behaviour by the former government, who did it in the last two weeks of the session. There is an hypocrisy there, and I think that the whole benefit of a cut-off motion debate is demonstrated by what we are doing here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To go on to Senator Hill's specific motion, the Greens have no problem with exempting the hazardous waste amendment bill from the cut-off motion. It is, as has been pointed out, a bill from a previous sitting of parliament. The same thing applies to the therapeutic goods bill. They are very familiar. Because time has drawn on, there is urgency associated with both of them. We have no problems there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we would like to request an assurance from the government in relation to the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill. If I thought I had the numbers to oppose it and to amend this motion to remove it, I would, and I would do a separate cut-off motion for it. In my view, the reason to have a sunset clause in any legislation is to allow the re-evaluation of the important measures that were introduced by the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that with this particular bill, the Australian National Audit Office has concluded that the requirements of the sunset clause have been met satisfactorily. They do not <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> believe that the broad&hyphen;ranging powers provided for in the act&mdash;about which the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs expressed concern&mdash;should be removed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I think that it is very important that we do not give consideration to the removal of that sunset clause until the last week of the coming sittings. If it is done straightaway, it really prevents the community from being able to have an input into the removal of the sunset clause and a say as to whether there would be unintended consequences of the broad&hyphen;ranging powers which could not be brought to the attention of the Australian National Audit Office or parliamentarians in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, with the exception of the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill, the Greens support this motion of the Leader of the Government. We would like to see an assurance from a member of the government that it is not intending to pursue a very quick process of debate in relation to that particular bill. To have it within this sitting is quite appropriate, but to have it in the last two weeks is honouring the whole intent and purpose of a sunset clause. It does violate the cut&hyphen;off motion because it has not been introduced in this parliament before. The removal of the sunset clause is something that has not been introduced in this place before and I alert honourable senators to that because we will be moving something that may have ramifications within the community.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government expresses its appreciation to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for its comprehensive and detailed report on the treaty making power and the external affairs power. The government considers that the Committee's report provides a sound basis for the reform of aspects of the treaty&hyphen;making process as it affects Australia, particularly as the Committee was able to reach unanimity on the recommendations put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's hearings took place during a period of profound debate on the place of treaties in Australian domestic law and process. The government has also taken account of that debate in framing its response, paying particular regard to submissions made by the states and Territories as well as concerned non&hyphen;governmental groups and individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the government's intention that treaty&hyphen;making should be accepted as playing a legitimate part in the development of Australia's place in the economic, political and social framework which is evolving in the modern post&hyphen;Cold War world. It is neither possible nor sensible for Australia to stand aside from this evolution. It is, however, equally necessary for the Parliament, the states and Territories and the Australian community to participate in the task of finding the best way for Australia to participate constructively in international law making and negotiate treaties which serve Australia's national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will augment the existing treaties unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Trade to coordinate information dissemination and consultation and ensure that by the time Australia enters into a treaty there will have been the fullest possible opportunity for all Australians with an interest to participate in the consultation process. The development of National Interest Analyses (NIAs) for all treaties to which Australia is considering  becoming a party will assist decision making and provide a further source of information to all interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also noted that the Committee's report envisages an enhanced role for Parliament in scrutinising Australia's treaties. The government will introduce a new tabling arrangement whereby all treaties, with the exception of urgent and sensitive treaties, will be tabled at least 15 sitting days to allow for Parliamentary scrutiny before binding treaty action is taken. The government will also support the creation of a special Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The Secretariat to be formed within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will also be tasked with coordinating the provision of treaty materials to the Parliament and the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successive governments have sought to clearly identify Australia's obligations in relation to international treaties. The fully revised Australian Treaty List, published in 1990, included all treaties to which Australia was formally a party. A detailed examination was made in its preparation of available archival and filed material and notifications to depositaries for multilateral treaties. This information was published under the entry for each treaty. If no evidence was available to the contrary, it was assumed that the treaty was still formally in force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Supplement to the List, published in 1995, while adding subsequent treaties to the List, also updated existing entries where further information had become available. This is an ongoing process. Updates to the List are published monthly as "Treaty Action" in the Departmental magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insight</EMPHASIS>  and annually in the Australian Treaty Series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction to the 1990&hyphen;1994 Supplement contained a detailed analysis of the number of treaties in force for Australia. It explained that the precise number of treaties in force for Australia is not easily established, because some treaties may still be formally in force but of no practical effect. These include a number of treaties whose purpose has expired and some colonial and pre&hyphen; World War 2 treaties inherited from the United Kingdom. There are also a number of treaties entered into with the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia whose status remains to be clarified.  In this regard, Australia is in a similar position to other countries. The extent of this uncertainty should not be overstated. The status of the great bulk of treaties is clear. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as part of its ongoing responsibilities seeks to terminate or replace treaties which are no longer practically operative, as well as undertaking diplomatic efforts to resolve the status of those treaties whose status is unclear. However, the allocation of the additional resources required to undertake a full scale audit to produce a list of treaties in force, for example, in terms of consultations with depositaries for multilateral treaties or other parties would be substantial, while the benefits would be questionable. Moreover, such an audit would probably take a number of years to complete since it would depend on the responsiveness of other countries, who would not necessarily regard it as a priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, the government accepts the need to present in a more accessible way information about Australian treaty making. An explanation of the sources of information and a general description of Australian treaty practice will be included in revisions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's publication  Australia and International Treaty Making: Information Kit (1994), as well as in future electronic information retrieval initiatives (see recommendation 4). <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Identification of Departments/agencies responsible for treaties</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Administrative Arrangements Order, the Foreign Minister is responsible for treaties. Responsibility for particular treaties is allocated by subject matter, e.g. the Department of Industrial Relations is responsible for International Labour Organisation treaties. However, there are a number of instances where several Departments or agencies will have a shared involvement in or responsibility for a particular treaty or a category of treaty.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government supports the establishment of a treaties database which would be accessible free of charge through the Internet. Given the enormous volume of treaty information available the only viable way of making this information accessible to the widest range of people is via the Internet. The government  indicated in its statement entitled  Australia On&hyphen;Line  that it supported the Electronic Links for Public Libraries Program, announced  in December 1995, which aims to provide Internet access to all public libraries in Australia. The Department of Social Security also has a pilot program under way (Community Information Network) designed to provide 400 Internet access points in DSS offices and community centres in selected states and towns. In addition, Internet <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="220"> access is being provided at other outlets, including Commonwealth Government Bookshops. Discussions with academics, industry, and NGOs suggest that the use of this dissemination resource will meet the needs of most of those with whom consultative relationships would be established. The government  will, however, continue to produce hard copies of certain treaty information such as the Australian Treaty Series and the Select Documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initially, the following treaty information would be placed on the database: the Australian Treaty List; the Australian Treaty Series (1948&hyphen; present); Select Documents on International Affairs: Treaties and Conventions (1966&hyphen; present); explanatory material being prepared in relation to forthcoming multilateral treaty action; and National Interest Analyses that are tabled in Parliament. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will form a government  Treaties Database Committee to manage what treaty information goes onto the database. The Committee would also establish guidelines on the management of the database and the development of complete and up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date treaty information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee also recommended that the decisions of international bodies which interpret these treaties, such as the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the complaints bodies [supervisory machinery] of the International Labour Organisation be placed on the database. The selection of an appropriate service provider will facilitate this task (some material is already available through the Australasian Legal Information Institute, an institution referred to in the Senate Committee's Report). The government will work toward placing the decisions of international treaty bodies on the database in line with the resources allocated to this task. Initial indications from the United Nations and its agencies is that the UN is currently considering the exchange of information through the Internet, including in relation to treaties. The government will work towards ensuring that as much UN information as possible is available to the public through the Internet. Seed funding has also been provided by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department for the Australian Human Rights Information Centre (AHRIC) for the purpose of establishing an Internet site which holds international human rights materials. AHRIC proposes that the second stage of the project will expand the core collection of human rights documentation, however, this would require further funding.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also existing texts which collect or summarise the travaux preparatoires of many major treaties and these are already available through libraries (including on Inter&hyphen;Library loan).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received a variety of views about the efficacy of the consultative process now undertaken with industry, NGO's and the wider community. It noted, however, that `there seemed to be some agreement that the government was making a greater effort to consult industry on relevant Conventions' (paragraph 12.12). It also stated that ``there appears to be some evidence that the commonwealth has done much more in recent years in consulting relevant non&hyphen;government organisations and industry groups'' (paragraph 12.24). It did, however, receive evidence indicating that the consultations process was conducted unevenly, and that there was a lack of transparency in the treaty process from the viewpoint of community groups and individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that it is important to ensure that all those groups and individuals which might be affected by a treaty or which could contribute expertise to the preparation of Australian positions on treaty issues are able to present their views at appropriate stages in the negotiation process. Consultation with such groups and individuals not only promotes community understanding of treaties and their potential value or impact, but also enables Australian Delegations to attend conferences with stronger briefing taking account of Australia's strengths in different fields. Representatives from state and territory governments, industry and NGO's have, where appropriate, been included on Australian government delegations attending treaty negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government seeks, with the assistance of peak organisations and known players, to bring the significance of treaty issues to the notice of all parties who might have an interest. Well&hyphen;developed mechanisms for consultation with industry and NGO's already exist, such as in the international environment arena, which discuss proposed treaties, treaties under negotiation and possible adherence by Australia to treaties. Hundreds of consultations are undertaken every year. The government has also relied on publications like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insight</EMPHASIS>  to let the wider community know of treaties under negotiation, and has responded to enquiries generated as a result. It also uses public affairs opportunities in centres around Australia to discuss treaty issues and seek reactions and views. Nonetheless, in some <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> areas, there is the  perception that the existing arrangements are not sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has already begun a review of the consultation process with the aim of identifying ways of improving it. This will extend to considering the value of formal meetings with representatives of interested peak organisations (as now happens with respect to Environment, Human Rights and Peace and Disarmament treaties). It will also consider the value of treaty&hyphen;specific consultations, which are common with the various environment and ILO conventions and the need for additional consultations with community groups. It will also consider the work done by peak bodies to disseminate treaty information to their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review will also discuss the capacity of private sector groups to digest and provide advice on the volume of information which is available on treaty issues. The delivery of information through electronic media, both by government and by other agencies, is transforming the consultative process and raising the possibility that government needs to see itself more as a provider of analysis rather than of raw information for consultation processes, at least where peak organisations and specialist groups are concerned. It is, however, important to bear in mind the importance of ensuring that treaty consultation is not made so complicated that it cannot be accessed by community groups who might be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The diverse subject matter of modern treaties makes it difficult to respond with a single answer to the identified need for increased efforts in this field. The government does, however, anticipate that the creation of the treaty database, and the wider dissemination of treaty information to the public through libraries and increased contact with the media, will encourage more interested groups and individuals to seek involvement in the consultation processes relevant to particular treaties. Officers of functional Departments will work with the groups and persons to find a way to assist the presentation of views to the consultative process relevant to the treaty in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also heard evidence that in some cases consultations took place at short notice, and with insufficient time for the presentation of considered views. The government endeavours in all cases to allow all potential consultative partners sufficient time to provide their views, but there are times when the international processes move at a speed which makes this impossible. The government trusts that continual improvements to dissemination procedures will ensure that community groups wishing to involve themselves in consultations will be in a position to do so from the beginning of negotiations, obviating the problem <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="222"> that some experience because they only learn of consultation opportunities at the eleventh hour.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government gives a firm commitment to the tabling of treaties to allow for Parliamentary scrutiny but believes that the new arrangements should be implemented for the time being by non&hyphen;legislative means. Under the new arrangements, all treaties will be tabled in the Parliament at least 15 sitting days before the government takes definitive treaty action, that is action to become a full party. The new arrangements will apply to all treaties i.e. bilateral treaties, as well as multilateral treaties. The Senate Committee accepted that a requirement to table bilateral treaties before signature was problematic because of the international convention that such treaties are confidential until signed. It recommended that all bilaterals be drafted to come into force through a two step mechanism of signature and ratification and be tabled before ratification. The same end can be achieved through Australia's normal practice of signature and exchange of notes (the exchange of notes procedure differs from formal ratification in that it is not necessary to refer the treaty to the Federal Executive Council for approval a second time). Under this proposal, the exchange of notes would be the definitive treaty action and treaties would be tabled between signature and exchange of notes. The tabling procedure will apply to all treaty actions, including amendments to, or termination of, treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only exceptions will be for urgent and sensitive treaties. The Senate Committee acknowledged the need for this. Acceptance of a requirement for tabling must be accompanied by provision for those inevitable urgent or sensitive treaty cases where it is desirable to take binding treaty action either before tabling or where a treaty has been tabled but the 15 sitting days have not expired. This seems essential in any new procedure. The Senate Committee acknowledged 15 sitting days might be 30&hyphen;100 calendar days.

In practice, however, the effect on the Federal/state balance will depend on how the treaty is implemented. NIAs will address this issue in the section on implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NIAs will be finalised in time for tabling in the Parliament as part of the new processes before Australia becomes a party to a treaty. They will also be made available to the state and territory governments and the wider community at this time. The states and Territories would be consulted in the development of NIAs in which they have a major interest, as would other interested groups. These views would be reflected in the NIA.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This question was the subject of widely divergent views during the Senate Committee hearings. These included presentations arguing for either approval or disallowance requirements, and the question of whether the Constitution empowered the Parliament to restrict the power of the Executive to enter into treaties. It concluded that there was ``little reason to doubt that the Legislature has the power to limit or regulate the Executive's power to enter into treaties, to make or remove reservations or to denounce treaties'' (para 16.99).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report discusses difficulties which would need to be addressed if an approval or disallowance procedure were to be introduced, and concluded that the issue was of such importance that it should be the subject of further public debate and consideration. It felt that the implementation of other recommendations could  ``assist in curing some of the problems which a system of parliamentary approval of treaties would also be designed to address'' (para 16.102).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that it would be sensible to review the experience to be gained from the establishment of a Joint Committee and the implementation of other recommendations before moving to consider the need for an approval or disallowance procedure.

It will give consideration at that time to whether the issue of an approval procedure should be referred to the new Treaties Committee.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me particular pleasure that my first statement in this chamber as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Senate should be to inform the chamber of the government's action to reform the treaty&hyphen;making process. This reform is long overdue, and the actions <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="225"> taken and proposals to be submitted to the parliament are intended to implement the policy commitments announced by the coalition during the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will provide proper and effective procedures enabling parliament to scrutinise intended treaty action. Importantly, they will also overcome what this government considers to have been a democratic deficit in the way treaty&hyphen;making has been carried out in the past. The measures will ensure that state and territory governments are effectively involved in the treaty&hyphen;making process through the establishment of a Treaties Council. They will also ensure that every Australian individual and interest group with a concern about treaty issues has the opportunity to make that concern known. Consultation will be the key word, and the government will not act to ratify a treaty unless it is able to assure itself that the treaty action proposed is supported by national interest considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering policy options, the government has taken careful account of national and international considerations. Among the latter, it is vital to note that trade flows, environmental concerns and human rights&mdash;to name only a few of an increasing array of such issues&mdash;can only be effectively managed and handled through international agreement. This means that treaties, the fundamental instruments of international law, are an increasingly important component of contemporary international relations and of Australia's own legal development. Accordingly, the treaty&hyphen;making system must be reformed and updated so as to reflect this growing importance and influence on our domestic system in a way which will provide greater accountability to the treaty&hyphen;making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, for Australia, means that we must have an efficient domestic methodology for assessing the way proposed treaties meet our own national concerns. Parliament should be in a position to examine the considerations which are weighed by the government when it determines the need for Australia to take binding treaty action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements should go a long way towards rectifying the democratic deficit <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> identified by so many commentators during the hearings conducted during 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Very many individuals and organisations put their views forward on treaty&hyphen;making in 1995. I cannot name them all here, but I can say that they came from virtually every part of the Australian social, economic, cultural and political spectrum. They ranged from community organisation representatives to persons like Justice Michael Kirby and Sir Ninian Stephen. My colleague, the Attorney&hyphen;General, also made two submissions to the Senate committee, and has played an instrumental role in the development of the actions and proposals I am privileged to announce today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my earnest hope that the government's response to the Senate committee's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trick or Treaty? Commonwealth Power to Make and Implement Treaties</EMPHASIS>, which I am now tabling for the information of the Senate, will restore confidence in the treaty&hyphen;making process. The government, however, offers an undertaking to revisit these issues after experience with these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before stating the changes that are to be introduced, I should note that they respond to the belief of state and territory governments that reforms are needed. The states and territories put their views forward in 1995 in their position paper entitled `Reform of the Treaties Process', to the Council of Australian Governments. They proposed a number of reforms which have been considered by this government. While discussions are continuing with the state and territory governments on the detail of some of the reforms announced today, I believe the new arrangements will go a long way to allaying their concerns over the treaty&hyphen;making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I note that the Prime Minister has already written to premiers and chief ministers to inform them that the Commonwealth will support the creation of a Treaties Council as an adjunct to the Council of Australian Governments. Further discussions will take place with the state and territory governments on the composition and working methods of the Treaties Council, but it is my hope that it will begin functioning without delay.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="226">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, I shall now describe the reforms we have decided to make to the treaty&hyphen;making process.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tabling of Treaties</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treaties will be tabled in parliament at least 15 sitting days before the government takes binding action. This means that treaties will be tabled after the treaty has been signed for Australia, but before action is taken which would bind Australia under international law. This latter action, which is often inaccurately called `signature' is usually ratification or accession, but there are occasionally other forms or procedures for taking binding action. The procedure will also be used whenever other types of binding action are proposed, including termination or denunciation of a treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements will apply to all treaties, bilateral as well as multilateral. They will also apply to all actions which amend a treaty if the amendment would alter obligations with a legally binding impact on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee recognised that there would be occasions when the government would need to take treaty action urgently, and recommended that special procedures be instituted to cater for this need. It noted, for example, that a 15 sitting day tabling requirement would often translate into 30&hyphen;100 calendar days. Treaties which require immediate implementation, like the Bougainville Peace Keeping Treaty of 1994, demonstrate the need for special arrangements to meet special circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, and in accordance with the Senate committee's recommendation, where tabling in advance of binding action is not possible, it will be tabled as soon as possible together with an explanation. These exceptions will be used sparingly and only where necessary to safeguard Australia's national interests, be they commercial, strategic or foreign policy interests.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National Interest Analyses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treaties will be tabled in the parliament with a national interest analysis. This will <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> facilitate parliamentary and community scrutiny of treaties, and demonstrate the reasons for the government's decision that Australia should enter into legally binding obligations under the treaty. The analysis will be designed to meet the need identified both by the Senate committee and the states and territories in 1995, namely that no treaty should be ratified without an analysis of the impact the treaty would have on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document will note the reasons why Australia should become a party to the treaty. Where relevant, this will include a discussion of the economic, environmental, social and cultural effects of the treaty; the obligations imposed by the treaty; its direct financial costs to Australia; how the treaty will be implemented domestically; what consultation has occurred in relation to the treaty and whether the treaty provides for withdrawal or denunciation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The size and complexity of national interest analyses will, of course, be tailored to particular treaties. More complex multilateral treaties will require a more detailed statement but this will not be allowed to become an unnecessarily lengthy, resource consuming exercise. I expect the consultation process will identify which issues merit detailed analysis. Ministers will ultimately determine the appropriate balance between the size and utility of the document and the resources required to prepare it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect the first tablings of treaties to see the beginnings of the national interest analysis system. The government looks forward to discussing these issues with state and territory governments in the COAG context.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will propose the establishment of a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Treaties to consider tabled treaties, their national interest analyses and any other question relating to a treaty or international instrument that is referred to it by either house of parliament or a minister. The committee will provide detailed scrutiny and examination of those treaties that are of particular interest to Australians. I consider this to be a landmark step in strengthening <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="227"> parliament's role in treaty making as the committee will be empowered to inquire into all tabled treaties and bring forward reports for consideration by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Treaties Council</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will support the creation of a Treaties Council as an adjunct to the Council of Australian Governments. The council will have an advisory function, but its composition and operational details will be the subject of further discussions with the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes that together with the commitment to prepare national interest analyses for all future treaty actions, the establishment of a Treaties Council will herald  a new phase in Commonwealth&hyphen;state consultation on treaty making.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Treaties Information Database</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of a treaties database was recommended by the Senate committee, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in consultation with the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, is now working on its creation, taking advice from potential users in the non&hyphen;governmental community as well as from state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The database will be designed to make it easy for all persons and groups with an interest in treaty information to obtain it free of charge, as recommended by the Senate committee. Present planning envisages that although the database will be available from the Internet, it will remain possible for those without electronic communication equipment to obtain information in hard copy form from the agency responsible for the treaty or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arrangements will be made to advertise the availability of the database once it is established. The government recognises that it is one thing to have the information available, but quite another to make that very availability widely known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Once established, the treaties database will complement the electronic links for public libraries program, which aims to provide Internet access to all public libraries in Australia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will work with the Office of Govern ment Information Technology and other relevant agencies to ensure that the database both stays abreast of technological developments, and provides information in a user&hyphen;friendly form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This exciting step will truly modernise the dissemination of treaty information in Australia. Industry bodies and NGOs are increasingly turning to the Internet as a means of communication that is particularly suited to the vast spaces of the Australian continent. Libraries in remote and rural communities that previously would not have kept hard copy texts of treaties and other information will, in future, be able to download this information from the Internet and make it available to anyone who wants it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaties database also has implications for consultations on particular treaties. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is examining the possibility that new forms of information dissemination, for example via electronic news groups, will make it easy to provide immediate advice of treaty developments to anyone who wants to be linked to the system. Discussions with potential users of this facility have already started, and I hope it will be possible for the new system to be up and running quickly. I also hope this will be able to be developed for the benefit of the parliament, for it is important that the parliament and the new Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is linked to this form of information dissemination.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CONCLUSION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms I have described represent a significant enhancement in treaty scrutiny and consultations at all levels in the Australian government and the community. Implementing them will be a major endeavour, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has already established a new treaties secretariat with responsibility for managing the reforms and coordinating their implementation. The treaties secretariat will also be responsible for monitoring public reactions to the reforms and reporting to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on ways in which they might be further enhanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to say that the reforms give Australians unparalleled access to the work of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="228"> governments in the making of new international laws. I firmly believe that the impact of international laws in the domestic context make it imperative that we continue to improve that transparency and recognise the fundamental right of people to scrutinise the way international law is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government foreshadowed these reforms in both its foreign policy and law and justice policy statements. I am happy to be able to announce today that the government has  delivered on these election promises within two months of being elected to office. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the statement and document.</PARA></SPEECH>

<STATE> (South Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(11.55 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the opposition, representing the shadow minister for foreign affairs in the Senate, to respond to this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us be quite clear about this. This ministerial statement and decision by the government is a damp squib by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). It reveals just how conservative the new government is in its foreign affairs ambitions. Despite the minister's bold claim in this statement that the government has delivered on its election promise, it has done nothing of the sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will remember that amongst the promises being flung around by the minister before the election were: an audit of all treaties Australia has signed; legislation to require the government to make an annual report to parliament on what has been done to them; and the creation of a national treaties council. He has done none of these things in substance. On the latter he has simply changed the words about the existing Joint Standing Committee on Treaties which engages the Commonwealth in discussion twice a year with the state and territory governments on all treaty negotiations. The minister's new so&hyphen;called treaties council is said to be an adjunct to the Council of Australian Governments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators should watch the speed with which it becomes simply part of the normal COAG agenda, as it has always been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In any case, this council will only have an advisory function&mdash;whatever that might <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mean&mdash;and its composition and operational details are the subject of further negotiations with the states and territories. In other words, the central role of the council has still to be determined, so we do not know yet what this major reform may mean. Yet again, as in so many other areas, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, since taking over as the minister, has been mugged by the reality which he refused to acknowledge before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even on the proposal that treaties be tabled at least 15 sitting days before ratification or accession, the minister now accepts that there will be situations when tabling in advance of binding action is not possible. He acknowledges for the first time that such a requirement could often translate to up to 100 calendar days of delay. He accepts `the need for special arrangements to meet special circumstances'. We have always said that this would be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it quite clear on behalf of the opposition that we have no concerns about any actions which provide for greater understanding of the role of treaties and greater opportunities for public involvement wherever this is possible. That is why the former Labor government set in place the Standing Committee on Treaties with state and territory governments, now apparently simply to be renamed the treaties council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was why we consulted industry and community groups on a regular basis on all major treaty negotiations such as the Uruguay Round, the Energy Charter Treaty, the Law of the Sea Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Montreal Protocol and the International Convention on Biological Diversity. Many representatives of industry and community groups participated in negotiations as members of Australian delegations. The minister's claim that `consultation will be the key word' reflects a strong view of the Labor Party which we had already put into place when we were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with much of the government's position on treaties has always been its use of so-called treaty reform to mask its real agenda&mdash;its hostility to the use of Australia's international commitments to support reform <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="229"> in Australia and opposition to the use of the external affairs power. Over the last few years in this parliament, in this Senate we heard endless humbug and hypocrisy from the then opposition about how we were traducing the constitution of Australia&mdash;the powers to the Australian parliament in signing treaties, which outlaid the powers of the federal government in the constitution since 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That political campaign by the then opposition confused the Australian people by saying that we would be bound in legislative action and the supremacy of the Australian parliament would be traduced and affected by signing foreign treaties&mdash;for example, the World Heritage listing that stopped the damming of the Franklin River in Tasmania. That only came into effect to actually stop the damming once this parliament had carried the appropriate legislation based on the foreign powers and it was upheld by the High Court. If the parliament had not carried the appropriate legislation, the damming would not have stopped; it would have proceeded. The parliament made the decision. That was always iced over by the opposition as they tried to conduct a fear campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember some years ago an extraordinary campaign about the UN charter on the rights of the child. I think all senators would have received extraordinary petitions and letters from members of the public claiming that it was the end of the right of parents to have a say over the upbringing of their own children. This was a scare campaign aided and abetted by the opposition, claiming that this UN treaty that we had supported meant that parents in Australia lost the power to control and bring up their children in their own sensible way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had a campaign going on here on this issue by the opposition who, in their ideological position, disliked very much the fact that the federal parliament should have powers that affect and have a national viewpoint rather than state rights. We were very happy to use those powers for the benefit of Australia. None of them were used contrary to the powers of the Australian parliament or the sovereignty of this parliament. If the parliament did not want to use those powers, it <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have carried legislation and resolutions accordingly. When it chose to use it, it was always decided here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere in the minister's statement does he refer to the agreement on security with Indonesia, although honourable senators will recall that this was the core of the criticism by the minister when he was the spokesman for the coalition, criticising the treaty's practice during the election campaign. These concerns were always fabricated. Since coming to office the government has again endorsed the security agreement, and we welcome and support that. It is an important document which should have bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this new Treaties Council, let it be quite clear that before the election the coalition suckered in the state conservative premiers and state governments to imply that this new council would be a veto on the federal parliament. The reality is that this statement today says that there is no such veto. There will be consultation, as there always was. I congratulate the minister for backing down on this and accepting the supremacy of this parliament and of the federal government to decide treaties and not giving the veto power to any state or territory government. Once that happened, the international obligations of this parliament would be dreadfully affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has backed down, but he suckered in the conservative state governments by implying that he would give this veto power to the Treaties Council. He has backed down, but he should have the good grace to admit that we were right and he was wrong. At long last he has acknowledged that this power shall remain after the consultation period, unimpeded to the federal parliament and the federal government, which is responsible to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A new joint standing committee of the parliament has been established. Before the election&mdash;if you read the manifesto of the coalition&mdash;it was implied that this committee would have some power of veto and so on. That has been backed right away from. It will have the power to look at, consult and take evidence, but in the end the power to ratify a treaty&mdash;to accede to a treaty&mdash;still remains <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="230"> with the federal government unless the parliament takes action to direct it otherwise, as it does have the power to direct the federal government at any time if you can get legislation through both houses of parliament. We do not object to the committee, but we accept what it always should have had&mdash;the power to advise and the power to express an opinion, but not the power to veto.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite six years of humbug in this Senate from the then opposition, in the end after two months in government they have done nothing else but dress it up. The existing position of the former government continues as it should. We congratulate the minister for climbing down and accepting reality. We condemn him for going around before the election and conducting a fear campaign that did not have any substance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we have one of the most significant reforms in relation to the Commonwealth's power under section 51(xxix) of the constitution. Over the years there has been much concern expressed by community groups, business groups and state governments as to how this government entered into international treaties. I am pleased to see that the government has accepted 10 out of 11 recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, which I chaired during this inquiry. I take this opportunity to thank those members of the committee for their hard work and their contribution. I also wish to thank the secretariat who served us so well at that time, in particular, Ms Anne Twomey, who has now gone on to lecture at Sydney University.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report was one of the most significant reports made by a Senate committee in the last parliament. The government has recognised the concerns which were expressed to the committee and has sensibly accepted its recommendations. I point out to the Senate that recently in the House of Lords this Senate committee report was referred to favourably in the course of a debate on a bill introduced by Lord Lester which involved parliamentary scrutiny in that country. We have the so-called mother of all parliaments in the United Kingdom looking to Australia <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for leadership in this area of reform in the process of entering into treaties. I think that is significant and completely overshadows the remarks made by Senator Schacht.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at some of the responses made by the government. The first is that treaties be tabled in parliament at least 15 sitting days before the government takes binding action. Previously, treaties were tabled twice a year. I recall an instance in October last year when no less than 100 international instruments, comprising treaties and amendments to treaties, were tabled with senators having no time at all to scrutinise them. This response is a great leap forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And so is the national interest analysis&mdash;basically a treaty impact statement&mdash;which was recommended by the committee. No such statement has existed before. It will enable people looking at treaties and impact statements to have a better understanding of what they entail. Through that process alone the community will be better informed about what we are letting ourselves in for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is something else new. It will allow the parliament&mdash;the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;to inquire into and report on any treaties under consideration. This can only be looked upon as an innovative step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Treaties Council, I remind Senator Schacht that the standing committee on treaties is really a body made up of officials. The Treaties Council will be made up of elected representatives from the states and chief ministers.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not in the statement.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in the report. The Senate report outlined how the standing committee worked. Obviously, Senator Schacht, you do not have that understanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the council, I refer you to recommendation 7. The government's response says that the composition and role of the council are matters to be agreed with between the Commonwealth, states and territories&mdash;properly so. But the government has accepted the recommendation made by <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="231"> the committee that the council should be made up of elected representatives rather than officials. That is a step forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also recommended that the council would issue reports from time to time and that those reports be made public. That is in stark contrast with the existing situation&mdash;another point that Senator Schacht has overlooked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn now to the treaties information database, which will be designed to make it easy for all persons and groups in the community with an interest in this area to obtain information on treaties free of charge. The committee heard that the current situation was unsatisfactory, that information was not available to the community at large. This database will be another great leap forward in increasing the transparency of the treaty process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up until now there has been a democratic deficit in the way this country has entered into treaties. That concerned many people who gave evidence to the Senate committee inquiring into this matter. At the last election the community raised the question of what a future government might do in this regard. That is why the coalition saw fit to put out its policy on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition did not say at any stage that it would bring in a system whereby the parliament would disallow treaties. The government has sensibly said that it will review in two years time how these reforms work. It will also review whether further consideration should be given to parliament having the ability to disallow treaties. That is a very sensible approach to reviewing how these reforms operate. I can tell Senator Schacht that a great deal of concern in this regard was expressed to the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concede that there were divergent views. That was because this is such a complex and difficult area that no&hyphen;one has the experience to draw on to form a definitive view. I suggest that in two years time, once we have seen the operation of these reforms, we will have the experience and hindsight to make an informed decision. This, fellow senators, is a great step forward in the way this federation <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operates. It means that the people of Australia will have greater input into how we enter into treaties. Community groups, business groups, state and territory governments will all have input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date there has been no formal procedure for the government to follow before entering into treaties. We had no notice of what was to be signed or ratified. We now have a situation where treaties will be tabled 15 sitting days prior to signing or ratification, which could mean having as long as three calendar months. That will give an opportunity for a joint parliamentary committee to review and inquire into these treaties and to report to the people on what the country is letting itself in for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most importantly, with recommendation 1, the government has accepted the need for an audit or listing of treaties that we have entered into. It was discovered during the course of our inquiry that no&hyphen;one was certain about how many treaties we had signed. I take on board the department's difficulty with the fact that some of the countries we have signed treaties with have since disappeared. Nonetheless, there must be an ongoing audit of how many treaties we have signed and what they are. That information should be available to all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats welcome today's ministerial statement by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) on reform of the treaty&hyphen;making process. As everyone in this chamber knows, we have been calling for reform of treaty&hyphen;making processes for several years. In fact, I have introduced two private senator's bills, both for a Parliamentary Approval of Treaties Act. The second of these, introduced last year, would ensure that no treaty could come into force in <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="232"> Australia unless the parliament gave its approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have long held the view that parliament's role should not be usurped by the executive when it comes to making commitments and entering into international obligations on behalf of the entire country&mdash;on behalf of every single one of us. There has clearly been an undermining of some very basic democratic principles in this area recently and the Democrats were critical of the previous government's failure to take action in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the coalition on their decision to make changes to the area of treaty making as one of their first actions in government. The government's changes are in line with much of what the Democrats have proposed. However, there is one great disappointment. That is, the coalition government has followed the course of its Labor predecessors and backed off making the final commitment to the democratic process: to allow both houses of the federal parliament to decide whether or not Australia should be a party to a treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition gets to that hurdle&mdash;and it makes some positive changes and commitments along the way. But it cannot quite bring itself to jump over that final obstacle and recognise the supremacy of the parliament over the executive. That failure to take the final step does weaken the impact and the strength of today's statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has agreed to table treaties in parliament at least 15 sitting days before the government takes binding action. That is a step forward. As we have frequently heard before, in the past the parliament has put up with having a swag of treaties and international agreements tabled once or twice a year in one big lump, with time&mdash;if we are lucky&mdash;for half an hour's worth of debate on the lot of them. Tabling usually comes after ratification&mdash;quite often, a long time after ratification&mdash;and impending legislation accompanying treaties has been very rare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the government's decision to table treaties 15 days before ratification is welcomed by the Democrats. As Senator Hill <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, 15 sitting days does often extend into a month or more in calendar days, and I accept that this move will not only improve parliamentary scrutiny of treaties but also open them up for public debate and comment. That level of openness in scrutiny is very much overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We support the decision to table treaties accompanied by a national interest analysis. That sort of impact statement is something which will certainly facilitate public debate about the possible flow&hyphen;on effect of treaties and it makes the tabling process a more meaningful exercise than it otherwise might have been. We will also support&mdash;though with reservations&mdash;the decision to establish a joint parliamentary committee on treaties, although I again make the point that scrutiny is not the same as approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are already on the record as saying that we are not keen to set up a special committee to examine treaties. I have called for an expanded role for the Selection of Bills Committee to enable it to make referrals on treaties to whatever Senate committee&mdash;or, indeed, joint committee&mdash;is best equipped to deal with the content of the particular treaty. The Democrats still believe that is the better course of action, but we will not stand in the way of the government's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also make the observation that the committee will need adequate resources if it is do its job properly and play a genuine and effective role in leading public debate on treaties. That is something the government needs to seriously consider if it is about to cut resources to the parliamentary committee process. I trust the government will ensure that that joint committee has sufficient resources to do its job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats also support the creation of a treaties council under the auspices of the Council of Australian Governments. That should ensure a greater level of Commonwealth&hyphen;state cooperation on treaties&mdash;I certainly hope it does&mdash;and it should also raise the level of debate and understanding about the impact of treaties. We also support the government's decision to fund the establishment of a treaties database and I commend the government for its stated commitment to <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="233"> ensuring a greater level of public access to information about treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot finish a speech on treaty making without mention of the Australian&hyphen;Indonesian bilateral security treaty which was put in place, almost single&hyphen;handedly, by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in December of last year. That treaty must rank as the prime example of how not to carry out the process of writing and ratifying a treaty. The terms of the treaty were agreed on in absolute secrecy&mdash;and the last Prime Minister was immensely proud of that fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard the former Prime Minister say on television that the reason he kept it absolutely secret was that if it had been public it would not have happened. How is that for democracy! If I, as an Australian citizen, am going to be bound by an international treaty to closely cooperate with a defence force, one section of which&mdash;Kopassus&mdash;has one of the worst human rights records in the world, I want to know about it. As a citizen of a democratic country, I have a right to know about it. And I want to have the democratically elected members of the federal parliament decide by a vote whether or not I will be bound by that treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite interesting to note that, before that treaty went ahead, there was a lot of debate&mdash;including in the committee that Senator Cooney, Senator Ellison and others are members of&mdash;about what the rules and regulations should be for treaty making. But it was all a bit academic at the time, because most of the treaties that Australia had put in place over the previous 20 years or so, over several different governments, had been fairly public. We had had debates on them in parliament&mdash;the more contentious ones, at any rate&mdash;and they usually led to some sort of a vote in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the treaty with Indonesia was the most outrageous abuse of democratic process I have seen in a very long time. It was outrageous because we did not have a say on what went into that treaty; we did not have a say on whether we should be a part of that treaty; and it was, I am sure, deliberately timed to be put to the Australian people just after the parliament had risen, just before Christmas, so <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there would be very little public debate&mdash;and no debate whatsoever in parliament. It is just an absolute outrage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line, though, is really this: the democratic deficit will remain in existence until such time as the government of the day is prevented from entering into treaties, conventions or protocols without the approval of both houses of parliament. During the election, the coalition, in its foreign affairs policy, pointed out with great clarity the current problems in the treaty&hyphen;making process. I agreed with them. Their policy talked of the increasing impact of internationalisation on domestic laws. It talked of the inadequacy of Australia's treaty&hyphen;making processes to manage the growing task of international law making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps most significantly, the policy said that there was already `compelling evidence' of the direct and undesirable impact on domestic laws and the division of powers as a result of those inadequate processes. We have to think of the Teoh legislation here. We have to remind ourselves that if we have agreed to a piece of legislation, through both houses of this parliament, that piece of legislation is something that Australia has to be bound by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way, if we have signed a treaty and said, `We believe this is our international obligation', it should also be our domestic obligation. We cannot say, `We have agreed that everybody else should do this&mdash;but, by the way, we won't.' That is a really outrageous thing to say. We have to keep that in mind when we look at the treaty making process. We have to keep that in mind when we look at the treaties that we have already signed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition says all these things but it still cannot bring itself to solve those problems through the relatively simple mechanism of giving the parliament the right to approve treaties. It would have been better to go down that path. It is a great pity and a great loss of opportunity that we did not. But I think we are going down a path which is far better and far more clearly spelt out than the one we have gone down before.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is a historic day in the constitutional development of this country. It is a historic day because, for the first time ever, a government has come to the parliament and said, `We wish to put controls over the power of the executive government to enter into and ratify treaties.'  That is why today is significant. It is significant because this government, in the first week of sitting, has said that the process which had been in train for the last 50 years&mdash;by which the power of the states and the Commonwealth parliament to legislate and the sanctity of the constitution had been eroded by continual transgressions by governments of all political persuasions&mdash;has been arrested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the first time that a government has said, `We believe that the practice of government should adhere more strictly to the intention of the constitution.'  As my colleague Senator Ellison so eloquently said earlier, section 51 of our constitution lays down certain restrictions upon the right of the federal government to legislate. Yet what we have seen, most particularly since the Franklin dam case in 1983, has been the efforts of the previous Labor government to ignore section 51 and to use spurious treaties as the basis of oppressive legislation overriding the rights of the states and overriding the interests of the people of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is why today is an historic day and that is why Senator Schacht is so bitter and twisted on the other side of the chamber. This government shows that it is concerned with the true basis of democracy in this country, which is that the executive government must be held accountable to the parliament. That is the basis of the reforms which have been outlined today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go on any further, it is appropriate to pay tribute to a number of honourable <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> senators present in the chamber today. They include my colleagues from both sides of the chamber who served on the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee and also the current Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Kemp. When he sat on the other side of the chamber, he was one of the people who had the courage and the fortitude to say, `We believe that the powers which the federal government currently exercises in relation to treaties should be examined and should be subject to some sort of oversight by the parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me move to some of the great reforms that are introduced in this ministerial statement. I wish to concentrate on two of those reforms. The first of those reforms is a commitment to a treaties council which will truly involve the states as well as the federal government in the process of considering treaties before they are entered into. Senator Schacht in his contribution said, `There are a number of treaties and we consulted with industry.' But, as Senator Bourne quite rightly said, there have been more treaties which the government has entered into in secret. Most notably, the recent treaty entered into with Indonesia on security matters was negotiated and signed in secret and only wheeled out before the parliament and the people of this country after the ink was dry on the paper. That we believe is wrong. That we believe is an abuse of executive power. That is why this coalition government has taken the unprecedented step of saying, `We believe that wherever possible these matters should be subject to scrutiny.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the treaties council will be to allow the states input into whether treaties should be signed, whether there should be reservations&mdash;that is, restrictions&mdash;upon Australia's obligations under those treaties and what scope a treaty should have in the process of negotiation when it is being drawn up. That is something that no government of either political persuasion has been willing to entertain to date. It is a sign of the commitment of this coalition government to return the parliament to its paramount position in the Australian democracy and to involve the states in a process of true federalism&mdash;not sham federalism and not centralism,  but a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="235"> process of true federalism which recognises the fact that state parliaments and state governments have as much of a stake in these treaties as does the federal parliament and the federal government. For that, I believe the government deserves to be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More importantly, I believe the government is deserving of congratulations in respect of the recommendation it accepted for a joint parliamentary committee on treaties. The wording of the recommendation is quite important. The committee recommended that the joint parliamentary committee on treaties have the power to inquire into: proposals to enter into treaties; whether there should be any reservations; whether there should be any changes or removal of reservations we already have; the obligations Australia already has under treaties; the function of scrutinising treaty statement impacts; the right to hold public hearings and hearings in camera and to call for documents and witnesses; and the power to commence an inquiry into a treaty at any time, regardless of whether or not it relates to a document which has been tabled in parliament. The government has accepted this recommendation for the establishment of this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Therefore, for the first time ever in Australian constitutional history, not only will there be parliamentary oversight by virtue of this joint committee but, because the committee will have the power to call witnesses and to hold hearings into treaties, the people of Australia will have a say about Australia's treaty obligations. You would well be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Childs, that there are many people in Australia today who are horrified at the way in which the previous government abused the treaty making power. This will give the ordinary Australian the chance to present his or her view to the parliament of this country, for all to see. They can give their view as to the impact of a treaty, as to whether we should make reservation to a treaty or as to whether the treaty should be entered into or not. That is a bold step by this government, but a step which says, `We trust the people of Australia and we trust the good sense of the people of Australia when it comes to these matters.' More importantly, we trust them to make recommenda tions which we can consider and, if appropriate, implement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators from both sides of the chamber who sat on the committee should be happy to see that so many of these recommendations have been accepted by the government. I and others may have differing views as to whether treaties ultimately should be subject to parliamentary disallowance or whether they should be subject to parliamentary approval processes and so on. That is an appropriate debate for us to have. The government does not walk away from that. The government, in the ministerial statement, is committed to a further examination, in two year's time, of the workings of the processes we commence here. I believe that we have started a process which will ultimately lead to parliamentary ratification or parliamentary disallowance of treaties. It may take two years; it may take 22 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most important thing to say today is this: hitherto treaties were formal affairs of state that were discussed, agreed and signed in secret. Under this government we have taken the historic and, hopefully, irreversible step of involving the parliament and the people in the treaty making process, which can only befit a great democracy such as this.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(12.34 p.m.)&mdash;We are debating a most important document which arises out of a very important report. Much has been said about that so far and I agree with most of what has been said. Senator Schacht is, of course, right when he says that, in the end, it is still government that makes, signs and ratifies the treaties. That is understandable because historically that is the position: the government, as distinct from parliament, was the institution that made treaties, in the sense of agreeing to them, and that signed them and ultimately ratified them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position over the last few decades or so has been that treaties have impacted more and more directly on the lives of citizens of countries around the world than was the position prior to that. States went to war usually on the declaration of war by their executive. That had a horrific impact. But putting that aside, most treaties did not touch the lives of people in the way that they do today. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="236">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaty which gave rise to the saving of the Franklin Dam has already been mentioned and I use that illustration again. Another illustration is the one that concerned your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Childs&mdash;the matter that arose from the Toonen case. You would be very well aware of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an illustration of how treaties more and more come into the forefront of our lives. That is particularly the case with treaties that deal with civil rights, arising from such conventions as the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights; treaties that deal with the way and conditions under which we work, the International Labour Organisation treaties, which are very significant indeed; and environmental treaties. It is those three categories of treaties&mdash;dealing with work, civil and economic rights, and the environment&mdash;which impact upon people in an everyday sense. It is for that reason that people and citizens of other countries generally have become more and more interested in what their particular governments have to say to each other about what will be the norm, what will be the agreement as to how things will function around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the constitution, which has been mentioned, came into operation in 1901, our foreign policy was very much dictated by Westminster, by the British parliament. It was only later with statutes like the Statute of Westminster that the separate foreign policy of the former colonies became more and more their own possession. So this particular committee report and government response must be seen as now coming within that great sweep of change, if you like, from 1901 to the present time and into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of this report, amongst other things, is that it anticipated that change. It has, as it were, seen the growing appetite of people in this country to have a greater say in what is agreed between us and other countries because the fact of the matter is it affects their lives. So if we are going to have laws, for example, about the way sexual practises are conducted, about the way our land is to be used and about the way the workplace is to be regulated, they will need to be looked at by the public and by the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public's representatives, which is this parliament. They will then be passed into law if they are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People are starting to understand more and more that the laws that ultimately fill our statute books in many instances have their origin, their birth, in the agreements that are made in the United Nations and, to a lesser extent, between nations on a bilateral basis. The United Nations is the engine of much change around the world. The European Community has its own dynamics but as far as Australia goes, as we are a separate country, down here in the Southern Hemisphere it is the United Nations which gives most force to the changes that arise from international agreements, international treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So when this parliament passes statutes to outlaw racism, to promote the equality of gender, to give people with disabilities&mdash;people who are injured in mind and body&mdash;an equal place in society with those of us who are whole, it should be understood, which is happening more and more, that those sorts of laws come from international agreements which may have been reached many years before and are, therefore, appropriate to be looked at by the people of Australia prior to their actually being ratified at least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bourne, who has done much work in this area, says, as I understand her, that before treaties are signed this parliament should give agreement to them. We looked at that issue, as Senator Ellison, Senator McKiernan, who is about to speak, and Senator O'Chee would agree, but clearly the United Nations, where most of this change comes from, is an organisation of executive governments not parliaments. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the parliaments meet on occasions in such forums as the IPU, at which you have represented Australia with great distinction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a difficulty which will need to be discussed further but it would be premature to have a situation where this parliament must agree to a treaty being signed before it is so signed. The practicalities are very much against that being a viable matter. Also, the way we deal with treaties has to be seen as being in continuing development, as an <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="237"> organic sort of thing. This is a major step along the way. It is for that reason I join with Senator Ellison, as deputy chair of the committee, in thanking the committee and in thanking the secretariat. Over the years the secretariats of this committee have served this country well. I join, finally, with Senator Ellison in thanking Anne Twomey. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that this government has gone as far as is practical. It has gone as far as it could go. In contrast to that, Senator Schacht, on 30 November 1994, 36 bilateral and multilateral treaties were tabled, of which 16 had been ratified by your government and a further seven had come into force. You must concede that the document laid down today goes a long way to improve that position. Even the most ungenerous person would concede that a lot of advancement has been made since your position of dumping 36 treaties on the table and saying, `Here they are. Whether you want them or not, they are ratified.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposition may not go as far as the Australian Democrats want to go. It may not go as far as you want it to go. But at least it is going somewhere. I believe it is really answering something which concerns the constituency of Queensland. People have recognised over the last 13 years, with the government's continued use of international treaties to override their vote, that they have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been losing their democratic right to have an influence on governments, both federal and state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new arrangements do meet the concerns of the public. They meet, as far as is practical, the concerns of the state and territory governments. The members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee should be congratulated on recognising these and on coming up with a deliberate way of satisfying some of the concerns that have been raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaties will have to be tabled for 15 sitting days before any decisions can be made. That will allow scrutiny. It will allow debate. It will allow people to become involved in issues that they are concerned with. An exceptional circumstances provision is there for when parliament is not sitting. I think that we all recognise the need for that. The national interest and people's concerns will be met through analysis, which will accompany the tabling of the treaty. No treaty will be ratified without an analysis of the impact a treaty will have on Australia and the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A joint parliamentary committee on treaties will be set up to scrutinise treaties before they come into parliament. The proposed treaties council will include representations from states and territories and will be part of the COAG agreement. There will be a database for information on treaties, and that will be able to be accessed by all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a red&hyphen;letter day for Australia. It is a day that should be recognised. A newly formed government has tried to grapple, and has grappled successfully, with an issue that has been raised on numerous occasions in Australia. I would say that it is of concern to rural Australia, and it is of even more concern to the people of the cities because they have seen democratic rights being eroded through treaties laid down on the Franklin Dam, on the wilderness areas in the north of Queensland, and on the timber industry where rights were completely eroded under an international treaty. Jobs were lost and industries were destroyed. People then started to take note of treaties being forced down their throats. But they had no practical way of voting against those treaties or of using the democratic <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="238"> process to stop those treaties going ahead and affecting their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in contrast to the Labor Party's gung&hyphen;ho approach of dumping 36 treaties on the table&mdash;seven of which have come into force and 16 of which have been ratified&mdash;that process will never be allowed to happen again while this government is in power. I believe that that will be for a very long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are seeing now&mdash;it may not be obvious to Senator Schacht or senators opposite&mdash;is one of the first processes of a new government taking the concerns that have been expressed to the National and Liberal parties by the people through their branches and through other processes. These concerns have been recognised by the two parties, and action has been taken at the earliest possible opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I once again congratulate the people who were responsible for the report: the members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. They have done a good job, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in responding in such a quick fashion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA>However, all this is made somewhat irrelevant when one puts it alongside the move by the former government, with the support of the then opposition, to bring before this parliament the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995. That bill would have negated the effect of many of the treaties Australia has signed by removing any administrative necessity to fulfil our interna <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> tional obligations unless expressly legislated by the parliament. The passage of such legislation would have severely damaged Australia's international reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Justice Elizabeth Evatt said in her oral submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee's inquiry into that bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the anti&hyphen;Teoh legislation, as abbreviated&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">gives the message that we have no reasonable expectation that our government will comply with obligations that it has undertaken. I would be ashamed to have to say that at an international forum.</PARA>
<PARA>Many others have spoken out against the gutting of Australia's international obligations through the so&hyphen;called anti&hyphen;Teoh bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a void in Australia's international treaty procedures. We have not had an effective and comprehensive mechanism for consultation, scrutiny and implementation of international instruments. So I could not agree more heartily with Senator Bourne, who expressed her grave concerns about the Australian&hyphen;Indonesian security treaty that was negotiated in such a secretive way and with such disdain for democratic principles. I do agree with and endorse the comments previously made in relation to concerns that that way of entering into treaty making is utterly unacceptable and undemocratic. I believe the new government has made a strong stand. By that, I hope it will distance itself from any such similar behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must disagree, however, with Senator Bourne and the Democrats, who assert that parliament should dictate to and veto the executive in the area of international treaties. Treaties are essentially aspirational. International treaties ensure that standards are set which have a wider perspective than that brought by any one country. Treaties provide a measure of intent which, hopefully, will be greater than that allowed by the political <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="239"> exigencies of any one country. Treaties allow the international community to focus on what should be, rather than on what we can get put in place back home. Because treaties are aspirational, even the negotiation process can compromise ideals and in some sense already international treaties are the result of the lowest common denominator approach. However, this would be exacerbated much further if that were the result of the domestic parliament constraining the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These particular reforms that we have in place and see introduced today are historic. They will keep the executive accountable without allowing the executive to be rendered impotent in relation to its very responsible role in international fora. The Commonwealth government has the right to participate in international fora and the responsibility to exercise its national role in the global community. That right and responsibility does not give it licence to make treaties without open and clear processes of consultation with the Australian community and with the parliament. These measures today guarantee that that licence not be allowed in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Neither should that right and responsibility of treaty making give any government the licence to enter into treaties and make treaties without any intention of honouring them in its administrative decision making. That is why I have referred to the High Court decision on Teoh, which affirmed the common law position of 1969, that there should be a legitimate expectation that decision makers will take provisions of international conventions into consideration. Therefore the Greens (WA) welcome the government's reforms in relation to treaty making and believe it will go far in addressing the community's concerns about the role of treaties in the past and in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to take a somewhat different position from some of the earlier speakers in this debate. I differ from my colleague, Senator Schacht, and actually welcome the response by the minister to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. I think it is admirable and it sets a standard, which I hope will be repeated <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through the life of the parliament, that committee reports will be responded to with the speed with which this one has been responded to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been mentioned that the government has only had two months in which to respond to the report. That is absolutely correct because the election was only held two months ago today, and here we are discussing the response. That perhaps overlooks the fact that the report has actually  been in the parliament and in the public eye now for six months. A considerable amount of work has been done on the report and the preparation of the response by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In commending the government for the speed in which the response has been brought into the parliament, one must also commend the individuals who are part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the efforts that they have put into the preparation of the response that we are debating in the Senate this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do agree with my colleague Senator Schacht, though, on the content of the response. I would urge people, particularly those who spoke earlier, not to get too carried away with the response that is before us. I have not had the opportunity of having an early copy of the report, but I do not believe that it does all the things that has been said of it in this place. Hopefully, in the few minutes remaining to me here, I will be able to deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the minister, in delivering his response here this afternoon, dwelt more on the contents of the government's reforms&mdash;as foreshadowed in its foreign affairs and law and justice policy statements enunciated before the election&mdash;than on the recommendations in the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The minister said that the changes would provide proper and effective procedures to enable parliament to scrutinise intended treaty action. It is commendable if they do that, but it would have been more honest if the minister had said that the changes would provide proper and effective procedures to enable parliament to scrutinise some policy <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="240"> actions as they relate to treaties, because that is what the committee was about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recognised when we were taking evidence and when we were deliberating on and preparing the report that there would be some treaties that this country would enter into that would not be the subject of the scrutiny of the parliament. Indeed, I believe, and I can be corrected, that one of the treaties mentioned here today by Senator Bourne&mdash;the one relating to Indonesia which was publicised late last year&mdash;was supported by the then opposition and that it will not repudiate the content of the treaty now that it is in government. So it might have been more honest if the minister had enunciated that it is only some things that will change. I welcome the changes that are going to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal in part&mdash;and very briefly because of the time limitations here today&mdash;with the contents and the detail of the response. Essentially, what we have before us, and I welcome it, is a holding report; it is a holding response. The real response hopefully will come in two years when, as the minister said, the government will review the new tabling arrangements. They consider that then, two years hence, will be the most appropriate time to consider the need for legislation and any suggestion that there might be a further examination of a parliamentary approval system. This response does not automatically give that parliamentary approval system now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not go near, as my colleague Senator Bolkus has said. Recommendation 2 of the report recommends legislation provide that the government report to parliament annually. The response to this recommendation says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government agrees to table annually a list of Commonwealth legislation specifically implementing Australia's treaty obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very distinct difference in the words, and a more distinct difference in the meaning of the words. The committee asked for legislation: the government said that it will agree to table a list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recommendation 3 was agreed to. Recommendation 5 was not accepted and there are <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reasons given in the response as to why it was not accepted. Recommendation 6 called for the government to increase its efforts to identify and consult. The response is that that recommendation is accepted. The comment actually does not take the response all that much further than what has become, in recent years, the current practice&mdash;the practice that has evolved in consulting with representative groups, with individuals and with non&hyphen;government organisations. I hasten to add that the comment that goes with the response is that it has been accepted by the government. Recommendation 7 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the existing Commonwealth&hyphen;State Standing Committee on Treaties be abolished and replaced with a Treaties Council that is preferably established by legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts the need to establish a treaties council.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a very great difference between accepting the need to establish a treaties council and going out there and legislating, or even giving a commitment to legislate, to establish one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee recommended, yet again, a legislative means to progress what we had determined would arise out of the committee's inquiry. We called for legislation to be enacted which would require the tabling of treaties in both houses of the Commonwealth parliament within 15 sitting days. We recognised, as a committee, that it would not always be possible to do that within 15 sitting days. I welcome the fact that some of the earlier speakers recognised that in some instances it could be up to three months before the parliament would have an opportunity to table the treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally important in the process was the fact that the committee lent itself to the legislative path. However, from the response it seems that there is no wish to move to legislative means at all. I think that is a bit sad but I also welcome the fact that the matter will be looked at within a two&hyphen;year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to recommendation 9, the committee again took the legislative path by recommending the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee on treaties. That has <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="241"> not been accepted by the government. They say that a better way of progressing this would be by resolutions of both houses of parliament. I understand that sometime today&mdash;perhaps the manager of government business might nod in approval&mdash;we will be told what the joint committees of the parliament are going to be.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party and the National Party went to the last election on the promise of reforming the processes of parliament. I welcome the government's response to this report because if there has been one criticism of the treaty&hyphen;making process in the past, it has been of its lack of transparency and of the lack of community involvement. Literally, members of this parliament could wake up one morning finding that we had entered into international obligations without any consultation with the parliament of Australia and without any consultation with the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we now know, as a result of certain High Court decisions in recent times, these international treaties can affect our domestic laws in ways in which the Australian Labor Party used to say they would not be affected. There were people on this side of the chamber, such as the capable Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Kemp, and others who made comments to the effect that these international treaties would be of importance in determining our domestic law. The High Court has now, I say regrettably, confirmed that view. It is absolutely important that the system of international treaty making <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="242"> be made transparent and be made subject to the Australian parliament and through that to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some two years ago, in my first speech in this place, I expressed my concerns at the way in which the international treaty&hyphen;making process was subverting our federal system of government. Basically the federal government could simply sign any international treaty and thereby get a head of power to legislate in areas which had usually been the preserve of the states. That provided a great degree of uncertainty in constitutional law. If there is one thing that any country needs it is certainty in the law. Unfortunately, the treaty&hyphen;making processes adopted, especially under the past Labor government, were such that the certainty of law was undermined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response has been a considered and appropriate one. Furthermore, I am delighted that the government has taken the initiative to respond so quickly. Indeed, I believe it is the government's first response to a Senate committee report. It is a great credit to Mr Downer&mdash;I listened to his comments in the House of Representatives&mdash;and to others in the new Howard&hyphen;Costello government that they have brought down this report so quickly and yet so thoughtfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought the 11 recommendations that the committee made were good ones. At the time that the report was brought down, I indicated that I had limited some of my thoughts and views to ensure that we could get a unanimous report. It is disappointing when a unanimous report is not fully accepted by the government. But this new government has been left with a fiscal hole of $8 billion&mdash;the legacy of the Labor government&mdash;and, as a result, some of the initiatives in this report cannot be implemented, simply because that would just add to the financial dilemma that this country finds itself in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am hopeful that once we have got the economic imperatives back in order the government may be able to revisit its considered response to this report and ascertain whether, after some of the Labor legacy debt has been paid off, funds could possibly be made available to implement some of the programs suggested by our committee. This <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would ensure that the people of Australia have a say in international treaty making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was delighted that during the campaign the then shadow Attorney&hyphen;General, Senator Amanda Vanstone, was able to announce the Liberal Party's policy in relation to international treaty making. That policy was to look through an international treaty and ascertain what domestic obligations might flow from that treaty if we were to sign it, and to implement those domestic obligations prior to signing the actual international treaty. We could then go to the world with a clear conscience and say, before signing the international treaty, `We have already abided by our international obligations by having legislated domestically.' <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the exact reverse of what those on the other side did. They would sign treaties so that they could somehow use their powers to effect changes in the law. There have been occasions on which the signing of international treaties was done without any thought whatsoever as to the domestic obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is how the former Labor government got itself into so much trouble. The Labor government used to prance around talking about its international obligations until the High Court told the Labor government, `You have international obligations. Your laws are not to be upheld and we will impose those international obligations on you.' What did the Labor government do? It ran in to this parliament with a bill to overturn the High Court decision and thereby to overturn its international obligations. In anybody's language that is two&hyphen;faced. You either believe and take seriously your international obligations or you do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this government, as opposed to the former government, has taken a fresh look at this issue and is going to act responsibly in this area. As a result, I have great delight in supporting the government response and welcoming the new approach to international treaty making.</PARA></SPEECH>

Commonwealth power to make and implement treaties</EMPHASIS> .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not long ago&mdash;perhaps two years, or slightly more&mdash;that the issue of considering treaties in this parliament was regarded as perhaps not being within the normal standards. I remember that, when we raised these issues and drew attention to some of the anomalies which were starting to come through as a result of the government's treaty&hyphen;making activities, we did not elicit a great response at the start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is encouraging about this whole process and about this report is not only the government's very positive response but also the responsive chord that it has clearly struck on all sides of the chamber. If we discount the contribution of Senator Chris Schacht and listen to the comments of Senator Cooney and others, there is no doubt that there was a very positive response to the government's statement today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly there has been a variety of views, including whether we should have gone a bit further. There was a debate when that issue was raised by the Democrats and the Greens. This is a prime example, certainly in my experience&mdash;six years in this parliament&mdash;of the way an issue can be raised and picked up by a variety of senators. It then attracts public attention; a serious committee looks at what can be done; recommendations are made; and the government acts in a positive manner in responding to the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I look back, there are a number of things which have generated widespread community concern about the treaty&hyphen;making activities of the previous government. The first one, which was given some attention by the committee, was the decision to allow domestic disputes to go to UN human rights committees without any public debate at all. Some people&mdash;for instance Justice Michael Kirby&mdash;have drawn attention to this matter and have noted that there was not much public debate at that time. Australians suddenly found that, as a result of a particular case which went to the UN human rights committees, an important process which could have constitutional implications for this country <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had been put into effect without any public debate about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another case which caused great concern was the ratification of ILO convention 158. This was an extraordinary occasion where, almost hours before the writs for the 1993 election were issued, this treaty was signed and ratified. It was really only after the election that people discovered what the government had done. My understanding was that there was no press statement at that time. That particular convention has been the subject of widespread public debate. Some elements of the industrial relations legislation of the previous government were based on it. But, as I said, it was signed without any community debate at all and there was no announcement by the government. That sort of approach, which the Hawke and Keating Labor governments had, did cause concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one would argue that many of the treaties we sign are not extremely important. And there is no argument that, in the world we have today, there will be more and more treaties which will have to be signed, both on a unilateral basis and a multilateral basis. But it is important that there be a proper process by which this is carried out because of the implications such treaties can have for the domestic affairs of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government has done today is to ensure that through the parliament the nation and its people are more effectively involved. The democratic deficit, which Sir Ninian Stephen drew attention to in an excellent speech about 12 months ago, is starting to be effectively addressed. In my view, we have taken a very important step forward in treaty&hyphen;making processes through this announcement today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="244"> I can remember having a debate with the former Senator Gareth Evans on this issue. We were discussing the treaty&hyphen;making activities of the previous government and I asked him, `Is there no way our people should be involved?' He said, and I believe I am quoting him correctly: `No way, Jose.' The former government really did feel that any parliamentary involvement in the treaty&hyphen;making process&mdash;and one way we have put forward here is essentially more effective parlia mentary scrutiny&mdash;would somehow threaten the treaty&hyphen;making regime which it had adopted and it was prepared to ignore contrary voices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly welcome the fact that as this debate has occurred over the last two or three years virtually all sections of the political spectrum have become involved. The Democrats have been very actively involved and Senator Bourne has spoken quite regularly on the subject in this chamber. As was pointed out in the debate today, the bill that she put forward went further than the ministerial statement which has now been presented. Senator Chamarette used the word `historic' in her response. She did not feel that it was appropriate that the parliament move to have the capacity to actually veto a treaty, but my understanding was that she welcomed the greater scrutiny and the greater chance for more effective public involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this has been a very important process. It has been very encouraging to see that an issue such as this can be put firmly on the national agenda, and that political parties which differ on many things&mdash;and this is an issue on which many do differ&mdash;can sit down, take evidence, do a serious report and make some important proposals which are very rapidly responded to by the government. Given my own interest in this area, I would certainly like to extend congratulations to the committee members, through their chairman, Senator Ellison, and to the secretary, Anne Twomey, who did an excellent job in the preparation of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to read a press cutting&mdash;I think it was from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">London Times</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that was sent to me recently. This committee report was in fact referred to in the mother of parliaments in London. It is interesting that there was a debate&mdash;in the House of Lords, I think&mdash;which was based very much on the sorts of assumptions that underlie the report that we have here. That debate turned to the fact that it was very important that parliaments become more effectively involved in the treaty&hyphen;making process. That was in the UK, and I think it shows how even the effect of a good committee report can extend far wider than one would sometimes imagine.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I welcome the report which has been brought down. I certainly find most encouraging the very positive responses which have come from all sides of the chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do so against a background of interest in the subject. I think one of the first questions I asked in this place when I became a member some six years ago was a question at estimates related to treaties. I know my colleague Senator Kemp has taken a keen interest in that matter. I was always concerned about the way treaties were used to interfere&mdash;as I call it&mdash;with the making of domestic law, when there was no right, without the proper parliamentary processes, to use treaties in such a way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to concentrate on ILO convention 158, because that convention was the one brought in at one minute to midnight before the calling of the last election, and that was the convention used by Mr Brereton of the Labor Party to hang his industrial relations reform legislation on. We all know of the problems that arose from the use of that convention in terms of that legislation, particularly with regard to unfair dismissal laws, and of the pain that it caused to so many businesses and employees. I believe it cost many people the opportunity of gaining a job, because it overrode what was really the province of the states. As that convention had never been before either of the houses of parliament or had a proper opportunity to be scrutinised by the states, it was an inappropriate use of power by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="245"> In terms of the government's response, that particular action will never be able to occur again, because it will have to go through the proper processes of this parliament&mdash;and so it should. In terms of what was in that act, if it had been presented here and debated prop erly by the various parties in this place, and thus people had had the proper opportunity to analyse the powers that existed in it in terms of relationships between the states and the Commonwealth, I question whether that treaty would ever have got up or got past the scrutiny of this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This response, as I have already emphasised, will prevent that from ever happening again. For that reason, I feel very comfortable with that aspect of it. When we make domestic law, it affects the Commonwealth, the states and the community, and it should be made within the province of the Australian nation. You should not be able to hang it, in the way that this was done, on conventions which are made by people outside of this country, people who have no feeling or understanding of how we operate as a Commonwealth country. The importance of this decision will manifest itself and we will see better legislation in coming years as a result of it. As a Western Australian, I must say that it has long been a contentious issue at our state conferences, and the various forums of the lay party, that decisions are made and hooked to these conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to acknowledge the work that was done in terms of convincing people of the necessity to reform this particular aspect of the operations of treaties and get them before the federal parliament. Bill Hassell, a president of the party not so long ago, a member of the Western Australian state parliament and a leader of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, did make this an issue many years ago, when it was not so popular, and he pursued it. I think Bill would rest very happy today to know that we have this report before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join my colleagues and people from the other side in congratulating the members of the committee&mdash;Senator Chris Ellison, Senator Cooney, Senator Abetz, Senator McKiernan, Senator Neal, Senator O'Chee, Senator Spindler and Senator Vanstone, and the participating members: senators Chamarette, Margetts, Kemp and Short&mdash;for bringing this report before us. It demonstrates that when members of the Senate put their minds to addressing a particular issue, and put party <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> politics aside momentarily, they can come up with a document that is representative of the views of the states, the Australian people and the parliament. I take this opportunity to congratulate the committee, and in doing so I include staff members who worked on particular aspects, for bringing this report before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very good day for the Australian parliament. As I have heard other speakers say, I think that the quick response to this, now that we are in government, demonstrates that as a government we intend to respond to things and be a government of action. Having made those comments, I reiterate that I am delighted that this report is before us today. I re&hyphen;emphasise my congratulations to those people who worked on it and to the minister for getting it into this place so quickly.</PARA></SPEECH>

The committee itself deserves Australia's congratulations. Senator Ellison, Senator Abetz and others have done a terrific job and have given great credence to the Senate committee process. They have demonstrated how valuable Senate committees can be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="246"> It was very disheartening and disappointing to read what former Senator Gareth Evans said in the House of Representatives the other day in relation to Mick Young when he condemned the Senate in the vein of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. While he did not use the word `swill', he certainly described the Senate as unrepresentative and he used other derogatory terms. I think it is very disappointing that someone who has served in this chamber for so long should go to the House and condemn his former cham ber when the Senate has just demonstrated its great value through this committee process by delivering this report which has now been acted upon and which is, as has been pointed out, a unanimous Senate report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was very encouraging to hear Labor senators applaud the government's response. Of course, it is interesting to us that Labor remains divided on this issue, with Senator Schacht taking a different line. It is a reflection upon the former government that we have come to this. It was the former government that brought the treaty&hyphen;making process into disrepute. This was never an issue in Australian politics prior to the advent of the Hawke&hyphen;Keating government. The external affairs power of the constitution was treated as an external affairs power. Many of us have watched the ALP over many years and we were not surprised to see that its centralist pretensions were put into effect through the back door of the constitution in a way which really did begin to subvert the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party really has a central core philosophy that is centralist, that is not supportive of a federal structure of government, that does not like this Senate, that does not like the existence of states and does not like the fact that we have a constitution which prescribes the powers of the central government, and the remaining powers lie with the states. That is not a model they support and they have always attempted to centralise authority in Canberra. The external affairs power suddenly became a magic door that opened for them to pursue that path in a very dangerous and subversive way through the course of the 13 years during which, unfortunately, they remained in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We propose to bring that to an end and we have done so with a very comprehensive response. All treaties will now be tabled in the parliament at least 15 days before they are ratified. We will genuinely seek consultation with the people and with the community. It will not be the false consultative model adopted by Labor where a few peak interest groups were brought into the inner sanctum and given special privileges. We will be a genuinely consultative government. Our approach to treaties is demonstrated by this statement today.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a genuine respect for the parliament, unlike Labor in its previous guise. We will be tabling these things in the parliament with, I note, a national interest analysis that will accompany the tabling&mdash;a very comprehensive assessment of the domestic impact of these treaties that are proposed for ratification. I think that will be a tremendous advance in involving the parliament in the process of executive government. The creation of a joint standing committee on treaties is a terrific advance and, of course, as a federalist party, a major advance in forming a treaties council as an adjunct to the Council of Australian Governments, so that states and territories who are affected by international treaties can be involved in the analysis of their effects and the question of their ratification. And there is to be, of course, the treaties database administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs. These are all tremendous advances which we welcome and which the government must be commended for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of parliamentary veto of treaties, I suppose, is one that will always be there. We are not supporting that proposition. I think we go a very long way towards opening up the process and towards involving parliament in it. We will not have the farce where dozens of treaties are dumped in the Senate allowing only a few minutes for feeble comments to be made on them, with no time at all for any proper debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not think parliamentary veto is an option. The parliament has the option of vetoing any laws made with respect to any treaties that are entered into. Nevertheless, this is a very comprehensive statement, and a welcome end to the 13 years of development of the subversion of the constitution by abuse of the external affairs power which has now been brought to an end.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Last night I gave an adjournment speech in which I indicated that a friend of mine, Glen Roy Pears, had still not been identified as a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="247"> result of the Port Arthur massacre, and that certain elements in the media, in particular the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , had been harassing the family and others for details.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Severe burns meant his body could not be identified by police until late Tuesday night.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this implies&mdash;although my name is not mentioned&mdash;that what I said last night was wrong. This morning at about 11 o'clock I rang Sergeant Chris Ellis, the coroner's clerk in Tasmania, and he once again confirmed that my friend Glen Pears has not been identified and is still listed as missing. I then read to Sergeant Ellis that sentence from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  and he indicated to me that he had no idea how any journalist could have that sort of information, because the police have not identified the body. I simply make this plea to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , Helen Pitt and any other journalist: why do you write stories like this, why do you manufacture `facts' which are not facts? It is just for the sake of a story.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I simply say that Australian Associated Press gave my speech last night high priority rating. And, guess what? Not a single media outlet ran with it, but a low priority rating story from the Newspaper Publishing Association congratulating themselves on the coverage of the Port Arthur massacre got a run. I hope that out of this sorry saga the media in this country start to look at their ethics and start to adopt practices which are more in tune with the ethics and morality that I think the Australian community want but, more importantly, deserve.

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very real possibility. And Senator Collins&mdash;who would take a lot of distinguishing from a crocodile at various times&mdash;ought to know that that is exactly what is going on here. The fact is that, if you listen to some of the ALP and public service union spokespeople&mdash;or some of them at least&mdash;you would think that what is in contemplation is a massive downsizing all as a result of policies that we have simply decided to implement unilaterally without any particular need to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that we went into the last election with you lot promising faithfully on a stack of bibles that there would be a budget surplus. You would think that nothing had <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> changed since then, but the fact is that Treasury has made it abundantly clear that some tough action needs to be taken. It is very clear that you were not prepared to take it. Unfortunately we have now been given that responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at what will be put in place since the last election, we have a threefold approach. We gave a commitment prior to the election to a two per cent reduction in running costs. That is currently being implemented. In meeting our commitments we also spelt out some particular agencies where we thought there was scope for additional cuts and that approach is also being implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over and above all that is the need to address your $8 billion Beazley black hole. The fact is that you just cannot conjure those figures out of nowhere. I know you would like to pretend that it is business as usual, but it simply is not. Over a period of 10 years from 1986 to 1996 what you did without telling anyone was reduce the size of the public service from 181,000 to 146,000. In other words, 35,000 people were surreptitiously given the boot, some of them by involuntary redundancies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, in the last financial year you had a further 19.2 per cent reduction; something like 14,000 people were taken off the list. We are sensitive to the needs of those people. We are not proposing to simply slash and burn for the sake of it. It will be a managed reduction. It will be negotiated pursuant to the Australian Public Service award. We are not setting targets and hopefully we will be able to achieve the great bulk of that on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that you are the ones who imposed on the Australian community the necessity for those sorts of reductions to be pursued. Therefore it is absolute hypocrisy&mdash;as Senator MacGibbon's question made plain&mdash;to suggest that somehow this is all our fault. It is almost entirely your fault, simply because of the combination&mdash;under the guise of a one per cent efficiency dividend&mdash;of your getting rid of all those thousands of public sector employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That process you put in place is what is currently under discussion. So, when you read <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="249"> about job reductions in certain departments, bear in mind that some of those relate to precisely the process that you had already put in train. The rest of them will relate to the $8 billion hole, thank you very much.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell you, Senator Vanstone. The results of the election prove that Labor's quota, which has never looked secure, is now entirely remote. I will come to the figures later. The sad thing is how unwilling some members opposite are to acknowledge how important it is to Australia that so many women have come into the federal parliament. I think that when you have a spokesman for the Labor Party saying, `Oh, but they're all going to lose.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sad thing is that the Labor Party does not look like ever achieving their goal. They have one more federal election before the year 2002 in which they have to get 35 per cent of winnable seats. At the last election they had 12 seats where people were retiring which they could have filled with women. Two seats had women retiring and they did not fill one of them with a woman. How can they possibly smirk over on that side of the chamber, Mr President? But on this side the Liberal Womens' Forum under Dame Margaret Guilfoyle helped women to learn techniques and to gain confidence in applying for preselection and then election by the public. It was a proven method that worked: giving assistance to those who are interested in standing for parliament. That is going to give you long&hyphen;term&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, yesterday in question time you intimated that Australia has the highest local telephone call rates in the world. Are you aware that the March survey by cost analysts NUS International showed that Australian local call prices are lower than comparable countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands? Are you also aware that the Bureau of Industry Economics has said that Australia's household phone rental rates are comparatively low and, in particular, are about half of New Zealand's, where home phone rentals have risen by 30 per cent since privatisation? Finally, what lessons do you draw from the first eight years of privatisation <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="258"> in Britain, where local call rates rose by 27 per cent and domestic installation costs rose by a massive 61 per cent, with only government regulation preventing further rises?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the parrot brigade will listen to the answer, I will explain it. The reason they have very high access charges is to compensate for the fact that they have free local residential calls. You cannot compare the access charges of a country that has no local residential calls with a country that has both. Therefore, if you look at Australia's access charges under NUS, I think you will find that we are about the fifth highest out of the 12&hyphen;day survey. I have not seen the latest one, but it is consistent with the one before that. NUS has done consistent surveys on local call charges in recent years which have shown that Australia&mdash;I think they reduced the rate of 25c to 23.8c to average it out&mdash;effectively has the highest local call charges in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is rather sad that you want to quibble about whether or not the rate is 25c or 24c or whether it is the highest or maybe only the second highest. The fact is that it is far too high and there are ways in which you can get these things down very substantially. If you look at the New Zealand experience, for example, you will find that 10 years ago their level of total factor productivity was well below that of Telstra's. Over the last decade they have doubled the rate of growth and they are now performing much better than us. That just happens to coincide with the privatisation process which commenced in 1988 and, of course, the opening up to very dramatic competition, even without a regulator. Their regulatory costs are much lower than ours and their levels of efficiency are much higher than ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> We have all learnt from the British experience; we borrowed Austel. One of the reasons why we introduced consumer guarantee prop osals in our election commitments was that we were concerned to ensure that those benefits flowed on&mdash;that you did not simply find even worse quality of service as a result of any major changes that you might make. We are actually going to require penalties to be paid if installation and maintenance calls are not made on time. I do not regard it as satisfactory for Telstra to agree to come to your premises. You take the day off waiting for them and then they say, `Sorry, we couldn't make it.' We are actually putting in place a very rigid and effective customer regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what I find deeply disturbing about this whole debate? When the Democrats were asked, `What further customer protections would you like in relation to the privatisation of Telstra?', they said, `We're not really interested in that at all; we are simply opposed. In other words, we have a blind ideological commitment based on 1960s notions of natural monopolies. We are not concerned about how you could deliver the goods for consumers.' Go off and study the rest of the world. You will find that they are all going down that privatisation track for the one very good reason that it has enormous consumer benefits. You would say that the rest of the world is out of step. You would say that they all have $8 billion holes and that is why they are doing it. They are all doing it because they know that you can achieve dramatic efficiencies. The only way you will get costs down and quality of service up is to make the sorts of cuts that Telstra itself recognises needs to be made.</PARA>

The people we will appoint to a board that is charged with the very important responsibility of oversighting civil aviation will be people with the requisite experience.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my question is addressed to Senator Short, who is the Minister representing the Treasurer. One of our government election promises was a family tax incentive. Minister, could you explain to the Senate how this initiative will give recognition to the families so badly ignored by Labor, particularly those with very young children and single parents.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="260" SPEAKER="Short, Sen Jim" NAMEID="DJ4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Knowles for that question because it demonstrates the vast gulf that exists between Labor and the Howard government in their attitudes towards families. Under the Labor government Australian families were absolutely ravaged so far as their living standards were concerned. In contrast, the new government has the well <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> being of Australian families at the very highest point of its priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, under Labor the wellbeing of Australian families was ravaged. Real wages fell. Those on the lowest incomes saw their earnings fall the most. Middle Australia found it harder to make ends meet and to save for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current account deficit and the foreign debt forced up interest rates to amongst the highest in the world, which hurt every Australian family. Average monthly mortgage repayments rose by nearly 50 per cent during Labor's term in government and many Australians have seen the value of their most prized possession, the family home, fall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During Labor's 13 years there was a dramatic increase in taxes payable and that impacted heavily on every family. We all know the infamous promises of tax cuts with which the then government lied its way back into office in 1993, only to break those promises and deceive every Australian family after the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr President, the coalition believes that families are the very best social welfare system that has ever been devised. One of the greatest challenges of modern family life is to balance effectively work commitments and goals against family responsibilities and aspirations. Any credible family policy must be directed at helping families to achieve that balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's $1 billion family tax package does just that. It demonstrates our commitment to Australian families, particularly low and middle income families. It will give families greater incentive and more choice about how they balance their work and their family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family package is a two&hyphen;pronged initiative and it will deliver assistance to families with children, commencing on 1 January 1997. It will benefit all types of Australian families&mdash;working couples with children, single income families and single parent families. It also recognises the extra cost of very young children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be two forms of assistance available to eligible families on the basis of <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="261"> income testing, with one being based on the number of children in the family. As to the matter Senator Knowles particularly asked about, there will be an additional level of assistance available to single income families with a child under the age of five. The policy package is designed to restore the wellbeing of every Australian family.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Sherry today, relating to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Short showed that he was totally unprepared not only for my question but for the range of economic questions put to him today by the opposition. Since he could not give me an answer to my question, for his edification I have obtained the information from the library. Australia's tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in 1993 was 28.7 per cent&mdash;second lowest to Turkey. If we look through a list of the revenue statistics for 24 OECD countries, we see that Australia has the second lowest tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. Let us look at outlays, which the new government is busily <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> slashing in its slash and burn approach to the budget. Australia's outlays as a percentage of GDP is 37.3 per cent&mdash;the second lowest only to the United States of America. Yet we have accusations from the new government that taxation was too high under the former Labor government and that expenditure was too high under the former Labor government. Nothing can be further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise for not having given a copy of these tables to Senator Short. I seek leave to incorporate a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">OECD Revenue Statistics</EMPHASIS> and of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">OECD Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> for December 1995 which shows the percentage of nominal gross domestic product total outlays.</PARA>

Anyone on either side of the chamber who thinks that a monthly balance of payments deficit of $1.5 billion is a good result has no right to represent any economic portfolio in this parliament. It is still a disastrously high result. It is good that the deficit is falling; we welcome that. I readily acknowledge that.

My second point is that I did not deny today that, within the span of OECD countries, Australia is down towards the lower end of taxation. I have never denied that. This government has never denied that. But that is a difficult comparison to make accurately. It also totally ignores the tax regimes of many of our main competitor countries&mdash;the developing nations of Asia and South East Asia. It is those countries that are the biggest competitive threat and that also have a competitive advantage. So you cannot ignore the wider than OECD tax regime comparisons.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Short), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to the effect of proposed budget cuts on information technology.</PARA>
<PARA>In question time today I asked Senator Short a very direct and succinct question about where does the government stand on its election promises. What I was met with was, in the first place, a reply that he stands by the answer he gave yesterday. Yesterday he did <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not give an answer, so I guess he stands by nothing at all. But today we never got an answer either. What we got was a confusion&mdash;and it may well be that the minister is in fact confused on this point&mdash;about an election undertaking and the budget process. I am not asking about the budget process; I am asking about the election undertaking. The election undertaking was quite clear and specific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time today I referred to this press release by Peter Costello, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and then shadow Treasurer, which he put down on 15 February 1996. It was headed, `Meeting our commitments'. Specifically, I table page three of that which is headed, `reduce information technology expenditure'. Then there is a list of financial implications showing a cut in the IT budget by the government of, in 1996&hyphen;97, $350 million; in 1997&hyphen;98, $335 million and in 1998&hyphen;99, $300 million, a total over the three&hyphen;year period of $985 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was a commitment given by the opposition prior to the election in an effort to demonstrate to the Australian people that they could fund their election promises. Yesterday I asked a specific question: what studies did the opposition at the time undertake to see, if you slash information technology by that amount, what efficiencies that you could have achieved do you forgo, what services that you could have delivered to the Australian community do you forgo, or did you simply think of a figure and cut it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These sorts of decisions are not simply decisions of funding. These are decisions in which cost benefit analysis must be undertaken if you are serious about managing government responsibility. There ought to be, therefore, a consideration of what limitation on efficiency and services there will be by reducing the IT budget in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="265"> The opposition's position is clear. We do not want these cuts to occur. We do not think they should occur. I also wanted to know from the government whether or not they had conferred with the Australian information technology industry. It is a major supplier of services to the government. A cut of this nature will devastate it. It is a highly competi tive industry worldwide. Australia has a very competitive position in that industry. In part its position of competitiveness is achieved because it is able to win government contracts in this country. If you deny it that opportunity its economies of scale suffer and its ability to win markets in the world is reduced accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just `a savings measure'. This is a measure which reduces services that the government can provide, efficiencies that the government can achieve. By this cut you do cut off your nose to spite your face. It is not a saving. Reducing these expenditures is indeed a cost. More than that, they create the prospect of job loss in information technology industries. If Australia is not world competitive in that field, given that we are in an information age and an information revolution, then we will be importing foreign made computers and foreign made information technology, which will blow the current account deficit right off the face of the earth. This is a serious matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I want to know is: does the government intend to honour the commitment it gave before the election to make these cuts? I would like to hear a big no, but, since yesterday my inquiry was described as entirely speculative, I simply ask. This is not a speculative matter. You have said on the record that the black letter of what you have proposed is that you will do this. Are you going to do it or are you not? Do we have to simply wait for four months because you confuse an election undertaking with the budget process? Do we have to wait four months to find out? What does the Australian information technology industry do in the meantime? Does it hold back investment or does it proceed with it? Does it continue to prepare applications for government tender or does it not? Do you put the whole industry in stall, ultimately leading to free&hyphen;fall and a lack of competitiveness? What do you do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that there is a deafening refusal to answer that question is a major condemnation of the government and a position in which the government is clearly offside with a leading sector of the Australian business community, and a leading area of Australian industry <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which is the hope of this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>It then goes on to say this, which Senator Kernot magically missed:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="266">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This profile, incorporating a period of temporary weakness, was implied in the economic forecasts released by the Treasurer on 12 March 1996 as background to a statement of the Government's fiscal policy intentions. It is also consistent with expectations recorded in recent business surveys.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this booklet that just came out clearly shows that these factors were taken into account. Senator Kernot tried to misrepresent that to this chamber. I think that is just disgraceful, but no doubt it meets Senator Kernot's particular political requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that, as this document reveals, on 12 March 1996 the Treasurer released a revised estimate of the 1995&hyphen;96 Commonwealth budget position, revised projections of the budget position over the medium term and the government's intended strategy for reducing the budget deficit. The revised budget figures contained in the table include the impact of policies announced by the previous government but not the underlying budget balances for the out years. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the underlying budget balances for the outyears similarly reflects weaker economic parameters and in addition the impact of projected public debt interest payments of the upward revisions to the Budget deficits over the forecast period.</PARA>
<PARA>The document then goes on to say, on page 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer announced the objective of returning the Budget to an underlying balance in 1997&hyphen;98 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In this very document it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this will involve measures to reduce the Budget deficit by $4 billion in 1996&hyphen;97 and a further $4 billion in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not revised. There is no resiling from the $8 billion. Not on your nelly. This document confirms what was said to the Treasurer and the revised budget deficit expectation&mdash;the $8 billion dollar blow&hyphen;out. It confirms it. It does not in any way diminish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="1"> Senator Kernot should be ashamed of herself. Another matter that is of significance in that document which should be brought to the attention of the Senate is that on a national accounts basis growth in unit labour costs increased significantly over the second half of 1995. This reflected on the one hand an increase in average earnings stemming from a pick up of wage pressures in 1995 com bined with increases in various other things&mdash;superannuation entitlements, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they are warning, if you like, that there is an underlying CPI inflation problem and that the longer term outlook for inflation will be heavily dependent on movements in labour costs and the stance of monetary policy.

If you do not believe that there is an $8 billion hole in the budget, you are saying that you do not believe the official forecasts that are on the public record and reinforced, as Senator Baume says, in the Treasury's bulletin of yesterday. Nothing that the bulletin article said yesterday in any way contradicts the official forecasts that are there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday's document does not provide an official revision of the forecasts. It does not say that at all. It simply reaffirms the underlying basis of the existing forecasts, and it is the existing forecasts on which the $8 billion black hole is based. There is no prevarication about this in any way at all. The $8 billion bottom line figure follows automatically on the government's official figures, which are based on those from Treasury. We are saying that until such time as forecasts change, and of course forecasts can change in the future, the only way in which any government can operate is on the basis of the existing forecasts. That is the only way in which government can operate responsibly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Kernot was putting to the Senate today, with great respect to you, Senator Kernot, was highly misleading because she gave the impression that somehow or other the Treasury was now saying something different from what it said in the release of the official forecasts, on which the government's $8 billion deficit has been based.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The new government has come into office professing honesty and integrity. But one of its first actions has been to make incorrect assertions about an $8 billion budget deficit. In fact, it does not just make an assertion, it boasts about an $8 billion so-called black hole. It is using this as an excuse to slash and burn not just public service jobs but a variety of public programs, like education and health. We are going to find out the true extent of that slash and burn, as ministers keep reiterating, in August when the budget is delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of aspects of the approach of the government that I want to deal with today, as do my colleagues Senator Cook and Senator Wheelwright. I want to place on record and reiterate Labor's economic record, since it is being subjected to some considerable rewriting of history&mdash;a rewriting of history that the new government was very fond of accusing the former Prime Minister of doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to examine very briefly the record of the Prime Minister (John Howard). If we have a black hole, you have a black void. Go and ask an astronomer what the difference is between the two. Your contribution to a black hole under John Howard as Treasurer, up until 1983, was massive compared to any alleged black hole we had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of our general economic performance, I would like to quote from a speech, which appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reserve Bank bulletin</EMPHASIS>, given by the head of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the standards of other developed countries we have not done badly. The economy has expanded <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by more than a third over the past decade and a proper interpretation of the data&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `a proper interpretation of the data'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;as well as casual observation&mdash;suggests that the vast majority of Australians are better off today than ever before. To be distracted by concerns that other countries (including some of our Asian neighbours)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as Senator Short alleged earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have caught up or surpassed us is to confuse the issues at stake.</PARA>
<PARA>I would also like to refer to the latest economic indicators in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> . Interestingly, of the dozen countries surveyed, Australia&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;has been at the top of the economic growth league over the last year. Australia is at the top of the economic growth league when compared to other comparable OECD western countries. That is a very impressive record. I will seek leave to incorporate that when I conclude my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have generally had good economic performance at a time, I might say, of severe drought and at a time when prices for our raw materials, particularly minerals, were very low in the world marketplace. We have had a good growth economy, particularly compared to the rest of the world. Even at the bottom of the business cycle, which is where we are at the present time, we have had economic growth running at just over three per cent. We have created on average 220,000 new jobs each year. That is a significant record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also connected with this has been an essential restructuring of the economy focused on export growth. An ANZ bulletin&mdash;which I was attempting to find; I do not have it in front of me at the moment&mdash;highlights the important transition of the Australian economy and the increase in export growth, particularly to Asia, over the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Inflation has been a very major constraint on the growth of the Australian economy, particularly in the last Liberal government. But under the Labor government, over the last 13 years, we have been able to reduce inflation to a target band of two per cent to three per cent, and perhaps lower. Looking at the figures that were released about 10 days ago of 0.4 per cent for the quarter, we may be <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="269"> able to maintain inflation in a lower band than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said about the current account, and certainly it could be better. We could have a more comfortably low current account. It is currently approximately 4&half; per cent of gross domestic product, but there has been a major improvement in recent times. It was approaching six per cent last year. The sorts of figures that were released today, which Senator Short and I referred to earlier, show a continuing downward trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A key to this, of course, is the issue of national savings. I highlight the introduction of the superannuation levy when we were in government. It has been adopted as a bipartisan policy. I will acknowledge that of the new government. They did not give us any credit for it. They opposed it bitterly when we introduced it. That will further enhance national saving, particularly when we get to the contribution of 15 per cent of total overall wages by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst on the issue of wages, we had an accord, which the new government has torn up. The new government has said, `We don't need any agreement on wages. Let the market decide.' That is an enormous gamble that the new Prime Minister and his Treasurer, Peter Costello, are taking. If it fails and inflation goes up, interest rates will go up. The new government is gambling that inflation will not rise and is taking a gamble on every Australian family's mortgage. I will make some brief comment about John Howard's&mdash;</PARA>

The difference is that a black hole has some substance; a black void has nothing in it at all. When Mr Howard was last Treasurer, the projected deficit in 1983-84 was $9.6 billion, or about 4.9 per cent of our gross domestic product. What would that be in today's dollar terms? It is $24.5 billion. That is what John Howard left us from his time as Treasurer in 1983-84.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not proud of it. In large part the figure is due to many of the promises made by the coalition at the last election. My colleague Senator Wheelwright will talk about projections and forecasts in some detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the coalition's promises, the other reason for this budget blow&hyphen;out has been the performance of the government, then in opposition, in this Senate. I think we have to refresh the memory of the now government about their performance in this Senate. In 1995-96, they knocked $265 million off our measures when we were in government. In 1996-97, the now government knocked over $2.5 billion of the then Labor government's budget, including airport sales, leasing proposals of $2 billion and building material proposals of $O.3 billion. When we went to the election there was a further $185 million worth of various measures held up in this Senate. When you take those sorts of billions of dollars into account, you see that the alleged $8 billion hole has been largely of the now government's own making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to the new government's promises at the election, which are included within this $8 billion hole. One of the promises the new government made was to cut IT expenditure by $985 million over three years. We will be fascinated to see whether they can carry out a cut of $985 million in IT expenditure, particularly when there are going to be so many public servants retrenched or made redundant through the government's slash and burn policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be particularly interested in the other promise written into this so&hyphen;called $8 billion; that is, the savings of about $500 million through reductions in fraud and by the tightening of the activity tests. There were a <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="270"> range of other issues estimated by Finance prior to the election&mdash;I am sure Senator Short has seen the figures&mdash;which expose shortfalls in the new government's election commitments. They are some of the reasons we are faced with this so-called $8 billion hole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really, what is it all about? It is not about good economic management. It is about a new government implementing its philosophical approach, which was very well outlined in Fightback over three years ago. It is Fightback. That is what it is. Fightback wasn't dead and buried. You decided to be clever and smart. You went to the last election with Fightback in the bottom draw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find fascinating about reading Fightback today is that many of the things you are doing now, particularly in cutting the Public Service, are in fact more severe than what is outlined in Fightback. So Fightback wasn't dead and buried. It was just put in the bottom draw and you took a politically smart position, as it turned out, to hide what you were going to do. That is the reality of both the cuts to the public service and the proposed cuts to government programs. That is why you are engaged in perhaps one of the biggest lies this country has ever seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a big one. I want to nail Senator Sherry on this one. He claimed that, of the $8 billion Beazley black hole, a significant portion of it&mdash;I am not sure what he said; I think he said almost half of it&mdash;was due to the policy commitments of the coalition government. Let me draw his attention to the latest Treasury bulletin, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Roundup</EMPHASIS> . On page 5 it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised budget figures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>those are the ones showing the $8 billion black hole&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">contained in the table below include the impact of policies announced by the previous government, but <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not the election commitments of the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that Senator Sherry will take the first available opportunity to correct the totally false statement that he made during his introduction to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Sherry believes that returning the budget to balance is an ideological obsession, then it is no wonder that Labor left Australia's finances in ruins and why the Australian people so comprehensively rejected Labor on 2 March. His assertion is in the same league as his incredible inference today that, somehow or other, a monthly balance of payments deficit of $1.5 billion, an annual deficit rate of $18 billion, is somehow good news. If that is good news, I would hate to hear what Senator Sherry regards as bad news for the Australian economy and for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry claims that we are in ideological pursuit of $8 billion spending cuts, but then he says that there is not really an $8 billion black hole left by Mr Beazley and the outgoing government. No-one else in Australia believes you, Senator Sherry. Every commentator, from the government's own official forecasts down, accepts the unequivocal fact that there is an $8 billion hole in the budget&mdash;a hole that the Labor government said, right until election day, did not exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, on the contrary, your then Minister for Finance, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was saying, `Everything is sweet, we are actually in surplus. The forward estimates show that we are going increasingly into surplus.' In fact, the forward estimates which the outgoing government knew existed were absolutely and totally the other way. They showed that the true situation was that the budget was going increasingly into deficit throughout the period of the forward estimates. There is absolutely no doubt that there is an $8 billion black hole. If there is anxiety in the community&mdash;and that is what is stated in the wording of Senator Sherry's matter of public importance today&mdash;it stems totally from Labor's ineptitude in having an irresponsible budget policy for many, many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party cannot hide its head in the sand any longer, nor can Australians, as Labor <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="271"> would have them pretend to be able to do. We do have to address, seriously, honestly and openly, the problems that we have inherited as a result of the mismanagement of Labor's rule. The difficult position that the new government is in financially, in terms of the budget, is a direct result of the opposition leader's deceit as finance minister. That said, the coalition government has made it clear that we will keep faith with our commitment to provide assistance to those most in need, despite the enormity of the fiscal problem facing us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The uncaring and irresponsible attitude to fiscal policy by Labor is the one thing that has created the problem that we now face. Labor got itself out of touch. It was unwilling or unable to face the challenges to get Australia on track. It seemed to live in cloud&hyphen;cuckoo&hyphen;land. Senator Cook, who I see is speaking later in this debate, was a leading architect of that through his ministerial portfolio. There were many others as well. Senator Sherry's claim in his MPI earlier today that a balanced budget is a mere ideological pursuit highlights the absolutely irresponsible cloud&hyphen;cuckoo&hyphen;land attitude of the Labor Party towards fiscal management and fiscal responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is this Labor mind-set that has led to five consecutive underlying budget deficits, despite the fact that the economy has been in a growth phase for the last four years. If you are going to run huge underlying budget deficits at a time when you have a period of economic growth, then the inevitable consequence of that is that you are going to produce over the life of the economic cycle an absolutely huge, even greater, underlying deficit. Of course, that causes huge problems for interest rates, for inflation, for competition, for our ability to provide for families in need, and for the opportunity for Australians to grow their living standards. It is this attitude&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Inflation is, I think, at a five-year high. It is exceeding the on average target that the previous government, your party, set as its benchmark. It is this attitude <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of Labor's that has led to a 400 per cent increase in Commonwealth debt. As a proportion of GDP, Commonwealth debt has gone up fourfold, I think, over the last five years or thereabouts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry, how many more budget deficits do you actually want? Why didn't Senator Sherry say today whether he believes an $8 billion budget deficit is acceptable? Would he seek to reduce that deficit? If not, then let him say so and let him be judged accordingly for the fiscal irresponsibility and stupidity that that implies. If, on the other hand, he does share the coalition's view that the Beazley $8 billion black hole is disastrous, unacceptable, and in desperate and urgent need of correction, then he should say so. He should also tell the Australian community how he would achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, far from anxiety induced by the new government, the policy agenda of the new government means that all Australians can look forward to a brighter and more prosperous future. That, I think, is the reason why the latest opinion polls show that the government is in stronger standing in the community than it was even at the time of the election. We are absolutely committed to stopping Labor's legacy of budget irresponsibility. We will make the necessary decisions to restore an underlying budget surplus. If Labor and the Democrats had any sense of fiscal responsibility, they would be sharing the wish to work with the government and the Australian people to correct the situation which is quite obviously untenable and in the worst interests of the nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have to ask the question: what sort of condition is the federal budget really in? Where did this $8 billion so-called black hole come from? It was almost entirely due to Treasury downgrading its economic forecast on growth to 3.25 per cent on 12 March. The debate really is not about whether Labor is more duplicitous than the coalition for the Democrats. For us, it is a matter of now looking at the impact of relying on an imprecise science of forecasting and the effect it will have on people's lives. We have to ask ourselves: firstly, are the forecasts right and, secondly, is the $8 billion spending cut the right response?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get up to that in a minute. Treasury admits in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Roundup</EMPHASIS>  that its GDP forecasts have been out by an average of 1.25 per cent over the past two decades. As I said earlier, 1.25 per cent translates into a $6 billion margin of error. Treasury says that by world standards that is not too bad. That is a real comfort&mdash;`by world standards that is not too bad'. But it is not a comfort to the thousands of public servants shortly to be out of work on the basis of a figure that is likely to be revised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You asked me this: what should we rely on? Since the release of the updated Treasury forecasts on 12 March, there have been a <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> string of economic indicators suggesting that Treasury was unduly pessimistic. Treasury's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Roundup</EMPHASIS> today says that the indications are that the growth slowdown is temporary and that growth should strengthen during the course of the calendar year. There are plenty of other indicators: today's balance of payments figures; the December national accounts, and we need to remember that those came out after the 12 March release; the various business investment surveys; credit growth figures&mdash;all of which have led the Reserve Bank and others to suggest stronger growth later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as black holes, I would suggest there is a black cloud over the growth figure. It is not because of former finance minister Kim Beazley's actions, but this could well be due to the actions of Treasurer Costello himself. For his determination to slash $8 billion out of the budget, there is the increased likelihood that that action will cut the growth rate by, according to the ANZ and Westpac forecasters, between one half and one per cent of GDP. Of course, that adds to unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of low growth requiring budget cuts&mdash;and that is the situation we are told we have&mdash;we could end up with a case of budget cuts made by the coalition causing low growth. In my view that is a self&hyphen;defeating policy adjustment. That leads us to fiscal policy. Irrespective of how much of the projected deficit is caused by forecast changes, how much deficit reduction is really needed? Recently the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, described as basically a failure the fact that after 17 quarters of growth the budget is not in surplus, and it is true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="273"> The previous Labor government did drop the ball on deficit reduction and one really important contributing factor in this was the 1993 One Nation tax cuts that were always unaffordable, unfunded and fiscally irresponsible. In 1994 they followed that by setting up $10 billion in the Working Nation employment programs, which were funded not through revenue and expenditure offsets, but from the growth dividend. In 1993 the Demo crats opposed those tax cuts as unaffordable and they were very badly targeted.</PARA>

We accept that, because of these key failings by Labor&mdash;and Senator Short asked me what I thought and what I would do&mdash;some element of fiscal repair is necessary, but how much remains a matter of careful judgment. The key factor must be the impact on unemployment. We need to remember that unemployment is rising. It is up from 8.1 per cent to 8.4 per cent in four months and there has been another projection by Westpac that it will reach 8.7 per cent next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask what is the most appropriate way to deliver fiscal tightening, taking into account expert advice from people like Vince Fitzgerald. It is his advice that it has been the rundown of the revenue base, rather than excessive spending, which is the main problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has ruled out looking at the revenue side and in our view that leaves them dealing with fiscal policy with one hand tied behind their backs. However, we will support the coalition government's efforts to identify and eliminate inefficiency. We will support their efforts on the abolition of redundant programs and better targeting of assistance to those in need. But we just cannot lend our support to cutbacks which lead to the reduction of access to standards of essential government services or any of these reductions which leave low income earners worse off.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Sherry, in this matter of public importance. At a press conference prior to the election, the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, was asked a simple and straight question by a journalist. That question was, `If there is a budget deficit, will the government still deliver on its election promises?' The answer by Mr Howard was also simple, straightforward and to the point. He said, `Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. The trouble is that it now appears that that answer has become, `No, no, no, no, no.' Because now we have a massive campaign by the government to position public expectations by producing a so&hyphen;called black hole out of a black hat which justifies them walking away from their election promises. That is what appears to be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the election campaign, honest John Howard, who is now the Prime Minister of this country, stood by hand on heart and made honesty in government an election issue and he will be called to book by the Australian people at the next available opportunity. They want the person who claimed that he is the honest man of Australian politics to live by his word. They took him at face value; they expect him now to deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon being elected to government, predictably&mdash;as we have seen with state Liberal governments around Australia after they are elected&mdash;they came in and said, `Oh, my God! There is a problem now with the budget <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="274"> and therefore we can't go ahead and do the things that we promised to do.' What they have said is&mdash;and it is their term for it&mdash;that there is a black hole. Senator Kernot described it as a black cloud. I would say that they are black of heart and really never did have any intention of delivering those election promises. They tried to gull the Australian community into believing that this was a government that would not rock the boat; it would adopt Labor policies, govern inclusively and that it would in fact do the things that Labor was doing. It would adopt Medicare, keep the employment programs in place and do all those things on health and education that we were doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has described this so&hyphen;called black hole as a furphy, and it is. But it is a furphy which the government knows to be a furphy, yet they continue to knowingly repeat that furphy. This is almost entirely due to the Treasury revising its forecasts and downgrading the budget parameters. It is not a fact that it exists. It is a forecast opinion and one where the Treasury has changed the parameters post the election to come to this conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Ross Gittins said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, forecasts are not facts&mdash;and nor are they. The government is running around saying that this forecast opinion will change as budget parameters change, and they are changing even now because the inflation rate is lower than anticipated by the markets and by the Treasurer (Mr Costello)&mdash;and thanks to a Labor government, it is, according to the inflation rate that came out last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a callous trick. We have a situation in which forecasters, reputable agencies, are saying that, if the budget outlays are cut by the figure the government is talking about, economic growth in Australia will be stunted by&mdash;according to the figure Senator Kernot gave today&mdash;between a half and one per cent. I concur that this is a reasonable forecast in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That means increasing unemployment, that means that Australia under&hyphen;performs in the world, and that means the government cannot deliver on any of its promises. It is a callous trick, too, to have industry lobbyists go and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> talk to ministers in this government and have ministers defend themselves, limply and lamely, by saying, `I agree with you, the lobbyist, that if we were to abolish these programs then that would be bad policy. Unfortunately, we might have to look at doing that because we have this so&hyphen;called black hole'. That is the ready excuse to do what was always intended, to do what was at the back of the Liberal mind before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will, of course, shine the light of truth on this. Indeed, the black hole is not there; it is a furphy. This is an exercise in naked ideology&mdash;not naked ideology, as Senator Short tried to pretend in this debate, to the extent that we are somehow opposed to a balanced budget. We were the governments that had balanced budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Liberal Party is not a party with any record of balancing budgets in this economy. Its ideology is all about small government, of government withdrawing from education, of government withdrawing from health, of government withdrawing from welfare, of government withdrawing from programs to support industry and business, and of government withdrawing across the board from other areas, including the dismissal of public servants. So here we have an ideology whereby you blame the victims, you penalise them by removing services from them, and you ensure therefore that you can deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall that before the election the coalition promised there would be no tax rises, that there would be no new taxes, that there would be no compulsory redundancies and that there would be no cuts to welfare. They made spending promises which mount up to in excess of $3 billion per annum by the year 1998&hyphen;99. They are all promises that have to be met on top of this so&hyphen;called funding cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition will be holding the government to a position, if they run away from any of their election promises, of having to face the Australian electors. No wonder yesterday in the House of Representatives the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, when asked by Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, to produce the Treasury estimates of what the cost of the coalition election promises is, refused to do so. Someone who, before the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="275"> election, campaigned in a mealy&hyphen;mouthed way, calling for the books of Treasury to be opened, has refused the opening of the Treasury books when it comes to revealing Treasury estimates on his own costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overall budget shortfall, as distinct from the underlying deficit, I might say, is currently estimated for 1996&hyphen;97 not at $8 billion, as we have been hearing from the government, but at something more like $4.9 billion. It has to be remembered that a significant part of that shortfall was in fact due to the coalition itself when last year it blocked some $2.5 billion worth of budget measures. So they are, to the extent that there is a deficit, the architects of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts in the industries area are particularly savage. They have gulled Australian industry leaders into believing they stand for small business, but they are cutting out of industry expenditure targeted programs to help small business, medium&hyphen;sized business and large business everywhere in Australia. Let us hear about the industry position on the diesel fuel rebate. What are industry leaders saying to this government about the tariff concession order? What will small business say about the loss of access to the NIES scheme, R&amp;D concessions and export schemes that help them penetrate foreign markets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The forecast for this budget in the second half of this year is good. That forecast was put down in January, before the election. The business confidence survey showed that that was high. That was true before the election. The economy in the second half of this year will be good, and that will be an achievement of the outgoing Labor government.</PARA></SPEECH>

Given the MPI today and the opposition's denial mode it is in at the moment, I can see this government will have a very extended honeymoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is borne out very much by today's news polls in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which show a very strong lead, if not stronger than the result of the 2 March election, and that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> business confidence has shot up since our election which will naturally lead to improved investment and therefore greater hope for improved jobs. It is quite obvious our tough decisions that are before us are expected by the electorate. They are not having a downward effect, a downward impact, upon the electorate, rather that is why the electorate put us into government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to particularly relate my comments, given the short time in this MPI, to the previous speakers. Just prior to me Senator Cook spoke of the very simple question that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was asked during the election campaign: would he deliver on all his promises? The answer to that is yes. We are going to deliver on all our promises, on all our policies. We know the task before us is very tough but, rest assured, we are going to deliver upon the promises we gave to the Australian people during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The area of most concern out in the Australian community is social welfare, and more than ever we are committed to delivering to that area. The Prime Minister said on radio only a few days ago that we are not going to slash and burn&mdash;reduce pensions or pull back on our commitments to homeless youth. Already we have acted upon our commitments to homeless youth by setting up a task force in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the Senate to a speech John Howard made in regard to social welfare which clearly sets out our directions and commitments in this very sensitive area and the honest approach toward delivering our policies that we will undertake. Senator Cook, that is the simple answer to that simple question. But when you were asked for a simple answer to a very simple question regarding the budget surplus, what you said in this chamber on 20 September 1995 when you knew quite well the estimates were moving against you at that time, was this:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have been in denial mode since then. You even knew in September 1995 that the estimates had clearly blown out. We know you knew that, Senator Cook, because in September 1995 the Joint Economic Forecasting Group warned the government that the budget blow-out would occur in 1996&hyphen;97, let alone Treasury's own estimates, which you said have been revised since the election. That $8 billion hole was an estimate compiled prior to the election because it was available to the incoming Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 3 March. The day after the election he received a blue folder with the Treasury estimates&mdash;a day, quite ironically, known as Clean Up Australia Day. The outgoing government knew full well the task before the incoming government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to assure Senator Sherry and Senator Kernot that this government will deliver on its promises regardless of the herculean task before many of our ministers of finding savings. That is the job we must do. The Victorian government, the Jeff Kennett government, proved that when tough decisions are made and budgets are brought into surplus the public will go along with that. That is what they want the government to do. Do not fall for the trap of denial like John Brumby does or, come the next election, you will end up just like John Brumby.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of public importance proposed by Senator Sherry. Let me say in relation to this debate that this spurious $8 billion figure, which has been so greeted with enthusiasm by senators opposite and indeed all members of the coalition parties, is in no way reliable enough to be used as the basis for spending plans over the next financial year or the year thereafter. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It comes as no surprise after the election to see senators opposite and other members of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the coalition whooping with joy that they have the prospect of cutting government spending by $8 billion. But there is all the world of difference between a full budgetary round of forecasts, which was done last November and has not been done since, and a quickie estimate that is given to an incoming government&mdash;outside the processes of the Joint Economic Forecasting Group. There is all the world of difference and that is something which senators opposite will not recognise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is the sort of problem which Senator Kernot was wrestling with. I am glad to be in a position to explain the situation to her. You have to realise that senators opposite and members of the coalition are very keen on market estimates. These quickie estimates of what the budget position is are the sorts of things the coalition is very keen on, certainly it was before the last election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, if you look at what happened in the last election campaign, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, accidentally blurted one out on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, which was quite off strategy. It was very embarrassing, but it indicates, as he said then, that that was the thing upon which they were basing their fiscal strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that it is entirely unreliable. These market estimates, these quickie estimates&mdash;which this government received from Treasury and which they so rely upon&mdash;are very unreliable indeed. Let me tell you about them. I can tell you about them because I used to do them. I was a market economist and I was in the position of making these estimates.</PARA>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RC6">Senator WHEELWRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why are they different, Senator Kemp? Let me tell you. In a financial market you have to make minute&hyphen;to&hyphen;minute decisions about whether you are going to buy financial securities. You have to make estimates on the best available information. The point is that, if you are wrong&mdash;if you have bought the wrong bond or you have bought the wrong equity&mdash;you can sell them again. That is a fundamentally different process for making plans which are going to have their full effect throughout the entire <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="277"> year on government expenditure and government savings. This is the sort of distinction which this government has not made; this is the sort of distinction which puts the lie to this $8 billion number. It is not reliable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you an indication of just how unreliable these quickie estimates can be. There is an organisation called Consensus Forecasts. Every month they get all the private market forecasts for the budget deficits, inflation and all the other major economic variables. Listen to how much they varied over the course of the year. Let us take the 1995-96 deficit: in January 1995 they thought there would be a deficit of $7.4 billion; by March they had changed to $4.6 billion; by April they were expecting a deficit of $3.7 billion; by June 1995 they were expecting a surplus of $0.4 billion; by July 1995, these market economists, doing these quickie estimates upon which the government is now relying, were back down to a deficit of $0.9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And so it went on month by month&mdash;0.7, 1.4, 1.3, down to 0.9 again, 1.3, 1.4 by March 1996. If we look at this fiscal year, 1996-97, already, in January, they are expecting $3 billion; in February they are expecting $3.1 billion; in March 1996 they are expecting $3.3 billion. That is the is the sort of variation you get if you rely on these spurious quickie estimates which you are flaunting in front of the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you this, and I am very confident in saying this: we will never see this exercise done again, will we? We will never see these sorts of quickie exercises trotted out again. It was the Labor government, the Labor Party, that had two forecasting rounds in a year instead of one, and it was the Labor Party, not John Howard when he was Treasurer, not Senator Short when he worked for the Treasury, that brought out projections of the forward estimates with the budget. That is about as much as a Treasury can do in any one year. It takes hundreds of economists and it takes a great deal of detailed work to build up a useable forecast upon which you can make estimates of public spending. We will never hear it again. This is the only time you have <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ever brought this number out and we will never hear it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that it will not be $8 billion in August, and you know it. It is not a number upon which you would choose to rely. All of this was an attempt to bring in Fightback. All you wanted to see was the number $8 billion, which neatly fits in with the sort of budget cuts that you want to bring, and that is what you have got. We will not see this sort of thing again. If it is such a great idea, do it again. Why don't you bring it in every three months? Do it every week. Let's run a sweep.

In 1990, when we had <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="278"> a million people unemployed, I remember that there was more anxiety created in our community than the average person should ever have to put up with.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> This is the opposition that would not tell us the true budgetary position before the election&mdash;not even the latest available forecasts.

<PARA>The ABC is one of the strongest and most relevant organisations in Australia today. You need not take my word for that. Earlier this year a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun&hyphen;Herald</EMPHASIS>  article showed that about 85 per cent of all Australians believed that the ABC has a more positive effect on Australian life than any of the other categories listed. There were a great many other categories listed. I regret to say that politicians came in third from the bottom of all categories listed. Journalists probably came in lower than that. The ABC as a body came in right at the very top. I am not the only person who thinks that in this chamber. All members of the 1995 Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations agreed with that in our report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC is one of the strongest and most relevant organisations in Australia today. It is an essential part of Australian life. It consistently and overwhelmingly puts high quality Australian product on our televisions and through our radios. It is our greatest source of high quality innovative product in broadcast media today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite recently a long list from the ABC came around to all senators setting out the awards that it won in 1994 and 1995. I will just read out a couple. They won an Emmy award for outstanding news and documentary achievement. That was for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wolves of the Sea</EMPHASIS>, produced and directed by David Parer and Elizabeth Parer&hyphen;Cook. They won Australian <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Film Institute awards in the television section and an award from the Australian Cinematographers Society. In the industry voted categories of the Logies, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Janus </EMPHASIS>came in very high, as did <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Damnation of Harvey McHugh</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners </EMPHASIS>and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS>. For radio they won the Gold Medal at the New York International Radio Festival in 1995. In 1994 they won the Prix Italia award. The 1994 gold Walkley award for radio went to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background Briefing</EMPHASIS> and silver awards also went to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Background Briefing</EMPHASIS>. It won an United Nations Association of Australia media peace award. Radio National's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Africa Week </EMPHASIS>won a major award for radio. I was one of the judges on that, but there were a lot of other judges as well, so I am not saying that because it was only me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where the ABC leads, Australian and international commercial channels will often follow. Where did we first see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mother and Son</EMPHASIS>? What commercial channel would have touched that before the ABC? None of them. In fact, the ABC was a bit nervous about it at first, but it has become one of our most popular and highest rating television programs and we are selling it overseas. How many American children are now singing `bananas in pyjamas are coming down the stairs'? An awful lot of them! That is a real achievement, particularly with American television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC provides leading news and current affairs coverage, which cannot be manipulated by any powerful media baron. For instance, Radio National's breakfast program is essential listening for those like myself who want to know what the day's political agenda is likely to be. How many times have we in this place ordered a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline </EMPHASIS>or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report </EMPHASIS>from the library because we missed the detail of a story that had significant impact on public and informed opinion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the ABC, it is probably only the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that does that on television and it is really only the ABC that I can think of that has as large an effect on radio. These are essential parts of our daily lives. The ABC is an essential and immensely important part of our daily lives. The ABC is under threat yet again.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="280">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was the Deputy Chair of the 1995 Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, a committee which examined the operations and management of the ABC in considerable detail. We saw an ABC which is sound and which provides a diverse and vibrant service, but one where commercial influences had just started to compromise the editorial integrity right at the margins. Why was that? The answer is that the ABC was not adequately funded, even for its charter obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last few years the ABC has been given extra charter obligations and then given one&hyphen;off grants to fulfil those obligations, after which the service was to be self&hyphen;funding. Obviously, on a limited budget that is a very tall order. The ABC has since rectified the problems which we identified except for one essential one. That is a problem which the ABC cannot rectify itself&mdash;federal government funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years, ABC funding has not been maintained in real terms. Because of that it has been forced past the point of efficiency. It is no use saying that we will trim some more fat off. There is no more fat; muscle has started to be trimmed. If the ABC is forced to cut programs because of a two per cent funding cut&mdash;have no doubt about it, if it has to make such a cut after all the cuts it has had to make over the years, which nobody else has had to make, it will be programs or entire networks which will have to go&mdash;we will see a few amputations that will undoubtedly make Australia the poorer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A study was done a while ago by the then director of Radio National which looked at the relative efficiencies of its programs as against comparable overseas broadcasters. The study showed that in comparison with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation the ABC makes similar programs for about half the cost. In comparison with the BBC's Radio Four it was about one third of the cost. In relation to US public radio it was about one half of the cost. So in relation to comparable corporations around the world, Radio National is an immensely efficient broadcaster. And there is no reason to suppose that the same does not apply to the rest of the ABC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition's election policy included a few very interesting and very good policies on the ABC. In particular, the coalition said it would maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding for the ABC and SBS, would ensure that Australia TV had a long&hyphen;term future in Asia, and would make sure that there was no advertising or sponsorship on the ABC. I have to agree absolutely with those policies. They are excellent and I was very pleased to see the coalition put them up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I expect that Senator Alston will promote those policies and that there will be no cuts to ABC funding in the next budget. He has promised in his published policy that there will be no cuts. I expect that the ABC will continue to be exempted from the efficiency dividend because that is what was promised. It is also one of the recommendations made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our ABC</EMPHASIS> report of the committee looking into the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Strong across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board support for the ABC and all its charter activities was shown by members of the committee. One member, Senator Carr, is sitting over there waiting to speak. There were other then government members, then opposition members, Senator Chamarette and me. While there was a dissenting report, there was no dissent to any of the things mentioned in this motion. Everybody agreed that the real problem was that charter activities had to be funded properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion to establish the Senate committee inquiry listed funding as one of the main issues to be examined. I thought it was one of the most important things we had to look at in relation to the ABC. The Senate, pretty well unanimously, agreed. It was found that the ABC has been under&hyphen;funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence given by ABC management that funding has not been maintained in real terms was irrefutable. When you look at bureaucracies around the country where funding has been maintained in real terms you have to accept that if the ABC is to continue to carry out all its charter obligations it needs to be funded at an adequate level. I do not think it is being funded to an adequate level now, let alone if its funding is cut by anywhere near two per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="281">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to remember that the ABC is in its third year of triennial funding. It would be too outrageous to contemplate anything happening at such a time but we have to contemplate the likelihood of something happening in the next period of triennial funding. That is something we must watch carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a member of this Senate, a former member of this committee and the Australian Democrats' communications spokesperson, I reaffirm the committee's conclusion that it unanimously supported: the maintenance of ABC funding, at least at its current level; the continuation of triennial funding arrangements; and the continued exemption from the efficiency dividend, which helps provide greater planning certainty for the ABC's capital works program&mdash;I certainly hope that will not be a question that comes up when we learn what is happening to ABC funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maintenance of current funding levels in real terms is very important. That does not allow for a two per cent, one per cent or even half a per cent cut. The committee was also unanimous in support of favourable consideration of any application for the provision of additional funds to ensure the viability of new parliamentary and ABC&hyphen;approved charter activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment there are only four speakers, including myself, on the list for this debate today. Not one is a member of the government. I hope someone from the government will speak on this matter. Perhaps they just do not have their act together. It is very important that we hear the government's side of this question. I look forward to hearing the opposition's views when we hear from Senator Schacht and Senator Carr and I also look forward to hearing from Senator Chamarette. I hope that the government will think again and find somebody who can speak today on funding for the ABC.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a BBC program shown on the ABC. The episode I refer to was one of the most famous and most funny episodes of that program. Unfortunately, what happened in that episode looks like it is going to come true here in relation to the ABC. When Mr Hacker, the new Minister for Administrative Services, had been in opposition he had circulated and organised a gigantic petition to arrange for freedom of information amendments, et cetera, to open up the government to more transparent arrangements. He then became the minister responsible for dealing with his own petition. Sir Humphrey Appleby classically convinced him very rapidly that he should dump his own petition and speak against it, which he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we have here?  The committee chaired by Senator Alston made all the wonderful motherhood recommendations about funding for the ABC and the independence of the ABC. But what did Senator Alston say yesterday in the Senate?  He would not give a commitment to maintain the funding as outlined not only in this report but also in the coalition's policy statement `Better Broadcasting', as announced on 18 January. He would not give a commitment to reaffirm that funding. Further, today he spoke about the need to provide a two per cent efficiency cut across the board, including the ABC, which is completely contrary to the recommendation in this report. That recommendation is that the ABC should be exempt from such an efficiency dividend, that it should be guaranteed funding, that it should be guaranteed the triennium funding. Here we have Senator Alston aping Jim Hacker in his first two months as a minister in the new government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In opposition, Senator Alston chaired this committee for two years; he stood up in this parliament demanding extra funds for the ABC. When I asked him a question yesterday <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="282"> he fell at the first fence. He would not reissue that commitment. Now he speaks glowingly about the need to apply the two per cent efficiency dividend across the board&mdash;to the ABC, to Telstra and to others. He says that they are inefficient. He does not say that in the committee report. The recommendations which he signed off on are quite to the contrary. He says that the ABC deserves certainty in funding. The opposition certainly supports that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We established in government over the last 13 years the policy of triennium funding for organisations like the ABC. We established it for organisations like the CSIRO, the SBS and other major institutions that provide a broad service to the Australian community. We did that to ensure that those organisations had guarantees over three years, so that they could better plan the management and provision of their services to the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the first chance when those opposite get into government it appears that the triennium funding arrangements will be undermined due to an efficiency dividend arbitrarily put on the ABC. The ABC will be told, `You cut where you like but there is going to be a two per cent cut in the efficiency dividend.'  That is what we know at the moment. We do not know whether anything further is coming. We do not know whether the ABC is being picked off somewhere else for bigger cuts. We know the triennium funding has another year to run from this coming budget. But by the time of the next budget, when the ABC is due to negotiate a new triennium of funding, it will be doing so in the full glare of a government trying to achieve $8 billion worth of cuts. The ABC cannot be confident in my view that it will not have its base funding slashed to provide the cuts to achieve this figure of $8 billion, this holy grail figure that it has become.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today I pay tribute to Senator Kernot who pointed out, with the release of the Treasury figures today, that it is now revising changing the growth figures in GDP. We all know that if there is about a one per cent change in GDP in the Australian economy, it could mean an increase in revenue of well over $1 billion to $1&half; billion dollars. Other savings <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will come: extra growth means increased employment, therefore there will be less demand for unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figure $8 billion that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and all the other ministers are treating as some holy grail figure is an excuse to achieve a political and ideological objective of the government. It is an excuse to reduce those organisations that they think do not follow the coalition's ideological line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From time to time we all hear the conservatives whingeing that some of the programs aired on the ABC put a different social, political and economic viewpoint. The coalition whinges about anything it does not like. I have to say that the Labor Party and even the Democrats sometimes probably do not like everything screened on the ABC. But that is the idea of a national broadcaster&mdash;to portray the full range of views. Senator Alston has fallen at the first opportunity. He has become Jim Hacker by rejecting his own report of a committee which he was so keen to chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is Senator Alston creating great uncertainty about funding, but in remarks made a week or so ago he said that the ABC could perhaps look at raising extra funds through sponsorship or some limited advertising. When he was the shadow minister for communications, I never heard a more dedicated opponent than him of advertising or sponsorship in relation to the ABC. But with the first pressure from the economic dries like Mr Costello and Mr Howard, he caves in. He says, `Maybe it's a way to get extra money for the ABC. Maybe it's not too bad to have a bit of sponsorship, a bit of advertising.'  I think he said that it has not done much damage to the SBS, that they seem to have handled it. He misunderstands the complete difference between the national broadcaster, the ABC, and its charter&mdash;a charter which this committee report is about upholding, expanding and improving&mdash;and the SBS and what it has to do under its charter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="283"> Nevertheless, Senator Alston has let it out that he can think of ways in which the sponsorship or the advertising can be put quietly into the ABC. He might even do it more brutally in other ways by saying, `Lis ten, we're taking $10 million, $20 million or $50 million a year out of your triennium funding under the efficiency divided scam, but you can make it up by sponsorship. You can make it up by limited advertising. That is the way you will make up the shortfall.' Therefore, we would have the most significant change in the style and operation of the ABC since it was formed in the 1930s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a great threat to the ABC by the new government, and it is why I think it is very appropriate that this motion is being debated in the first week of the new parliament with a new government. The opposition is certainly very keen to be associated with the motion as moved by Senator Bourne and I must say that, as the new shadow spokesperson for communications, I am very keen to be associated with the motion and to be debating these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell Senator Alston and the government that on these issues of funding for the ABC&mdash;not that I am not critical at times of its performance&mdash;there has to be a review of management from time to time to make sure the best efficiencies are there, but it cannot be used as an excuse for ideological reasons to try to inhibit the programming of the ABC. I often think that is the motivation of some of the forces in the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will always defend editorial independence and the way to guarantee that editorial independence is to guarantee stability in funding. That is why when we were in government we introduced triennium funding because the funding cannot be got at budget by budget. But under the excuse of an efficiency dividend it will be got at in this budget, and in the following year when the triennium is up for negotiation it will be got at again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will campaign to stop this apparently ideologically driven government from trying to reduce the performance of the ABC. I am sure that we will be joined by the Democrats, by various organisations and, above all, by the millions of Australians who rely on the ABC for the diversity of its programs: news and information, entertainment, current events, sport&mdash;all of it. I am sure they will be with the opposition and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other parties in the Senate. I therefore commend Senator Bourne's motion to the Senate and look forward to its being carried.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Bourne's motion which is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  today. I welcome the opportunity to say a few things about the ABC, an ABC which I personally value very highly. As a result of the Senate inquiry which I participated in, I am able to say I know a great deal more about the ABC than I did before the commencement of this inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would particularly like to emphasise to the Senate is the fact that the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations&mdash;which was established under the most dubious of circumstances, with a whole series of quite vicious allegations made within the terms of reference itself&mdash;was not able to come up with the goods to demonstrate that the ABC was in any way weak or not fulfilling its functions as an effective public broadcaster in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament is not yet a week old and the deafening hollowness of the coalition's election commitments are resounding throughout its walls. Despite the coalition's promise to maintain existing funding to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, as announced in their policy brought down on 18 February 1996, the ABC has been informed by the government that it will be subject to a funding cut of at least two per cent. That information was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 23 April. It was also indicated that much larger cuts had not been ruled out. A cut of two per cent would approximate $10 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Adding to this funding assault, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has refused to rule out the possibility of advertising or sponsorship on the ABC to cover funding shortfalls. What should the electorate make of this apparent new turn in policy that this government and this minister have presided over? At the very least we can say that there has been a maximum degree of evasiveness. It would seem to me that there has been quite a fundamental shift and breach of promise in regard to what was put before <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="284"> the Australian people and before this parliament in respect of the operations of the Senate select committee into the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA>On 30 March 1995 in this chamber, Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition has a very strong commitment to the ABC as one of Australia's vital national cultural institutions . . . and it is vitally important that the ABC remains as an independent quality alternative to the commercial radio and television networks in the decade ahead. Australia certainly needs a fearlessly fair, impartial and independent ABC.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston then referred to the forces of darkness. One could not agree more. The question is: what are the forces of darkness that we are talking about? I contend that the forces of darkness reside on the other side of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Darth Vaders of Tory philistinism, of course, have captured the Treasury bench. They have enriched the public debate for many years with their diatribes of hostility to the ABC. How many times have we been told that the ABC has a left&hyphen;wing bias, that it is run by the Labor Party, and that it is full of all sorts of people with doubtful sexual preferences? How many times have we been told that the ABC is somehow or other not up to it? That was the whole basis, was it not, of this Senate inquiry? Remember the terms of reference, or have you forgotten so soon?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were utterly scandalous terms of reference which stated that the ABC is marked by `failure', by `controversy' and by `conflict', that it was `dysfunctional', had `some deep&hyphen;seated problems that had caused universal concern'. That is why the members of the now government, when in opposition, behaved outrageously in flouting the standing orders. That is why the chairman of that committee sought, without the authority of the committee, a whole series of matters from the ABC which were right outside the terms of reference. He careered around like a lose cannon, acting without the committee's authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I saw it, that Senate inquiry was the inquisitional equivalent of the gutter crawl. They were trying to solicit a submission from anyone who had an axe to grind against the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ABC, anybody who had a prejudice to peddle about the ABC. That is why there was a whole series of time wasting activities and why there was concentration on peripheral matters such as the dismissal of Pamela Bornhorst, whose affair was probably more fitting to the letter pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">TV Week</EMPHASIS> than in a Senate inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not end there. Yesterday, again, the government indicated that it saw a need for `a major shake up in the ABC', that `the ABC was running a deficit' and `its character was nebulous'. It made it clear to us all yesterday that the ABC was going to be subject to major change. It was stated yesterday in the Senate that `the ABC itself is in need of a significant shake&hyphen;up'. That is completely in contrast with what we were told through the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that the Senate committee was set up in the most dubious of circumstances, yet its findings were not able to demonstrate that the claims made in the terms of reference were valid in any way. It was demonstrated, though, that the case was the complete opposite, that the ABC was operating in a much stronger way, was serving more people than it ever had and its performance and public satisfaction levels were much higher than they ever had been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as we are concerned, and as far as the Labor senators who were involved in that committee were concerned, our faith in the ABC was demonstrated by our commitment to give the ABC triennial funding, which has been in place since 1988. The commitment was demonstrated in real terms&mdash;and this is where I perhaps disagree with the sentiments expressed in the proposition before us today&mdash;by an increase in funding since 1988&hyphen;89. That was done by earmarking $1.5 billion for ABC activities over the three&hyphen;year period to June 1997 and providing additional funds where required for special initiatives such as the Australian Television International and, of course, pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition before us today indicates that the ABC management and the ABC union felt that there had been a cut in funding. That was not borne out by the figures. <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="285"> Senator Bourne would recall the findings of the report itself. On page 155, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the ABC and the CPSU argued that the ABC's funding base was permanently reduced in 1988/89 when the ABC did not receive supplementation for the full movement in the non&hyphen;farm GDP deflator. Both organisations estimate that the ABC has lost $35m from its funding base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government's efficiency dividend has not been applied to the ABC since the first triennium of funding (1988/89&mdash;1990/91). The exemption from the efficiency dividend represents a significant saving to the organisation and is supported by the Committee. Overall, the ABC has fared as well as any public sector organisation in its budget funding in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate that there has been a quite deliberate campaign of denigration against the ABC for some years by conservative forces in this country. There have been the tactics of slander, abuse and trivialisation, characterised in particular by the lead&hyphen;up to the establishment of this particular Senate inquiry. As far as I could tell, there seemed to be quite a determined effort to undermine the confidence in the ABC board by constant reference to the members' past and present political affiliations. Part of the inquiry's findings went to the issue of board membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be very interesting to see what the government's position is on another matter&mdash;that is, the board being appointed after thorough parliamentary scrutiny of nominees' credentials. Let us hear more about that. When this government comes to appointing new members to that board, I wonder how much notice it will take of the commitments it made in this report through the chairman, Senator Alston, agreeing to that proposition.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue here is what is at stake. It strikes me that it is the Fightback agenda <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being implemented by stealth. You will recall that under Fightback the proposal was for a slashing of some $50 million from the corporation's budget. It seems that that is where we are going with this matter as well, despite the commitments that have been made to the public and this Senate through this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is abundantly clear evidence of the hypocrisy of this government on this matter. It is quite clear that it is an ideologically driven agenda of the current government for the corporation to be wound back. You have to ask yourself why that is the case. One of the reasons is not the failure of the ABC but its success. Because it is so widely accepted by Australians and because it so effectively competes with commercial interests, it has to be wound back, doesn't it? That is very much at the heart of the problem here. We cannot have an independent news organisation, can we, that puts a different view? That is bad news, according to the ideological precepts of those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are really talking about the Fightback agenda being introduced by stealth. We are looking at the commercialisation at any cost through this new government regime. What a terrible cost that would be. The ABC is, in my judgment, more than a mere broadcaster; it has a very important role to play in both the national political debate and the development of a national culture in this country. The ABC is a very important institution in the protection of Australia's culture, and a very important protection in Australian society in that regard. That is why the debate about advertising on the ABC is much more than just a question of economics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two pillars of independence for the corporation, that is, its separation from political and commercial influences. Such independence could well be compromised were the ABC to become even partly dependent on income from advertisers and sponsors. Wasn't that the point that you constantly made throughout the inquiry? You said that any off&hyphen;budget revenue raises the issue of seepage and the question of the independence of the ABC. What now do we see so quickly after there is a change of government?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="286">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Extensive surveys of public opinion on the ABC in the late 1980s indicated that the overwhelming majority of Australians want the ABC to be commercial free and that they are prepared to keep paying their 8c a day for the privilege. Eighty&hyphen;one per cent of respondents opposed advertising on the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former head of the corporation recently stated, `The dirty work of the commercialisation of the ABC will be left to a cash&hyphen;strapped board.' David Hill made that comment in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 23 April 1996. ABC chairmen and media commentators have warned of the inevitable dilution of the corporation's unique products which will result from commercial pressures. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has described the prospect of advertising on the ABC as a major tragedy, a sentiment with which I fully agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even Australia's commercial television networks have opposed the introduction of advertising. You could ask yourself why. It does indicate that there is, I think, broad opposition to the introduction of advertising on the ABC. They have warned that there will be a dramatic drop in the overall quality of Australian television programming, and they cite the SBS television model as being ineffective. Of course there is commercial interest in that, but there is also, I think, sound reason in terms of the product that would result, that is, with drama and all the other entertainment services provided by the ABC, not just the news itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should an Australian cultural icon be defiled because the government has set itself an unrealistic and irresponsible target of budget cuts totalling some $8 billion over two years? The diversity of Australia's broadcasting system has worked well for the nation with its strong and complementary commercial and public arms. The Labor government's stable funding regime and policy environment provided the ABC with the necessary certainty to maintain and develop the service, experiment with new formats and pioneer new techniques. It should not be undermined by a major shake&hyphen;up, as this minister has promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I recall correctly, H.G. Wells described advertising as `legalised lying', a process the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government should not be seen in the same light as. It is time for the minister to squash the rumours and to spell out exactly what the government is intending to do on this issue. You cannot rely on half&hyphen;truths and evasive answers. These in themselves destabilise and demoralise the corporation, and are of great concern to the electorate at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public broadcaster has served the public well for some 60 years. The ABC is much stronger as a result of Labor in government. In terms of the resources that have been delivered and the policy regime in which it operated, it has been able to extend its services to quite extraordinary levels. The ABC has increased its radio audience by some 62 per cent and its television audience by 26 per cent since the late 1980s, and it has done so, in my judgment, largely as a result of quality programming and more Australian content than ever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC cannot afford to be undermined by the sorts of ideological obsessions that we are witnessing here and that we have witnessed for some time from the Liberal Party. We all understand that the ABC is a great Australian institution. I have no doubt it will survive. The issue is, however, at what cost it will survive. The ABC has survived war, depression and, of course, the worst excesses of tory philistinism. I believe it will also survive Richard Alston.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of Senator Bourne's motion relating to the ABC. I recall giving a `hear, hear!' to the motion yesterday when she gave notice of it in the chamber. I am extremely disappointed at the failure of the government to be here to present a position and to listen to the views that are being expressed and to the questions that are implied from the views that are being expressed. It is not an auspicious start in this new government's first week of program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is actually the comments of the new government that have generated concern regarding the future of the ABC. Yet it is not here to clarify and elaborate on the position it intends to take, or to even present an interim position. There is no justification for its failure to be present and to express a view <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="287"> at this time. I want to express serious condemnation of the failure of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and his party to even have the minister and his views represented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard much about the Senate inquiry into the ABC. It has been referred to in various ways. As I was an instigator of that inquiry, and as one who certainly supported it and participated in the committee, I would like to recount some incidents in the life of that committee which I believe can support Senator Bourne's motion and the need for this chamber to consider very seriously aspects of the ABC's operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I instigated that inquiry as a wholehearted supporter of the ABC in its role as Australia's independent national public broadcaster. I presented the Senate inquiry as a positive step to clear the air on a series of issues relating to the management and operation of the ABC. I  did not believe that support of the ABC should involve any glossing over of problems that were clearly apparent in the operation of the ABC at that time. I will refer to some of those concerns which I believe had been in some cases dealt with, in some cases exacerbated, and in some cases are still in suspension because of this new government's failure to declare its full position on the matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, I felt that the ABC needed a visible mechanism to get over the problems and criticisms that had occurred and that the purpose of the inquiry was not to emphasise any one of the particular issues of concern but to allow a number of people to air their views and to be part of the problem solving process. In my view, this would ensure that nothing would hold back the ABC from continuing its vital role in the community into the next century. They were the words that I used at the time of supporting the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there were dire predictions, even at that time, held by the former government regarding my motives and the motives of the opposition in supporting the motion for a committee into the ABC. I think aspersions were also cast on the Australian Democrats for being prepared to look at the terms of reference and to also support them, after they had included some aspects that met their <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerns, which were that it should not be a destructive inquiry but a constructive one to uphold the importance of our national broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall a conversation at the time of those allegations. I am sure that Senator Bourne remembers it as well. Senator Alston, Senator Bourne and I were engaged in a three-way discussion in another part of the chamber. I asked Senator Alston to repeat the comments that he had made to me in response to my concerns that, in the lead-up to the previous federal election, it had been quite clearly stated by the former leader of the Liberal Party, John Hewson, that de&hyphen;funding, or reducing the funding, or not continuing in the same volume the funding of the ABC, would be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston quite specifically repudiated that previous stance of the coalition. He said that there was no question of lowering the level of funding, that it had put those troublesome policies behind it, that it wanted to have nothing to do with them, and that he would guarantee to Senator Bourne and me personally that the only interest the then government had was in a constructive support, a continuing support, of the ABC. I am sure Senator Bourne can bear out that conversation that occurred between the three of us, and the motivation that led us to double check before we agreed altogether on passing that motion in the Senate: it was in the interests of furthering the operations of the ABC and not doing anything to curtail it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to some of the concerns that were addressed, I believe that the then government and the ALP senators who were on the committee took a less than helpful role in what they no doubt considered was a defence of the ABC. `Defence' is probably the right term because they became so defensive and abusive that their main concern seemed to be to defend the ABC by undermining the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In retrospect, and even at that time, I think that their role could have been far more powerful. They could have ensured that the committee's report was unanimous and that it tied the coalition well and truly to the kinds of supports for the ABC that we would not <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="288"> even need to be debating today if they had added their presence in a constructive way to the committee public hearings. Instead, they simply argued with the chairman and made aspersions on the motivations, and not only on members of the committee but also on people who gave evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the previous comments of Senator Carr need to be balanced by a statement from me. As a member of that committee, I think there were opportunities for the two senators, Senator Forshaw and Senator Carr, to have been very constructive in working with Senator Bourne and me to make the recommendations of the committee even stronger than they eventually turned out to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns that were raised&mdash;some have been addressed; some have been proven true&mdash;and that I want to mention here are concerns about the role of ATV, ATV International, the proposed abolition of ABC regional television news, program sponsorship rules, continuing levels of resignations and departures of ABC staff, appointments to the board, relationships between the board and management and the increase in commercial activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, we were concerned about the centralisation of operations towards Sydney, the proposal to amalgamate Radio Australia and ATV and the increasing commercialisation of the broadcaster. Western Australia is only too aware that some of these moves have unfortunately already taken place. I believe that regional Australia has been severely penalised by the kinds of budget constraints and centralisation that have operated in the ABC and which need to be counteracted by a strong stand from government and from all parties that says, `The ABC should have the funding. It should not penalise regional and decentralised public broadcasting&mdash;radio or television&mdash;to the detriment of the people of Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the committee hearings made it perfectly clear that there was a danger of that if there was not an increase in and an increased security of the funding of the ABC, we have been able to see that that centralisation, that holding down and lessening of the broadening aspect of this ABC, has occurred. <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Central to the kinds of changes that have occurred is concern regarding funding. During the committee's deliberations, we discovered that the ABC had operated extremely well, considering the low base of funding from which it was operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we received a comparison of the ABC's funding with that of other national broadcasters around the world, we were appalled to see that, just for example, the ABC's total television budget is greater than the budgets of the national broadcasters of only New Zealand and the United States. If we want to emulate the United States and let our national broadcaster drop to that degree in terms of its commercial competition and sway, we have to think very seriously about the implications of that. I think we should seriously question it if we feel we are only the same size as New Zealand and we can afford to have a budget that is just barely bigger than that of New Zealand when we are such a vast continent. People are spread out right throughout the states and we cannot afford the kind of centralisation that may well be possible in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC's budget ranks behind those of the national broadcasters of Japan, Italy, Germany, the UK, France and Canada. It is really a disgrace and I think this government needs to be looking at that&mdash;looking at its international reputation and the kind of image it is going to present by the priority it gives to its national broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think I said in a previous speech that one of the intelligence test items is: what is the importance of a free press? I leave that as an open question to test the intelligence of my listeners here. I will just say that the importance of a free press must not be overlooked by this new government and must not be overlooked in relation to the issues we are discussing right now. It has very serious ramifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the committee report, all parties supported the triennial funding initiative. We have supported it because it provides the ABC with the ability to plan over a longer period while at the same time allows it to retain any profits arising from its commercial activities. Senator Bourne and I had concern <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="289"> about the commercial involvement, so that was not a uniform committee position. However, we were totally united in relation to the maintenance of the present level of funding as a minimum and additional revenue that should be provided by the government, rather than forcing it into commercial activities or into downscaling the very worthwhile activities it has been conducting for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The case for additional funding was put very clearly in the report on page 97. While it did state that the ABC's annual report of 1993-94 advised that current funding levels would enable it to maintain current activities, one of the major concerns was that other activities wouldn't be able to be engaged in. Some of the activities that had actually been raised, for example ATV, which was experiencing revenue shortfalls, and also other aspects of ABC services, would eventually be a drain on the limited appropriation funds allocated to the ABC. The report quotes the Friends of the ABC as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The root of the ABC's current problems is undoubtedly a general shortage of funds and management's entrepreneurial attempts to address this problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Friends claimed that the shortage of funds has been exacerbated by the expansion of the ABC into such areas as ATV and 24 hour radio news on the parliamentary channel.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the statements in Senator Bourne's motion are worthy of total support. We really need to put on the record where the coalition stood in relation to these matters. Certainly, the maintenance of ABC funding, at least at its current level, and the continuation of the triennial funding arrangements was a unanimous recommendation. The coalition supported the continued exemption from the efficiency dividend because it helped provide greater planning certainty for the ABC's capital works program. The committee also supported the maintenance of current funding levels in real terms and would support favourable consideration of any application for the provision of additional funds to ensure the viability of new parliamentary and ABC approved charter activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think nothing could be more clear than the committee's findings and I think there can be <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nothing more clear, by the absence of a representative of the government speaking on this matter, than that the government is in danger of grave hypocrisy or of really letting down its responsibilities in relation to this very important portfolio area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that we cannot stress enough how important it is to maintain the role and functions of the ABC&mdash;and not just in the way that we have taken for granted for so long, because we are about to see an enormous technological leap in this country. We do not need a public broadcaster that slips further and further behind the kind of competition that will come from other innovations and which people should be seriously concerned about, because of the impact that will have on Australian content and on the general objectivity of media coverage. When we established the committee, I knew that the ABC was not immune to justifiable criticisms. I believe that its funding should be not only supported but increased. I support, in the strongest possible terms, the motion that is before the chamber at the present moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the select committee which considered the issues which have been debated this afternoon. I must firstly respond to the comments directed by Senator Chamarette at me and Senator Carr. The accusation was that we really were not interested in the issue and sought to somehow derail the committee. I refute that completely. I think I am pretty safe in saying that I was probably one of the few members of the committee that attended every single session of the hearings. Not only that, I also took a keen interest, as did Senator Carr, in the issues before the committee and we sought to obtain as much evidence as we could from the witnesses regarding the matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, we do not resile from the fact that, from the very outset of that committee, it was fatally flawed because we had a series of conclusions that were looking for an argument to be sustained. Whilst I would acknowledge that there were at the time some general issues of concern regarding funding for the ABC, there were also some specific matters that were in the public arena, such as <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="290"> the alleged increase in use of sponsorship through what are known as `infotainment programs' to supplement ABC funding. There was also the specific matter that Senator Chamarette took an interest in, namely the dismissal of an ABC reporter named Pamela Bornhorst. Despite all of those rather important and serious matters, what we ended up with was a committee, chaired by Senator Alston, which sought&mdash;in our view&mdash;to attack the ABC wherever it could for political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had this inquiry which went into the membership of the board and allegations of stacking. We had allegations directed at staff of the ABC. In some cases quite serious and malicious allegations were allowed to be made against staff of the ABC who were then placed in a difficult position of having to defend themselves. When you went through the specific terms of reference of that inquiry, it became very clear that each of the allegations and issues raised were either erroneous or were matters which were being adequately handled within the structure of the ABC, particularly through the Palmer report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason why the government senators at the time came down with a dissenting report was that we believed that the ABC was under surreptitious attack here by the then opposition. I do not level that charge at Senators Bourne or Chamarette, because I believe they have&mdash;and had at that time and through that inquiry&mdash;a genuine desire to examine some issues of concern to them and to do so in the course of defending and promoting the interests of the ABC as a public broadcaster. I have had the opportunity to talk particularly with Senator Bourne on a number of occasions and I think we both agree that we are great fans of the ABC, as many of us are. I refute those comments of Senator Chamarette with respect to our activities on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to touch very quickly on a couple of matters that arose out of the committee and that have been covered here this afternoon by the various speakers. I note that the now government&mdash;those who when opposite were so intent upon chasing down every burrow any rabbit they could find to get stuck <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> into the ABC only a year or so ago in the inquiry&mdash;have not even bothered to participate in this debate. Senator Alston has said that they believe that the ABC is a great public institution. On many occasions, Senator Alston, then as opposition spokesman, asked questions in the chamber and made speeches attacking the government&mdash;attacks which were unwarranted. He was always holding up this mantle that he stood for an independent ABC and one that needed to be adequately funded and open to public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today we have one of the first debates in this chamber since the election, and where are the government? They have gone home. They are not here. The minister is not here to even participate in the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The precedent was set during the election campaign. What happened during the election campaign? There was going to be a debate between the Prime Minister of the day, Paul Keating, and the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard&mdash;just as there had been a debate in the previous election in 1993 and in preceding elections. But what was the view of the opposition leader? The view was, `We can't have the debate on the ABC.' John Howard would not accept Kerry O'Brien as the moderator of that debate. He attacked the integrity of one of Australia's leading and fairest and unbiased political commentators&mdash;Kerry O'Brien. He was not going to actually come out and say it publicly. No. What did he do? He said, `I refuse to have the debate on the ABC with Kerry O'Brien.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a matter of fundamental importance in terms of the independence and the integrity of the ABC that, as our only true national public broadcaster, it should have the opportunity to carry that debate, to do so in a totally commercial&hyphen;free environment and to be able to choose the compere or the moderator of the debate. But the now Prime Minister said, `I'm not going to turn up.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the precedent was set then. You would not participate in the debate on the ABC. Now that we are debating the ABC and the critical question of funding for the ABC, you will not participate in this debate either. You have gone quiet. You have done a Jeff Kennett. When it comes to the ABC, it is the <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="291"> only way you can ever shut Jeff Kennett up, because he will not talk to them. This is the attitude. This is this great support that you have, and your leader has, for the independence and the integrity and the maintenance of an unbiased and fair public broadcaster like the ABC. You will not even come along into the chamber and debate the very important issues. Of course, it is an important issue&mdash;a very critical issue in terms of the future of public broadcasting in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Carr so rightly pointed out, the real agenda was in Fightback. That was to rip $50 million out of the budget of the ABC. The ABC is probably one of only two remaining national public broadcasters in the world that relies essentially on public funds through the budgetary process and does not rely upon direct commercial revenue through television commercials, radio commercials and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other public broadcasters throughout the world that have a mix of funding. There are broadcasters like the BBC that rely on a licence fee system, where the level of funding can go up just by putting the licence fee up. Of course, the ABC has always been subject to budgetary allocation. The introduction of the triennial funding arrangements by the Labor government brought a lot of stability to that funding process and enabled that broadcaster, the Broadcasting Corporation, to be able to plan well in advance for its needs. What we have now is a direct threat to the continuation of public funding at current levels for the ABC. As Senator Carr so rightly points out, the agenda is ultimately to slash public funding for the ABC and, no doubt, probably open it up to another form of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We stand committed to maintaining that total support. I will be very interested, as I am sure we all will be, when the minister in this place, Senator Alston, finally finds the time to come along and participate in the debate, to see how he addresses this issue without hypocrisy. He is now on the record, as he said in the past, saying that he would maintain the level of funding. Clearly, within a matter of a few weeks, that promise has been broken like so many others. So we are very supportive of the continuation of public funding for <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the ABC, and I endorse wholeheartedly the remarks of earlier speakers, particularly those of Senator Carr.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their support. Let me make the point that editorial independence can only be guaranteed by adequate independent funding. The courage to produce a significant amount of innovative, high quality programming, as the ABC constantly does, can only be guaranteed by adequate independent funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make just one more point about the efficiency of the ABC. Another comparison between Radio National and the BBC's Radio 4 showed that similar programming from the two networks was provided with a global budget for Radio National that was about one-third of what was provided for BBC's Radio 4. The ABC is as efficient as it is going to become. Chopping budgets by one or two per cent every year does not necessarily lead to greater efficiency. In fact, lower funding will very quickly lead to lower efficiency. When does the appallingly named efficiency dividend&mdash;`efficiency dividend', who made that up?&mdash;become nominally inefficient? When does it become the inefficiency dividend? How close to zero does the budget have to be before we start questioning the basis of this ridiculous concept?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any government which reduces independent funding for an independent broadcaster is in fact at the same time increasing the power of a few media barons, and that is particularly so in Australia. The absolute stupidity and short-sightedness of doing such a thing is that any government which increases the power of any media baron increases that power over itself. That is a very dangerous procedure indeed. Australia needs every single program on every single network which is currently produced by the ABC.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="292">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish by going through the coalition's election promises in relation to the ABC. It will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding and triennial funding for the ABC and the SBS. It will support the ongoing extension of Triple J into regional Australia. It will ensure Australia Television, ATV, has a long-term future in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. It will fund the ABC and the SBS directly for their transmission costs. It will provide $6 million for the captioning of ABC and SBS television news services. It will implement a coherent media policy which puts the national interest first. I am really pleased to hear that one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition will maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio. ABC Radio, which includes Metropolitan Radio, Regional Radio, Radio National, ABC Classic&hyphen;FM, Triple J and NewsRadio, is one of Australia's most influential and listened to radio networks. I absolutely agree. The policy reads:</PARA>

<PARA>What can I say? I absolutely agree&mdash;very, very good policy. The coalition has promised to put these policies before parliament where appropriate and attempt to get them through. I can guarantee that the Democrats will support them and it seems to me that we can count on the support of the opposition and Senator Chamarette. So we are looking forward in the very near future to seeing more funding for the ABC, not less.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to draw to the attention of the Senate the response by the Australian Customs Service on the handout brochure that goes with the report. Customs has identified and is implementing a more cost&hyphen;effective means of data capture which recognises the diversity in business sophistication among claimants under the scheme. The brochure goes on to list a half a dozen points. There is no need for me to read those out because they are there in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to raise one particular aspect which would improve the scheme enormously. Back in 1981 or 1982, because of certain misuses of the scheme, it became a rebate scheme rather than being an exemption scheme. I think it is time to have another look at <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="293"> that particular aspect of the scheme. I believe it should be done this way. It could be done in conjunction with a sales tax exemption. A sales tax exemption certificate operates in those industries where the diesel fuel rebate scheme applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about removing taxes from the inputs into export industries. Under the sales tax exemption scheme you have a registered number and only authorised individuals can operate from that number. Customs should be looking at introducing a similar type of scheme. In fact, you could have a sales tax exemption certificate that applied to both sales tax and the diesel fuel rebate scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it could be done under a Medicare type card with a number on it which has to be stamped on each invoice. That in itself would be an enormous improvement in the scheme in terms of efficiency and would significantly reduce the compliance costs for both the users of the scheme and the department, because there are enormous resources tied up in manpower and facilities in administering the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it is be acknowledged that Customs have addressed a number of aspects that are raised here. I also want to point out why people from my state take such an interest in this scheme. I refer particularly to page 7. It is well known that Western Australia provides some 25 per cent of the export income of this nation. It has also been estimated that by the year 2010&mdash;or between 2010 and 2015&mdash;mainly out of the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and other areas in the goldfields as well, particularly the electorates of Kalgoorlie and to a lesser extent O'Connor, that percentage of Australia's total export earnings will rise to about 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia receives about 38 per cent of the total value of rebates, yet has only 10 per cent of the claimants. That is a reflection of two things: the total export operations in mining and agriculture in Western Australia and the distances involved in transportation. I want to make it clear that, when I mention transport, I am not talking about transport on public roads. It is paid on public roads. I am talking about transport on private roads out in the bush. I believe that it is important that we <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> continue to highlight those aspects of the scheme. It would be detrimental to those industries if their costs increased, particularly the infrastructure costs involved in the expansion of some operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to mention the operations of Marandoo and Tom Price and what are commonly known as transport networks. A private railway line has been built between the two operations. By linking Marandoo and Tom Price, it increases the life of that particular operation by some 40 years. It is anticipated that if Tom Price is not expanded by the increase in the high&hyphen;grade ore from Marandoo, it will cease to be an export operation by the year 2009. The extension of the railway system to Marandoo will increase its life to about 40 years, between the years 2040 and 2050. So we need to take a long&hyphen;term view of the diesel fuel rebate when we are considering the structural requirements for the development and continued expansion of mining in Western Australia. I wanted to draw the Senate's attention to that aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another aspect which is of interest&mdash;no doubt Customs is looking at it&mdash;is the discrepancies in the average cost of processing a claim. This is dealt with on page 34 of the report. I suggest that we should develop a type of card system which could operate in conjunction with the sales tax exemption. It would significantly lower the administration cost of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. For some reason or other&mdash;I have not been able to identify it at this stage&mdash;the cost of processing in the Northern Territory is significantly higher than it is in the other states. New South Wales has the lowest processing cost. There is probably a very good reason for that, and no doubt we can pursue that in the estimates committee hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having made those comments regarding the diesel fuel rebate scheme, I reiterate that the responses by Customs to this and other audit reports have been very positive and constructive. I look forward to seeing in the audit report next year how these recommendations have been implemented.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see the former minister sees where I am coming from. There is some speculation in the press that there may be some attack on this diesel fuel rebate. It is, as I said, fundamentally important to Australia's fishing, farming and mining industries. They are the big earners, the big job providers in Australia. The scheme has been effective since 1957, providing some relief from the excise on diesel fuel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also absolutely important to the international competitiveness of our export earning industries. It is calculated that its removal would result in an increase in direct farm costs of $90 a week on average, and more for heavy users of diesel fuel, such as grain growers. I think there was a letter from the mining industry, which came only yesterday, or maybe today, which says that the loss of the diesel fuel rebate to the mining industry would increase the cost of coal by, I think, $1 per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trebling of the diesel fuel rebate over the past decade has been a result of the automatic increase of the fuel excise going from 10.437c a litre in 1986 to 34.183c a litre in today's dollars. Most of that money was initially spent on the development of roads. During the last 13 years the money was syphoned off into general revenue, but that is a matter for another debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its 1993 budget the previous government attempted to impose an administration charge of one per cent. We on this side of parliament knew that that would have been the thin edge of the wedge driven in. It would have been one per cent this year and it would have been cranked up to a greater amount once it was established. I am very pleased that the then opposition, the government at the moment, led a charge&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the one hand they giveth and on the other hand they taketh away. The Democrats supported the government, which resulted in a loss of the diesel rebate to some aspects of the mining industry and the primary industry. When they removed the diesel rebate from the extraction of limestone, which was used to help defeat the acidity in the soil, that amounted to a loss of about $600,000 to farmers. The cane trains that bring the sugar cane into the mills also lost their maintenance rebate for diesel fuel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have taken this matter up with the minister and Senator Crane has taken up some aspects of this legislation with respect to his home state with the minister. We hope that when an amending bill comes through the subjects that we raised with the minister in relation to the building of roads on properties, the reinstatement of the diesel fuel rebate on cane trains and the maintenance of the lines will meet with the minister's approval and he will re-establish the diesel fuel rebate on those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General's report allows me to address those issues on the diesel fuel rebate and gives us an opportunity to say how important it is to farmers, miners and the fishing and forestry industries.

That work has been done in the discharge of our functions as parliamentarians and in the interests of the Australian people.

One of those arms is the executive, and it does not matter whether it is an executive from the party that is now on this side of the chamber or an executive, as it in fact is, from the parties on the other side. The executive is one arm, and one arm of government alone. If it is in a position to exercise, in effect, restraint upon the parliament and upon the judiciary so as to make their work less efficient&mdash;less efficient is the degree to which I put it&mdash;than it otherwise would be, then we as parliamentarians fail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, Senator Abetz has got up, and properly so, to defend, as he sees it, his government. I am not having a go&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;in specific terms about his government or specifically about his government. What I am having a go about is this: that parliament, which is supposed to be the supreme body and from which the executive is selected, should not play to the tune set by government. If there are resources to be reduced, then they should be reduced by the parliament. If the parliament agrees, pursuant to a proposition brought before it, that it should take part in general funding cuts, so be it. It should not be subject to a proposition put forward in an inset or in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that says, `Well, look, there are anticipated funding reductions and the resources available to you are going to be less.' That is not how we as parliamentarians should go forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the governments's proposition, there is a need for funding cuts. That is a political issue. That is a matter we are going to discuss in the chamber. It is very legitimate&mdash;more than legitimate&mdash;for those opposite, who now have a mandate to govern, to put forward propositions that will result in funding cuts if accepted by this chamber. It is not proper, it is not in accordance with constitutional history and it is not in accordance with parliamentary history in this country or in England&mdash;from which we, in large part, take our precedents&mdash;that parliament should be subject to the dictates of a lesser body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the present government was in opposition, it called for, as it was entitled to do, documents from the executive. There was great dispute about that. Parliament was exercising its power over the executive&mdash;making the executive responsible to the legislature, to the parliament. It is proper that we as parliamentarians continue what was suggested by those applications and which came as a result of a long and glorious history of parliamentary rule. It is only proper that, if there is to be this reduction in the funds made available to this parliament to carry out its functions, we as a parliament should have a say in it.</PARA>

Madam Acting Deputy President, seeing that you have allowed the latitude you have on the consideration of the tobacco industry and the cost of related illness report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I just cannot allow some of Senator Cooney's comments to go without a response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it fascinating, Senator Cooney, that your comments are from a person who belongs to a party which has been in government for 13 years and which has sought in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> every way, shape and form to grind down the facilities of this parliament lock, stock and barrel. Also, you come from a party which until recently saw fit to have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansards</EMPHASIS> printed on archive paper that lasts 100 years when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Hansards</EMPHASIS> are pelted out the door the moment the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Hansards</EMPHASIS> are printed. Also, you come from a party that should be sufficiently informed about technology to know that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> are on the database, which is a far better and more economical use. You also come from a party that has trumpeted long and loud about conservation issues and preserving the forests. You cannot have it both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to get a reasonable response across the board about the requirement of facilities by senators, members and people who use the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as to what is the most practical position to take on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> and the distribution of the daily, weekly and electronic <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> because, quite frankly, I do not know too many people who go to bed every night and read their daily copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> cover to cover. I have to say that I do not read mine every night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now get back to the issue before the Senate&mdash;that is, the tobacco industry and the cost of tobacco related illness report handed down by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee just before Christmas. I, as I say, was a member of that committee and I agree wholeheartedly with the majority of the recommendations put down by the majority of the committee. I agree that smoking is addictive. I agree that everything that is humanly possible should be done not only to get people to stop smoking but also to stop them from smoking in the first instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, Senator Minchin, who spoke on this report yesterday, and I did see fit to put in a minority report on some of the issues that were canvassed by the committee which we felt had a very serious and potentially deleterious impact on small business. We proposed something much stronger in our general recommendations about making the sale of cigarettes to minors illegal. I think that shows our bona fides in terms of the attitude that we took to the question of smoking in general and the desire that we had to see fewer and fewer people in the community smoking.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="301">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We thought that, while this product is legal, snatching it out of the stores&mdash;as is literally proposed by the majority report&mdash;was not only unfair but would certainly impact very seriously on the viability of many businesses. The report details the number of businesses that would be affected by such a move. It also highlights the types of businesses that would be affected. The minority report was very seriously considered by Senator Minchin and me in those terms to make sure that the business community was not going to be seriously and detrimentally affected overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The part that I wish to raise tonight is the role one of the cigarette companies played in the misinformation and the distribution of that misinformation. Senator West actually referred to it briefly last night as well in her comments about this report. Given the fact that the report had made a number of recommendations that I felt had great significance for the health of the Australian population, I was very disturbed that Philip Morris in particular decided to not only distort the report but also not even mention the dissenting report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not been keen to agitate this sensitive issue, particularly in a public sense. I in no way wish my dissenting report to be interpreted as an endorsement of smoking, under-age smoking or in fact any type of smoking in general by any age. Rather, I am keen to see that whatever regulations are put into place are fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Philip Morris actually sent a so-called information sheet to retailers around Australia, including retailers in Western Australia. I call it a misinformation sheet because it told business owners that the Senate's plan to ban the sale of cigarettes in their stores would dramatically impact upon their business. They inferred that this was legislation. In fact, the inference went one step further: they inferred that it was law. It went on to say that such a ban would threaten the income and livelihood of their business and that of their employees. It urged them to write to a named member of parliament raising a number of points, which they provided on a separate page, and to let Philip Morris know what action they had taken.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the letters sent to Western Australian retailers my name and contact details were provided, albeit the provision of the details was partially incorrect as well. But in doing this it remains my view that it was implied that I had supported the committee's recommendations that businesses be seriously affected and that I should be lobbied to reverse that point of view. Of course, the company argued the contrary. In fact, I found it rather amusing in some sense, had it not been so wrong, that in the end they tried to imply that they had done this for my benefit, that I was somehow going to be made the hero of small business when the correction was made. Nothing could be further from the truth. They were not trying to do it for my benefit; they were trying to do it for theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very sad, given the fact that we had heard the arguments of Philip Morris and a lot of the other cigarette companies throughout the year in the preparation of this report, that they then sought to go and distort the report and not even talk about the dissenting report at all in such a public fashion. No mention of that dissenting report was made in any letter in the first state, and it was not until I performed and questioned very seriously their motive and the way in which they had done this that they then offered to give me a list of the people to whom they had sent the original misinformation sheet. But then they retracted on that guarantee and said that they would in the end put out a sheet on my behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My office was flooded with calls, faxes and letters from retailers who were angry at me for making recommendations on cigarette sales which stood to harm their businesses and at my party for doing so. But in reality nothing could be further from the truth. In the course of my negotiations with Philip Morris about sending the second letter, a representative of the company had the gall to tell me that the letter to retailers would work in my favour by providing me with a perfect opportunity to communicate with small business owners. That is absolute rot. They did not write such a letter to open up the paths of communication between retailers and members of parliament; they wrote it, plain as day, to further their own interests.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="302">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the responsibility of any business to ensure that the proceedings of this parliament are reported accurately&mdash;if that is what a business wishes to do. But to report them inaccurately, as Philip Morris did, is very sad. It is very sad given the fact that in relation to the business aspect and the impact on businesses, I was right behind them. I am not right behind them in terms of encouraging people to smoke. It is very sad that this event took place. I certainly hope that Philip Morris and other companies will be more careful in the future.</PARA></SPEECH>

Today and yesterday we heard speeches from the Chairman of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Herron, and from other colleagues of mine&mdash;from Senator Minchin, Senator Knowles, and Senator Cooney, and from Senator West, who spoke yesterday. I am sure that we will give every consideration to the arguments set out in the majority report and in the minority report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the record, I am entirely convinced by the position that Senator Herron has put to the committee in the majority report: tobacco is addictive; tobacco is poisonous to the human system; and it is our responsibility to curb every possible use of tobacco, consistent with the human rights and freedoms of citizens to choose. The day is fast coming when tobacco will be described accurately as a poison and when it will no longer be fully available for sale in the community in the way that it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter that leads me to rise concerns the general remarks in this debate from Senator Cooney, my good friend. I quarrel not with Senator Cooney's point that parliament should have appropriate and ample resources to do its work&mdash;of course, I support that; and from the clarification of Senator MacGibbon's remarks, I can see that he stands by that as well, as do we all&mdash;but I quarrel with my good friend Senator Cooney fearing an outcome. He is anticipating what might be in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe, even with the restricted and measured amount that was announced in <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the election campaign, that there will be a cut in the expenditure in the upcoming budget which will affect all areas of government and all areas of the parliament. But let me assert to Senator Cooney, and indeed to all senators, that, if there are any measures put in the budget that relate to parliamentary appropriation which are judged by a majority in this Senate to be seriously affecting the ability of the parliament to do its work, then the parliament must say so. Then, through the estimates process and legislation committees, it must examine the detail of the provision with regard to the Senate, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the library, the Joint House Department and, if necessary, the House of Representatives to ensure that the parliament does have the resources to fulfil its responsibilities&mdash;as we do in so many ways&mdash;not least in the committee system, which was the focus of Senator Cooney's remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues and I said this when Senator Walsh was Minister for Finance and when at one stage there was a tussle about whether there was adequate provision for the parliament. The appropriate way for that to take place is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), after proper consultations with colleagues, and for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Mr Faulkner) and other representative senators to have meetings with the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to ensure that there are appropriate moneys. If there are not appropriate moneys, they should make the appropriate resolutions when the budget is before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My quarrel with Senator Cooney is that he has set up a scarecrow. I understand solidly his principle that the parliament must have its resources. The parliament has control of the budget, even if it is initiated, as with all money bills, in the House of Representatives. We all&mdash;opposition and government members and minority party senators alike&mdash;must stand when the time appropriately comes. We must not stand in any anxious anticipation of the budget. But, when the time appropriately comes, we must stand to ensure that the parliament is able to fulfil its duties.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I can promise that I will stick to the subject matter and content of this report because it was a very important committee inquiry into what became known as Eastlink. On 30 March last year, the Senate referred to the <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate Economics References Committee for inquiry and report the matter of the proposed interconnection of New South Wales and Queensland electricity grids with a high voltage powerline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter arose following public questioning of the viability of the link and other matters, the imposition of its construction on private lands and the possible health risks emanating from high voltage powerlines. Because the committee's report was completed after the Senate rose at the end of last year, it was presented to the President of the Senate out of session on 18 December 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the Eastlink inquiry stemmed from a proposal which forms part of a much broader plan, that of interconnecting the electricity utilities of the eastern states to increase national competitiveness and efficiency, the committee's work for the most part particularly related to the concerns of those people living along the proposed Eastlink route; that is, the regions flowing along a line from Gatton, near Toowoomba, in Queensland to Armidale in northern New South Wales. The link was to have been a 330 kilovolt double circuit steel trowel transmission line, having a length of about 380 kilometres to 400 kilometres, capable of carrying 500 megawatts in either direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of this inquiry, the committee received 274 submissions, 1,266 form letters and surveys, and petitions carrying some 2,658 signatures. Public hearings were held in Toowoomba and Armidale and detailed inspections were conducted along parts of the route.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During these hearings and inspections it became clear to the committee that the communities affected by Eastlink were very strongly against the proposal. Demonstrations were held outside public hearing venues and the community of Allora organised a street parade to show the committee just how strongly people felt about Eastlink passing through the Allora region. I well remember that street demonstration because it was early in the course of our inquiry. I do remember that when the committee first went to Queensland to hear evidence we were welcomed by the then Queensland Minister for Mines and <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="304"> Energy, suggesting that we were conducting a kangaroo court, that because I as a South Australian was chairing it perhaps I didn't have any knowledge of what was going on in Queensland anyway.</PARA>

<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is not minister. He is a colleague of Senator Burns, but I would say that, judging by the paper comments the next morning, not a close colleague of Senator Burns. It is the first time I have ever been on a Senate inquiry where senators have actually been welcomed with the enthusiasm they were on this inquiry. I think that is a sign that the people in the general community welcomed the opportunity and the activity of Senate committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the photos in the report distinctly shows a photograph of a truck going down the street. All it has on it is a banner saying, `We thank the senators just for coming'. I think that highlighted the effectiveness of Senate committees and the work they do. It gave people who felt they had been deprived of any opportunity, any public hearing or any consultation to have a chance to talk to the Senate and to publicly state what their feelings really were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me, one of the highlights of this particular inquiry was the fact that people who felt they had been deprived of any opportunity to state their case now felt that there was a venue and an opportunity, through the Senate committee system, for them to do so. I think it is a case of taking the parliament to the people when normally we expect the people to come to the parliament. So I think that was most important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's inquiry covered a lot of aspects, particularly the potential health effects of EMFs. I think that far outweighed any of the other considerations we were lobbied on or given evidence on, excepting perhaps some of the environmental concerns. The committee found that many people held genuine reservations about the impact that a high voltage powerline may have on their health and the health of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In attempting to resolve this issue from a scientific point of view, it became clear that <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reputable scientists have taken strong stands both in support of and against the proposition that high voltage powerlines may cause health effects in people living near them. In the light of such conflicting evidence, and because it is not possible to scientifically prove a negative, the committee was unable to totally dismiss the possibility that there may be adverse effects. Similarly, we were unable to conclude that a definite link exists between high voltage powerlines and adverse effects on human health and thus that any new policy recommendations need to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the one thing that we were able to agree on and conclude was that simply the fear of detrimental health effects&mdash;whether real or imaginary&mdash;was itself having an impact on the lives of some individuals who were affected by the Eastlink proposal. In acknowledging those concerns the committee took a similar stand to that of the Gibbs report and agreed that, as a minimum policy or until evidence is proved otherwise, the concept of prudent avoidance should continue to be practised by government and power authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Eastlink, we particularly concluded that prudent avoidance should mean siting the line as far as possible away from houses, outbuildings and other farm facilities. Of course, history has moved on since then and we know that decisions have been taken which are possibly not in the light of the committee's report. But I am quite sure that some of the evidence that we took and the recommendations we made had an influence on a decision that was made by the now Queensland government to revisit the issue of both the power connection and the Eastlink proposal itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the community consultation process used, there was much evidence given to the committee that, while authorities made an effort to consult people directly affected by the proposal, both those individuals and the broader community rejected the consultation process as completely inadequate. People believed that they were never given a chance or choice on Eastlink in the consultation process and that because of that it was intrinsically flawed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="305">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that, while the power authorities put a large effort into public consultation, the methods used were not acceptable to and were not accepted by many of those people affected by the proposed powerline. The committee also concluded that the effect on the community of the public consultation process&mdash;as inadequate as it was&mdash;was, ironically, `considerable social disquiet and distress'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout the inquiry the committee was impressed by the knowledge and the enthusiasm the community groups and individuals held for alternative renewable forms of electricity generation. This view paralleled the opinion expressed in the report of this committee's predecessor, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, when it tabled a report in the Senate in 1992 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gas and electricity: combining efficiency and greenhouse</EMPHASIS>. The report also said that Queensland would be an ideal place for increased research and development of renewable energy options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay a special tribute to the secretariat. The economic references committee secretariat has had a number of inquiries over the past 12 months and the dedication of the staff is outstanding. In this particular case there were 274 written submissions, and the work that the secretariat put into the inquiry&mdash;particularly the secretary, Rob Diamond, and Dr Pippa Carron&mdash;was quite outstanding. I certainly pay tribute to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the former chairman of that committee, I also pay tribute to the members of the committee, particularly my deputy chairman, Senator Bruce Childs. This committee has a history of providing unanimous reports to the Senate. Although this was not a totally unanimous report&mdash;we thought we had one until Senator Woodley put in a two&hyphen;page minority report at the end&mdash;there was general agreement and we worked towards a unanimous report. The functions of the committee in this particular case were designed to represent the views of people in the area and I felt that we had a responsibility to come to as unanimous a report as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank the committee members&mdash;Senator Burns and Senator Woodley are here&mdash;and <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those people involved in the Eastlink inquiry. I appreciate the way we worked together. I hope that when the new references committee has met and its chairman is elected, the same spirit of cooperation will exist when reporting to the Senate on matters of vital importance which have been referred to it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is any doubt that Eastlink will proceed at some stage because there is no nation on this planet that stops any transmission line for electricity at a state or provincial border; it is done within a nation. Economically, I believe the imperatives are there for it to occur at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As Senator Ferguson said, once again the Senate committee system gave an opportunity to people to have a platform to voice their concerns about what they saw as a real problem for them and the people in their community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had discussions with eminent people in the electricity industry and with those who oppose transmission lines and have concerns about EMFs. One thing emerges clearly: no&hyphen;one can show that they are detrimental and no&hyphen;one can show that they are not. The jury is still out on that particular matter. There is one thing it is certain the jury is not out on: the visual pollution is damned horrible. It is a pity some other way could not be found through alternative energy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the community voiced their opposition to Eastlink, but it was also very enlightening and very good to hear them suggesting alternative energy. I was a little surprised, because I have never heard people do so in such a consistent way as those people did who appeared before the committee. I for one support those sorts of propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consultation question was a real problem. I guess like all quangos the people <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="306"> involved in this particular measure took the Big Brother approach. They really were saying to people, `We'll consult with you,' but all they wanted to do was tell people what they were going to do, how they were going to do it and how it should not worry anyone. To me that is not real consultation. I hope that in the future, if this matter does proceed, there is good consultation. I hope that they do take notice of the suggestions by the committee about siting within particular properties and across that area generally when the link is put in in the years ahead.</PARA></SPEECH>

It was quite a remarkable experience to have half the town turn out to welcome a Senate committee. I guess that this is one of the great and often undervalued roles of the Senate&mdash;that is, to provide an opportunity for people to have their voices heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the report was tabled last December, there has been a change of government in Queensland. In this respect, at least I congratulate the new coalition government on their decision to heed the views and advice of many people and of this Senate committee, and to cancel the Eastlink project. I hear what Senator Burns says. In the future there may be a connection of some sort but certainly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> now is not the time for that connection to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a few parts of the report, particularly my additional minority report. It was not a dissenting report in the sense that it disagreed with the report which was made, which I endorsed; rather, it emphasised a number of points which I believe needed more emphasis and underlined a need for much better scrutiny of the real economic, environmental and health costs of Eastlink.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the minority report, I would just like to put on the record the broader environmental concerns which I believe need to be addressed. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe the evidence provided to the Inquiry shows</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a continuing lack of support by governments or the electricity industry for encouraging the reduction of electricity consumption throughout the community, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> an ongoing failure to provide serious support or encouragement to alternative energy options, and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>although, as Senator Burns says, that is what the community is asking for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> little or no consideration given to the potential impact of Eastlink on greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the things that I wanted to underline, and that was really the reason for the minority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final paragraph of the report reiterates once again that Queensland would be an ideal place for increased research and development of renewable energy options. It is obvious to me that this potential, underlined by two Senate reports, is not being addressed. That costs us all environmentally, but it means also that Queensland is missing out on considerable economic benefits in being able to establish renewable energy industries, with the likelihood of many jobs being generated in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is good that Eastlink will now be scrapped, but it is crucial that in the light of that scrapping the Queensland government does not just replace it with other powerlines or, even worse, build more coal fired or hydro&hyphen;electric power stations. Unfortunately, it appears that this is still a possibility&mdash;that <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="307"> the Queensland government may go down that track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is ridiculous that governments consider spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars on unnecessarily generating and transmitting electricity. It appears very much that this is being driven by electricity companies. We have seen evidence of that in recent weeks in the media in Queensland. We saw a scandalous example of an electricity corporation trying to hoodwink the state government into believing that there was an impending power crisis, with blackouts and brownouts supposedly likely to be widespread this summer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has now come to light, in a statement to the Queensland government in recent days, that this scenario is totally false and was based on false information given to the government by one of the power generating authorities. It is clear to me that electricity companies will do all they can to further their own commercial interests, regardless of the overall economic, environmental, social and health costs to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with what Don Maisch said in a right&hyphen;of&hyphen;reply which he made to the Electricity Supply Association of Australia's criticism of his original report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fields of Conflict</EMPHASIS>. He says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is perhaps understandable why the ESAA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Electricity Supply Association of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">consistently denies that there is a possible EMF&hyphen;health hazard. Their role is not to be a public health "watch dog", but to be an advocate for the power industries interests, and talk of health hazards is, quite frankly, bad for business.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this whole debate were about the hazards from tobacco smoking, and not about EMF's, could we rely on the tobacco institute to give expert advice on the health risk from smoking?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ESAA should be concerned about the legal implications of their attempts to suppress the evidence of an EMF health hazard. In both the asbestos and tobacco industry, similar attempts to suppress hazard information eventually resulted in multi million dollar litigation cases. Specifically because their attempts to suppress information indicated the industries knew of the risk, and still knowingly exposed workers and the public to their products.  <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA>I just want to say that it is a risky strategy for the ESAA to be involved in. I hope the Queensland government is able to stand up to this sort of strategy used by the ESAA and make decisions for the future benefit of all Queenslanders.</PARA>

<PARA>I note that the only good thing the lost but not lamented Frank Walker ever did was ask the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to inquire into the redistribution process. I think it was timely and necessary that the redistribution mechanisms be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the only other good thing that occurred under the Labor administration was that it finally got the right chairman for this committee. Laurie Ferguson was the third Labor chairman of this committee in as many months. No offence to my friend and colleague Senator Foreman, Laurie Ferguson did a tremendous job of chairing the committee at the time of this redistribution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shadow minister will do for the moment. We produced a unanimous report, which I always think is a healthy sign in what is otherwise a very partisan parliament. The committee secretary, Kieran Schneemann, and the secretariat did a first class job in supporting the committee on this occasion. I am delighted that Kieran has moved on to greener pastures by joining the staff of a coalition minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, it was a unanimous report. There are 24 individual recommendations which the new government will now need to consider. Because the recommendations are unanimous, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="308"> certainly I as a coalition member am happy to encourage the government to adopt them. If they are adopted, the redistribution process will be considerably improved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major problem with the redistribution process at the moment is the requirement on the redistribution committee to ensure that 3&half; years after the redistribution is made no division will deviate by over two per cent from the average divisional enrolment for that state. That was actually a relaxation of the original Labor rule which said that after 3&half; years there had to be exact equality, which was an impossible requirement. There was a relaxation brought in to make it two per cent but even that has proved to be extremely difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor and Liberal members alike regard that requirement on distribution committees in drawing electoral boundaries as an impossible mathematical requirement which is subjugating all other criteria in relation to community interest, et cetera, to the mathematical requirement, which for those of us who have been actively involved in redistributions is guesswork anyway. It is based on population projections which often prove wildly inaccurate. It is resulting in rural electorates, which have relatively low growth, being placed well above quota and therefore even bigger than they would otherwise be. Our rural members are having an impossible task placed before them as a result of this section.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most important recommendations is that we allow for a variation in the rules relating to the 3&half; years and the two per cent. I think the two per cent the committee recommended should be allowed out to 3&half; per cent. The National Party submitted that it should be five per cent. I think the government should move to a 3&half; per cent tolerance, if not more, in order that we can have a sensible approach to the business of redistributions and take account of other criteria. I also note the recommendation that the period of 3&half; years probably should be reduced. It is very difficult to project 3&half; years out. That probably should come back to two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a very important recommendation, No. 4, in relation to large electorates. I think we all accept now the 10 per cent rule, <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> although it was very contentious back in 1974 when it was introduced. We have recommended that the Minister for Administrative Services consult with the six largest House of Representatives seats to discuss ways in which we can improve the members' capacity to represent their constituents. I think that is a very important recommendation and one I encourage our new Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) to take up. Some of our electorates are impossibly huge, some as large as western Europe, and very difficult for anyone to service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also recommended that the criteria in relation to existing boundaries be subservient to the other qualitative criteria&mdash;that is, community interests, means of communication and travel, physical features&mdash;because the boundaries commissioners find themselves having to constrain themselves to existing boundaries for no reason. There is no reason at all why undue regard should be paid to existing boundaries when drawing seats. Community interest is the most important qualitative criteria and should override existing boundaries. They are among the most significant recommendations which, again, were supported unanimously and which I hope the government will look seriously at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We discussed the issue of electoral boundaries and political fairness to some degree. That is dealt with in chapter five of this very good report. It is an issue of considerable importance. We have seen in a number of state elections in particular governments of both colours winning office with less than 50 per cent of the two&hyphen;party preferred vote, which is not one vote one value at all. It of necessity means that voters for the party that is achieving government with less than 50 per cent has a vote worth more than the party that is gaining the majority of the vote but a minority of the seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a complete denial of one vote, one value to have such a situation occur. We have had that situation in Queensland and New South Wales recently. It occurred in South Australia in 1989, where the Labor Party, with 48 per cent of the vote, was able to govern. I was privileged to be part of a group of people who brought about a tremendous <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="309"> constitutional change in that state, the only state that provides for politically fair boundaries. We now have in South Australia the fairest boundaries of any state in Australia&mdash;or indeed of the nation&mdash;in that they provide that the party that wins a majority of the votes shall have a majority of the seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, as an architect of that South Australian scheme, was wanting the committee to look at that issue from a federal point of view. I concede, and I do so in the report, that it is extremely difficult to apply such a mechanism at a federal level. It would have to be done on a state by state basis. You are dealing in some states with relatively few seats. It is very difficult to apply the very good South Australian system at a federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also concede that, at the moment, there is no obvious call for such a system. We do not have a situation nationally where governments win office with less than 50 per cent of the vote. The only recent experience was in 1990 where the coalition got just over 50 per cent of the vote but did not win. I do not think it was so dramatic a deviation that it would call for a review of this issue at a federal level but I do think it is an issue that the parliament should monitor. It should constantly keep under watch the question of the political fairness of federal boundaries. If we find significant deviations occurring&mdash;one way or the other&mdash;then the matter should be looked at to see whether something like the South Australian model should be brought in nationally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I think this is a very good review of the nation's system for drawing electoral boundaries, the system that does determine who wins office. It is the nature of the seats; it is the nature of government. We do have to ensure one vote, one value but we also have to ensure politically fair boundaries. Therefore they need to be monitored. This report will now go to the new government and I hope it will adopt what are unanimous recommendations. I therefore commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission because of my concern for the way in which it appears to lack accountability. It receives about $854 million each financial year, not counting funds for things like the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies or Aboriginal Hostels. The total Commonwealth expenditure on the indigenous population is about $1.3 billion and the latest census data indicates that the population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is 265,000 or 1.6 per cent of the total population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have to say that what I am going to outline tonight I would outline if it came from any possible department that you could wish to think of. And I want to dispute up front any claim of any degree of racism, because I believe very firmly&mdash;as my record will show throughout my time in the Senate, in the chamber and in estimates and other committee hearings&mdash;that I have had a long interest in and concern about the welfare of Aboriginal communities, and particularly about health, employment prospects and housing. But accountability must be an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board phenomenon. It must not be dependent upon race, colour, religion, nationality, gender or anything else. Nor should it be exempted by any of these things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Strelley station in the Pilbara, the north&hyphen;west region of my home state of Western Australia, and related entities such as the Nomads Charitable and Educational Foundation, have been intermittently under the microscope in the Senate since 1993. I have raised my concerns about it regularly, as have my colleagues Senator Panizza and Senator Tambling. There have been speeches, questions on notice and questions asked at many Senate estimates committee hearings. There has been print media and television coverage. Now an ombudsman investigation is under <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="310"> way because ATSIC is not able to provide any substantiation that it has been accountable on Strelley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to the concerns raised since 1993, when a task force review was conducted, has been piecemeal to say the least. The outcome has been questionable at best. Certainly, it would appear that the former minister, Mr Tickner, had little interest in the allegations raised. Equally, it appears that certain staff in ATSIC Perth have had to go it alone in terms of trying to sort out the mess, by commissioning a special task force review and an independent audit report of its grants to the Strelley and Nomads entities. The most recently released audit report is an inspection of funds granted by ATSIC to Strelley and Nomads. That was conducted by Duesburys Chartered Accountants. The report, I have to say, is damning. I seek leave of the Senate to table both these documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report arises from a recommendation made by the Strelley task force review team back in March 1994. It indicates that the former Department of Aboriginal Affairs and its successor, ATSIC, planned a number of reviews of the Strelley organisation over the past 20 years. These did not eventuate until the regional council of ATSIC made a once and for all decision in April 1993 to suspend ongoing funding for 1993&hyphen;94 to Strelley and Nomads until a major review was undertaken. CDEP funding was suspended in July of the same year by ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force report explains that the reason for this is that the administrator of the companies, Mr Don McLeod, whose office is located in South Guildford some 1,800 kilometres away from the site of Strelley station, constantly denied ATSIC access to the Aboriginal communities there. The report says that Mr McLeod required ATSIC staff or staff from other agencies to seek his permission before they visited the Aboriginal communities. Approval was not usually forthcoming and, when it was, administrative staff from the South Guildford office accompanied the ATSIC staff on their visits. They were not permitted to contact the communities directly <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to arrange visits. Due to this arrangement and the alleged lack of cooperation by Mr McLeod, the investigation took many years to eventuate. When it did, according to the report, it `was not able to satisfactorily address a number of the terms of reference'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additionally, recommendation 10 on page 70 of the report indicates:</PARA>

<PARA>Actually, the concern about Mr McLeod's ability to run the stations in the best interests of Aboriginal people goes as far back as 1977. I seek leave to table a copy of an assessment made by the Chief Pastoral Inspector, dated 12 January 1977, to the chairman of the Pastoral Appraisement Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In that assessment the inspector stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from this, it is pointed out that Strelley Pastoral Pty Ltd also "manage" Coongan and Warralong, held by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. It should also be noted that this same group, headed by Mr Don McLeod, were in earlier years responsible for the virtual extinction of Riverdale, Meentheena, Yandeeyarra and White Springs as operational station units and it is a foregone conclusion that such will be the fate of Strelley, Coongan, Warralong and any other pastoral properties which come under their control.</PARA>
<PARA>The inspector then concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no hesitation recommending that the request to transfer Lalla Rookh to Strelley Pastoral Pty Ltd be refused until such time as the company has demonstrated its real intent and ability to efficiently develop, stock and operate stations in a husband-like manner as required under Section 103(3)(4)(c) of the Land Act.</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe if that advice and warning had been heeded, we would not be seeing the gross waste that is evident today. Nonetheless, the evidence that has been produced subsequent to that since 1993 has been damning and the former minister should have taken it on board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="311"> The task force report showed that Strelley had been abandoned, but considerable infrastructure remained in place. This included 40 houses, 10 shelters, two single&hyphen;men's quarters, an ablution block, a solar pack, two school buildings, a mechanical workshop, a power house building, two generator sheds, two fuel tanks and three water tanks. It is alleged that, despite this state of abandon, ATSIC had poured another $1.6 million into Strelley. This is despite the insistence of a former caretaker, Mr Ric Livingstone, who stated in his February 1993 report to the state government that the money was going to waste or, worse still, that it had been syphoned away from the Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The task force report in 1994 and the subsequent Duesburys report of this year paint a very bleak picture in terms of gross misappropriation of funds and the questionable existence or use of assets. Alarmingly, in my mind many of these assets were in Perth, not in the Pilbara where the communities reside. It stands as obvious that they could have been of no benefit to the Aboriginal communities for where they were intended. These assets included a $33,000 Cessna 150, five motor vehicles to a total value in excess of $70,000, a mobile septic tank valued at about $3,500 and an $11,000 trailer&hyphen;mounted solar plant that is in Perth. The finding on the CDEP outcome is that not a single time sheet could be found. There was no proof of the operation of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the summary of the findings Duesburys indicate that, despite their best efforts, they were unable to prove and identify the existence of assets purchased with grant funding, nor were they able to physically inspect these assets to determine their operational status or their current market values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the things that need to be highlighted include the failure to provide financial reports to ATSIC within the reporting periods specified, failure to have financial reports certified as having been ordered and failure to have financial reports audited by an appropriate person. The list goes on. Then we have specific examples of apparent impropriety, which include $10,000 paid to Nomads Management Pty Ltd for accounting and auditing, although the relevant invoices for the related party did not detail the nature or the extent of the services provided. We have amounts totalling $55,000 which were paid to Nomads for airfares and charters, but Nomads were unable to provide Duesburys with <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> documentary evidence as to the nature and extent of the services provided by Nomads. Then we have repairs and maintenance of vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An amount of $6,500 was paid to Watts Western Rubber, Bayswater, Perth, to purchase 58 tyres and 188 tubes. The invoice was made out to Strelley Pastoral Pty Ltd but was charged to Nomads. I might add that the 58 tyres and 188 tubes were for seven vehicles, as were sixty&hyphen;five 12&hyphen;volt heavy duty batteries to the value of $3,997. The invoice was made out to the Moolyella Society but was charged to Nomads. Once again, the 65 batteries were for seven vehicles. Amounts totalling $12,122 were paid to Nomads Management during 1991-92 for the services of a part-time bookkeeper, but they were not able to ascertain which employee these charges related to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My time is almost ready to expire. The problem is vast and it needs to be addressed. </PARA>

<STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.25 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in the Senate chamber I rise to mourn, firstly, but also, more importantly, to pay tribute to a great Australian, a great Western Australian, a great Aboriginal and a great bloke. I am talking about Rob Riley. The sad news came through to this place yesterday that Rob had been found dead in a suburban hotel in Perth. It came as a tremendous shock to me personally. To those around this place who have known Rob and who have known him for a number of years, it was a tremendous shock. I imagine that it must have been a devastating blow to his family. I have not been able to talk with them. It is probably something that they as family members and intimate friends will not be able to recover from for a long period. I think all of Australia is saddened by Rob's passing and all of Australia is deprived of a very important individual in the area of Aboriginal reconciliation and also in the area of the representation of the views and aspirations of the Aboriginal people of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="312">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I got to know Rob pretty well when he worked as a senior adviser for the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, in the late 1980s. I suppose we had a few things in common. He reminded me on one occasion that there was a bit of Irishness in both of us, which lent for a bit of rebellion. He attributed that in part to his name, which was reflective of at least part of his ancestry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rob came from a minority and, as a migrant, I was also part of a minority. He also cared very deeply about people. We had another thing in common, which I only very recently found out, and that was that both of us had been apprentice fitters and turners. I stuck with my apprenticeship and he, fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;certainly fortunately for his people&mdash;went on to do other things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, he served in the Beaufort Street Magistrates Court as a clerk with the Crown Law Department in Western Australia. He then joined the army and spent three years there before he returned to Western Australia to study psychology at the WA Institute of Technology, or WAIT, as we called it. From there he went on to work for the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then he started on a path that was to bring him to national and, some would say, international prominence when in 1981, at the tender age of 26, he won an election to serve on the then National Aboriginal Council. At 27 he was chairman of the WA branch, and at 28 he was the deputy national chairman. In June 1984 he became the youngest national chairman elected by the national conference of the NAC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had very strong views, as did the NAC. They were perhaps so strong that in the middle of 1985 the then Hawke government decided to abolish the NAC, which put Rob out of a job. But he was not out of a job for very long. He moved himself up to Darwin in the Northern Territory to work for the Northern Lands Council. It was when he came to work for the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, that I actually got to know him. From there he continued on his path to national prominence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year he was again very much in the news in Western Australia after a couple of <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unfortunate incidents where he was caught in charge of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Obviously, for a person of his prominence and in his position it was not something to boast about. But he met that challenge front on, so much so that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper saw fit to write an editorial about him on Thursday, 3 August 1995. I want to quote part of that editorial because it says an enormous amount about the man:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he has salvaged dignity and pride from his nightmare with his straightforward courage and honesty in accepting responsibility and punishment for his wrongdoing. From the depths of his humiliation he has set an example of strength of character that others can look up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">His resignation from his job of executive director of the ALS is widely regretted&mdash;especially in the Aboriginal community&mdash;but it was the only honourable course he could take.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the editorial it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although his offences are serious, they took place at a time of high emotion for Mr Riley. National Aboriginal and Islander Week this year focused on the tragedy of Aboriginal children separated from the families and only days before his offences Mr Riley had publicly told of his own emotionally wrenching experience. To his credit, he made no attempt to use this to avoid the consequences of his actions.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I quote those comments is to draw attention to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's national inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. That is a much needed inquiry. I hope&mdash;as, I suspect, do those other senators who had cause to make representation to the then government to get this inquiry under way and ensure it had funding&mdash;that the inquiry will be a memorial to Rob Riley, a person who has done so much to support the cause of Aboriginals in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to make this a partisan political issue but, as we have talked about in other debates in this place, attempts have been made by government to cut funding in various program areas under its administration. I suspect that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will have to endure some funding cuts just as other government bodies and departments will. But I hope that, <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="313"> as a tribute to Rob Riley, this inquiry will be separated from those cuts and that the minister will ensure that it will be fully funded to its proper conclusion. That would be a tribute to this great Western Australian, this great Aboriginal, this great bloke.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

<TALK.START>
<TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME>
<STATE> (Queensland)</STATE>
<TIME.STAMP>(7.34 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address the Senate once again on the issue of what I believe is failed financial supervision in Queensland. Senators might recall that in 1995 I advised the Senate that the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision and the Queensland Treasurer had failed to competently supervise credit unions in that state. Queenslanders, quite properly, are asked to have confidence in the credit union supervisor, but I believe that the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision has failed to act on serious complaints made to it against the Queensland Professional Credit Union Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to explain tonight the extent of the failure of the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision. A number of my Queensland constituents have tried to extract answers from QOFS but to no avail. They have been told that the matters with respect to the 57th report of the Senate Committee of Privileges are `at an end'. Yet I believe that no proper investigation was undertaken by QOFS. There should have been an investigation into the conversion of long service and holiday pay to employer superannuation. If independent inquiries had been made, the QOFS would no doubt have responded differently to my constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the Senate Privileges Committee report, the issue is that the Queensland Professional Credit Union took reprisal action against a member when he tried to question management of the QPCU. That person's membership in the credit union was terminated without giving that member his rights according to the credit union's own rules. Three members of the credit union then complained to the QOFS claiming that the credit union had broken its rules and, in turn, was in breach of the financial institution's code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The QOFS responded to the members' complaint that they had considered the Senate <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Privileges Committee report and found that no further action was warranted. However, they did not bother to give reasons. Was it perhaps that they did not consider that there may have been a breach? Perhaps they may have thought that there was a breach but that it was not worth pursuing. Or is it that the relationship between the credit union and the industry regulator&mdash;the QOFS&mdash;is such that it is in the best interests of QOFS not to bite the hand that feeds it?  The QOFS is funded by levies from the credit unions and building societies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the Senate Privileges Committee was not satisfied with the board of the credit union when it wrote that `it considers the explanation provided by QPCU was disingenuous'. At the 1995 AGM of the QPCU the managing director, Mr Rutherford, stated that they were delighted with the report of the Senate Privileges Committee. Also, in correspondence received by my constituents, QOFS said, `It has confidence in the current financial position of the society and the quality of its prudential management and corporate governance.' This, I believe, is a matter of kinship. Where are credit union members to go for a remedy for a blatant disregard of proper processes, as in this case? If the regulatory body is not prepared to enforce the code, all we have is window&hyphen;dressing as regulation, and this could have dire consequences for the members of all non&hyphen;bank financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue which has been the subject of member complaint arose out of the 1994 annual report of the QPCU. It was about a conversion of long service leave and unused holiday leave which was transferred to employer superannuation. I have raised this matter previously in the House and with the previous Treasurer and also with the current Treasurer (Mr Costello). They have advised that such a conversion was not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet at the 1995 AGM of the Queensland Professional Credit Union Ltd shareholders were assured by Mr Ellwood of KPMG that the ATO, the Australian Taxation Office, had completed its inquiry into the conversion of long service leave to superannuation. This assurance was expressed in such a way as to leave most shareholders with the impression <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="314"> that the ATO was accepting the transfer as a bona fide transaction. In a newsletter from KPMG to clients and in the media, KPMG states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that industrial relations legislation may limit the extent to which some employee entitlements (for example, unused annual leave and long service leave entitlements) may be the subject of such arrangements . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This newsletter is referring to arrangements which I have described above. KPMG is telling clients in February 1996 that this type of transfer should not be attempted. But at the credit union's AGM in October 1995 Mr Ellwood appeared to be telling the members of the credit union that it was okay. They cannot have it both ways. There is a basic inconsistency in the advice by KPMG. This raises a serious question: was the credit union meeting in October 1995 misled by KPMG?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter of public interest. With the current federal government's proposal to allow banks, and presumably credit unions, to partake in a share of the superannuation honey pot, it is imperative that adequate controls are in place to protect the retirement savings of Australian workers. Failure to do so would be inviting disaster. I will ask the Treasurer, in a letter to him, to advise the Senate of the ATO's estimate of the legality, prevalence and revenue loss as a result of transactions such as the one advised by KPMG to the Queensland Professional Credit Union Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the Treasurer to assure the Senate that the ATO is recovering the outstanding tax in the above transactions and to say what steps it has taken to audit this activity in Australia. I ask the Treasurer to raise these issues at the next meeting of the council of premiers and finance ministers and seek a review of the effectiveness of the Australian financial institutions code and whether the exemptions from the Australian corporations and securities legislation enjoyed by credit unions and building societies should be revoked. It is my view that these organisations have not been subjected to an effective watchdog and would be better supervised at arm's length through the Australian Securities Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to recognise the tremendous work being done in Australia towards the treatment of diabetes, particularly with respect to young children and adolescents. The International Diabetes Federation is an international body which conducts research around the world into the very debilitating disease of diabetes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia, there is a consultative section which focuses particularly on childhood and adolescent diabetes. The co&hyphen;conveners of that organisation are Mrs Lorna Mellor and Professor Martin Silink. Mrs Mellor is the Vice&hyphen;President of the International Diabetes Federation and Professor Silink is a leading expert and specialist in this field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May last year I became aware of the need for funding support for the Australian consultative section to enable them to conduct an international conference in Sydney in April of this year. The aim of that conference was a workshop to bring together experts from Asian and Pacific nations to look at research and, in particular, the training needs for health care workers in other less developed countries so that they could go back and assist in the treatment and further research of this disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conference was held in April of this year. It was able to be held because of the support that came particularly from AusAID through its international seminar support program. I particularly want to place on the record thanks to the former minister Gordon Bilney for his assistance in making that support through that program possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the workshop took place in Sydney in early April this year. I am advised that it was a great success. I was privileged to be able to attend the opening ceremony and to meet a large number of distinguished international experts, all giving selflessly of their time towards researching and assisting in trying to find not only a cure but ways of more appropriately dealing with this complaint; a complaint that many people are aware of and that afflicts, in particular,  adults&mdash;quite often without any prior warning&mdash;but also new-born children and young <BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="315"> people, who then have to live with that complaint for the rest of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week I had the opportunity to visit the new children's hospital at Westmead and to see the work being performed by Professor Silink and his team first-hand. It is certainly inspirational to see the dedication of Professor Silink and his team&mdash;the nurses and all the other staff at the children's hospital&mdash;giving hope to and giving of their time and their skill for these young children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I also wish to place on the record a particular tribute to Mrs Lorna Mellor who has given many years to the International Diabetes Federation in this area. She is a woman who has the ability to get things moving, to get things happening, and to get other people moving. She was very much responsible for getting this conference off the ground and for bringing people from all around the region to Sydney. I understand that that is the first time that that has occurred. I understand that, following the conference, the delegates have returned to their own countries, are putting those training programs in place and are looking to conduct further workshops which will progress the work in this most important area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In conclusion, I believe that this is one of those areas where government funding support is certainly appropriate and it produces real results. I only hope that, in the current climate that grips the current government, they can recognise that there are many areas where we should not look to reduce the funding but to improve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I finally wish to pay tribute to Mr Terry Sheahan who has been the President of Diabetes Australia for a number of years. He was also involved in getting this conference off the ground. Terry retires from his position as President of Diabetes Australia this year, and he has also devoted many years to assisting in this very important work.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1>

I raise a matter which is quite serious in nature in my home <BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> state of New South Wales. On 25 May there will be a by-election for the seat of Clarence. Clarence is a very pleasant area on the north coast of New South Wales. It takes in a number of very pleasant towns such as Lismore, Grafton, Casino and Yamba.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Up until recently, Harry Woods, whom we all know, the former member for Page, looked after that area as the federal member. In this up&hyphen;coming state by&hyphen;election Harry Woods will be the candidate for the Labor Party. I have to say, not at any great length, that I wish him a great deal of luck and thank him for continuing to serve the people of that north coast area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to raise a matter about the National Party candidate in that particular seat, a fellow by the name of Geoff Knight. The things that I wish to say regarding him are not quite as pleasant as those I have said about Harry Woods. Geoffrey Leonard Knight was, until the end of last year&mdash;in fact, January&mdash;living in the state seat of Coffs Harbour at an address at Bonville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some time earlier this year Geoff Knight, realising there was shortly going to be a National Party preselection for the seat of Clarence, took up enrolment at an address known as `Bonnyhills' Orara Way, Glenray. The interesting thing about this particular property is that there is no house there, there is no water and there is no electricity. Geoff Knight was subsequently preselected by the National Party and he is now the candidate for the state seat of Clarence. Understandably, the National Party may not have done anything about this if they had been unaware but the fact is it is now on the public record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Examiner</EMPHASIS>, a local paper, on 23 April 1996 an article ran about the investigation into his having made false statements in relation to his electoral enrolment. That article pointed out that Mr Knight had originally told them he had never lived on that property, that he had used it for an agistment, that he had fenced it and that he believed, in accordance with the provisions for the local government electoral roll, that being a property owner was entitlement enough for enrolment on the federal roll. In fact, he relied on that enrolment to vote in the last federal election.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="316">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The article then went on to point out that Geoff had resiled from that position some two weeks later by saying that he had in fact resided in a caravan for a very short period though his wife and child had continued to live at the previous address during the period of this supposed residence on the block. I must urge the National Party, in the light of this being on the public record, to do something in relation to their candidate.</PARA>
