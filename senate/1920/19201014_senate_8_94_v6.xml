This course is rendered necessary by the fact that some honorable senators are expected to attend a meeting of the Committee today. </para>

                        <para>- When speaking in this Chamber on the 10th September last upon a motion for the adjournment of the Senate, which was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> F. Guthrie, and which had reference to the wool position in relation to cloth manufacture, I made the following statement regarding the agreement which is now in existence between the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company and the Commonwealth Government :  - </para>

                    <para>But I would point out to the honorable senator that the agreement which was subsequently entered into, and which he now criticises, was drawn up by the Central Wool Committee themselves. This is an historical fact which cannot be evaded. The Central Wool Committee did not sign it, but nevertheless it was the agreement which members of that body drew up. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I find that that statement is inaccurate. The facts are that the agreement of 12th March, 1920, between the Commonwealth Government and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, which was the agreement to which I referred, was not drawn up by the Central Wool Committee, and they were not consulted in respect of it. But, prior to that agreement being adopted, a conference was convened by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> between the Central Wool Committee and the company in question, at which certain heads of the proposed agreement were drafted and agreed to by all the parties, but this draft was not signed. I am informed that it is also a fact that some of the points of the agreement which have been the subject of criticism are covered by the heads which were agreed to by the Central Wool Committee at that conference. But, whilst that is so, my statement that the agreement was drawn up by the Central Wool Committee is not correct. I therefore take the earliest opportunity., since my attention was drawn to the matter, of making this correction of my statement. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a Supply Bill for two months, based, of course, on the Estimates now before Parliament. Parliament has already granted Supply for a little over three months of the present financial year, the votes being for the following amounts:- No. 1, &#163;1,838,847; No. 2, &#163;2,367,826; No. 3, &#163;1,729,915; total, &#163;5,936,588. Further Supply is required to enable salaries for the Public Service to be paid on the 15th October, so it is necessary for the Senate to put the Bill through to-day. The measure provides the money necessary to carry on the ordinary services of the Government for two months, the total amount asked for being &#163;3,128,645. Of this sum &#163;2,124,595 is for ordinary services, &#163;854,050 on account of war services paid from revenue, as indicated in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget  speech, and &#163;150,000 for refunds to revenue, required for refunds of payments in connexion with income tax and Post Office revenue. Appeals are continually pending against taxation assessments, and as these appeals are decided in favour of the taxpayers, who have already paid the amounts in question into the revenue, the Treasurer has to find varying sums of money as refunds. This vote is required to meet such contingencies. A similar position arises in connexion with Post Office revenue from time to time. Apart from these, there are no items in the Bill that call for any special comment, the remainder of the Supply, as I have already stated, being the vote required to carry on the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>-  I am surprised that, when I exhibit any anxiety to encourage the policy of making everything we need in Australia, I should receive such opposition from Protectionists. In 1915 tenders were called for the making of telephone instruments in Australia, and there were some replies. Subsequently the Government informed the tenderers that they did not intend to proceed with the work, but that in all probability they would hear more of the matter within twelve months. I understand it is quite possible, under certain circumstances, to make about 80 per cent. of telephone instrument parts in Australia, and if this work can be done under fair and reasonable conditions - I am not asking the Government to pay too much for them - it should be advisable to encourage the manufacturers. I was speaking to one of the tenderers in Sydney this week, and I gathered, from our conversation, that a company undertaking to make telephone instruments in Australia would require a contract from the Government for nearly five years, which, I think, is rather a long term. Unless the Government were prepared to give an order covering a fairly long time it would not pay any individual or company to attempt to make the instruments in Australia. Outside the Government requirements, of course, there are very few telephones in Australia. </para>

                            <para>-Just so. If 80 per cent. of an instrument can be made in Australia it is quite possible that if the manufacturers are encouraged they may be able, ultimately, to make the other 20 per cent., so that in course of time telephones may be entirely made in the Commonwealth. I mention this matter in order to get some information from the Minister as to whether the Government intend again to call tenders, or whether the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> will let me know why the proposition has been turned down, because it is nearly four years ago now since tenders were invited, and the tenderers were informed then that they could expect some further communications on the subject from the Government. No reasons were given, except that the Government did not intend then to go on with it, but that they hoped within twelve months to call for fresh tenders. I am glad the Minister representing the Postmaster-General is present, because he said that the Post Office was &#34; getting a move on.&#34; May I remind him that it is four years since that Department said that within twelve months they would be calling for fresh tenders? I ask the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General, in order to see if it is possible to call for tenders, so that we may ascertain whether at least some portions of the telephones can be made in Australia, and whether the Government can give any firm or firms a guarantee for a certain amount of time, so as to enable them to start making the instruments. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to bring under notice the question of the country mail services in Queensland. During my recent tour of part of that State, I came across quite a number of districts, at no great distance from Rockhampton, which are -without any mail delivery at all. In some cases these districts were being opened, up by returned soldiers. Many of the men who are going in for soldier settlements have not been accustomed, during the greater part of their lives, to country conditions, and, so far as I could gather, one of the- greatest causes of dissatisfaction among them was the fact that they wore not able to get their letters regularly. At one place in particular, known a6 the Dalma Scrub, in addition to the men who are opening up the country as soldier settlers, there is a large number of other settlers who have been there for many years, and who &#39;have been putting up with this state, of affairs for a considerable time. On the first occasion that they asked for a mail service they were informed b3&#39; the  Deputy  Postmaster-General that there was not sufficient money available on account of the restrictions placed on country mail services. At the end of the war, when they rightly considered that their claims should receive some attention from, the Government, they were informed that the Department did not think there was sufficient business to warrant the granting of a mail service. Even if the Department were going to lose temporarily a certain amount owing to the limited business available by giving services to the new settlements which are being opened up by returned soldiers, it would find that, in the long run, by making these men more satisfied with their conditions  it would reap a great reward. There are large numbers of soldier settlers in different parts of Queensland, and. the Department would ultimately benefit by now granting them a weekly, or, if possible, a twice-a-week, mail delivery. I believe it would be possible to get one of the local settlers who has the time at his disposal to undertake the mail contract for a sum that would cost the Government  very  little. Many of these settlers are living away from their people until they get their selections sufficiently cleared to bring their families to them, and the fact that they are not able to receive letters regularly is to them a cause of great dissatisfaction. The question of supplying soldier settlers with mail services should receive the very earnest consideration of the Government. Australia generally will benefit by making them more satisfied with their conditions. </para>

                    <para>On the question of land settlement for returned soldiers, in the early stages a sum amounting to &#163;625 per settler was allocated by the Federal  Government  to the State Governments, and by them - advanced by way of loan to the soldiers, so much to be available for the building of a house, so much for scrub clearing, so much for well sinking, and so much for&#39; stocking up and fencing. On a number of occasions the fact was brought under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator Millen.)</inline> in this Chamber, and also by deputations of the soldiers themselves, that in many cases &#163;625 was not sufficient to give the man a flying start. Recently the Commonwealth Government increased the allowance from &#163;625 to a flat rate of &#163;1,000 per settler, but the settlers themselves were very much surprised when they were informed lately by the Land Settlement Department of the State of Queensland that the extra &#163;375 made available bv the Commonwealth Government was not being granted to the soldier at all, but was being retained by the State Government to meet what they called overhead expenses. A letter, signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline><inline font-style="italic">W.</inline> Phillips, a settler on  the  North-Coast line, recently appeared in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily&#39; Mail,</inline> pointing out the dissatisfaction existing among the settlers as the result of this action by the State Government. I do not know what the Queensland Land Settlement Department claim to be doing with the &#163;375, but it is generally understood that they say they are retaining it for overhead expenses and for the purpose of making roads to the various settlements. I had an opportunity recently to visit two or three of the settlements, particularly one known as Ridgelands and another known as the Charcoal Scrub. If the Queensland Government are charging every settler &#163;375 for the roads they are building out tq these settlements, then they are profiteering at the expense of the soldier settlers, because, generally speaking, those roads are practically impassable for anything except a light spring cart. </para>

                            <para>- The amount of &#163;375 per settler is retained by the Queensland Government, although the Commonwealth Government increased the total advance per settler to &#163;1,000. A number of the settlers have complained that the only amount available for them is &#163;625, and&#39; the letter I referred to, dealing with the deputation of Beerburrum settlers which waited on the Minister, points out that the State Government are retaining &#163;375 per settler for what they call over- head charges. I understood that the Minister for Repatriation decided to increase the amount from &#163;625 to &#163;1,000 per settler, because he realized, as others did, that the extra &#163;375 for improvements and stocking up would mean just the difference in many cases between success and failure on the part of the soldier settlers. But, if the extra amount is to be retained by the State Government, the settlers are in practically no better position than they were when the Commonwealth Government was making available to the States the sum of only &#163;625 per man. I do not know what the intentions of the Government were when they agreed to increase the rate per settler to &#163;1,000, but I understand that the increase was made to enable the men to have more money to assist them in cultivating a larger area if they were farming, or to increase their herds if they were dairying. It is quite apparent that, under the existing state of affairs in Queensland, the soldier settler is no better off than when he was receiving &#163;625. According to the complaint made by the gentleman who brought this matter under the notice of the Queensland Minister for Lands, the extra money is not benefiting the soldier settler to any extent, and. I think it is a matter that should have the immediate attention of the Government. When the amount was increased I do not think it was intended that it should be held by a State Government for overhead expenses. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFOLL. - That is practically what it means; but it is quite possible that the Land Settlement Board will say that it is retaining the amount to construct roads through the scrub. The soldier settlers complain that, although the amount has been increased to the extent I have mentioned, one-third of it is retained by the Government. When I first read the statement made by the settlers themselves, and the reply given by the Minister for Lands, I was astounded. Honorable senators will see that it is out of all proportion , to say that one-third of the money advanced by the Commonwealth Government should be retained for overhead expenses. The Queensland Government are adopting a very different attitude to that of the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the War </para>
                    <para>Service Homes Department, where; no charge is made for administrative expenses. As the Commonwealth is primarily responsible for finding the money for settling soldiers on the land, some investigation should be made as to the manner in which this money is being spent, as too much latitude is being given to Governments in the matter of land settlement. The Commonwealth Government are responsible for raising the money and for the burden of taxation they have to impose upon the people to meet the interest bill, and they should exercise more jurisdiction over the expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- The land policy of the Queensland Government is perpetual leasehold, under which the soldiers are charged rent which should practically cover the cost of road-making. In addition to rent, local government taxes have to be paid on this land as on other properties, which means that the holdings are carrying an excessive burden. If a road is constructed through scrub on Crown lands to a holding 7 or 8 miles off the main road, why should a soldier settler be burdened with the cost of that road ? </para>

Even if the roads are being constructed, it is an unreasonable amount to charge each settler. If an ordinary settler had to pay anything approaching that amount in proportion, to what he was investing he would be unable to carry on. The soldier is not getting any of the &#163;375 to enable him to purchase additional stock or implements, although I believe the extra money was made available for that purpose.

Quite recently I- had an opportunity of visiting Charcoal Scrub, which is 30 miles out from Rockhampton. This settlement is well off the main road, and in order to reach it 2 or 3 miles of low-lying country, which is under water in a rainy season, has to be crossed .- The Charcoal Scrub country consists of splendid land, and the men will do well on it, but it is of little use to them until an embankment and light tramway are constructed. It is unreasonable to suggest that the soldier settlers should have to pay the whole of the cost of such a tramway, as that is surely a part of the development policy of the State Government. In the Charcoal Scrub country there is very dense scrub, and by the time a settler has sunk a well, put up a house, erected some fencing, and, possibly, paid &#163;3 per acre for clearing the scrub, there is very little left out of the advance of &#163;625. Because I knew that the position of these settlers was known I was of the opinion that the Commonwealth had agreed to increase the advance to &#163;1,000 in order that more capital might be available to the soldier settlers. It is a common complaint among them that the advance is quite insufficient. When General Birdwood was visiting the </para>

This information was received by the &#34; diggers &#34; with cheers, but it came as a thunderbolt to them when they discovered that they were not to have the use of the extra money advanced, but that it was to be retained and spent by the State Government. I think this matter should be given the fullest consideration and inquiry by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>.- I indorse every word that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has said in regard to the necessity for increasing the postal facilities of those people who live far back from ordinary centres of settlement. Quite recently I paid a visit to St. Mary&#39;s Plain, a very isolated portion of Tasmania, where a number of men with their families have for years been endeavouring to carve out for themselves homes in the bush. Their number  ha6  recently been augmented by half-a-dozen returned soldiers. The nearest post-office is about 12 miles away, and they are without a mail or telephone service. From time to time this Parliament, has endeavoured to impress upon the people the necessity for developing the resources that have hitherto lain neglected in our back areas, and it seems to me that we ought to urge the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> the necessity for devoting to the provision of special services for people in outback districts a portion of the profit made by his Department last year and a portion of the money which, we are informed, the Treasurer has just made available to the Department. We ought to get out of the groove in which we have been travelling for years past, and if  it should be a fact that departmental regulations may prevent the Postmaster-General from doing that which we desire, surely we are justified in claiming that the regulations should be altered in order that such mail -services may be provided for people as will afford them every inducement to remain on the land to develop the resources of the Commonwealth. I can quite realize that some of the outlying settlements do&#39; not justify the establishment of the ordinary mail services and post-offices, but surely some scheme could be introduced whereby they could get, if not a mail service twice a week, at least a weekly service, which would bring them into closer touch with the rest of the State in which they reside. Therefore, I trust the Minister will confer with the Postmaster-General to see if there is any possibility of doing this, not only for the soldier settlements mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> but also for scattered communities of settlers right throughout the Commonwealth. I feel sure that the people as a whole would approve of such a policy. The St. Mary&#39;s Plain district has wonderful possibilities, but we cannot expect to have it developed unless we offer some inducement to people to settle there. The soldiers who have settled there are working well, but they pointed out to- me on my recent visit that it was difficult for them to carry on without reasonable facilities for getting their correspondence to the nearest post-office. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the retention by the State Governments of the  &#163;375  out of the total of  &#163;1,000  advanced by the Commonwealth for the settlement of soldiers on the land, I do not think that honorable senators are fully aware of the conditions which govern and control the disbursement of this money, and I am hopeful that we shall have a statement this afternoon showing the exact position in this regard. Nothing can be urged against the retention of a portion of the advance by the State Government, if it is spent directly in the interests of the soldier settlers, and it appears to me that the desire of the Federal Government in supplementing the amount directly advanced to the settlers, for the purpose of enabling them to purchase stock and implements, is to provide a sum which the State Governments can devote towards the construction of works intended for the benefit of the soldiers on the land. </para>

                            <para>- It is, and I should imagine that a smaller amount would be suincierj.it. It must be remembered that those who have, been endeavouring to carve out homes in the back-blocks prior to the initiation of the soldier settlement scheme had to wait for many years before they could get anything like decent roads to their holdings. The States could not find the money to make the roads and provide these settlers with means of communication with the larger centres, and it strikes me that it is quite possible this arrangement  ha6  been entered into in order that the soldier settler might not be handicapped as was the ordinary settler in the past, and might be provided with good means of communication in the near future. </para>

                            <para>- A policy has been suggested from time to time - and it has a good deal to recommend it - that the States should withdraw their land from selection and build roads through it, the cost of which would ultimately be placed on the blocks when taken up. However, I should imagine that, at the bottom of the arrangement between the. Commonwealth and the States in respect to soldier settlement, is the idea that the soldier settlers may have speedy means of access to their holdings and to the neighbouring towns. I hope that the Minister will be able to make a statement regarding the expenditure of this money. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to say a few words upon the very important point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> The exact position has already been forecast by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> In regard to the land settlement of returned soldiers it was originally agreed that the Commonwealth would advance up to  &#163;625  per man in respect of stock, implements, buildings, &#38;c. Obviously the man would get the greater portion of that advance. Subsequently a conference was held at which the .States pointed out that if they were to make soldier settlement a success they must commit themselves to a larger expenditure. The Commonwealth agreed to find a total sum for the States of  &#163;1,000  per man. This amount was to cover all expenditure upon land resumption, public works, and the advances to the soldiers. The arrangement, however, does not mean that a soldier will get more than &#163;625. </para>

The benevolent attitude of members towards soldier settlement will certainly prejudice them in favour of any applications which may be made by such settlements for telephonic or telegraphic communication. It is the desire of the Government that this policy shall be extended, as far as possible, and any specific request by honorable senators to the Postmaster-General in that connexion will receive sympathetic consideration. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am rather surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> imagining things. The item in the Bill to which reference has been made relates, not to a High Commissioner in America, but to the Trade Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mark</inline> Sheldon, who has been appointed for quite a long time. The discrepancy between the amount provided for this particular item in the present Bill and that which appeared in the last Supply Bill is easily explained. The last Supply Bill covered only one month, whereas this Bill will cover two months. The Trade Commissioner&#39;s Office is in New York, which is a very expensive city in which to maintain an office. That circumstance alone accounts for the large amount under the heading of &#34; contingencies,&#34; as compared with the sum which is to be appropriated by way of salary. </para>

                        <para>. - The amount which we are asked to vote under this heading indicates that the Australian Trade Commissioner&#39;s. Office in New York is costing the Commonwealth about  &#163;10,000  per - annum. Whilst I do not dissent from the action of the Government in opening up trade communication with the great Republic across the Pacific, I entirely agree with their policy of appointing a High Commissioner in the United States of America in the near future, in order that we may derive some political advantage from the position. I do not think that we are getting too many advantages from the appointment of a Trade Commissioner. I believe that many political advantages would accrue, and a more friendly bond would be created, by a diplomatic appointment in the United States of America upon the lines proposed by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I quite recognise that a movement of this description may reasonably start with the appointment of a Trade Commissioner, just as it did in the case of Canada. I am in entire accord with the policy of the Government in regard to the appointment in the immediate future of a High Commissioner in the United States of America for the purpose of establishing a diplomatic bond between ourselves and the great Republic across the Pacific. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the Government will continue the policy of appointing Trade Commissioners in various parts of the world. As the result of Australian trade interests being represented in the United States of America, the Commonwealth will derive a substantial benefit. But the countries to which we should turn our attention in this connexion are those which are looking for our exports. There is no part of the world which offers so many opportunities for the development of our trade as does the near East. Although this Bill contains no provision for the position, I understand that at present we have a trade representative in Paris looking after our interests there, and I hope the Government will push on with the policy indorsed by the Senate when the resolution to which I have referred was carried, </para>

I think a half  promise was then given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that inquiries would be made, and an effort made to improve their, position. Without, perhaps, being entirely accurate , as to the circumstances, I believe that in such places as the Liverpool, Lidcombe, and Newington institutions, all in the vicinity of Sydney, the Commonwealth Government pay the pension allowance to the State Government for the maintenance of the old people. </para>

                            <para>- Seeing that the old-age pension allowance is now higher, I think the old folk in such places are entitled to a little more pocket money for such comforts as tobacco, newspapers, and even sweets. Any honorable senator who visits these well-conducted homes must feel very gratified indeed that Australia has provided such places for the old people who are there very well cared for, and their declining years are as peaceful as they can reasonably be in all the circumstances. These institutions are not looked upon as asylums or charitable homes. The old people, if they have been good citizens of the Commonwealth, have a right to go to them ; but the ambit of their happiness is governed largely by the amount of pocket money for what are now, to them, almost necessary commodities. Even an additional 16. per week would make all the difference in the world to them. Take tobacco, as an illustration. Nearly all of the old men require tobacco, and it is now more than twice the price it was when this- arrangement as to the amount of their pocket money was made, so that they can only buy half the quantity now. The Commonwealth recognises that they are worthy citizens by giving them the right of the franchise, and, in view of the restricted purchasing power of our currency, I urge upon the Minister the desirability of allotting a little extra pocket money to- these old people. I am glad the Minister has told us that this matter is in the hands of the Commonwealth, and not of the States, and I hope that my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> and I will now only have to ask to receive. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to urge upon the Minister the necessity for a reconsideration of the conditions under which the maternity bonus is allotted. It was all very well before the war, when we had an abundant revenue and a light indebtedness, for the Commonwealth Government to play the part of a fairy godmother by awarding to every mother who presented an infant to the world a present, irrespective of whether it was needed or not. That time has long since gone by. Now we have to look to every item of expenditure with the idea of cutting it down if possible. Yesterday, when the Minister &#39;invited critics of the Budget to lay their fingers upon any particular item in respect of which economy might be advocated, he entirely overlooked this particular vote. He also urged that the largely increased expenditure this year was inevitably forced upon the Commonwealth Government; but that, at all events, cannot be said of this particular item. We should give some evidence of our earnestness to observe the pledges we gave to the electors that we would endeavour to bring about economy in administration. It is idle for the Minister to defend the Government by remarking that, if another party got into power, they would &#34;roast&#34; the unfortunate electors to a still greater degree than the present Government are doing. That is no answer to criticism, for the people might very well say, &#34;A plague on both your houses,&#34; and determine to get a better set of people who would endeavour to- carry out the mandate to reduce expenditure. It is somewhat difficult for private members to point to any particular expenditure, but, in this Chamber and elsewhere, certain items have been mentioned as being capable of reduction. I have instanced the Canberra vote-, and, with some other honorable senators, urged a reduction there. Here, again, is a vote in connexion with which inquiries might be made with a view to reduction in the maternity allowance vote. </para>

                        <para>.- I have made up my mind never to let pass an opportunity to protest against a continuation of the maternity allowance as it is administered to-day. The time has arrived when the Government ought to review the operations of this Department with regard to the maternity allowance. We are face to face with a huge annual expenditure, with a heavy war debt, and a heavy debt in connexion with other matters, and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> tells us that he does not know how to make ends meet, yet we practically propose to throw away at least &#163;250,000 which ought to be utilized in some other direction that would be valuable to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It is absurd to suggest that there should be no discrimination as regards the recipients of the allowance. If a little stranger came to my house next year, why should I have the right to claim &#163;5 of the taxpayers&#39; money? The object of the introduction of the allowance originally was to provide necessary comforts and assistance to the mother and child where, owing to the financial circumstances of the home, these were not available. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. We know the allowance is superfluous in many cases. I believe that in 50 per cent. of the cases in Australia it is absolutely superfluous, because the money is not needed. The Budget-papers show that last year the allowance cost the Commonwealth &#163;625,865. The cost of administration was &#163;2 0s.10d. per cent., whereas in 1914 it was only &#163;1 10s. 6d. per cent. One is surely justified in drawing attention to the increase of departmental expenditure in a matter of this kind. There should be little or no increase. I could understand the bulk of the expenditure being incurred at the beginning of the scheme, but when the machinery got into working order we ought reasonably to anticipate a reduction of the annual expenditure on this sub-Department. </para>

                            <para>- I am quoting the percentage costs, so that the increase of population does not apply. One could understand, when the new Department was created, a large amount of expenditure being involved during the first year or so of its operations in order to get the machinery going properly, but that ought not to be a recurring item. The time has arrived when the Senate ought to press the Government to do all they can to revise the maternity allowance legislation in the direction of applying it only to cases where the help is really needed. If it is found necessary to increase the amount, I shall be prepared to support the increase so long as the grant is made only to necessitous cases. </para>

                        <para>. -  I wish to support, to a certain extent, the remarks of previous speakers on the maternity allowance, which is costing the Commonwealth such a vast amount. I should never be one to attempt to prevent the payment of the allowance to those who need it. I should be rather inclined in those cases to increase it, because the sum of &#163;5, made available for medical attention and so forth in a time of need, is of great assistance to poor people. But on every page of his Budget speech the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> points out how essential it is for the Commonwealth Parliament to economize at the present juncture, and I would support any movement whereby those people who are in receipt of&#34; an income of, say, &#163;400 per annum and over, should not receive the allowance. The money saved would be much better spent in the establishment of an institution such as they have in New Zealand, whereby mothers-to-be are educated by those splendid women, the trained nurses, in the proper way to attend to the babies. After all, a good, healthy Australian baby is the best possible immigrant that we can have in this country. </para>

                            <para>- It exists in New Zealand, where, through the nurses going about the country showing expectant mothers how to attend to their babies, and how to take care of their own health, and by the inauguration of a pure milk supply, which is a magnificent thing for any Government to take  in  hand, the mortality of infants has been decreased by over 4 per cent. This proves that the lives of thousands and thousands of children have been saved by these means. The Commonwealth Government should, therefore, take seriously into consideration, if not now, then in the immediate future, the question of either increasing the maternity allowance to the poor by deducting it from the comparatively rich, who do not require it, or of assisting to establish an institution of trained nurses to go throughout the country, or of doing something towards securing a pure milk supply, which is a thing we have not got in Australia. It may be available in some parts, but we have not made the provision in the Commonwealth that we should have made, especially in the large cities of Melbourne and Sydney, for that purpose. A pure milk supply is a matter of national importance. If the Government can save money by not paying the maternity allowance to those enjoying over a certain income, and if then they have any money to spend on other Departments, I would impress on them the fact that they are not spending enough on immigration. Only the paltry sum of &#163;100,000 is provided for that purpose in this year&#39;s Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- That would involve the abandonment of the important principle originally laid down that everybody who qualified should be entitled to the allowance, and that no poverty line should be drawn. Personally, I am not satisfied that we are spending this money to get the best results. I am convinced that it is the duty of the State to assist maternity, but the Commonwealth will never be able satisfactorily to deal with this and allied &#39;health questions until it has a Ministry of Health,_ and until it is endowed with proper powers to deal with health matters. The maternity question is only one phase of the bigger question of the health of the people. </para>

                            <para>- While assistance is given in this way, it would be invidious to say that only some were to receive it, as it would then become a pauper&#39;s dole. The community would be divided into two sections, one of which could point to the other as being subsidized by the State. My personal opinion is that this money is not being spent in the best way to assist maternity, but I do not think it would be wise to draw what might be called a poverty line. </para>

                        raised the question of the coinage vote. This is not a regular amount we pay out in salaries, but included in it is the purchase of material, and. the expenditure in this direction may be more in one month than in another.

                    <para>The increase in the cost of administering the maternity allowance is largely due to the increased salaries paid to public servants. The Budget figures disclose that &#163;750,000 is to be spent in increased salaries. I understand that the cost of administering the baby bonus is at the &#34;rate of 2s. per birth, about 8d. of which is paid to the Registrar of Births and Deaths. There is another factor which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> may not be aware of. I am informed that at the inception of this scheme there was a large number of cases of fraud and deception, as a result of which a check system had to be established, which necessitated the employment of a larger number of officers. </para>

                        <para>. - I know I am voicing the feelings of some who are absent when I say that at present we are paying away a good deal of money in maternity allowances when it is absolutely unnecessary. I believe that is the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> desired to make&#62; but the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> seemed to evade it. The Minister said that he could justify the payment of  &#163;5  for every infant bom, irrespective of the circumstances, because if it were otherwise it would be regarded as a pauper&#39;s dole.  I  do not agree with that point of view at all.  I  -do not think that position is consistent with the manner in which the recipients of the old-age pension regard it. That pension is given as a right, not as charity, to those unfortunately placed citizens in our midst who, under certain circumstances, are entitled to it. My strong opinion, and I believe it is the opinion of many honorable senators, is that no payment should be made in respect of a child whose father was receiving, say,  &#163;300, &#163;400,  or  &#163;500  per annum, or whatever amount Parliament might decide. The same principle applies in taxation matters; but  I  think it is desirable to stress the fact that in certain circumstances the payment of  &#163;5  is too little. In connexion with the revision of. the many activities of the Government,  I  hope they will bear in mind that it is,  I  believe, the overwhelming opinion, of the people that, although we may pay away  &#163;650,000  in maternity allowances, that a re-adjustment of that position could take place in the way of lopping off the bonus from those who do not need it, and adding it to those to whom it would be a blessing when a child is born. Although my remarks may not be regarded as of great importance, I trust they will be the means of helping to create an atmosphere of public opinion which may be reflected in the direction we desire in the future financial policy of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. -  ;I desire to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that, in connexion with the expenditure of  &#163;16,400  in the Northern Territory, no reference is made to boring for water. It is not my desire to take up the time of the Senate, but knowing a good deal about the Northern Territory, I wish to say that the only way in which that country can be developed is by providing adequate supplies of water. Sub-artesian supplies are obtainable almost anywhere from  250  to  400  feet in depth, and it is the duty of the Government to put down as many bores as possible.  If  this were done, it would be the means of assisting in bringing stock to market from the back country. At present beef would not be costing its present price if cattle could be brought from the north-western portion of the Northern Territory, where there are long stretches on the stock routes without water.  If  the Government spent a reasonable amount in tapping sub-artesian supplies it would be the means of increasing the supply of cattle in our metropolitan and country markets. </para>

                            <para>- It seems, from the wording of section 24 of the Constitution, that the initiative must be taken by the Government, but no doubt a census is the means by which Ministers will inform their minds as to whether the conditions of the Constitution are for the moment being substantially  adhered to. From what I have seen of the electoral figures I should say that a redistribution of seats will almost certainly follow the next census, because there has been a great change in the population figures since the last redistribution took place. </para>

                        <para>. - Apparently it has been decided by the Department of the Navy to cut out Rockhampton as a sub-district naval training centre, and, as Naval Defence will play an important part in the defence of Australia,  I  hope that this apparent small economy will not be effected, and that the step contemplated will be reconsidered.  I  have already approached the Department on the matter, and the people of Rockhampton have brought it under the attention of the Naval Commandant at  Brisbane,  who,  I  understand, says that economy has necessitated cutting out Rockhampton as a sub-district training centre.  I  take second place to no one in my desire to see economy effected by the Government, but, in view of the vulnerability of the Queensland coast line to attack, I think this would be false economy. I urge the Department not to seek to save the small amount of money that would be spent by maintaining Rockhampton, which is in the centre of that coast line, as a sub-district training centre, and I hope the Minister for Defence will bring this matter under the attention, of  the  Minister for  the  Navy. </para>

                        <para>.- The Marine Board of Launceston - which is spending a considerable amount of money for the purpose of improving the entrance to the Tamar River, a work not  only  of  local,  but  also  of national importance, because I understand that if a rock at the entrance is removed the Navy &#34;Department will establish a subbase in the river - has informed me that it has had occasion to import a considerable quantity of machinery, which cannot be obtained in Australia, for the purpose of removing this rock, and has been obliged to pay &#163;500 by way of duty upon it. It is also bringing out a dredger of a particular type on which it will also be called upon to pay duty. While I am most anxious that both private and public enterprises should be carried out by the utilization of material made in Australia, at the same time I hold that if it is impossible to provide the necessary material locally it is in the interests of the public generally that some concession should be made to State Government or semi-Government activities which are obliged to import it. I was under the impression that there was some preferential tariff in this respect for Government Departments or semi-Government institutions, and if such be the case I direct the attention of the Minister to the claim, of this semi-Government activity, the Launceston Marine Board, to be relieved&#39; of the payment of &#39;duty upon the material it requires for removing the main obstruction to the entrance of a beautiful river. I do not know what amount is involved, but it is a matter of principle which I am urging, namely that any Government undertaking should receive assistance in carrying out a national undertaking, always providing, of course, that such assistance is commensurate with a due observance of the necessity for affording adequate protection to Australian industries. </para>

                        <para>.- I indorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has said. The Launceston Marine Board has been faced with very great problems with regard to the development of that very fine waterway named the River Tamar, which the Board is endeavouring to make so .navigable that it will be able to accommodate not only the Australian Nary, but also the British Navy should it ever come out here. The people of Launceston have undertaken a huge financial responsibility. In their endeavour to create, at Bell Bay, a port second to none in Australia, it has become necessary for them to incur . very heavy expenditure in the purchase of material, the duty on which is a big item.  On  some heavy cable chains recently purchased, a very big sum was paid by way of duty, and now that they are bringing out a bucket dredge, which is essential to the carrying out of the work, they have asked honorable senators representing Tasmania to approach the Government with a view to securing some concession in respect to the duty payable on this material. I hope that the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs will convey our representations to his colleague, and confer with him to see whether some relief cannot be afforded which will assist the Launceston Marine Board in carrying out this work which is of national importance. </para>

                    <para>Iwish now to say a few words in regard to the item &#34; Lighthouses.&#34; It has been brought under my notice that at King Island, in the Straits - an island which is of very great importance from a productive point of view - there is a jetty on the east coast which was constructed by the State Government at a very heavy cost some years ago, and which is badly in need of some lighting in order to insure the safety of vessels trading there. This jetty is constructed in the open roadstead near Fraser Bluff, and, prior to its erection, the only port available was Currie Harbor, which is subject to very heavy north-westerly gales. It therefore became necessary to evolve a scheme for  the  construction of a port which would afford the necessary shelter during the prevailing westerly winds. The result was that eventually the State Government constructed the Fraser Harbor jetty at a very heavy cost. There is no light there, and frequently ships arriving after dusk  are  obliged to stand off  till  next morning before they  can  approach  the  jetty. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the Bill is to be brought down this  week,  but, in my opinion, its introduction is somewhat belated. This matter was first mentioned in the Senate nearly six months ago. I hope that the measure referred to by the Minister for Defence will remove the very unfair anomalies which exist in regard to the administration of foreign exchanges in the Customs House, and that it will no longer continue to favour countries such as the United States of America, Canada, and Japan, whose exchanges are against us, whilst penalizing countries like France, Italy, and Belgium, whose exchanges are in our favour. I feel that we should give the French people just now the very best possible treatment that we can, consistent with the protection of Australian interests. A state of affairs has existed in connexion with these exchanges which has played right into the hands of Americans and Japanese, and which has subjected our late ally, France, to a very grave handicap. I hope that the Bill which has been promised will rectify these anomalies and place the administration of foreign exchanges by the Customs Department upon a basis at which no business man can cavil. </para>

                        <para>. - The payment of these moneys in Adelaide is due to the fact that there has always been an arrangement under which the Northern Territory accounts are kept separate from those for the rest of the Commonwealth. Adelaide is one of the termini of the overland telegraph line over which is transmitted a large volume of cable business. I do not know why the practice of paying certain officials in Adelaide has been continued as it has been. Ever since South Australia undertook the administration of the Northern Territory certain officials have been paid in Adelaide, and the amounts thus disbursed have been charged against the Territory. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to direct the attention of the Minister for Defence to the lack of mail facilities in the Northern Territory. Only the other day I received a request from the residents of Borroloola that I should do what I could to secure them a fortnightly mail service. At present they receive a mail from Cloncurry only once a month. As the sum of &#163;100,000 has been set aside for the encouragement of commercial aviation, I suggest that a part of it should be earmarked to encourage a company which is being formed by some returned aviators, who, like the provisional directors of the company, are men of very high standing, and which is called &#34; The Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service Limited.&#34; The objects of the company are to establish an aerial passenger mail and general aerial transport service, linking up the railway termini in Queensland with&#39; the Northern Territory at Port .Darwin. At the present time, mails have to travel all the way round  Yorke&#39;s Peninsula in order to reach Darwin, and their transit is consequently slow and expensive. This, it will be conceded, is a great drawback. The proposed aerial service will run from Longreach, in Queensland, to Winton, thence to Cloncurry, Camooweal, Anthony&#39;s Lagoon, Newcastle Waters, Daly Waters, and the Katherine, where it will link up with the railway from the Katherine to Darwin. This is not a hot-air scheme. Anybody who has taken an interest in the aerial transport of mails must know what is being done in this regard in Great Britain, America, and Europe. It is hoped that the company to which I have referred will be able to obtain contracts from the Government for the carriage of mails through this particular country, thus conferring many advantages upon outback settlers. The prospectus of the company states : - </para>

                        <para>The special climatic and general suitability of conditions in the area, to bc served by this company, and the great distances between the commercial centres of the Commonwealth and the undeveloped pastoral and mineral areas that will be served by this company, convince the directors that the services will be of great value to the Commonwealth, from an administrative, development, and defence point of view. This route - Longreach to Katherine - is a most essential route to be organized in connexion with the aerial defence of Australia, and it is expected that the Federal Government will assist in the organization of this, and will also avail itself of the company&#39;s services for the carriage of mails and for the administration at Port Darwin and for aerial survey work, &#38;c. </para>
                        <para>I ask the Minister to consider the  advisableness  of earmarking a certain portion of the &#163;100,000 which is to be devoted to the encouragement of commercial aviation, for the carriage of mails along the route which has been mapped out by this company. The promoters of the company are returned soldiers and very experienced aviators. I hope, therefore, that the company will be granted a contract for the carriage of mails along the route which I have outlined.&#39; </para>

                    <para class="block">Guthrie, will receive very favorable consideration. But, obviously, each proposal must be examined upon its merits, and must be able to withstand the closest investigation. We ought not to fritter money away upon ill digested schemes, no matter how enthusiastic their promoters may be. Very often we know that the judgment of these people is not sound. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that, it is. We propose shortly to appoint a Director of Civil Aviation. We hope he will be in sympathy with the development of civil aviation. The Defence Department is at present in collaboration with the Postal Department in endeavouring to select certain routes for trial postal services. It is wise, in the interests of economy, that we should not launch an ambitious scheme at first, and without giving careful consideration to the actual working conditions of a certain period. Only in this way can we expect to be able to form an opinion as to how best the services may be further developed. It does not follow that a scheme which has been successful in other parts of the world, under possibly different aerial conditions, will be as successful here. We intend to carefully develop aviation, and to endeavour if possible to place civil aviation on a sound commercial basis. </para>

I should not like to see established two distinct branches of aviation, not related to each other, the one for military purposes only, and the other for commercial purposes, developed, possibly, by private enterprise largely, and perhaps to some extent frowned upon by the military authorities. </para>

                    <para>I rose particularly to refer to the question of our overseas mail service, in connexion with which our expenditure is, approximately, &#163;150,000 per year. This sum, I take it, is being paid on the poundage basis for the despatch of Australian mail matter abroad. It is common knowledge that, before the war, the Orient Steam Navigation Company had a contract with the Commonwealth Government for the carriage of our mails to the United Kingdom, while the British Government had a contract with the Peninsular and Oriental Company for the conveyance of British mails to Australia. The two contracts gave us practically a weekly mail service between the Commonwealth and the Mother Country. We know that the dislocation of shipping was very great during the war; and I noticed in the press the other day a statement by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> to the effect that he was taking advantage of the best service offering for the despatch of mail matter to the United Kingdom, on the poundage basis, irrespective of any particular steam-ship line. I do not know what is in. the mind of the Government with regard to the renewal of the subsidy for a regular mail service ; but I do know that during the past twelve months the various Chambers of Commerce throughout the Commonwealth have been vigorously protesting against the unsatisfactory position of our oversea mail service. It is within my own knowledge that mails from England are delivered very spasmodically, though I believe the Postm aster-General disclaims any responsibility. I understand, too, that Australian mails are delivered in England in the same unsatisfactory manner. In view of a recent announcement by the Peninsular and Oriental and </para>
                    <para class="block">Orient Companies that they hope, early in the new year, to institute a biweekly mail service again, I hope the Post Office authorities will do something to place our post-war mail service on its very satisfactory pre-war basis. I believe the subsidy is not now being paid. </para>

                            <para>- I remember an agreement made between the Orient Company and the Commonwealth Government in one of the pre-war years - I am not quite sure it was not made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> when he was Postmaster-General - for the payment of a sum approaching &#163;200,000 as a subsidy for a regular fortnightly service. The payment of that subsidy was suspended during the war, and I believe it has not been renewed. I should like some information on the point, because even now the transit of mails to and from Australia and England is very unsatisfactory. I remind honorable senators, too, that the bulk of our export trade is with England, and that an unsatisfactory mail service means a great deal, directly and indirectly, to our commercial community. Documents, exchanges, drafts, credits, and indeed the whole export structure of our commercial edifice in Australia would be greatly improved by a regular mail service to the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>. -  During the war there was no option but to suspend the mail contract with the Orient Company, because nearly all the vessels of that company&#39;s fleet were requisitioned by the Imperial Government. The contract was for &#163;170,000 a year, and upon the suspension of the contract we were obliged to send our mails at poundage rates by any vessel that happened to be available. When the war ended the British Shipping Controller released a number of the Orient ships, and we have taken over the contrast again, although, legally, we could have broken it altogether. The company lost a number of vessels by enemy action; but they are now building up their fleet again, as is evidenced from the fact that the subsidy to be paid this year is larger than last year. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that is so. The full contract is for &#163;175,000 per year. Last year we paid &#163;111,000, and this year we are paying about &#163;130,000. As they improve the service, so will the subsidy increase in proportion. With regard to the radio service, the Government have decided to transfer it from the Navy to the Postal Department, and I believe negotiations are now being made to that end by the respective Ministers. </para>

                        <para>.- Under the item, War Pensions Office, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to the fact that in the recent increase of pensions to dependants of soldiers proper provision was not made for the dependants of officers of the Australian Imperial Force who were killed in action or died on active service. When the Australian Imperial Force was established a scheme of pensions was inaugurated, in which the provision was totally inadequate, with the result that first a simple system of living .allowances, and later an increased pension scheme, was provided for the lower ranks. The result is that up to the rank of captain every one receives a flat rate. Beyond that there is a slight increase for majors and colonels. It is very good to have a democratic ideal, and to live up to it, by treating everybody alike. It makes quite a popular appeal, and goes down well with the mob ; but a Government charged with the responsibility of administering the affairs of the Commonwealth, and especially that enormously important branch of them, the Military Forces, must look a little further than that if they are to obtain good service. It has recently been found that the conditions of service in the commissioned ranks are so bad that no one is coming forward to take the positions offered at Duntroon. A similar difficulty is likely to meet the Government in officering even the Citizen Forces. The officers of any Force are open to criticism, and that has been very freely exercised by certain sections of the community. An officer, to fit himself, even in the Citizen Forces- </para>

                            <para>- The conditions which, to-day. apply to the Australian Imperial Force are likely to apply to any Force that is hereafter raised to defend Australia. Intending officers, looking at the treatment afforded to officers of the Australian Imperial Force, may well draw the inference that their treatment will be on like lines, and so be deterred from accepting the responsibilities and the extra dangers attached to the rank of officer. The officers of the Citizen Forces have to sacrifice the whole of their leisure time, as I know from personal experience. For many years after the Boer War I never had a vacation that I could spend with my family. All my spare time was taken up with attending instructional schools or camps of training. The reward, so far as I can see, is that officers are treated exactly the same as those in the lower ranks, and no encouragement appears to be offered, in the latest scale of pensions, to men to fit themselves for higher commands. I would particularly direct the attention of the Minister to the facts about the medical service. The great majority of its members were men of the rank of captain, young men, many of them just married, and with young families. A <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> umber of them possessed the very highest attainments in their profession. They came forward with the utmost freedom; in fact we were able actually to spare men who were graduates of the Australian Universities to help the British. Hundreds of them who came forward in response to the call left the Australian Forces and joined the British, to whom they rendered invaluable services. Many of these men were killed or died on service, but the only reward that their dependants have received is exactly the same treatment as is given to the dependants of privates. These men fitted themselves by a long and expensive course of study to undertake the duties which they were called on to discharge, and for which they freely volunteered. The Government might well take into consideration the need for encouraging such men to come forward freely in that way by making a little better provision for their children and other dependants in the event of their being killed in the service of their country. </para>

                        is incorrect in assuming that war pensions, when first established, recognised any difference between the officer and other ranks. The first War Pensions Bill introduced provided for a flat rate. It took no cognisance of the difference between officers and those of other ranks. If
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline>
                        will look a little further back than he has gone, I think he will find a justification for the attitude which the Commonwealth has taken up. The Australian Imperial Force was essentially a citizen army. When its members ceased to be citizens, and became soldiers, the Commonwealth recognised the difference in the responsibility of officers and other ranks by giving higher salaries according
                        <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                        the grade of that responsibility. But when they ceased to be soldiers, and again became citizens, and were to receive war pen.sious according to the disability they suffered in the war, the Commonwealth treated them as it treats all its citizens,  equally in the sight of the law, and. therefore equally in their claims for war pensions. That policy, I think, can be justified, because our officers were not drawn from any particular class of the community. They came from all classes. The intention of the pension is to compensate for disabilities, and to place the soldier relatively, as far as this can be done, in as good a position as he occupied before he was disabled. If, therefore, we depart from that flat rate, we must not base the pension on the salary which the man received as a soldier, but on the salary that he received before he became a soldier. Look where that would lead us, and the many inequalities that we would come up against. Obviously, that is the only basis, if we are going to treat these men as citizens in regard to their war pensions. It is the only justification we could have for departing from the flat rate.

                            <para>- Because, as citizens, they do not hold that rank, and as citizens they do not draw the salary of that rank. In some cases they draw more, and in some less. The Australian ImperialForce was an army recruited from the citizens, and the idea of the war pension is that it should be a compensation for and alleviation of disabilities suffered from the war, having regard, not to the man as a soldier, or the salary he earned as a soldier, but to the man as a citizen. Therefore, if we were strictly logical we would fix the pension in relation to the salary he received as a citizen; but as that would raise a tremendous crop of difficulties, we adopted a flat rate for all, which seems to me the better course. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is somewhat of a technical measure, and. as a layman, I speak on it with some trepidation. The main principles involved in it, however, are such as the ordinary layman can approach with as much confidence as can members of the legal profession. In the Judiciary Act which we passed in 1912 it is provided that a Full Court consisting of less than all the Justices shall not give a decision upon any question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth unless a majority of the Justices concur in the decision. There are at present seven Justices of the High Court, and no decision can be given upon any constitutional question unless at least four Justices concur in it. Until quite recently two Justices were utilized practically for the whole of their time upon Arbitration work, and although the Arbitration (Public Service) Bill recently passed may relieve one, it is almost certain that at least one Judge will continue to be occupied with arbitration work for the whole of his time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers is absent on leave overseas. Owing to the pressure of work during the war the Justices have not been able to take their leave, and are now seizing the opportunity. Upon the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs will take his leave. It will be seen that for all practical purposes there will be five Justices readily available for hearing constitutional questions before the High Court. It would be difficult to have a Court constituted of a greater number than that, and it is therefore proposed to amend the existing law by striking out the words, &#34; unless a majority of the Justices concur in the decision,&#34; and inserting in lieu thereof the words &#34; unless at least three Justices concur in the decision.&#34; In most cases it will be three out of five. The point may be raised as to what would happen in the event of six Judges deciding to sit, because if we carry this Bill three are to constitute a majority. In the event of an equal number of Judges there might be three on either side. Section 3 of the Judiciary Act 1912, which amends section 23 of the principal Act, provides in sub-section 2: - </para>

                    <para class="block">This is in exercise of the power conferred under section 76, sub-section 2, of the Constitution, which reads, &#34; Arising under any laws made by the Commonwealth.&#34; Under the Act of 1915 the Commonwealth partly exercised its power by giving to the High Court original  jurisdiction in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. The distinctive feature of that Act was the granting of criminal jurisdiction to the High Court to enable it to deal with indictable offences. </para>
                    <para>The measure was introduced at a time when war legislation generally was under discussion, and there was a disposition on the part of Parliament to embody in all its laws a restriction as to the period of their operation. At the time we were conferring on the High Court Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and although that was necessary in time of peace, it became increasingly necessary in time of war. As regards indictable offences, it must be remembered that the Commonwealth Parliament had the supreme responsibility of the war thrown upon it, and it was felt that it should be supreme in regard to indictable offences through our own Court. These matters were made urgent in consequence of the war, and even if there had not been a war this power should have been conferred upon it. The Government of the day accepted an amendment providing that the Act should remain in operation during the war, and for six months thereafter, and no longer. It is now proposed to repeal that limitation, which will have the effect of continuing the High Court jurisdiction as provided in the  1915  Act. I think it is sufficient to say that, as nothing very dreadful has happened, there should be no objection to the power being continued. </para>
                    <para>Clause 4 will enable the High Court to direct that an award of arbitration in any matter of Federal jurisdiction shall be a rule of Court. Such awards may then be enforced in the same way as judgments. For instance, awards of arbitration in regard to disputes arising where land has been acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act, or the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Lands Act, will now be enforceable in the same way as judgments of the Court. At present, in the absence of this provision, an appeal to a State Court is required to accomplish that, but if this &#39;amendment is carried it will be a matter for an order of the High Court. </para>
                    <para>Clause  5  will authorize State Courts exercising Commonwealth jurisdiction in. criminal matters to amend informations so as to remove defects therein. Cases have arisen in certain State Courts where it has been held that they did not have the power. There is no difficulty in this regard in most of the States; but in South Australia instances have occurred where it has been held that they did not have the power. It is advisable that they should have authority, because justice may otherwise be defeated if they cannot amend an information when defects are disclosed. The law in the other States is different, and it is thought that in Commonwealth cases there should be power to amend an information in the State of South Australia. </para>
                    <para>The measure is one that will prove useful, and I trust its provisions will be acceptable to the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know what latitude I am allowed in dealing with the amendments  made in another place; but I think it desirable to consider them collectively. They have been adopted as a result of a conference between the seamen and the representative of the Government, and subsequently by a conference with the ship-owners. All parties are now agreed on the points at issue, and it is believed that the amendments will make our navigation laws the best of any nation in the world. Some of them are rather technical, and come under specific headings; and I believe if I were permitted, in a general way, to draw attention to their meaning, much Mme would* be saved. Is it possible to explain all the amendments in a general statement ? </para>

                        <para>- The first amendment is in relation to the definition of a &#34; limited coast trade ship.&#34; In the original Act there was no mileage limit, but in 1910 a limitation of 400 miles was imposed; but as the word &#34;nautical&#34; was omitted we were compelled to define &#34; miles &#34; as being ordinary miles. If the word &#34; nautical &#34; had been employed a much greater distance would have been covered. For instance, Sydney and Melbourne would have been brought within the radius of 400 nautical miles. It is proposed to emit the words &#34; not exceeding a radius of 400 miles,&#34; and insert in their stead &#34; not exceeding the limits for home trade or coast trade ships, as the case may be, fixed for the port at the commencement of this section by any State law.&#34; ; </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Another amendment deals with certified tes of competency. When the Act was passed there were few oil boats or power boats in use. It lias been decided to issue first class and second class certificates of competency to engineers on motor boats. </para>
                <para>The next amendment relates to employment of aliens, and is a copy of the new provision in the British Act. Australia is following the example of Great Britain in preventing the employment of aliens, thus preserving the British mercantile marino to British seamen. </para>
                <para>Then follows an amendment as to  nn-.inng  agreements. In the past seamen have suffered hardship through being discharged away from their home ports. A new clause has been inserted by the House of Representatives, having been mutually agreed upon by the steam-ship owners and the seamen, providing that when a crew has been engaged under a running agreement which has been in force more than six months, they must be discharged at their home port or transhipped to their home port upon discharge at the co6t of the ship-owner. </para>
                <para>Then there is an amendment relating; to allotment notes, and providing that a seaman proceeding on a voyage which may last for six months may allot two-thirds of his pay to his wife, children or other dependants. In the old days the seaman was not allowed to allot more than half his wages; but with the increased pay of seamen I. think that a sailor should be entitled to allot a greater proportion of his wages to his dependants at home. In any . case it would still leave him with, more money than he had under the old arrangement by which he allotted half his wages. </para>

                <para>In the next amendment, in a case of shipwreck the responsibility is cast upon the owner to take care of a seaman until his return to Australia. </para>
                <para>A further amendment will compel ship-owners to provide refrigerating, chambers capable of preserving in good condition fresh meat for the consumption of their # crews. This is an example of how far prejudice may take one. After careful inquiry it has been ascertained that the cost of observing this provision will be less than the cost of .the old system which it will supplant. While&#39; it will be a great improvement from the point of view of the crew, it will also serve to eliminate a great deal of the waste which occurred under the old system. </para>
                <para>Provision is made for protecting the deck wheel, and the next amendment relates to accommodation for seamen and apprentices. The latter has been mutually agreed upon by all parties. Of course, there are some exemptions in this respect. It is not proposed to compel a ship-owner to break up a boat which may have cost many thousands of pounds because the necessary accommodation cannot be fitted into it, but the existing construction will be utilized to the best advantage in order to afford improved conditions for the crew. However, no new boat will be licensed until it complies with all these conditions. </para>
                <para>Other amendments relate to bunks, the appointment of surveyors, the provision of watertight compartments, fireproof bulkheads, &#38;c, on passenger ships and unlicensed ships. There are certain unlicensed tramp vessels which wander round the world getting cargoes where they can. When it is possible for us to secure licensed vessels for our coastal work, of course, they must, be utilized ; but when all our own vessels are fully engaged, and it may be found necessary to secure the services of additional ships, we ought to have permission to engage the services of unlicensed vessels. In fact, the north-west coast will probably be dependent on unlicensed vessels. </para>

The whole purpose of this Bill is to preserve the policy of a White Australia, but we are not so foolish as to say that if ships manned by white crews are not available, we must deprive a portion of the coast of Australia of all means of Communication. That would be cutting off one&#39;s nose to spite his face. We tried the method once, and a part of our coast Vas neglected for many months. </para>

                <para>An amendment to clause US limits the time for taking proceedings, and the last amendment relates to barges, sud) as are used on the River Murray, which Ave hope to see developed in the near future. A strict interpretation of the law is that each barge must carry a skipper and a mate, but In the history of the River Murray trade we have not had an instance of a barge requiring the attendance of more than a skipper and, possibly, a helmsman, who, as a matter of fact, is a member of the crew of the tug which is towing the barge. It is not the desire of the Government to compel these craft to carry full crews, and the Minister, by this amendment, is given power to exempt them. </para>

                    <para>. -  I would like to give full consideration to these amendments, particularly the exemption of the North-West trade from the provisions of the Act, thus permitting the employment of black labour on our coast. As honorable senators are aware, I have been absent from Australia for the last few months, and, of course, I arn not altogether familiar with what has taken place here during my absence. I ask the Minister to report progress so that I might peruse these amendments to-night and study their effect. It may be true that the ship-owners have agreed to these amendments, and it may be possible that the Western Australian Government have agreed to the exemption of black-labour boats, but I know from my own experience that they are building their own vessels to trade upon their coast. </para>

                    (Victoria- Vice-President of the Executive Council) &#91;G.1SJ. - There is no desire to force these amendments on the Senate without giving ample opportunity for discussing them, and although I am surprised that a request for adjournment should come from one honorable senator who we all know is the  be3t  informed in the Chamber upon matters affecting seamen, I realize that it is because be has just returned to Australia. However, seeing that he has been most active in participating in the passing of legislation affecting navigation, it would possibly be unfair not to grant his request, and I am quite prepared to allow the discussion of these amendments to stand over until to-morrow.

                            <para>- Precisely. It could only make recommendations in accordance with the evidence which was tendered to it. But its deliberations might conceivably result in an amendment of our Public Service Act. It must be admitted that the views which some of us hold to-day are somewhat different from those which we expressed when the first Public Service Bill was under consideration in this Chamber. It is also possible that a discussion of this motion may make more understandable than they are at present certain actions which you, sir, have recently taken. To-day I have the honour  to  be a member of the Parliamentary Library Committee. I was also a member of the first Library Committee, which was appointed soon after the meeting of the first Commonwealth Parliament nearly twenty years ago. I am, therefore, thoroughly acquainted with the practice which has obtained in connexion with that body since  its  very inception, and I exceedingly regret the attempts which have recently been made by you, sir, to depart from well-established precedent - precedent which  was  laid down when the first Parliamentary Library Committee which was presided over by the  Speaker  of the first Commonwealth Parliament, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, was appointed. I gather from a letter, which was recently forwarded by you to the present Library Committee, that you protest against certain practices on the part of that body - practices which were followed by the first Library Committee to which I have referred. Whilst attending  a  meeting of the Committee the other clay I was indeed surprised to learn of the attitude which you have taken up. I made inquiries into the matter, and found that the Committee had been exercising control over certain parliamentary officers, so far as their promotions and salaries were concerned. According to a report, which I have received, you, sir, have protested against their action, and have affirmed that under the Public Service Act you and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> have the right to deal with these questions. Upon hearing this, the members of the Committee naturally began to ask themselves, &#34; What is the use of this Committee if it cannot exercise control over these matters?&#34; I say quite frankly that, if the important questions to which I have referred are taken out of the hands of the Committee, I shall not remain  a  member of it for five minutes. If you, sir, are going to dictate to the Committees which this Parliament has rightly appointed, you must accept full responsibility for your action.  That  is the position which I intend to take up. But I do not wish to press the matter  to  that extreme. When the first Public Service Bill was under consideration, Parliament wisely declined  to  surrender control of its own officers  to  the Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                    <para class="block">But for the purposes of administration, the  President  of this Chamber and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives were appointed to take the place of the Commissioner, so far as parliamentary officers are concerned. I was a member of the House Committee which was appointed by the second Commonwealth Parliament, and can therefore speak with some degree of authority as to what transpired at its meetings. I have no hesita&#39;tion in saying that, in those days, each item of business, whether it related to the salary or promotion of any official or not, was brought before the Committee, and decided by a majority of its members, and the  President  of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker, duly gave effect to those decisions. That practice has continued till quite recently. Our Public Service Act has not been altered in any way which can be construed into a justification for you, sir, taking up the attitude which you have adopted. In my opinion, you are putting a new interpretation upon your own powers, and are seeking to take out of the hands of the Committees to which I have referred the right to control the officers of this Parliament. Seeing that Parliament was so jealous of its right to control its own officers that it declined to transfer that control to an outside Commissioner, it follows that it should also refuse to surrender that control to an individual member of this Senate, in the person of the  President. </para>

For instance,  the  Public Service Commissioner is required? to present an annual report to Parliament concerning the entire working  o&#163;  the whole of the Public Service. <inline font-style="italic">~W&#38;</inline> have had no such report from the  President  or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> nor have we  had!  any statement from them as to the classification of our officers. Whenever a vacancy occurs in the Parliament,  we  have no announcement of the fact through the press, and, so far as I aim aware, no applications are invited from officers in the Public Service outside  th&#169;  Parliament, as is usual in  other  branches of the Public Service. Ltd short, with the exception of  one  particular section, the Public Service Act has not been applied to Parliament. Outside of the Parliament an officer of  on&#169;  Department has an opportunity of applying for a vacancy in another Department, but we have had nothing of that kind here, although, strange to say, while  we  have only a small number of officers  in  the Parliament, we have as many Departments as there are in the whole Public Service. For instance, the Senate  is a  Department, the House of Representatives is a Department, the Library  is a  Department, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is a Department, and so on. And each Department is a water-tight compartment. This is  on&#169;  phase of the question which it would  b&#169;  necessary for this Select Committee  to inquire  into. This state of affairs is  very  unfair to our officers, many of whom  have  been here for the last twenty years. In this Chamber I recognise gentlemen  who  came here twenty years ago, and who  today  are occupying practically the same position, with very little advance  im  salary. </para>

                            <para>- I hope so, toss, I also hope that twenty years hence  we  shall not be occupying the same humble positions that we are in to-day, but  that  we shall have made some progress in  the  meantime. This cannot be .&#171;aid. of elD of our officers. During the last twenty years some have made material advancement; but others, on the contrary, have made none at all. There are officers in this Chamber - I am not going outside the Senate for my illustrations - gentlemen who occupied very humble and modest positions in comparison with what they occupy to-day ; men who were on a very low salary scale, who, in fact, were in junior positions, but who, to-day are very high up in their classification. On the  other hand, we have gentlemen occupying very prominent positions in connexion with <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and who, in my opinion, after close observation, are the hardest working section of our parliamentary officers, and yet these officers are in the same position to-day as they were twenty years ago. 7. attribute this to the system of watertight compartments in the Parliament of which I am complaining. The system docs not work fairly between one officer and another. &#34;We have officers who, twenty years ago, were getting, say, &#163;300 a year, and to-day arc in receipt of &#163;1,000 a year. They certainly have not got much to complain of, for they have received recognition. </para>

These are the matters which the Select Committee should inquire into, and I hope remedy, or at all events make some recommendation to the Senate as to the better working of the Public Service Act in relation to our officers. </para>

                    <para>I have mentioned the higher-paid officers; I turn now to the lower-paid men, and I find that their position is even worse. Considering the times we are living in, the high cost of living, and the fact that greatly increased wages are now paid by outside employers, our lower-paid officers have been working under sweated conditions. Instead of Parliament being a model employer, I think it might very well be termed a sweating employer. These are the matters which I think justify me in saying that the time is ripe for an inquiry into the working of the Public Service Act, so far as this Parliament is concerned, to see whether .we can remedy this state of affairs and do justice between one officer and another. </para>
                    <para>I do not wish to cover the whole of the ground in my remarks to-night, as I understand other honorable senators intend also to speak. I may, perhaps, instance the case of a prominent member of the <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> Staff - I am not going to refer to any of the gentlemen who are still on that staff, for I have very good reason for not wanting to drag them in if I can possibly leave them out - a gentleman who was on the staff for many years: Professor Scott, of the Melbourne University. Had that gentleman still occupied his position on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff, he could not have applied for a vacancy at the head of the Senate table. This is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue. When a &#39;man gives good service to his country, and is fitted for other tasks than that in which he is engaged, he should have an opportunity of making application for any vacancies in the other branches of the Public Service. Some of the men in the humbler positions in the Parliament are to-day on practically the same wage as they wore twenty years ago. This is alto.gether unreasonable in these days of high cost of living. There are men working on our staff, doing responsible work, for less than &#163;4 per week. I attribute this state of affairs to the present want of system. </para>
                    <para>I do not wish to weary the Senate, but I would remind honorable senators that, while wc have been passing laws for the betterment of working conditions outside, we have, I am afraid, overlooked those who are attending on us day after day, and, perhaps, we have not recognised their merits because they have been so close to us. It is time the Senate took some action to improve their position. Men who have been in the service of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Parliament for very many years are still temporary officers. This, again, shows that the classification scheme of the Public Service Act has not been applied, because no employee in the Public Service can remain a temporary employee for a greater period than nine months. Yet, we have men still regarded as temporary employees who have been working in the Parliament for nine years. These men, so far as they know, have never been gazetted. They are still in temporary positions. That, I take it, is quite wrong. </para>

I do not deplore the fact that the power has been taken away from those Committees. It is a very good thing that something has stirred Parliament to take action and take notice of what is going on. We have the right from time to time to review the working of our laws, and if we discover flaws which necessitate amendments, we should say so, as reasonable individuals, no matter who may be offended. I, for one, am not going to be turned one iota from the course which my sense of duty compels me to take in order to please or displease any individual.I came here as a free man to do the right thing by any one and every one who may be affected by my vote and voice, and I am going to do that to the end. If individuals treat this as a personal matter, they must take the responsibility.I am standing as I did twenty years ago, for a just thing between the Committees and those whom we employ, to carry on the work of Parliament. That is all I ask for, and nothing short of an inquiry into the whole of the surrounding circumstances, and a revision of the Public Service Act, in the light of the way it has operated , will meet the requirements of the case. </para>

                            <para>.- In what I have to say on this motion I wish it to be distinctly understood that I speak as a senator, and not as a member of the Government. This is a question which concerns the Senate itself. It is not a Government question, and therefore every honorable senator is entitled to express his own views on it. To me the issue seems very simple. Section 14 of the Public Service Act substitutes the  President  of the Senate, so far as the Senate is concerned, for the Public Service Commissioner and the  Clerk  of the Senate is created the permanent head of a Department. There can be no manner of doubt about this. It also constitutes the officers of the Senate a separate Department under the Act. If the  President  sees fit to consult any Committee of the Senate about a question coming within his jurisdiction, that is a matter for himself. There is no statutory obligation, and no obligation laid upon him by our Standing Orders to do so. He has the right to inform his mind as he sees fit. He is the officer made responsible by the Public Service Act and by our Standing Orders, and it is to him and not to any Committee or any individual senator that the Senate must look for the proper performance of his duties as the head of the  officers of this branch of the Legislature. Therefore, so far as concerns the first part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s speech, I have no doubt in my mind that the  President  is the authority duly constituted. It does not matter whether any past  President  has thought fit to consult a Committee or anybody else. That fact does not raise any doubt cn my mind as to the position of the  President  in this matter. </para>

                    <para>The next question that arises is whether the  President  is properly carrying out his duties to the Senate. If he &#163;s, we have no need to appoint a Select Committee. I take it that, as soon as the Select Committee came up against the Public Service Act, they would be Forced to the view that the  President  is responsible. * They would then have to proceed to inquire into what the  President  has been and is doing to see whether, in their opinion, he is. rightly carrying out his duties. </para>

                            <para>- If that is the  idea,  then I am not in favour of appointing a Committee, because I am not in favour of laying that duty on a number of persons. I prefer to lay it on one person, and to hold him responsible to the Senate. That person is the Presiding Officer of the Senate. He and the  Speaker  of another place are the proper persons to have control of the staffs accessory for the carrying on of Parliament. </para>

If they find any difficulty in carrying out their duties, their obligation is to report to the Senate. So far, they have not done that, and until some Committee report that the  President  is interfering with them, or preventing them from carrying out their duties, I shall assume that he is not so interfering, because there is a proper way under the Standing Orders  for them to bring any such happening before the Senate. Until they do, T do not propose to assume anything of the kind. </para>

                    <para>The  President  is first of all elected by the vote of the Senate, and under section 17 of the Constitution he is removable at any time by a vote of the Senate. He is, therefore, all the time responsible to the Senate for the due performance of his duties. The question consequently arises : Has any case been made out to show that the  President  is not worthy of our confidence? Because the .passing of a motion such as this would presume that we have doubts&#39; as to the way in which he is carrying out his duties. In the case of some Departments, honorable senators may not have the means of making up their minds as to what is being done. That cannot be said in the case of the Senate.

I can see it for myself just as well as any member of a Select Committee can see it. I am, therefore, entitled to make up my own mind whether the  President  is properly carrying out his duties. I believe he is doing so. I believe he has a due sense of his responsibility, not merely to the Senate, but to the officers under his &#39;control. I therefore cannot vote for the motion, because, in my judgment, it imputes a doubt as to the way in which the  President  is carrying out his duties. </para>

                    <para>One point was brought up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie as a justification, I take it, for the passing of the motion. He quoted cases of officers who were here when the first Senate met, and pointed out that many of them had not had their salaries increased in proportion to the length of time that they had been engaged. I altogether dissent from the principle therein inferred as to the fixation of salaries. The right thing to do in Government Departments, as elsewhere, is to fix the salary according to the nature and responsibility of the duties performed. The problem set by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is not confined to Parliament. It is to be met in every Government Department. The claim is continually put forward that an officer can remain in a position, and that his salary can go on automatically increasing. If that principle were carried to its logical conclusion, it would mean that, in course of time, an officer performing duties of the lowest character; so far as responsibility and value of service were concerned, could be receiving the highest salary, because he had been in the Department for perhaps thirty years. That is altogether a wrong principle upon which to assess salaries. Length, of service should be taken into consideration,  but we must also consider the nature o5 the duties that the officer is performing. Officers do not come into this Parliament blindfold. They know what they are coming to. There are officers in this Parliament who were officers in some of the Commonwealth Departments. When they came into the service of Parliament they knew that they were entering a Department in which the opportunities for promotion were strictly limited. They knew that they were coming to a large extent into a <inline font-style="italic">cut-de-sac.</inline> A man looking around him for a future career could see the Public Service open to him, because if he had the qualifications to enter the Parliamentary Service, he ought tc&#62; have them also to enter the Public Service. He deliberately decides to enter a Department with a handful of employees, where he must know that the number of highly-paid positions must be distinctly limited, and the opportunities for promotion very few. He must know that the opportunities here are not to be compared with those which obtain in the wider sphere of other Departments. </para>

We know there is work in this Parliament being performed by men which could well be done by  boys.  I have seen men with bundles of papers, under their arms which have merely to be attached to files in the Senate clubroom.

                            <para>- If vacancies occur, they have the opportunity of applying; and it is ridiculous to suggest that because a man remains in <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> certain position his salary should rise automatically. It would be unreasonable to adopt such a principle. The salaries here ought to have relation to salaries outside, which are paid by those who have to provide the money with which our attendants ;irc paid. Prom, what I can see in the&#39; Estimates, the salaries paid to our attendants compare more than favorably with those in other public Departments. I have seen officers in this Parliament performing duties which are light compared with those in other public Departments where &#34;the remuneration is not higher. </para>

Even if it were assumed that the salaries paid are inadequate, that is a matter with which the  President  can deal. The Senate had a Supply Bill before it this afternoon, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> was available to answer any criticisms or questions in regard to the salaries paid to certain officers. I do not see why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> . should not be responsible; and I am sure that if specific cases were brought forward they would  see  that justice was done. </para>

I do not believe that he would do that, and before a charge of that kind is made proof of it should be submitted. So far, there has been no justification for such a statement, and during the twenty years I have been a member of this Senate I have never heard of a case of victimization.

This is not the first time that adverse criticisms, and even attacks, have been made upon my administration of the affairs of this Chamber. The only complaint I have to make in this regard is that it would be much better to discuss this matter when we are in Committee on the Estimates, as I would then have the opportunity of meeting honorable senators on an equal footing. </para>

                                <para>- I wish the honorable senator would be silent and allow me to proceed, as I did not&#39; interrupt him when he was speaking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, at the outset, gave his reasons for bringing this motion forward. It is not for me to impute motives, but he said he had introduced the matter to give the Senate an opportunity to ventilate its opinions. The Senate has full and ample opportunity to do that without any special opportunity being provided by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. This afternoon we had  a  Supply Bill before the Senate, in which the Parliamentary Estimates found first place. I remained in the chamber, as I  always do, until the vote for Parliament had been disposed of, so that if any criticisms were offered I would be able to meet them. That was an opportunity for honorable senators to. ventilate their opinions. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie believe that if a Select Committee is appointed it will be the means of giving honorable senators an opportunity to ventilate their opinions? It will not give them that right. </para>

                        <para>It is very curious to me to find that the Senate is being asked to appoint a Committee to inquire into the work of Committees, or something which comes under the purview of Committees already appointed. The Senate, in common with another place, has appointed various Committees, and as the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> pointed out, they have the right to report to the Senate or to another place any conclusions at which they may arrive. These Committees have the fullest right to inquire into everything that comes under their purview, and yet the Senate is being coolly asked to appoint another Committee to inquire into the work of other Committees. It is absurd on the face of it. The honorable senator said, amongst other things, that the inquiry of the proposed Committee might be the means of making my decisions more understandable. If there has been anything that was not understandable I have been in my place every time the Estimates and Supply Bills have been under discussion to give the fullest information. If it is to be an inquiry behind my back, without me having the opportunity of putting my case, I do not think the Senate will be in a much better position to understand my decisions than it has been in the past. It is altogether improper for the Senate to appoint a Committee of inquiry into the working of the Joint Committee of the two Houses. It would be an assumption on the part of the Senate that they had the right to review the work of Joint Committees. That would not be a. proper attitude for the Senate to adopt. If a Select Committee is appointed it should be a Joint Committee of the two Houses, because both branches of the Legislature are equally responsible. </para>
                        <para>In discussing certain matters which he desired to review, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said that a letter was sent from me to the Library Committee laying down certain principles. I desire to assure honorable senators that during the seventeen years I have been a member of the Senate I have never sent a single line to the Library Committee or any other Committee. If I did send a communication it must be on the files of the Library Committee, and I defy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, or any one else, to produce such a letter, because I have never written one - not a single line. </para>

When the question of fixing salaries or arranging promotions came under review, I, as a member of the Committee, refused to take any part in the discussion, because under the law as it stands it was not my duty.

                                <para>- The minutes are not a letter. I did enter a protest; I refused to be a party to what was being done, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is the  chairman  of the Library Committee. The responsibility is his by Act of Parliament, and no Committee has a right to override an Act passed by both branches of the Legislature. The gentlemen who should pay the greatest respect to the will of Parliament are its members and officers. If the law is wrong it should be amended ; but while it is there expressing the will of Parliament, honorable members themselves, and especially the officers, should be most ardent in upholding it. What really happened in regard to the Library  Committee is this : The  Speaker  is  chairman  of the Committee, and has a full knowledge of the work of the officers, and i6, therefore, the proper person to deal with such questions as promotions and salaries. I have a joint responsibility with him, and give my assent to all his recommendations. I never question his decisions, because I recognise that he is the responsible officer. I give my support in any decisions he may arrive at, because I believe that divided or scattered control is very undesirable. Exactly the same thing happened in regard to the Joint House Committee, and the procedure adopted has always been the same, since the Public Service Act was passed. It is only  in regard to the men who are not classified, such as gardeners and others, that for many years past the Presiding Officers have consulted the Committee. I consulted the House Committee when the cost of living was increasing by leaps and bounds, in order to strengthen my opinion as to what should be a proper amount to add to the salaries of these officers, and so that, when asking the Government for increased provision, I might be able to say that I had the support of the Committee in doing so. </para>

                            Largie also says that the Presiding Officers must accept all the responsibility. Undoubtedly we must, and I have never refused to do so. I am here to be criticised for any action I may have taken, and willing to face all criticism levelled against me. It is my responsibility to do so. I have always been willing to take it. I am doing so now. But what would be the position of the Presiding Officers if we were to be mere messenger boys, allowing everything to be fixed  by Committees, and then making our recommendations to the Governor-General in Council, as provided in the Act, al- though having nothing at all to do with them? Who would be responsible in those circumstances? As a matter of fact, no  Speaker  or  President  could adopt such a cowardly attitude as to say to either House, &#34; The Committee did this, and I should not be held responsible.&#34; The Act places the responsibility on the Presiding Officers, and we cannot be so cowardly as to shelter ourselves behind any Committees.

                            Largie says that our action has taken away from the Committee the power to deal with the officers, but how can one take away from the Committee something which it has never had ?

                                <para>- The Committee has never had this power. Section 14 of the Public Service Act, which was passed in 1902, and has never been repealed or altered in this regard, distinctly provides, in sub-section 1, that the  President  and  Speaker  shall deal with all questions of appointments, promotions, &#39; and regulations. Can any one show me a single line, in the Public Service Act in which the Committee to which the honorable senator has referred is even mentioned ? Subsection 2 of this section further appoints the  President  and  Speaker  to take the place of the Public Service Commissioner, and classifies the Clerks of either House, the Chief Parliamentary Reporter, and the Parliamentary Librarian as permanent heads. That is the provision in the Act, and I ask, again, how can any action on my part take away from a Committee something which it has never had? If any fault there be, it lies with Parliament for not giving the Committee the power. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s complaint lies against Parliament and not against me. I am placed here in a responsible position, with certain defined duties laid down by Statute, and am I to be &#34; hauled over the coals &#34; because I do faithfully and well, within the limits of my capacity and ability, that which the Act compels me to do ? It is a strange doctrine indeed to me that the honorable senator should turn and rend me for doing something which Parliament has made it imperative for me to do. </para>

                        <para class="block">Service Act while giving adherence to this particular sub-section. As a matter of fact we have done nothing of the kind. In every place where the Public Service regulations with regard to leave, promotions, or anything else, are applicable to this Senate, they are always applied. There is not a single provision of the Act or obligation imposed om the Public Service Commissioner in regard to the outside officers which we do not assume in regard to our officers. Perhaps I am wrong in saying this, because there is one thing which I have done illegally, but I shall tell the Senate about it before I have finished and then it can judge me accordingly. But apart from this in every case where the Public Service regulations and practice could be applied to the officers of this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and I have invariably applied them. Again, where a &#39;Commonwealth arbitration award has applied to officers of the Public Service, we have immediately, and without hesitation, applied it to the officers of this Parliament. If a Commonwealth Arbitration Court has given an award improving the .position, or increasing the pay of officers of the Public Service, similarly the pay of our own officers has immediately been advanced to the same extent. This has been done in every case. </para>

                            Largie says that no &#39; announcement has been made in the press of vacancies that have occurred in the staff of the Senate; but I think he is wrong. Vacancies have frequently been advertised in the press. A month ago a vacant .position was advertised in that way. I am not sure that every vacant position has been so advertised in the press, but an advertisement has always appeared in the

                        <para>I have already said that I plead guilty to one evasion of the provisions of the Public Service Act; but that has occurred since our soldiers began to return from the great war. In respect to junior (positions, in which&#39; it is not necessary to hold an examination, and for which any one outside the Service may be chosen, instead of advertising them, as perhaps I should have done, under the strict letter of the law, I have asked the Repatriation Department to choose for me three or four men suitable for the positions to be filled. I have explained the nature of the duties to be undertaken, and have interviewed the men sent up by the Department, and picked those I thought best suited for the positions. If I am to be condemned for this one departure from the provisions of the Public Service Act, I am prepared to bear the condemnation cheerfully. To these lower positions four men have been appointed by me within the last four years, and they were all obtained in the manner I have described. When a very old servant of, the Senate died a little while ago, the vacancy thus created was filled in this manner&#39; on the first of this month. </para>

                                <para>- I shall deal with that matter if the honorable senator will allow me to complete what I am saying. I did not interrupt him when he was speaking. All the appointments made in the way I have described have proved satisfactory. I have not had a single complaint about one of these men. They were appointed on six months&#39; probation, and their appointments were confirmed if they proved satisfactory. So far every one of them has proved satisfactory. In regard to the giving of higher positions to returned soldiers, there has only been one position vacant - the one which I mentioned a little while ago. However, my conception of the principle of giving preference to returned soldiers is to give them that preference in respect to entry into the Service, and then let them work their way up on their merits. Having secured preference of entry into the Service, I think they ought not to ask for anything more. In that respect the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> which I can produce for the benefit of honorable senators, fully bears me out. This is the position I have taken up in regard to the vacancies I have filled. In the last case my idea was to get the youngest person I could, with the necessary qualifications, because, in the ordinary course of events, it was likely that he would have a very long time to wait before obtaining promotion, and I thought that the years of training and practical work he would thus get would enable him to fill the highest positions here. Therefore, the younger he was, the better he would be from my point of view. That was one of the reasons actuating me in appointing the gentleman who has filled the vacancy. </para>

                            Largie has also said that unfairness has been displayed towards officers with twenty years&#39; service, but it is all very well to make a general statement of that kind. The honorable senator should have come down to hard facts, and if he knew that there had been unfairness he should have given particular instances of it. I venture to say that there is not&#39; a single officer, from the highest position to the lowest position in the Senate, who is not at least as well off as any officer occupying a similar position in the general Public Service. This is proved by the fact that, for every position in the Parliamentary Service, from the highest to the lowest, which has become vacant, there have been hundreds of applications from persons in the general Public Service. Do honorable senators think that if officers of the Parliament were not so well paid as officers of the general Public Service, there would be that rush for these positions ? People do not rush for worse positions than those which they at present occupy. Whilst the Parliament should be the best and most generous of employers, it should not set an impossible standard for the general Public Service. Conditions should be somewhat equal all round. In my view, whilst being just, and even generous, to the men we employ, we should not be over-generous, because we should remember the multitude of poor people who have to find the money to give them handsome salaries. However, I have always noticed that men who are most generous with other people&#39;s money are generally close-fisted with their own.

If there is a single officer of the Senate from the humblest to the highest getting a lower salary than he would receive in the general Public Service, he has. a right to complain of injustice just as an officer of the general Public Service would have the right to complain if officers here of a similar grade were very much better treated than he was. Each is entitled to the same measure of fair play and justice no matter to which of the Services he belongs. </para>

                        <para>There was an ample opportunity afforded this afternoon, if any injustice has been done to any individual, to thresh out the individual case. It cannot be done in a general debate of this kind, but it might have been done this afternoon in Committee on the Supply Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, casting his eyes around, said that he could see such officers in this chamber. The only individual case to which I can think the honorable senator&#39;s remarks applied is the case of my messenger, James, who is in the Senate chamber now, and who has been promoted. I take full responsibility for his promotion, and I say that James is the only officer I have met in this Parliament who would have done what he did without a murmur. A little while ago, owing to ill-health or some other re&#39;ason we had occasion to reduce an officer to a humbler position than that which he previously occupied. James was transferred to fill that officer&#39;s place. After filling if satisfactorily and well for several months representations were made to me that I ought to give the former occupant of the position another show, and put him back in the position he formerly occupied. I did so, and restored James to his old and humbler position. He went back, and never uttered a complaint. I say that I do not think there is any other officer who would have done that. If any man on his past record is deserving of promotion it is James, and I make no apology to any one for having promoted him. </para>

                        <para>Something has been said with respect to the <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> staff. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff is in a position by itself. To a large extent it is a professional staff, and if there is any close staff at all - which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie complains of - it is the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and necessarily so, because a man requires special qualifications to be a member of it. Other officers of very high ability come in in junior positions, and have to work their way up after many years to the standard of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> man. If they tried to get on to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff here ; there would be very serious complaints about it, and they would never get a show. But the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff do not work throughout years of junior training at low salaries in the service of this Parliament as other officers have to do. They are appointed at fairly decent salaries from the beginning. I took occasion a little while ago to get from the House of Commons a statement as to the way in which the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff was treated there, and I say that, although the cost of living is higher in Great Britain than it is here at the present moment, the treatment meted out to  the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> officers here does not compare unfavorably with the treatment meted out to the &#39;Souse of Commons <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, nor is their work more strenuous. </para>
                        <para>AVith regard to the sweated conditions here which we have heard so much about, I fail to see that anybody is sweated in the service of this Chamber. If there is any one sweated the fault must lie with the tribunal that fixes the conditions of service, because the decisions of that tribunal are invariably applied to the officers of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has mentioned the fact that Professor Scott was a member of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. No one rejoiced more than I did to find one of the members of our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff promoted to so distinguished a position as that of Professor of History in the University of Melbourne. But while he is to be congratulated upon his success, that is not to say that he was worth any more to us as a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporter. He might be worth several thousand pounds a year as a professor of history, but that would be no criterion of his value as a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporter. It would have nothing to do with it. A man in one walk of life may earn &#163;20 a week, but because he may choose to accept another position in which, he can earn only &#163;5, that is no reason why the occupation for which he is paid &#163;5 per week should be saddled with the higher salary - it is only that the man is in the wrong position for the time being. </para>
                        <para>With regard to the question of the temporary men, I have not adopted any system in that regard which was not adopted by my predecessor from the beginning. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Chaffey Baker, in regard to the lower paid junior positions, laid down that principle many years ago. He held that he should be in a position to have some control over officers filling positions for which no examination had to be passed, and which required the possession of no particular qualifications. There is another aspect of the question which ought to be considered, and it is this : There are positions which at times can very well be done without, and, if you put into those positions a gazetted public servant, a permanent man, no matter whether you want him or not and whether or not there is anything for him to do, he must be kept on. There are some positions in connexion with the Senate which, at times, and especially when Parliament is not sitting, need not be filled. It is a matter for consideration whether the policy of retaining officers in those positions shall continue in the future. In any case it is a bad policy to gazette a man into the Public Service so that he must be kept in employment whether there is work for him to do or not. No one has anything to complain of because the junior and lower positions are temporary. As a matter of fact, .the officers filling them have every privilege, every increase of pay, and every promotion given to them that they could claim if they were duly gazetted public servants. </para>
                        <para>In conclusion, I want to point out what it would mean if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s contention, were correct, and all appointments, fixing of salaries, and promotions were subject to a Committee. Rightly or wrongly, and, I believe, rightly, the Public Service Act was originally passed for the purpose of removing, as far as possible, all political influence from the Public Service. That was one of the main reasons why the Act was passed in its present form </para>

                                <para>- Of course they could not. They would have no right whatever to do so. If the Presiding Officers abrogated their duty, and it became the duty of a Committee, its members and their friends might all be wanting positions for their friends or relations, and we&#34; can easily imagine how overloaded the Service might become, and how possibly very improper individuals might be appointed. No one could say that any one in particular was responsible. You could not put your finger upon any particular man and say that he was responsible for that. That is the position, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie knows it as well as I do. I venture to say that, if that practice had applied to officers of this Parliament, we should have had more than one improper appointment made, and the Public Service would have been unduly loaded with supernumeraries and incompetents. I venture to say that one of my chief sins in the eyes of <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator de</inline> Largie is that I did  not act in something like that way on one occasion. I did not do it, and I am willing to bear the consequence. I leave it entirely in the hands of the Senate to say whether there is any need for the proposed Select Committee, or whether I am to be subjected to these continual taunts and pin-pricks because of any personal animus or feeling on the part of another honorable senator. I think that is to be deprecated. I have tried to do my duty, and shall continue to do so so long as I retain the position I now occupy. It is quite unnecessary that I should be appealed to, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie appealed to me at the beginning of his address, to take full responsibility for what I do. I always do so. I am taking full responsibility now, and I am willing to accept any punishment the Senate likes to inflict upon me for so doing. </para>

                                <para>- When the motion was announced yesterday, and when I read it on the business-paper to-day, I could see at once that it was not so much of a public character as a motion dealing with the affairs of the Senate itself. But from the debate it seems to have assumed the form of a domestic or family quarrel. I should be very sorry if the motion were voted upon from considerations of that character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out that section 14 of the Public Service Act invests the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in their relation to the officers of the Senate and another place, with the same powers, functions, responsibilities, and duties as the Public Service Commissioner exercises over the general body of the Public Service. Nobody doubts that. But what, I take it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was complaining of was that, whereas in the early days of the operation of the Act it was the practice for Presidents and Speakers, in exercising some of their responsibilities and discharging their functions in relation to employees of Parliament, to consult and confer with several Committees more directly associated with individual officers, the practice has now grown up of the  President  of the Senate and of the  Speaker  of the other branch of the Legislature taking upon themselves literally, technically, and formally, the full powers and responsibilities which are vested in them by virtue of the Public Service Act. That, I take it, was the gravamen of his complaint. </para>

                        <para>The Minister for Defence stated that he was not concerned with what preceding Presidents and Speakers did. I am, and I hope that the Senate will be. They have laid down precedents for our guidance in regard to the position of the various officers of the Senate. What will be the position of the latter if we have not a uniform practice? If preceding Presidents have adopted one line of practice, are not the officers of the Senate justified in assuming that that practice will be permanently followed ? If a succeeding President comes along and blows to the winds all the precedents laid down by his predecessors, what will be the position of the officers of this Chamber? If that President should go, and his successor should adopt a different attitude, how can those officers know where they stand ? I am, therefore, concerned with what was the original practice. </para>

Certain principles have been laid down in our Public Service Act for certain purposes Had time permitted, I would have carefully perused the debates which took place upon certain provisions which are embodied in that Statute with a view to ascertaining the reasons which actuated Parliament in placing under the control of the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of another place, the, officers of this Parliament, instead of placing them under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. It may be that upon that occasion the  President  and the  Speaker&#39;  gave assurances that in discharging their responsibilities they would be guided by the views which were expressed by the various Parliamentary Committees. </para>

It may be that Parliament agreed to certain provisions which now appear in the Public Service Act upon assurances of that character. At any rate. <inline font-weight="bold">President Sir Richard</inline> Chaffey Baker, who was perhaps the most experienced Presiding Officer of his day in the whole of the Commonwealth, and  Speaker  Holder, who was a  Speaker  of the greatest eminence, discharged their duties under the Public Service- Act in a certain manner, and officers of this Parliament were naturally led to believe that the procedure which they laid down would be followed for all time. Now it appears that certain changes have taken place. Should there be any further changes in the occupancy of the chairs in the different Houses, the officers of this Parliament will have no knowledge of where they stand.  For this reason&#39; we are concerned, when debating a motion of this character, with what has been the practice hitherto, no matter what may be the literal terms of the Statute. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. We have had seventeen or eighteen years&#39; experience of the Public Service Act in its application to public servants generally, and of section 14 of that Act in its application to officers of this Parliament. There is no harm in inquiring  whether  it is wise to perpetuate the policy which is there laid down or to modify it. As I have been reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> the Government propose, during the current session, to deal with various outstanding features connected with our Public Service administration. We have been promised a_ comprehensive measure dealing with the Public Service in all its phases. We have recently dealt with single features of the Service by means of separate Bills. But the amending measure which is to be submitted for our consideration during the present session will apply to the whole of the Service. Should it be thought desirable by the Select Committee which it is proposed to appoint, that the provisions of the Act should be made to apply &#34;to the officers of the Senate, the present is a very opportune time for it to consider that question. If, on the other hand, the Committee should think that the present system works&#39; well in the interests of the officers of Parliament themselves, this is a very opportune time for it to express its opinion to the Senate., and for the Senate to act accordingly. The time, I repeat, is opportune, and the means proposed in this motion are appropriate. I therefore intend to support the motion. In doing so, however. I do not wish to lay myself open to the same form of attack as I have made upon the Minister for Defence; but I am not now concerned with the question of whether a man should or should not have been promoted, or whether he is or is not receiving adequate remuneration for his services considering the length of time that he has occupied his office. But I am concerned with whether the officers of this Parliament should constitute a water-tight compartment. </para>

                            <para>. - To-day, when you, sir, were classifying the business, I called &#34;Not formal&#34; to this motion, in order that I might at least hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie the motives which prompted his desire to get it put into operation without discussion. Personally, I desired it to be discussed. I have since listened to the whole of his speech; and whatever may be the correctness or otherwise of the construction which has been put upon the motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> I must tell him that I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie lay special stress upon matters concerning the Library staff and. the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. I understand that the officials engaged in our parliamentary Library, and the officers of the <inline font-style="italic">Han sard</inline> staff, come under the jurisdiction of the  Speaker  of another place and of the  President  of the Senate, and that they are not solely within the jurisdiction of the Presiding Officer of this Oh amber. Consequently, any Committee which may he appointed under the terms of this motion will clearly have no power to do anything in connexion with officers who require to be appointed by the Presiding Officers of both branches of the Legislature. If we attempt, of our own volition, to initiate an inquiry into matters which certainly concern the Presiding Officers of both Chambers, our action will probably be resented. But even if we could institute such an inquiry, it would be injudicious for us to do so. If we take the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and the Library staff away from the parliamentary staff, how many individuals will remain? I am a member of the House Committee, and have been so ever since I entered the Senate. I have missed very few meetings of that Committee- </para>

                        <para>SenatorBAKHAP.- Yes. That was clearly one of the acts within the competency of the Committee. I am not here to defend the  President.  He is very capable of defending his own action. At the meetings of the Joint House Committee which I have attended, many matters have come within its purview, and these have certainly been brought, up by the  President  in no arrogant spirit; but if he and the  Speaker  of another place have powers vested in them by Act of Parliament, I would think very little of them if they asked the Committee to assume responsibility for the exercise of those powers. The granting of an increase in the meal allowances and increased wages to the gardeners came within the scope of the House Committee&#39;s deliberations. That was not effected by the  President  or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> of their own volition. It was done by us at a meeting of the Joint House Committee. </para>

I think, in fairness to the  President,  that before we appoint this Select Committee, which will be in a sense appointed in an atmosphere of censure so far as he is concerned, we should have some specific statement, for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie clearly complained, in his opening remarks, of certain things which he said the  President  had done or had not done; of sins of commission and omission. Was the honorable senator specific in his allegations? He certainly was not. He mentioned in a vague way something the  President  had done in connexion with the Library Committee, but I am in darkness even now as to what wrong the  President  committed. What are the charges? What is the nature of the President&#39;s derelictions? I do not know. Did any other honorable senator gather any substantial information from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s statements ? </para>

                            <para>. - I follow very largely what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has said, and I want to say, definitely and clearly, that I sympathize with the  members of the Parliamentary staffs in the fact that the reduced value of the &#163;1 to-day  has placed them at a disadvantage. I listened with a great deal of interest to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> had&#39; to say. He told us clearly that the whole trouble was due to the fact that .the Parliamentary staffs were in watertight compartments under the present Public Service Act. If that is so, I take it that the appointment of this Select Committee can lead to no good, but that, on the contrary, it may do a great deal of harm in the matter of discipline and the creation of ill-feeling amongst the officers concerned. For that reason I deprecate very much the time of the Senate being taken up in the discussion of the question . </para>

                            (South Australia) 79.37&#93;. - I am sorry the debate has taken this turn. I have taken a great deal of interest in every Bill affecting the Public Service that has come before the Senate, and I think that as we are to have a comprehensive amendment of the Act shortly we should learn as much as we can of the present system under which our Parliamentary officers are working. I know of no other way of getting this information than by the means proposed.

                            <para>- That is so. I have no personal feeling in the matter at all. I feel that a public duty rests upon me to do what I can to make every Bill that comes before the Senate as perfect as possible, and I desire that all officers employed in connexion with the Parliament should have every reasonable opportunity for advancement. I would not like it to be said of them : &#34; As you were in the beginning, so you shall be for ever.&#34; I may inform honorable senators that a gentleman, who was a sessional assistant in the South Australian Parliament, was able eventually to rise to his present position as assistant librarian in the State Parliamentary Library. I do not want any impediment to be placed in the path of progress for our officers, and for that_ reason I have no hesitation in indorsing the terms of the motion. I am not supporting it in order to pass censure upon the  President,  because, as a matter of fact, we are very good friends. </para>

                                <para>- We shall have to consider the Public Service as a whole  in  the Bill that will shortly be before us. If the Department of the Senate is a &#34; watertight compartment,&#34; as it has been called during the debate, we want to know whether that is the most desirable system, and we cannot ascertain that better than by finding out how other Parliaments conduct similar services. If our way is better than theirs, we shall return from the search satisfied, and be able to report that we are satisfied. If, however, we obtain such information as leads this Parliament to amend the existing system, our appointment will not have been in vain. A Select Committee really involves the sacrifice of the time of the members who compose it, and that sacrifice will have to be made without any fee or reward. It therefore need not be thought that this is to be a joy-ride. Whether the motion is carried or not will depend entirely on the good sense of the Senate; and, for my part, I leave it entirely to their judgment. In my opinion, if the Committee is appointed useful results will be achieved. </para>

                            <para>.- I have listened to the debate on this question from its inception, and, so far, I have failed to grasp <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s object in asking for the appointment of a SelectCommittee. Had I been a member of the House Committee, and had I felt that I was responsible to the Senate for the protection of the officers under theCommittee, I should have taken upon myself the responsibility of advising the Senate that those officers were not being properly treated. The officers themselves have rights, and if they feel that it would be a privilege to them to &#39;be allowed to appeal to the &#39;House &#39;Committee to remedy their wrongs- </para>

                        <para>. -  I was asked to bring before the Senate yesterday a matter affect ing honorable senators who were absent at the time the division was taken on the item in the Loan Bill for works in the Federal Capital Territory. At the time the Senate adjourned yesterday the Library Committee was meeting, and I missed the opportunity to do so. An article appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 4th October commenting on the division on the vote for works at Canberra, in which reflections were made on senators who were absent. I am pleased to say that those senators were paired on that occasion, but if the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> statement was not contradicted, they might be placed in an unfavorable light before the public. The paragraph is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>The Senate  on  Friday had an opportunity to prevent the  wasteful expenditure of  &#163;150,000  on  the Federal Capital, and  seldom  was more than one-half  of  the thirty-six members  present.  Many  of  those who were  opposing  this  frittering  away  of  money  considered  that had there been  a full attendance  the  waste  would have been  prevented.  When a  division  was  taken  nineteen members voted. It is only a short while since members voted  themselves  an  additional  &#163;400  a  year, and the least they  can  do  is to  give  serious consideration to important business  when it arises. </para>

                    <para class="block">We had in the circumstances a very good attendance. Those honorable senators who did not take part in the division were paired, and their vote was recorded, and had they been present it would have made no difference whatever to the result. It is only fair that I should mention this in order to show the public that those senators who were absent did not neglect their duties in any way. Many of them were away on public duties, or taking part in public affairs, but they were all accounted for. The pairs on that division were: - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson; Senator Pearce,</inline> who was in Western Australia on public duty, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton; Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, who was also away on public duty, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> who was in Queensland on public affairs, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow; Senator Lynch,</inline> whois in Western Australia, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> ; and SenatorPayne, who was in Tasmania, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain.</inline> Including that list of pairs, therefore, wo had a very full attendance when the matter was settled. </para>
