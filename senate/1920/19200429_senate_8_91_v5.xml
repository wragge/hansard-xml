                            <para>- It is not proposed to extend any further clemency to prisoners. All sentences awarded prior to18th July, 1919, in respect of purely military offences only, have been remitted, and ace still being remitted on the disembarkation of the military prisoners in their districts in Australia. Also, in regard to sentences awarded before that date for offences ordinarily punishable by civil law, an automatic remission of three weeks for every three months (not exceeding twelve months in all) is granted. In addition, all such cases are subsequently reviewed, and very substantial further remissions have been made. All sentences awarded after 18th July, 1919, are reviewed by a Sentences Revisory Committee, and many remissions have been granted. The greater proportion of sentences which have not been altogether remitted under the amnesty have been awarded for very grave criminal offences, such as manslaughter, stealing, robbery with violence, wounding with intent, forgery, &#38;c. </para>

                    <para>. - In dealing with the amendments made by the House of Representatives in this Bill as it left the Senate, I should like first of all to intimate that most of them are non-controversial, inasmuch as they pro- vide merely for greater clarity of language, a little liberalization in respect to one or two classes of dependants, and generally are such as I feel sure the Senate will accept as improvements in the Bill. There are only two amendments in respect of which I propose to ask the Senate to disagree with what has been proposed by the other branch of the Legislature. I shall indicate those as we proceed.

                        <para>- I hold no brief for any particular organization. I belong to two, one of which is political and the other non-political. We have had in Queensland such an experience of logrolling that I ask the Committee to consider seriously before opening the door to any organization, political or non-political, to submit names for a seat on the Commission. If I had heard the Minister clearly I should have asked him to reconsider the matter and to agree to insert the words &#34; any non -political organization,&#34; because if we once open the door for a political organization to submit names, we immediately give the Government then in power an opportunity to make a political appointment. Suppose, for instance, that the party of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is a member occupied the Treasury bench. What would be the position then ? </para>

                        <para>- I do mean it, because of our recent experiences in Queensland. My colleagues from that State can bear out what I say. A few men could form themselves into an organization and claim to be a soldiers&#39; organization, for the purpose of submitting a name to the Labour Government, and the Labour Government could accept the nomination, with the result that the appointment would immediately become a political appointment. I am not advocating that the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League should be the only body with the right to submit names. Let any soldiers&#39; organizations submit names, so long as they are non-political organizations; but if once we allow political organizations to submit names, we immediately open the door for the making of political appointments by whatever Government happens to be on the Treasury bench at the time. </para>

                    <para>. - I dissent from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> suggestion that the party which happens to be in charge of the Treasury bench for the time being should decline to pass legislation which would be regarded as acceptable as long as that party remained in power, simply for fear of something that a future Government may do. We ought to pass the thing if we think it right, irrespective of what any future Government may elect to do with it. The honorable senator wishes the right of nomination to be limited to non-political parties. Frankly, I do not know such a thing. I hear all sorts of parties calling themselves non- political, but in the last resort it is found that they drift into politics sooner or later. Even the principal Soldiers League calls itself non-political, but if you read its manifesto you find that half the items are debatable subjects which enter into the realm of politics. </para>

                        <para>- They are not so affiliated to-day, but it is clear that they are endeavouring to form a party themselves, or, alternatively, that they will support whatever political party tries to achieve the objects for which they stand. It is largely a matter of camouflage to talk of non-political parties to-day. Any number of instances could be quoted of organizations, formed for quite desirable objects, that started out with the declaration that they were non-political, but before long took an active part at elections in backing those candidates who promised to support the things they desired to achieve. If they are loyal to their objects, they must use all the tools which come to their hand, in order to attain them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> need not be alarmed about this matter. The ordinary citizen walking in the streets has the right to nominate anybody. He can write to the Minister enclosing the nomination of somebody else, or even of himself, as a member of the Commission, bub the responsibility of making the selection falls on the Minister. Whether the nomination is made by one or twenty organizations does not impair the two facts&#39;: first, that the right exists to-day, and, secondly, that upon the Minister ultimately falls the responsibility of saying which of the persons nominated he deems best for the position. I am unable to share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll&#39;s</inline> fears, and therefore ask the Committee to agree to the amendment made by another place. </para>

                <para class="block">The Bill provided a term of five years for the Commission. Another place has reduced that term to three years. We are giving the Commission very wide powers. Having largely of our own volition passed those powers into the hands of the Commission, we ought to give the Commission such security of tenure as will insure its exercise of those powers in a free and independent way. We recognise that principle in appointing Judges for life, in order that they may perform their duties without the necessity of shaping their course so as to secure re-appointment. Most Commissions are appointed for seven years, but I do not suggest that term in this case. In view of the work to be accomplished, seven years would be too long; but five years is a reasonable period. I ask the Committee to disagree with the amendment in order to secure the placing of the Commissioners in a position of independence. </para>

It will be generally recognised that that would be a very bad principle to adopt. These commissioners should be quite independent of politics- indeed, their positions should be somewhat analogous to those occupied by our Judges. They will be called upon &#39; to undertake a vast work, and in three years they will only just about have mastered their jobs. It would be a pity, therefore, if we did not disagree with the amendment of the other House. Personally, I hope that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> will stick to his guns. </para>

                    <para>. - If it were seriously contended that the work of the Repatriation Commission would terminate within three years, there might be some justification for adopting the amendment of the other branch of the Legislature. But if the work of this body is to extend over an indefinite period and we could effect a compromise with another place by making the term of their appointment seven years, I think it would be wise for us to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> arguments were not so much in favour of the amendment which has been made in the Bill as they were condemnatory of it. We all know that the election of a new House of Representatives may mean the formation of a new Government. That .might conceivably result in the appointment of fresh commissioners if the term of their appointment were limited to three years. </para>

                        <para>- The practice suggested would certainly tend to make such appointments of a purely political character. Had the other House amended the Bill to provide for a seven years&#39; period I would have supported it. In the circumstances, however, I hope that the Minister will adhere to the term of five years, which I regard&#39; as the most satisfactory. </para>

                <para>SenatorGARDINER (New South Wales) &#91;3.27&#93;. - I would remind honorable senators that this amendment emanates from a party which has a majority in the other House. I have no desire to discuss the question of party appointments, but  I  do not think there is any warrant for the charge of log rolling which was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> In most Government appointments the fitness of men for the position has ever been the chief concern of Ministers. I make that statement as the result of a long and active association with party politics. </para>

No officer who discharges his duties efficiently for three years is likely to be displaced by any Government. But if we insist upon fixing the term for which these commissioners are to be appointed at five years it may possibly be found that it would have been convenient at the end of three years to remove one of them because of the perfunctory manner in which he was performing his duties. </para>

                        <para>- No, because there must be ample reason for the removal of any public official from his office. If there is no charge against him he cannot be removed before the expiration of his term, though I could quite understand that it would be a convenience for the Government to have power to remove him at an earlier period. The difference between three years and five years is not very great, and I take it that at the end of three years the principal business of the Commission will have been completed. If there is any fear in the minds of honorable senators that any party will make political appointments, all I can say is that that fear is not justified by my experience in State and Federal politics over a great many years. </para>

                    <para>. - I am more concerned with the selection of a suitable man for this position than the term of his appointment. Two years have elapsed since we passed the first Repatriation Bill, though it seems as if it were but yesterday, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> were right there would be no need for a reappointment of the Commissioners. We cannot, however, anticipate that we are near the end of our repatriation work. During the first three years of his term a Commissioner will necessarily acquire a great deal of knowledge, which will be of value to him in his future work, but if the appointment is for only three years, a Commissioner at the end of that term might be looking for a job. He may or may not be reappointed. If a man is not efficient enough for an appointment of five years, he is not worthy of appointment for three years. There is no force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> argument that we ought to accept the amendment made by the House of Representatives because it is the opinon of the majority of the other House and the same party has a majority in the Senate. The five years&#39; term is preferable on all grounds, because a Commissioner will get to know his work and be able to perform it more efficiently. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators will remember that when this clause was before us there was some discussion as to the limit to be placed upon the Commissioner. An amendment was drafted at the time which met with the wishes of the Committee, but which the law officers thought was couched in somewhat ambiguous language. The purpose of the new paragraph is, very rightly, to prevent a Commissioner or Acting Commissioner from being interested in any undertaking or company deriving profits from transactions with the Commission. </para>

                        <para>. -  This is one of the two amendments which I have intimated I intended to ask the Senate to disagree with. I am well aware that there have been put forward various suggestions for the repatriation of soldiers by establishing them in businesses, cooperative and otherwise. But I ask the Committee to consider some of the difficulties, and even evils, which might arise if this proposed new clause were agreed to. I assume from the remarks made in another place that what was in the mind of the honorable member who moved this amendment  was that it was a proposal by means of which it would be possible to place in businesses a number of men now awaiting employment, and on the unemployed register of the Repatriation Department. I do not want -what I arn about to say to be in any way misinterpreted, or to appear to cast the slightest reflection on our returned soldiers as a whole. I have already referred to the fact that their readiness to go back to civil life is the highest testimony to their character that could be given. Still, I do ask the Committee to recognise that there must necessarily be amongst the men who remain with us towards the end of repatriation a very considerable percentage of those who, for some reason or another, are very difficult to place. Many of these may not have been noted for steadiness before they went to the war- </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Amongst the men -on our books, there is a considerable percentage of those who, in my view, would represent, perhaps, the least satisfactory persons to start businesses on their own account. This provision I point out could not be limited to nien now on the unemployed register of the Department. If the Government, as a part of their repatriation policy, are to find money, to establish in business men who have not yet returned to civil life, they cannot deny the same privilege to those who have already returned to civil life. The benefit of this clause cannot be restricted to men who are awaiting employment to-day. If this clause is agreed to, any returned Australian soldier, no matter when he was discharged, must have a right to the benefits of the provision. I have not the exact figures with me, but I think that upwards of 200,000 men have passed through the Department, or have gone direct themselves to their niche in civil life. If this clause is agreed .to, not merely the men who are unemployed today, but thousands of those who axe already satisfactorily employed, but animated by the ambition of most young Australians to start business on their own account,  rather  than continue in employment, will seek assistance under this provision. </para>

If the Committee approves of the proposition to advance money to the returned soldiers generally to start business on their own account, it seems to me they will be throwing upon the Repatriation Department an obligation for which it is not intended. </para>

                        <para>- It is; but if we advance money to half-a-dozen soldiers to enable them to go into a co-operative business, we cannot logically refuse to make a proportionate advance to an individual soldier who wishes to go into business on his own account. In the last analysis, therefore, the proposed new clause is a proposition to advance money to every soldier to make a start on his own account, and, in my view, it would be, not only unnecessary, but dangerous to approve of such a proposal. </para>

                        <para>- It would be a most dangerous experiment for the Commonwealth to find the money to start 100,000 men in a co-operative enterprise. I cannot dissociate from this amendment very many applications made to me to start returned soldiers in business enterprises in the country towns, and chiefly in the State of Victoria. I think I am safe in saying that three out of every four of these cases submitted to me have been proposals to take up some defunct or bankrupt business. In one town, at no great distance from Melbourne, there is a wilderness of machinery started some years ago under a high-sounding name as a saw-milling plant. Leading townsmen, who are hardheaded business men, came along and described the magnificent opportunity which was here afforded to establish several soldiers in business. My answer was to suggest- that they were business men, and although this opportunity had stared them  in  the face, they allowed the machinery to lie idle for years, and I preferred that the experiment should be tried with the stay-at-homes rather than with men who had gone to the Front. Other leading townsmen proposed that returned soldiers should be assisted to develop a defunct mine in their neighbourhood. Another proposal submitted was that returned soldiers should be assisted to take over a bankrupt engineering shop which was to be sold. It was pleaded that this would be a magnificent business in which to start returned soldiers. I felt that it would certainly not be a good thing for the soldiers if it had failed in the hands of other people. I have felt, also, that underlying these proposals there has &#39;been one word for the soldier and six for the residents of certain towns, who would like to have some public money spent in their midst. I should be more disposed to approve of this proposition if those responsible for it said that they were willing to find a percentage of the money required to give it effect. If some of the gentlemen who have been so ardent in their desire to have industries started by the returned soldiers showed their faith in the proposition by agreeing to subsidize the proposals, or to advance &#163;1 for every &#163;1 advanced by the country, for this purpose. I should have greater faith in the value of the proposals they make. If the proposed new clause were agreed to, I believe that its effect would be to unsettle a large number of returned men who have satisfactorily found some niche in civil life, and would also start in business a large number of men who can make no possible claim to sufficient experience to warrant their success. It may be said that the responsibility is thrown on the Minister for Repatriation of saying yes or no to any proposition under this clause. I should like to say, as the Minister for the time being, that if it is desired to start an Industries Promotion Board, for that is involved, it should be apart from the Repatriation Department. I do not feel competent to say whether a particular enterprise may be good, bad, or indifferent. Quite different machinery from that which I have created for carrying on the Repatriation Department must be called into being to handle such proposals. The work of the Repatriation Department has gone along not without its jolts and jars, but still for the most part satisfactorily. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to all that the Minister .for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has said, and again I remind the Committee that this amendment could not have been carried in the House of Representatives if the Government had a &#39; majority opposed to it. I hope that the Senate is not to be made a convenience of to enable the Government to correct what has been done in another place if they disapprove of it. The House of Representatives has in this case deliberately inserted a clause which, in my opinion, might be made of material benefit to the soldiers. The one or two cases mentioned by the Minister for Repatriation of proposals for advances in support of doubtful enterprises prove nothing. If we take the saw-milling industry I venture to say that amongst our returned soldiers we should find men who would make a success of that business where, perhaps, private enterprise has so far failed. The returned soldiers have had a wider experience than most of us, and they have done things abroad. I believe that it would be in the interests not only of the returned soldiers, but of the community as a whole, to invest -money in the establishment of returned men in business on their own account under the new clause inserted by the House of Representatives. What could be better than to have a body of ten men joined in a co-operative saw-milling business at Rabaul, which is subject to our control under the mandate to supply the timber necessary for the construction of soldiers&#39; homes. At the rate at which the work is proceeding at present we shall probably be constructing these homes for the next ten years. I am credibly informed that there is very valuable timber in the new territory to which I have referred, which should be utilized in the construction of soldiers&#39; homes. </para>

                        <para>- If the new clause is agreed to, the proposed cooperative concern might easily be financed out of the gratuity money. It would be quite impossible for one or two men to undertake the timber industry in Rabaul, for instance, owing to the distance, the obstacles in the way, the difficulty of getting shipping, and the fact that they would have to fight the Timber Combine and the Shipping Ring: Those considerations would be enough to frighten out men i with a lot of capital, and would certainly frighten out a few soldiers. But let a few soldiers form a co-operative concern with their own. capital, such as their war gratuity money, and be backed up by the Minister, because the Minister&#39;s approval is necessary, with a guarantee from the Government of shipping for the material they produce, and see what will happen. My mind is running particularly on the new Possessions in the Pacific. I can imagine ten men going there with a few thousand pounds worth of machinery and beginning operations with all the native labour available. </para>

                        <para>- At the time 1 speak of it could be purchased in Sydney at about 9s. per 100 super., and it is now about 90s. I recognise that there is now a greater scarcity of timber, and greater cost of material and labour, but the real trouble is the existence of a timber combine which has the whole of the timber business of the world in its hands. The best way to fight that Combine would be with the same men as fought for ail our other industries. I would not confine them to the new territories. They could exploit the forests of Australia. Then let us turn from timber to coal. We know how enormous and far-reaching are the coal deposits of Australia, and with our increased and increasing population there is ample room for taking the Coal Combine out of the hands of a few coal kings who control it now. The soldiers could do that, if permitted by this measure, supported by the Minister, and encouraged by the Government. We could follow cooperation in many other directions, but I know this Government&#39; has no intention to. do it. They will not even allow a clause to be included in this Bill to permit other Governments to do it. </para>

                        <para>- I heard one of the shrewdest business men it was ever my lot to listen to, speaking of an enterprise they were trying to persuade him to go into, say to his son, &#34;Don&#39;t go into that, pioneers nearly always go down. It will be successful, but not by those who take it up first.&#34; The failures of the past should never be used as a reason why a thing should not be a success eventually. The failure of cooperation twenty years ago may have been due to the management of that particular concern., . or to the conditions under which it operated, or to its members themselves. So far as co-operation among the soldiers is concerned, even if it costs us money, it would be money admirably spent if we assisted parties of soldiers to erect saw-mills or embark in other desirable undertakings. When the men went away to fight, nobody grumbled about paying them their wages while they were engaged in the work of destruction. The only thing that prevented them being paid a better wage was the fact that the concern was so enormous that it could not be done. But if they could be maintained, clothed, fed, and equipped for years for that purpose, what is, wrong, now that they are back, with saying to them, &#34;We engaged you to go and fight, and maintained you; you gave us intense satisfaction while you were fighting, and we shall never cease to admire your splendid performances. Now that you are back, and want to form co-operative enterprises, we are not going to stop at a shilling or two.&#34; That would not be an over-generous thing for the people of Australia to say, nor would it be too much to expect the Minister to welcome a claim of that kind. </para>

                        <para>-I know the distinction that is made on the other side. It is not wet-nursing them when they are employed to fight for other people&#39;s interests, but it is wet-nursing them to help them to fight in their own interests. If it is to the benefit of the people represented opposite, it is the soldier&#39;s duty to do it, but if it is for the soldier&#39;s benefit, we immediately hear the cry, &#34;We cannot wet-nurse them; we cannot support them.&#34; Honorable senators opposite will take very fine care that they would not support the soldiers. The world is moving towards co-operation. Why, then, should we not follow the lead of another place by saying that if the soldiers want to move with the times we will help them instead of retarding them ? I do not claim that it is a generous thing to do. It is merely common-sense and our common duty. If the Minister does not approve of an enterprise, his &#34; no &#34; puts an end to any scheme that he thinks unsatisfactory.  His  &#34;yes&#34; will give effect to any scheme that he thinks will be a success. I am not afraid either of the business capacity of the soldiers or of the failures, because they would he so few. Throughout Australia at the present time there are opportunities simply waiting to be picked up, waiting for organized brains to use the potentialities of this country for making good money out of them. I heard a soldier discussing with a few of his mates a proposal for cooperatively tilling unused lands - that is, to enter into arrangements with the holders of lands to lease them to grow wheat, oats, potatoes, and all those things of which the community is so badly in need. He had an excellent scheme for sending advance agents round to secure land in certain districts. When they secured sufficient land in one district, he proposed to arrange with the manufacturers of machinery to send certain classes of machines there, and then the tilling of the land would go on. They would move from place to place, not looking to purchase land, but merely making arrangements to use the lands lying idle to-day in the rich districts, and used only to graze a few head of stock but capable of producing much more money if put under intense cultivation. A scheme of that kind would be of immense value to Australia at this juncture. In these soldiers we have the men who can carry it out. We know what they have done. The men who learned to handle big guns would soon learn to handle big ploughs and harvesting machinery. With all these possibilities for the employment of soldiers in co-operative societies, why jib at this proposal ? I know the Committee will reject it, because the Minister asks them to do so. At the same time we could think of nothing better to benefit the soldiers, and if the Government would adopt it, and take a supervising interest in it, and give the soldiers sufficient encouragement to start cooperative businesses, there is no saying where it would end. I believe that in his heart <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> thinks the same, because he said, &#34; We cannot do this for the men who have to be repatriated, and refuse it to those who are already back in their employments.&#34; He can see the success that the scheme would be when it started. Men already working at something else would begin to look for something better in the way of cooperative enterprise. It is because I am looking for better times for co-operative enterprises, which would remove many of the grievances that we are suffering under to-day, that I favour accepting the amendment of another place. There is huge scope for splendid effort on behalf of the soldiers, and for that reason I shall vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I was surprised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> remarks. It is rather amusing to find that- in one place the Government agree to a clause being put into a Bill, while in another place the Minister representing the same party, with the same views and aspirations, asks that the clause shall be thrown out of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> advanced the reason that it was almost impracticable because of certain ventures brought under his notice, which, in his opinion, were rotten. He said that those who brought them under his notice so urgently were local people with an axe to grind, who wanted to utilize the Government to finance them, but would not put any capital in themselves. A large number of men have been trained, or are being trained, in various technical schools. There are over 600 going through vocational training at the Working Men&#39;s College, with which I have been connected for the last eighteen years.&#39; Some of them said to me, &#34; When we have learnt all we can learn we have to seek private employment, or do something else if we cannot get it. Why cannot the Government give us an opportunity to co-operate, for the purpose of establishing industries .with the knowledge we have gained, so that we can sell our goods after making them, instead of working for somebody else.&#34; A very strong case was put before me in which the men had shown their capabilities. There is every safeguard in this provision, because the Minister, upon advice, would himself determine whether an industry should be established or not. There can be no such thing as men not properly fitted for the work undertaking to form a co-operative society and being able to demand assistance from the Government. I am sure that those in another place who agreed to the clause being put in the Bill saw that that was so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell</inline> interjected when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was speaking, &#34; We do not want, to wet-nurse the soldiers all the time.&#34; That is a thing that should not be said in this Chamber or outside it. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is one which the other branch of the Legislature has decided in the light of just as much information as we ourselves possess. We recognise that these men should be afforded every chance of getting back into civil life. I have in my mind the case of some returned soldiers who would have established a new industry here had they possessed the necessary capital.  They  applied to the Repatriation Department for assistance, but it was refused them. Had they been supported as they should have been, they would to-day have been producing goods and sell.ng them direct to the public. Are not these men entitled to be trusted? A little while ago they were intrusted with a very great deal more than the few paltry pounds that are involved here. They were then intrusted with the preservation of the liberties of the Empire. </para>

                    <para>. - It is rather amusing - and I am sure it puts the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> in a very peculiar position - to hear honorable senators opposite affirm that we ought blindly to. accept whatever amendments the other House may choose to insert in the Bill. This is, indeed, a new <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> for the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> to assume. Upon many occasions they have found very serious fault with the Government for agreeing with the legislative proposals which originated in another place. They have repeatedly urged, when Bills come up here, that the Government expect us to slavishly adhere to the decisions of the other Chamber. To-day, however, their attitude is of quite a different character. The very circumstance that honorable senators upon this side of the chamber are opposing the insertion of the proposed new clause shows how absolutely inaccurate is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker&#39;s</inline> statement. The honorable senator posed as the censor of a gentleman who has taken part in more than one war, merely because he remarked that our soldiers should not be wet-nursed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not pose as a martyr. I am perfectly at liberty to oppose any proposal which may be brought forward by Ministers, and that is a glorious position for any senator to occupy. In assigning reasons why the clause should not be inserted the Minister said that there was a great probability of unworthy enterprises being foisted upon returned soldiers. To vest the Minister with the right of veto in such matters would be to place him in a very unenviable position. He has himself stated that he does not feel competent to decide whether soldiers should be assisted to establish on a co-operative basis such&#39; industries as saw-milling and the working of a coal mine. No Minister is competent to decide whether a body of men ought to be assisted to engage in such enterprises. It would be necessary to appoint a board of experts to deal with these matters. We all recognise that individually and collectively soldiers have entered into various businesses since their return to Australia. We know, too, that they have not all been successful. If soldiers who enter into co-operative enterprises are to be permitted to draw upon the Government whenever they sustain a loss, it follows that the Government will always be obliged to see them through their undertakings. Otherwise, it will be said that if the Commonwealth had stood behind them they would have succeeded. Only a few days ago we dealt with another Bill which provided that returned soldiers may start cooperative concerns for themselves. The soldiers asked for that consideration, but they have not asked for the proposal which is embodied in this new clause. The War Gratuity Bill provides that the Government will stand behind a returned soldier when he puts his gratuity into a cooperative concern. Parliament has also enacted that nurses, doctors and others may put their allowances for war service homes into co-operative enterprises. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> that nothing is too good for our returned soldiers, although he and his friends did not always say that. At the same time, we have a right to see that we do not lead our soldiers into a trap or encourage unscrupulous persons outside to do so. I have no doubt that the Committee will follow the advice of the Minister and reject the clause. From reading the remarks of its author, I know perfectly well what he had in his mind. He had chiefly in view co-operative enterprises associated with primary production. But now it is suggested that these enterprises may cover anything from the purchase of a coal mine to the running of a fleet of ships. Suppose that the Minister had asked for (power to purchase half-a-dozen  vessels for the purpose of strike-breaking. Would my honorable friends opposite have applauded that proposal? </para>

Suppose that our returned&#39; men were to&#39; start a co-operative concern for the purpose of building soldiers&#39; homes. Would my friends opposite like that?

                    <para>. - I was rather amused at the outset of the honorable senator&#39;s remarks. He appeared <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> expand his chest and strike an independent attitude. But there are forty-four amendments to the Repatriation Bill, and I find he is so independent that up to the present he has followed the Minister in accepting every one. In regard to this amendment he now tells us that ho is opposing its acceptance because he is not bound or shackled to the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- He knows the danger they constitute to vested interests, to the exploiters and profiteers of this country. The amendment says nothing at all about the Government providing a huge sum of money with which to establish a coal mine or any other enterprise. It merely asks that the Commission shall have power, with the consent of the Minister, to assist soldiers. They may decide to invest some of their gratuity money in these concerns on a cooperative basis, and the Minister, by moving to disagree with the House of Representatives&#39; amendment, wants to refuse them this assistance. Of course, this is the policy of his party. They won the election on it. It is the policy of the people who were opposed to all co-operative enterprises calculated to injure, in any way, those who are associated with private concerns and Combines that are supporting this Government and members on the Ministerial benches. Naturally they want no cooperative enterprises to interfere with their businesses. Let us, however, imagine the establishment of a co-operative shipping enterprise trading between Tasmania and the mainland. Is it likely that men engaged in such a business would strike against themselves? How many ships would they require to maintain regular communication between Tasmania and the mainland? And then; if they were successful, they could go further afield and establish communication with New Zealand. There is, in fact, almost unlimited scope for a well organized co-operative shipping concern. </para>

I congratulate honorable members of another place upon having inserted this provision in the Bill, as the amendment  is calculated to materially benefit, not only our returned soldiers, but  the  whole community; though I can quite understand why the Minister should oppose it. He has always been the representative of the big institutions and the big Combines of this country. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a phase of cooperation with Which I have had no experience. All my- life. I have been connected with co-operative enterprises. I can quite understand any body of &#39;men advocating Government control of these concerns; but I do not know whether this would be a wise policy. I cannot see how we could justify our action, by voting for the amendment made by the House of Representatives, asking the Government to find money which some other people would have the right to spend as they think fit. The principle of co-operation has been in operation for the better part of a century, and very many such institutions may be numbered as amongst the most successful enterprises in the civilized world. But I point out  that  the money invested in them belongs to those who are actively associated with such concerns. I am not so sure that they would be as successful if the money provided were spent by somebody else in a haphazard manner, as might happen under this amendment. In my opinion, the Government are doing almost everything that is humanly possible for our returned soldiers, and they should not now be asked to find money for co-operative concerns, as contemplated in the amendment, because ventures of this kind are bound to fail, owing to the absence of that incentive to success, namely, the investment in them of one&#39;s own capital. In this case, the money will be simply doled out by the Government to people who would experiment with it. Co-operation, if it means anything, means the co-operation of the whole. If a man wants to be co-operator, he must be prepared to co-operate with that which he possesses. Unless a man&#39;s interests are definitely associated with these enterprises, he cannot argue very forcibly in favour of them, nor will he be very successful in the business. The cooperative societies established in New South Wales have, for the most part, been very successful. But some have failed. Practically the whole of the co-operative undertakings,- with the exception of those in Western Australia, where the members of certain timber concerns took the opportunity <inline font-style="italic">;.</inline> selling out when they had a suitable opportunity, have failed. Those in operation in Western Australia were, however, successful; and if We desire the soldiers to succeed we should allow them to. work out their own salvation under the provision embodied in the War Gratuity Bill. If they are anxious to conduct businesses, all they need do is to co-operate, pool their gratuities, and follow in the footsteps of out successful pioneers. During their . travels abroad many of &#39;our soldiers must have had an opportunity of inspecting the industrial undertakings which, in times of peace, were hives of industry, but which, during the war period, unfortunately were at a standstill. Industries of this kind have been, and are . still being, successfully handled by men whose life interests are sunk in them, and whose capital has been the means of building them. up. I therefore intend supporting the Minister, in opposing this amendment, because if the soldiers are prepared, to work on a cooperative basis they have the opportunity of doing so under the provisions  of the War Gratuity Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators have apparently overlooked the fact that no machinery is provided in the Bill for giving effect to the proposed new clause. If the amendment is agreed to we shall be enacting something, entirely foreign to the spirit of the measure. This is not a Bill in which such a clause should be inserted, and if we adopt it we shall be making a grave mistake. Provision has already been made in the War Gratuity Bill for something of this character, and the authorities responsible for the administration of that Act will have the opportunity of giving their careful attention, to that portion of the measure. But under a Repatriation Bill it is unreasonable to give the Commissioners power to control, or even direct, a number of undertakings; and if the proposal is adopted it will certainly lead to considerable inconvenience and probably disorganization. </para>

Here in this city, and in the city from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> comes, action was taken that was entirely antagonistic to the principle now advocated. Do honorable senators opposite recall  that it was in April, 1918, when Haig delivered his celebrated message to the effect that our men had their backs to the wall, and that no man should give way? Who was it who then applauded the soldier? Who were the members of organizations that supported resolutions to the effect that there was no possibility of victory for the Allies, and that Great Britain should retire from the conflict? </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators on this side have been charged with acting in an unfriendly way towards the soldiers, because we are not supporting the insertion of the proposed new clause. It has been said that we are devoid of sincerity. Can honorable senators opposite say that they are sincere in their desire to assist the soldiers, when they have refused to assist the recruiting movement, at a time when the Germans were within 40 miles of Paris ? Where were honorable senators then ? It was at that critical stage in our history that they said that victory was impossible. We said that victory was possible, and we stood by the soldiers then and have done so ever since. But, because we do not favour the insertion of the proposed clause, it does not prove that we are not desirous of assisting our ex-fighting men. We have always been the friend of the soldiers, but I decline to assist in including this clause in the Bill, because I do not think it is its proper place. However, if it is included, no machinery has been provided for giving effect to it. If such a provision is necessary, why not introduce a separate Bill to enable soldiers to start co-operative concerns. Such a provision should not be inserted in a Repatriation Bill, when the money has to be found by the Government and not by the soldier, and there is a vast difference between using public money and money belonging to the soldiers. If a separate Bill were submitted, there would be more strength in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> arguments in asking the Government to assist. This is not a question of assisting, but of doing everything, which is quite a different proposition. We are charged with being fettered- </para>

                    <para>.- I feel it is my duty to reply to the attack that has been made on my party by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline> So far as words go, I do not think I have ever accused the honorable senator of being unfriendly towards the soldier. He has been continually repeating the fact that he is the soldiers&#39; friend for three years, but when an opportunity comes for him to do anything he always shirks his responsibility. The honorable senator has been endeavouring to prove, &#39;by reading quotations, that the record of our party is altogether unfavorable,&#39; but he must remember that we were responsible for passing legislation that has been of great advantage to our soldiers. We are now asking the Government to go further and do something in the interests of a few soldiers. This clause merely provides that assistance shall be given in certain directions, if the Minister approves, and these so-called friends of the soldiers are opposing it. If the Minister is willing to approve of assistance being given in this direction, why should the Committee object? </para>

                        <para>- They could be started without any delay. Half-a-dozen men would soon start a co-operative business if they could be assured that they would be assisted - I do not say with moneys of the Repatriation Department, but with their own moneys - and once they got together they could go on with their 00-operative concern. Honorable senators will say that they could do this without this clause, and while that is true, they could do it very much better with the advantage of this clause. They could do it so much better that honorable members in another place said that the provision should be inserted in this Bill, and they gave the Minister for Repatriation the right to refuse or to accept any proposal made under it. I am satisfied that if any proposition was submitted in connexion with which returned soldiers were likely to lose money the Minister would not agree to it.  If any particular proposal could not be shown to be on a sound business footing it would be immediately turned down. We are asked to insert a provision which can be taken advantage of only on the initiative of the soldiers themselves. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators opposite refuse to agree to the amendment of the House of Representatives, and yet Senators Senior and Newland stand up and parade their support of the returned soldiers. I say that so far as their professions of support ##&#38;&#114;©## concerned I have to accept them, because I have heard them say a hundred times that they are interested and enthusiastic supporters of the returned soldiers. But I am forced to a different opinion of them when I find them refusing to agree to any nro.posal that would benefit the returned soldiers. I know their professions as to what they dick when the war was on, and what somebody else did not do, and what they thought of persons who spoke in a way that did not please them. </para>

                        <para>- No ; honorable senators are the &#34;its,&#34; but still the fact remains that whilst before the elections they had a majority of fifty-four, the Government now lives by the grace of the members of two other parties in Parliament. So far as the party on this side is concerned we increased our numbers in the House that makes and unmakes Governments, whilst the party opposite is dependent for their majority on the Country party or the Labour party, and cannot carry on without that assistance. </para>

                        <para>- The members of our party were cheated out of their positions here by an Act which swindled them out of the right to have the votes recorded for them counted. In the last two elections there was not a difference of 2,000 votes between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and myself, but at the last election, because all the votes counted were not recorded, there was a difference of 100,000 votes between us. Every one knows that that is not a true index of the way in which the people voted. If all the votes recorded for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> were counted, it is possible that he would be here instead of myself. </para>

The House of Representatives has proposed the insertion of the provision which can only be brought into force on the initiative of the soldiers, and which is controlled by the Minister for Repatriation.

                <para class="block">The amendment made by the House of Representatives does not, in effect, alter the Schedule under the existing law, but sets out the various degrees of disability in greater particularity. The Schedule adopted by the British Parliament deals with a vast number of forms, in which men are maimed, and provides a special  rate for each.. The practice adopted here is to group the forms of disability under certain main headings. This is thought desirable, and the soldiers themselves prefer to have the injury set out with the special rate of pension payable in respect thereof. I move - </para>

                        <para>. - This is another piece of that finicky legislation introduced by the Government which exercised under the War Precautions Act powers which the War Precautions Act never conceded to them, but which they assumed to themselves. I look upon this measure as one of the small things that do not matter much. &#34;While a Government like this is in office, it scarcely matters whether it has taken power by legislation or whether it exercises it at its own discretion. The system of passports proposed in this Bill appears to me to be simply an attempt&#34; to interfere with the travelling community, and to harass and annoy people as much as possible by insisting that they shall come to a Government Department before they may have permission to leave this country. There are quite a number of people that I would hurry out of Australia without making them ask for permission to leave. I think we will have a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> This is merely part and parcel of the sort of legislation of which the Government seem so fond, costing a good deal to administer, adding considerably to the irritation of the community, and benefiting no one in particular. For years one could leave this country without a passport. If the Government wish to regulate the travelling community by means of passports, they should see that there is no difficulty in getting them. Sydney is the chief city of Australia, easily first in wealth, population and importance, yet a citizen .of Sydney who wants to travel has to wait until Melbourne is communicated with. A Bill which continues such a system is not worthy of the consideration of the Senate. We can get on very well without all this class of legislation. It is not satisfactory, and it stops no one going outside this country who really wants to go. If I desire to get out of Australia without a passport I can do so. &#34;We have had cases where men have gone without passports, and also other cases where passports have been issued very expeditiously, even when the Government did not want them to be issued. The Bill is in accord with the legislation for which the Government are becoming famous or infamous, legislation that aims at interfering with private persons, legislation that wants to bring everything under the control of Departments, and enable the Government to interfere by one means or another where Government interference is of no value and no benefit. As this Bill is part and parcel of that sort of thing, I will not detain honorable senators by discussing it. The Government have introduced it, and can pass it, as I have no doubt they will. I shall call for a division against it. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is evidently under a misapprehension as to the objects of the Bill. He says people can leave Australia without passports. That is quite true, but they cannot get into other countries without passports. This is a Bill to facilitate travelling. All sorts of people are exempt, such&#34;, for instance, as any member of the Naval or Military Forces leaving the Commonwealth on duty, any member of the crew of an oversea vessel, any member of the crew of any vessel who signs on in Australia for  an oversea voyage, any person visiting New Zealand, or returning to New Zealand, Papua, Norfolk Island, &#38;c. On other people there is no restriction beyond the securing of a simple passport prior to leaving the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>That document will facilitate travelling in other parts of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> might be able to obtain facilities for travelling when he reached England, but it would be foolish to permit people to leave Australia for other parts of the world, as probably thousands will be doing shortly, to see the graves of their boys or for other purposes, without taking with them from Australia a certificate that they are reputable citizens of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to a case that arose some time ago in connexion with the issue of a passport, and to ask him for some assurance that what happened, then is not going to be the practice of the Department. In that case the passport was applied for and granted, and the person who received it travelled as far as Fremantle. Then, on account of certain private circumstances that arose, the Department cancelled the passport, and the holder was pulled off the boat and left at Fremantle. On account of the delicacy of the case I shall not quote any names; but is it the intention of the Government, having once satisfied themselves of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of an applicant, and issued a passport, if circumstances arise which are altogether outside of </para>

                        <para>. - This clause imposes on all persons leaving the Commonwealth, with specified exceptions, the obligation to secure passports. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to a matter regarding which I should like to have further information from the Minister. Is it unavoidable that the passport administration should be centralized in Melbourne ? I know instances where people from Tasmania desired to travel beyond the Commonwealth. Their port of embarkation from the Commonwealth was Sydney, as they were going across the- Pacific or northward to ports in Asia. Before they  could get their passports they had to be in Sydney. I know cases where they left Tasmania, and were due to arrive in Sydney a little before -the oversea boat was to leave, and the interval between their arrival and proposed departure was a holiday. It is very inconvenient for well-known and reputable inhabitants of Hobart to find themselves unable to get their passport because the office in Sydney is closed. Could not some arrangement be made whereby in the different States those intending to travel could get their passports before they left their regular home ? It will .be most awkward . if people have to come from Western Australia or </para>

Some arrangement might very well be made whereby intending travellers, before leaving their homes, should be given an assurance that they will receive their passports in due course. In one case that I have in my mind, an intending traveller was apprised of the possibility that upon his arrival in Sydney he would be unable to obtain his passport. He communicated with me, and I suggested to the authorities here that the passport might be issued and forwarded to him in Tasmania through certain Commonwealth officers. The authorities found themselves unable to adopt my suggestion, but consented to make special arrangements to meet this particular case. I do not know what would have happened to this traveller had he not taken the precaution to communicate with me prior to leaving his home in Tasmania. If we are going to impose upon the public the obligation to obtain passports we should certainly facilitate the issue of those passports, and we ought not to compel intending travellers to visit a particular centre with no assurance that upon their arrival there they will receive them. </para>

The trouble which has been outlined by the honorable senator was due to special circumstances. During the war period the Intelligence Department was centralized at the Defence Head-quarters in Melbourne. But under this Rill it is intended to vest in the Customs Officers of each State full authority to administer it under a civil Department instead of as part of a military organization. </para>

                        <para>.- Under this Bill a departmental officer will be clothed with altogether too much power. One clause in it seeks to authorize him to cancel a passport which has been issued. I have been called upon quite a number of times to intervene in order to enable intending travellers to get away by; certain oversea vessels. That sort of thing ought not to obtain. The humblest citizen of the Commonwealth is either entitled to a passport or he is not. If a passport will not be issued to him, it is undesirable that a member of Parliament should be called upon to exert his influence to enable him to get it. I have no complaint against the departmental officers as such. I have always found them extremely obliging and willing to assist travellers in every possible way. But I object to the system which the Bill seeks to introduce. The Government are introducing measure after measure in which provision is made to clothe different persons with powers which they ought not to be permitted to exercise. Yet no protest is made. Of course, a Justice of the High Court will protest when he sees the Government attempting to set aside the Arbitration Court in favour of a Commission, which has yet to be constituted; But nobody else protests. This tendency to concentrate power in the hands of individuals is a vicious one, which requires to be checked. </para>

Such powers always are. But I am not, disposed to acquiesce in any legislation which will confer such far-reaching power on any Commonwealth officer. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable senators are prepared to accept that explanation, why not appoint officers with  power to do anything ? What if the head of the Government issued a passport to a particular individual, and a departmental officer who imagined that he had not received from the intending passenger that degree of respect to which he thought himself entitled took it upon himself to cancel the passport? The whole position is full of danger. I have nothing to urge against departmental officers, but I do object to giving them powers the exercise of which may considerably embarrass the travelling public. </para>

                        <para>.- I appreciate the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> Under this clause there is nothing to prevent a passport from being cancelled without sufficient reason, with the result that grave loss and inconvenience may be sustained by an. intending traveller. Seeing that a fair time must elapse between the period when a passport is applied for and the departure of the vessel by which the applicant will travel, surely there is ample opportunity for the Department to conduct the necessary inquiries. I am quite in sympathy with the action taken by the Government in the case to which I previously referred, and I merely desired to obtain from the Minister an authoritative statement as to the principle which is followed. </para>

                        <para>. -  To me it seems strange that it should be suggested that the Commonwealth should not have power to cancel a passport which has been obtained by means of false representations. Suppose, for example, that a warrant has been issued for the arrest of a man who, under an assumed name, has obtained a passport and is fleeing from the Commonwealth. Ought we not to possess the power to cancel his passport? I admit that if this provision were applied to the ordinary citizen, it would operate harshly. But no honest man has anything to fear from legislation of this kind. The power conferred by the clause is not likely to be abused. Tricks are frequently played by travellers by means of an exchange of passports, and the clause is intended to prevent that sort of thing. </para>

                        <para>. -  I object to vesting in Government officers powers which should be wielded only by Courts of Justice. This clause seeks  to  clothe Government officials with power to cancel passports without setting forth the conditions under which the power shall be exercised. If it provided that the passport of a person who had obtained it by means of misrepresentation could be cancelled, I would not object. If any responsible officer exercised the power or cancellation under such circumstances, the individual concerned would have no claim against him. But if an officer compelled a passenger to leave  a  vessel just as she was about to depart from an Australian port, and thus held him up to public ridicule, that officer could go into Court and plead this clause as  a  justification for his conduct. I quite agree with the necessity for dealing with persons who have obtained passports by means of fraud or misrepresentation, but I would deal with them by law. Unless there are legal grounds for action, the Government have no right to interfere with them. </para>

                            <para>- But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> quoted a case of mistaken identity, in which a departmental officer would have authority to cancel a permit. Surely the Government are not going to issue permits which may be cancelled by a subordinate! Let me remind honorable senators of what happened in the case  of  Georgeson,  who was ill, and, acting on medical advice, applied for a passport to go to New Zealand, where he could get beneficial treatment for his particular ailment. The Federal Government, in no way concerned with the legal aspects of the case - because there was no charge against the man - declined to issue a permit. That was an outrage. They may claim, of course, that public opinion will be with them; but in certain circumstances I would not caTe very much about public opinion. If a man is at liberty, and has no charges pending against him, it is wrong in principle to interfere with his liberty in any way. </para>

                            <para>- A Royal Commission was appointed to make the inquiry, and the Commissioner indicated that he could not come to a final decision until he had obtained evidence from Georgeson. But there was no statement about suspicion, nor was there any doubt about the man&#39;s physical condition. . I do not know if the Government were requested to withhold a permit from Georgeson, but he was not able to get one, and, therefore, could not leave Australia. If there was any suspicion against a man I could understand the Government taking thi3 precaution; but I object to power being vested in any one to interfere with the liberty of any person against whom there is no charge. I stand for the liberty of the individual, and regret to notice a gradual invasion of this principle in recent legislation. If action is to be taken against any person, the proper legal course  should  be followed; and if there is a desire to prevent his departure from the Commonwealth, the necessary bail should be asked for. </para>

                            <para>- And that is the point which I would like the Minister to look into more closely. When action is taken against any man, a certain amount of hardship is unavoidable; but in the case cited by the Minister, the man concerned would be in the happy position of knowing that he would come before a Court of law for trial. The position under this clause is different. If, for instance, I joined &#39; a vessel in Sydney for Ceylon, and something happened, a departmental officer would have&#39; authority, in the presence of all the passengers, to take my passport from me, and I would have no redress. I would be practically &#34; drummed &#34; off the ship in full view of everybody, and degraded before the whole community. It is an entirely wrong principle to give any person authority to interfere with passports issued by the Government, and. so I shall oppose the clause. </para>

                            <para>- We would be helpless in the matter. If they had not reached the last port of call in Australia they could be recalled by wireless. When once an absconding debtor, for instance, is beyond the 3-mile limit, we have no control over him. The provisions of this Bill will not affect the ordinary citizen, and it will be a means of protecting innocent persons. If certain persons propose leaving Australia when they have no right to do so, we have under this Bill the power to withhold or cancel their passports and compel them to submit to a proper trial. </para>

                    <para>. -I now bring up the reasons prepared by the Committee appointed in reference to the action of the Senate in disagreeing to the suggested amendments, Nos. 4 and 30, made by the House of Representatives in the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Bill. They are as follows: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>As to amendment No.  4.  - Because the term of three years is calculated to restrict the Government&#39;s choice in the matter of appointments to the Commission, and that, furthermore, it is not sufficiently long to secure continuity in administration, and a desirable independence of action on the part of the Commissioners. </para>
                <para>As to amendment No.  30. - </para>
                <para>Because it is not considered equitable to extend to collective bodies of soldiers benefits for which individual soldiers might not beeligible. </para>
                <para>Because the effect of the granting of the benefits contemplated by the amendment would result in the unsettlement of the large majority of men whose re-establishment  in  civil life has bees  already  accomplished. </para>
                <para>Because grave financial loss to the Government, and disappointment to bodies of men may result from the starting of enterprises which may not prove successful. </para>
                <para class="block">Because if it is desirable to promote enterprises by means of Government advances, the proposals should bethe subject of special legislation in which provision  would  be made for the creation of the  proper  machinery to give effect to such policy. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am wondering whether we ought to. agree to the reasons submitted by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen).</inline> Honorable senators opposite, of course, agree; but objections from those on this side should be recorded. When a Royal Commission submits its report, Commissioners dissenting are permitted to record their objections, and I think honorable senators on this side should be permitted to do so in this instance. Personally, I think the objections are enlarged somewhat unduly, and could have been submitted in a more concise manner. I therefore content myself by protesting against them as being unsound, hurriedly drawn up, ill-considered, and of very little use when submitted to the giants in another place. </para>
