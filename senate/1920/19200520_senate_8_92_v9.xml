                            <para>- The answer is-  1 and 2. To be eligible  for  leave or payment  in  lieu thereof under Australian Military Regulation 409,  it is  necessary that  an  applicant who has under  twenty years'  continuous  service  should have attained the age for retirement on,  or  prior to,  his  discharge or retirement. Members of the Permanent Forces who have not attained the age for retirement on, or prior to, their discharge or retirement, are therefore not eligible under the provisions of Australian Military Regulation 409. </para>

                    <para>. - My intention and purpose having been sufficiently disclosed during the discussion in Committee last night, it is not necessary for me to give any further reasons for submitting this amendment. The agreement, as a whole, is to me valuable, and particularly so because I believe that it will provide an incentive to the development of known oil resources which, up to the present, exclusively consist of shale-oil deposits. The Commonwealth is under an obligation, if it considers the development of the Australian oil resources essential, to do everything in its  power to substitute native oil for the 200,000 tons of imported oil. To a very considerable extent this opportunity exists, and I submit the amendment for the purpose of defining the position, and not only because I recognise that the Commonwealth Government, if it fully comprehends its duty, will endeavour to substitute native oil, from whatever source, for imported oil. Despite any controversy there may be concerning the interpretation of the word "indigenous," I desire to place it beyond all doubt that shale oil available in the Commonwealth must be refined in substitution for imported oil. One of the reasons that will cause criticism to be directed at this measure will be that its incidence may be considered to preclude the development of Australian shale-oil deposits, and, that being so, it is my duty to see that the essential value of the Bill is demonstrated by properly securing that supplies of shale oil shall be offered to, and accepted by, the Refinery Company. If mineral oil produced from shale is unobjectionable, then my amendment is unobjectionable. If there is any technical difficulty in the way to prevent the development of Australian shale-oil deposits, that difficulty should be disclosed, because it will show that the Refinery Company, in its possible preference for imported oil, may seriously militate against the development of our shale-oil deposits. If there is no difficulty in the way, there can be no reason for not agreeing to my amendment. I have merely asked for the deletion of the word " obtained," with a view of inserting in lieu thereof the words "which has been produced from shale or any other source." That determines conclusively the fact that shale oil, or oil produced from shale, if offered to the Refinery Company must be refined with the assistance of its best technical knowledge. If the company is placed in a position to. say that shale oil is something quite out of the way, that it is not going to refine it, and we are to be put under an obligation, we should know exactly where we are. If there is anything in this agreement that has not been disclosed, and that will prevent the development of the shale-oil deposits in Australia, I want to know what it is. We should know that if, as a result of its operations, or the operations of different States, the company is offered 200,000 tons or less of Australian crude mineral shale oil, that oil must be taken in substitution for an equal quantity of imported oil. Honorable senators understand exactly what I mean, and without labouring the question I ask the Committee to agree to my amendment. </para>

                        has argued that shale oil is excluded, and, as a matter of fact, it is excluded under that term, but is embodied in the term " indigenous oil." "We do not need to insert the proposed amendment, as it is quite unnecessary.  I  asked that progress be reported last night as, on the spur of the moment, I did not feel competent to express an opinion on a technical point. I was anxious to consult the Crown Law officers who were responsible for drafting the agreement, and also the representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The representative of the company stated -

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will look at paragraph li, he will see where indigenous oil and crude mineral oil are to be supplied by the Commonwealth to the Refinery Company at a certain price. When, in the agreement itself, there is apparently a distinction  between indigenous and crude oil, what is the objection to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> which is aimed to provide a clear definition ? I understand that one of the main reasons why the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, which commenced operations several years ago in the neighbourhood of Lithgow, lost a large sum of money in its unsuccessful enterprise was that the machinery which it had installed was not suitable for dealing with the rich shale existing in that locality. Is it not likely that the Anglo-Persian Company, when the refinery is i erected, may instal machinery quite suited to- the refining of crude oil from the Persian fields, but which may not be capable of dealing with the deposits that we hope to see discovered in Tasmania, New South Wales, and other parts of the Commonwealth ? Instead of aiming first to develop the oil resources of the Commonwealth, thi6 company may naturally prefer to erect machinery capable of dealing with the product of which it has complete knowledge, and it may not be so desirous of refining .any crude oil which may be obtained in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will not resist the amendment, or that if he does, it will only be on the ground that he thinks the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> can be better expressed. Honorable senators can all .agree with the Minister and with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, and anybody else, who may state that the oil referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is indigenous. There is no doubt that it is, in the ordinary acceptation of that term. It is mineral also. But we are not dealing with the ordinary acceptation - tha dictionary meaning - of the word "indigenous." This is a paragraph having to do with the matter of definition, and we are saying, &gt; for the purpose of this agreement, what the term " indigenous " shall mean. We are not relying on&gt; the original meaning. We are giving a meaning to the term, and adopting that meaning, for the purposes of this agreement ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> rightly claims that we are limiting the meaning to crude mineral oil. </para>

                        <para>- If there is any doubt concerning whether or not it comes under this definition, and if the Minister says it does, then he should accept the amendment and so remove all possible doubt. What is the use of referring  honorable senators back to the dictionary meaning ? The statements of the authorities consulted by the Minister are, in effect, that this oil must be indigenous because of the dictionary meaning of the word and not because of the statutory definition which we are to insert. I strongly urge that no doubt shall be left about the matter. </para>

If the strata be permeable, the product is, of course, shale oil, and needs distillation. It appears to me, therefore, that the amendment will merely cloud the issue. </para>

                    <para>. - The only possible objection that can be taken to the amendment is that it is redundant, and in connexion with legal matters* redundancy is not regarded as a fault. In paragraph 3 , of the agreement the letters of the alphabet have been levied upon, and Roman and Arabic numerals employed for the purpose of defining certain things. All I wish to do is to secure the exclusion of one word in paragraph 7 for the purpose of inserting less than a dozen words to make it quite clear that oil derived from shale, if made available to the Refinery Company in any quantity or volume up to 200,000 tons per annum, must be used in substitution for imported oil. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth has ' a self-imposed obligation to substitute any indigenous oil for the imported product, and at present the only known Australian source is shale, which must be retorted to produce any volume of oil. I know that at times shale oil contains certain elements which may be regarded by the technical experts of the Refinery Company as objectionable in comparison with the imported liquid mineral oil, and I want to protect my own country. The British Empire is a great deal to me, and so is the British company but over and above all I have a right to impress upon the minds of honorable senators, if I can, the necessity for protecting this industry for the production of oil from the only known source in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- This agreement has never been before any judicial tribunal and as long as the company, in which the Commonwealth Government will be the predominant partner, works satisfactorily, the document is not likely to come before any arbitrating authority. But I know of no matter contained in the agreement that is more likely to call for review than this technical definition of crude mineral oil to be supplied to the refinery. It is  my desire to protect the interests of my own country against any company, and I shall insist, to the best of my ability, on the insertion of the words. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish this question to go to a vote without stating my position. Had the explanation not been given by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> I should certainly have voted for the amendment, but after listening to the Minister's remarks, I have come to the conclusion that the amendment is not necessary. I admire my honorable friends from Tasmania for the fight they are putting up for the protection of the shale oil industry of that State. I am aware that there are said to be very large shale deposits of great potential value to the Commonwealth in the Latrobe district of Tasmania. But in my own State the development of the shale oil industry has gone much further than in any other part of Australia. Large deposits are being successfully worked in the Lithgow valley, and recently a company started to resuscitate the industry at Murrurundi and Joadja Creek. In a report published yesterday of the Commonwealth Oil Company in Sydney it was stated that the net profits, including bounty, for the six months ending 3rd September was Â£26,000, and that during the period referred to the company retorted  18,000 tons of shale, from which 1,660,000 gallon's of crude oil and naphtha was obtained. Yesterday we were told that the total consumption of the Commonwealth was 52,000,000 gallons per annum, and I think we have every reason to be pleased with the progress of the enterprise referred to; but I shall not vote for the amendment to compel the Refinery Company to accept shale oil at any price, because if we are going to erect a refinery for the purpose of bringing down the price of oil we must not think about raising the price artificially in order to keep the shale oil  industry  going. I feel quite satisfied with the Minister's explanation. My view is that, if shale oil is available in sufficient quantities, and at a reasonable price, the Refinery Company will have to take it. Consequently the shale oil industry is fully protected. </para>

                        <para>- It is only right that we should make this matter so clear as to obviate all possibility of misunderstanding. When we speak of obtaining oil we mean something which is entirely different from extracting oil. I suggest that the paragraph should be made to read - " For the purposes of this agreement the term ' indigenous oil* shall mean and include crude mineral oil obtained in the Commonwealth of Australia or extracted from shale in any Territory of the Commonwealth." The position would then be absolutely clear. I fear that this agreement will strike a death-blow at the production of shale oil throughout Australia. I have been told on the very best authority that the production from the 200,000 tons of crude oil which will be imported by the Refinery Company for refining in the Commonwealth will amount to about  80,000  tons of fuel oil and about 60,0OU tons of petrol. In the latter case the quantity refined here will suffice for only one-half of our actual consumption, whilst in the former it will suffice for double our needs. </para>

                        <para>- The gas companies have been very short of coal lately, but I have not heard that they have used very much of our fuel oil. Certainly they have used a little of our shale. The shale-oil industry in New South Wales, and particularly in Tasmania, depends largely upon the possession of a home market for crude fuel oil. In New South Wales there are very extensive shale deposits. I have here a book containing a very full description of the shale-oil mines working in that State , up to the year 1901. It shows that in an area 200 miles long by 60 miles wide, extending from Murrurundi, in the north, to Clyde, in the south, there are about fifty localities in which torbanite yielding oil and other nitrogenous products very valuable to Australia have been found. Yet we find a professedly Protectionist Government putting before us a proposal which will jeopardize the future of one of the most important of our primary industries. </para>

                        <para>- By the introduction of 200,000 tons annually of a commodity which we do not want, for the purpose of getting another commodity that we do want. I quite agree with the basic idea underlying this agreement, that, as we are large consumers of petrol and kerosene, we should transfer our trade to a, British company. We know that the two big Trusts which are in existence have penalized Australia. Their interests have been set above those of Australia, and we have a right to go to our own people with a view to obtaining from them more cheaply the commodity that we require. But I submit we are going the wrong way to work. If we wish to obtain Persian petrol from a British company, why cannot the Common wealth buy it, and supply it to those who require it ? Why should we risk destroying what would otherwise become a very valuable industry here ? If we have a few more coal strikes we shall have to resort to some other form of fuel. By the introduction of 80,000 tons of fuel oil annually we are going to threaten with utter extinction the shale-oil industry of Australia. </para>

Honorable senators may possibly recollect a remark which was made by the Chief Justice of the High Court the other day, to the effect that obviously Parliament had forgotten to amend a certain Act. We do not want a similar remark to be made concerning this important agreement.

It possesses in that fact a very important reserve power to enforce its will in this regard. In the terms of the honorable senator's- amendment the Commonwealth is not the partner in this company, but the Commonwealth Government. If the Commonwealth Government comes to the conclusion that the prices charged are not fair and reasonable it will call upon the company, of which it is itself the chief shareholder, to reduce the prices to what are fair and reasonable. But that is a question upon which, surely, the company should have some voice, and should be able to put its own case forward..

                        <para>- It would; but I ask honorable senators not. to carry an amendment of the schedule merely for the purpose of painting the lily. The Commonwealth will be in a strong position under this agreement, but it should be borne in mind that the company has some rights, and should have some voice to protect its interests, which, incidentally, will be the interests of the Commonwealth also. The agreement will . be powerfully opposed, but this Refinery Company will be subjected to powerful and continued opposition. Opposition may arise at a time when there may be a Commonwealth Government in power hostile to this company. That is* quite on the cards, and in that case a hostile Government could practically destroy this company by declaring that the prices proposed to be charged for the oil were unfair and unreasonable. There would then be no recourse for the company, as, under the amendment, the Commonwealth Government would be  the  absolute arbiter. On the other hand, the Commonwealth can never be placed in that position under the agreement, because, in the case of a deadlock, it can have recourse to an arbitrator, and may, by reason of its predominating share interest,  exercise  the control required in the interests of the community. It seems to me that the Committee might leave the paragraph as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not opposed to the agreement. I am as desirous as is the Minister that this should be made a useful and perfect measure, but I realize the possibility of danger under this paragraph. If the fixing of the price of the oil were a matter dealt with by the whole company, the contention of the Minister would be right. But this is not a question to be submitted to the shareholders, but a question of administration determined by the director ate, in which the Oil Company will exercise a predominating influence. If they as directors determine that the price of the oil shall be so much, although we hold a majority of the shares, we may have a minority of control on the directorate. Where is the provision in the agreement that will bring a dispute to the position provided elsewhere that it shall be determined by arbitration? If the Minister for Defence can assure us that that point is covered we have a fair safeguard. It has been mentioned by the Minister that an adverse Government may be in power whose object might be to destroy the company by decreasing the price of oil until its production was unprofitable, in which case the Commonwealth Government would lose. </para>

                    <para>. -I take it that this is an agreement between two contracting parties,, and that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> amendment is adopted it will give complete power to the Government of the day to determine what is a fair and reasonable price. It does not require any stretch of imagination to say what would happen when the public was clamouring for a low priced commodity. The wishes of the public would outweigh the desire of the Government to pay a fair and reasonable price, and we would have a Government declaring that oil should  be  sold at  a  price which would not enable the company to carry on its operations profitably. The natural result would be that the work of the company would come to a standstill. If we desire this company to start at all, we cannot expect it to commence operations under such circumstances as the amendment suggests. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> amendment is carried we may as well throw the whole agreement in the waste-paper basket, because no sensible business man would enter into such a contract, particularly when there is a strong desire on the part of the people for cheap commodities. I am certain that a concern such as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would not work under such an agreement, particularly when the Government would have the power of fixing the price. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> said, in effect, that if the company did not declare a high price it would lose money, but how can we weigh that against the natural desire of the Government to meet the clamour for cheap oil? As the Minister for Defence has pointed out, if there is a dispute as to what is a fair and reasonable price the arbitration provision will operate, and the matter will be settled in a straightforward manner. The paragraph as it stands is just, and should have the support of the Committee. </para>

                <para class="block">Committee to the fact that there is another party to be considered. Since I have been a member of this Chamber I have rarely experienced an occasion when I have heard so many detailed criticisms from candid friends outside in connexion with a matter on which we have been called to legislate. By telephone and by letter I have had communications from people, influenced, I suppose, by patriotic or other motives, criticising the Bill, and saying why it should not be passed. This measure is not to create a monopoly, but to break one, and we have to consider that there are two sides to the question. Every labourer is worthy of his hire, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has to receive a fair and reasonable profit. My belief is that, even though it does get a fair and reasonable profit, oil in Australia will be much cheaper, as the result of this agreement, and we are also safeguarded from the grasping monopoly that the people of the Commonwealth have been  ;Suffering  under so long. When once the refinery is operating, and our oil resources are developed, we shall be in a much better position than we are at present. </para>

                    <para>.- I am rather amused at the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> and' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in their criticisms of my effort to make this provision practicable. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator '</inline> Fairbairn stated, my amendment will ruin the whole agreement, what in the name of fortune is the use of the paragraph ? Is it camouflage, deceit, or a smoke screen in the interests of this company. The paragraph provides that the company must sell its products at a fair and reasonable price, and honorable senators object to the Government saying what is fair and reasonable. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> suggested that perhaps a hostile Government might he elected by the people, and that it would insist upon the company selling its products at a price that will ultimately result in the company's ruin. Can we imagine for a moment  the people electing a Government that would ruin an industry ? If honorable senators are opposed to the amendment, and do not wish to protect the consumers of oil, let them strike the paragraph out altogether, and allow the company to charge what it likes. It has been said that we should not allow one party to the agreement to have any special control, and that all decisions should be mutually arrived at. But in paragraph 3 there are no less than five different proposals that can be decided only by the Government. Under those provisions the company trusts the Government to decide what is just, and why cannot it trust the Government to say what is a fair and reasonable price for its products ? I can quite understand that the Minister for Defence is anxious to pass the Bill in the form in which it left another place. </para>

I can quite understand the Minister's attitude, and if I were in his position I would act similarly ; but I cannot understand honorable senator?, who are representatives of the people, taking a similar stand.

                    <para>. - I disagree with the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> concerning the attitude of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Even if tie Minister were anxious to pass the Bill in its present form, that would not influence me in the least. If honorable senators thought that there was any benefit to be gained by amending the schedule, it would be stupid in the extreme to oppose the amendment. It would be unreasonable for the Government to submit a, paragraph to this Chamber, and tell us that all we have to do is to agree to it without an amendment. The Minister for Defence does not take up that attitude, and honorable senators would not, even if the Minister did, as we have the right to make whatever amendments we may consider necessary. What are we asked to do ? To give the Commonwealth Government - whatever Government it may be - the absolute right to fix the price of the product at any figure they desire. Would any intelligent man "come here and take the risk of spending a huge sum of money knowing that a Commonwealth Government might, some day, be prompted to lower the price of the product to any figure desired <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Would any intelligent man conceive that, yielding to popular clamour, or for any other motive, the Federal Government might, at some future date, alter the price in such a manner? It is only a few weeks since another agreement was being considered by this Chamber. I refer to the sugar agreement. Does anyone think that, if the Government could have reduced the price of sugar it would have failed to do so, in face of the outcry which arose from all over the Commonwealth ? We are seeking to establish new industries in Australia. We are looking for more people, and for more work for the people whom we have here. We are seeking the cheapest fuel which can be secured to assist Australian industries. Here is a company prepared to operate in the Commonwealth under this agreement, or under the agreement as it may be reasonably amended. But no company would establish itself in this country if, in addition to the proportion of control held by the Commonwealth authority, the latter also had the power to fix the price, irrespective of what the company might desire. If honorable senators will examine paragraph 22 they will perceive that it makes specific reference to arbitration. By that means there can be settled any such dispute as may arise between the company and the Commonwealth. The Arbitration Act is specially referred to. I ask honorable senators, therefore, not to seek to make any such alterations in the agreement as will jeopardize this projected new Australian industry. </para>

                    <para>. -  The more one examines this schedule the more one becomes suspicious of its contents. The Refinery Company will be unable to go beyond the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for its crude supplies. The Anglo-Persian Company, in the first place, will have the right to supply oil, practically at its own figure, to the Refinery Company. The proposed amendment seeks to place some restriction upon the price which may be charged by the Refinery Company to consumers in Australia. It may be said that this agreement is calculated to break up the Standard Oil Trust and the Shell Company, so far as their activities in Australia are concerned. I fear that it will prove that we are merely creating another monopoly, and that, so far as the matter of providing cheap oil is concerned, we shall be entirely deceived. I have no hope that Australia will be supplied with cheap oil from this proposed source. If the Government itself were to establish a refinery. and were to import crude oil, the people of Australia might have a chance of securing cheap supplies. It is deplorable to be in the hands of one or two companies. The cost of oil has been shown to have increased fully 100 per cent. since 1914, and it is still increasing. That fact brings home to us the nature of the grip which these oil companies have, not only on Australia but on other countries also. </para>

                    <para>.I do not support the amendment. I do not see what good purpose it can serve. The schedule, as it stands, gives to the Commonwealth power to deal with the price of oil. Here is a venture in which the Government comes in practically as a majority shareholder. It has a majority of capital, and even although it is to have a minority of representation upon the directorate, that consideration is really small, seeing that the Government will wield the greater influence. The people of Australia should reasonably expect to make a good thing out of the agreement. But, if unnecessary obstacles are placed in the way of establishing the industry, then those honorable senators who are responsible will have to answer to the people, who are looking to be benefited. If the price is to be fixed, it must be fixed by the directorate. Who is the directorate? The Government, in conjunction with the company's representatives. Is the Government likely to do anything to destroy the company in which it has tied up a large amount of capital on behalf of the people of Australia? </para>

                    <para>. -  I did not speak upon the second reading of this Bill for the main reason that I am in hearty accord with it. But I oppose the whole of this paragraph. It is a blot on what otherwise may be regarded as a very good agreement. The paragraph may be termed the anti-dumping provision. If the Vacuum Oil Company; or the " Shell " Company, or any other firm, desired to smash a new rival - such as will be brought into being by this agreement - it might dump oil in Australia at a very cheap rate, and thus strangle the infant enterprise. But I cannot imagine that any private interest would attempt, by the process of dumping, to smash a company which is associated with the Commonwealth Government. Some ten years ago, when it was my duty to take a close interest in the matter of shipping, I heard evidence being given by the general manager of the Orient Line. It is known that shipping firms keep a considerable sum in hand with which to fight any new company that may be formed as a competitor. I asked this witness whether the shipping activities concerned in the Combine would be prepared to fight any new interest which might come along as a rival. The witness answered, " Yes." I then asked, "Would you be prepared to fight a Commonwealth steam-ship line?" and he said, " That is quite another question." And so it is. </para>

                        <para>- Suppose they are fighting the Commonwealth line of steamers, and are offering freight at a considerable reduction upon the Commonwealth charges. As we have only a few ships capable of dealing with, say, 10 per cent. of the freight offering, it follows that if 90 per cent. of the freight is carried by other ships at. a cheap rate, the people of the Commonwealth will be better off. If the Combine carried our goods for nothing, it would pay us to have the Commonwealth steamers laid up and being painted, until we were ready to start again, because, during the whole of that time, there would be no freight charges. If any other company wishes to fight the Anglo-Persian Company by sending cheap oil into this country, we ought not to complain. I listened very carefully to the debate, and I must confess that I am a little befogged. One honorable senator seemed to think that we would get cheap oil under this agreement.  His  trouble appeared to be that it might be so cheap as to interfere with the shale oil industry. </para>

                        <para>- While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> seems to think that we will get oil so cheaply as to kill the shale oil business, other honorable senators appear to be afraid that it will not be cheap enough. According to my view, the proper way to insure a plentiful supply of oil at a fair and reasonable price is to throw the trade open to the competition of the world. I should like to see this dumping clause eliminated. If outside competitors can furnish us with a cheaper and a better oil, the people of Australia would be justified in wanting to get it. With the support of the Government the Refinery Company ought to be able to carry on and do all that ie necessary without this anti-dumping safeguard. One reason why I am opposed to it is that I fear the Refinery Company might fall back upon it in the face of threatened competition, and be too ready to ask for it to be put into operation. I admit that my views on this question of dumping differ somewhat from those of some other honorable senators. If people send oil or any other goods to this country, they, of course, require something in return for it, either wool, corn, other products, or gold. The position taken up by those who favour the anti-dumping portion of the agreement is that if, say, the Standard or Vacuum Oil companies declared their intention of selling us so much oil for, say, one bale of wool, the supporters of this anti-dumping proposal would at once say, " No; that would be dumping. You charge us two bales." Or, again, some oil company might 'say, " We will send you so much oil in return for 1,000 sovereigns." And, again, these anti-dumping advocates would reply, " No; that would be dumping. It is too cheap. You charge us 2,000 sovereigns, and we will take it." Of course, honorable senators who support this anti-dumping provision of the agreement would like to get cheap oil privately, but in an agreement of this kind they feel that they must take a "broad national outlook," and must not allow the people of the country to have cheap oil. I have been supporting the Government on every division during this debate, and probably I shall support them to the end, with the. exception of this anti-dumping paragraph, which I should like to see eliminated. </para>

                        <para>- If every ton of merchandise coming to Australia were carried in ships belonging to the Combine, we would not get freight a halfpenny cheaper. But when the Combine succeed in strangling the Commonwealth line - if ever they do - they will put up their freights, as they proposed to do before the Commonwealth ships intervened. Let me give another illustration. I remember the time when the Farmers* Co-operative Society of Western Australia commenced to buy fertilizers for its farmer members. During one season it supplied certain orders at a considerable reduction on prices charged by private traders. Next year, however, a private trader, having ascertained the price at which the co-operative society could import and sell, sent his representatives among members of the association soliciting orders at 6d. per cwt. below the cooperative society's charges. This was, in effect, dumping, because nearly every farmer member of the society bought from the private trader. The following season the society, which was not strong financially, decided not to buy fertilizers, with the result that .the private trader put his prices up by about 50 per cent. Now, that is exactly what might happen in the case of oil if we are not prepared to protect this new enterprise against unfair competition. The Shipping Combine is bad enough, but compared with the Standard Oil Company it is as a tame tabby cat to a hungry Bengal tiger. </para>

My first reason is that a company is to be established here, and is to put its money into an enterprise in order to help the Commonwealth to break up a monopoly which has existed in this country ever since it has been a Commonwealth. "We have to realize that in this vast continent embracing an area of 3,000,000 square miles we do not consume very much more than one five-hundredth part of the total oil consumption of the world. Consequently, to monopolies which probably supply 400 out of 500 parts of the world's consumption of oil, it would not be difficult to stifle any infantile effort we might make to supply our own oil to our own people. To organizations which supply practically the whole of the world's consumption of oil, it would not be difficult to kill an infant industry which was being established to provide only one five-hundredth part of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> world's consumption. I shall therefore support these anti-dumping provisions, because it is only fair to the Refinery Company that they should be embodied in the agreement. In regard to this paragraph, I invite the attention of the Minister to a suggestion which I have to make, namely, that the words " and administrative," which appear in subparagraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> should be left out. This is a matter to which I referred when speaking upon the second reading of the Bill yesterday. To my mind', the inclusion of those words  will clothe the Government with mandatory, arbitrary, and, perhaps, unjust power to do by administrative act something which Parliament alone is entitled to do. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that the very fact that the word "statutory" appears in the paragraph indicates that in so far as the guarantee which is here given can be exercised by statutory means, it will be exercised. But that alone will not afford the Refinery Company the necessary protection. Every Act of Parliament requires administrative action. If the honorable senator will look up the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-10 he will find that part 3 of that measure relates to the prevention of dumping. It contains a definition of " dumping " and also of " unfair competition." It requires the Minister to do quite a number of things. The Statute is really a dead letter until the Minister himself acts. Administrative acts must always follow statutory acts. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Consequently we have to say to the proposed Refinery Company, " Not only will we assure you of statutory protection, but also of administrative protection .  " Whilst the War Precautions Act was in full operation it was possible for a Minister to do many things which he was not authorized to do either by the Australian Industries Preservation Act or by the Customs Act. But when the War Precautions Act disappears, the Minister will have no powers except those which are derived from Statute. </para>

                        <para>-That is not so. This paragraph will not clothe him with any statutory powers. This agreement does not give recourse to any statutory power other than that provided by the Australian Industries Preservation Act or the Customs Act. On reflection, I feel sure the honorable senator will see that if the agreement is to be made effective to prevent dumping, it will be necessary to have not only statutory power, but a guarantee of administrative action within that power. </para>

                    <para>. - Because the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are going to put Â£249,999 into the proposed refinery, it is proposed by this Bill to do all that may be necessary to protect their interest, and make it certain that it will be a gilt-edged one. It will be exceedingly interesting, as the years go on, and the Government may desire to acquire the interests of the company in the refinery, to learn what this investment will be worth to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. One would imagine that we are faced with a grave danger of the Standard Oil Company laying on to Australia a pipe 5 or 6 feet in diameter, with a pressure of many hundreds of pounds to the square inch behind it, to supply this country with an unlimited quantity of cheap oil, and that in this effort the Standard Oil Company will be backed up by the Shell Group, and other oil corporations. I am afraid that nothing of the kind is likely to occur. Oil companies are not built that way. It appears to me that under paragraph 14 the Oil Company will be placed unfairly in a most advantageous position, and that so long as it lasts Australian consumers will be debarred from any possibility of obtaining cheap oil. We are to have statutory powers, and administrative powers, to make it quite certain under this agreement that any duties imposed on crude oil imported from Persia shall be refunded to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. It is a wonder to me that the Government do not propose to go farther, and insist that duties on oil supplied by the Anglo-Persian Company to any Australian refinery from any part of the world shall also be refunded. It should not be forgotten that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will fix the price of oil brought here from Persia. The mere fact that it is to supply oil to the proposed refinery at the same price as that charged to the British Government does not provide any protection for the people of Australia. It may be necessary, under this paragraph, for the Government to immediately bring in a Bill for the protection of the company to impose duties on crude oil imported by other companies into Australia. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which we are invited to believe is prepared to invest its money in Australia for the protection of Australian consumers of oil, has taken very fine care to secure for itself a degree of protection which no other company operating in Australia has or can hope to obtain. I defy any honorable senator to demonstrate that we are likely in Australia to obtain oil any cheaper under this agreement than we are now paying for it. Some people are of the opinion that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have no connexion whatever with the Standard Oil Company, or any other oil corporation; but I have very grave doubts on that point. I think there is evidence in this agreement of a well-laid scheme, which might possibly be discovered if the measure were referred for inquiry to a Royal Commission or a Select Committee, to exploit the oil consumers of Australia. </para>

They pay now only 3s. 6d. per gallon for refined oil, and there is no reason in the world why, if the Persian Oil Company and the other two groups put their heads together, the Australian consumer should not have the price considerably advanced, in view of the fact that in this country no oil is produced except what is distilled from shale. </para>

I am rather sorry that he should have said that I was arguing against my conviction im what I said about preventing dumping. I should like the honorable senator to ascertain whether there are any anti-dumping provisions in the agreement between the British Government and the Anglo-Persian Company.

                        <para>- If there are no such provisions in the agreement between the British Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, why should they be introduced here? The Minister in referring to dumping quoted a case of competition between private companies. I could quote stronger cases than he did of that kind, but it had no bearing upon the argument I used. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator rather anticipates what I was going to say. So far as present legislation is concerned, this paragraph refers only to the administration of legislation already on the statute-book. But it may be necessary to have further legislation, and the paragraph will cover administration of any further legislation passed by the Parliament to prevent dumping. I understand that it is not intended under this paragraph to exercise any power outside" either- present statutory law or future statutory law.' Is that the position? </para>

                        <para>. - Under certain circumstances, this provision would give a very handsome remuneration to the Oil Company as distinct from the Refining Company in which the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth have an</inline> interest. So far as I have been able to estimate, in view of the actual position, it is somewhat harmless and cannot be operative for some years, because it deals only with the sale of refined products outside of the Commonwealth. But I can quite understand that if we discovered oil in Papua, and ha'd two, three, or four refineries in operation in Australia, one half of the products of which would be sold outside the Commonwealth, a commission of 10 per cent, on the gross amount of sale3 would be a very profitable commission indeed. Had the position been somewhat different to what it is this afternoon, I would like to have seen the words " not exceeding " included, or the elimination of the words " ten per centum on the gross sales," and the substitution of the words " fair and reasonable." Should oil be discovered in Papua in commercial quantities, a commission of 10 per cent, may mean anything from Â£250,000 to Â£1,000,000 a year to the company, and would be money easily earned. I merely desire to record the fact that in my opinion 10 per cent, is too high a commission in .view of future contingencies, and I would like the Government to consider an amendment to include the words "not exceeding" before "ten per centum," so that it would be understood that this Legislature looks upon 10 per cent, as a maximum and not a minimum. It may be that the Government may decide upon a lower percentage, or the substitution of the words " fair and reasonable." If it is right that this Parliament should include such words in the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, it is only just that such words should be included when the Commonwealth has to pay. It is clear that this provision will be inoperative until we have products from our refineries for sale abroad, but I am most strenuously opposed to a gross commission of 10 per cent, being paid to any person or company in connexion with extensive  exportations  of crude or refined oil. </para>

The case on their behalf was submitted rather late, and it was promised that they would be given consideration under the provisions of an amending Bill. This measure is to assist such men, and I believe it will have the general support of the Senate. It also includes one or two technical amendments, and rectifies one or two omissions in the principal measure. I do not intend to occupy the time of the Senate in discussing it at length, as I feel sure that it will have general support. </para>

                    <para>April, it has already been found necessary - as I indicated during the discussion on the principal Act - to amend it in several important respects. The men who went to New Guinea were excluded from the provisions of the principal Act, but I am glad to say that they are now included. It is also gratifying to see that the Imperial Reservists and their dependants are to benefit. At first the Government were not prepared to allow them to participate, but apparently they now recognise that they served their country as well as others who served overseas. It may be remembered that during the discussion on the measure now being amended I protested rather strongly against the action of the Government in not including a provision covering those Australians who. on the declaration of war, were abroad, and who at first made an unsuccessful effort to join some Australian unit in Great Britain, but who subsequently became members of the Force. </para>
                    <para class="block">These men were excluded, but now they are to be allowed to participate in the benefits. Provision has also been made for certain members of the Naval Forces, and for further extending the number of exemptions in relation to the payment of income tax. These are provisions which are very necessary and acceptable. Will the Minister for Defence explain why the regulations to be framed under this measure specifically apply to the last two clauses? The Act as it stands to-day appears to provide the Government with ample power. </para>

They propose also to increase the number of members from nine to ten, the one additional member being appointed from the House of Representatives.

                    <para>. -  Some time ago I inquired when honorable senators were likely to have placed before them a report prepared for the Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> in connexion with the Public Service. The reply was of such a character that it appeared almost useless for honorable senators to spend time discussing the Estimates. We understand that the report deals generally with the Public Service. On a former occasion, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> told us that it was. no use having the report just then, because the money had practically all been spent. If that is so, it seems to be almost a waste of time to discuss the Estimates, because, apparently, it is futile to attempt to deal with the present or the past, and not necessary to deal with tie future. I differ from the Minister. This report is a very important document, and that there was some necessity for it is evident from the fact that the Government asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> to prepare it. Since I asked that question, one or two paragraphs have appeared in the press, and lately a more definite statement has appeared to the effect that the report suggests that the. Government ought to be in a position more easily to dismiss incompetent officers. Whether this recommendation is contained in the report, I cannot say ; but the press paragraphs indicate that it is, and if the press information is correct, the sooner we have that report in our hands the better. I understand great difficulty is experienced in dismissing incompetent officers from the Public Service, on account of the opportunities to approach the Appeal Board, which comprises three persons, one of whom must be an officer in the same grade as the appellant, another a member of the Public Service appointed by the Government, and the third an outsider if the Government so desires. In these circumstances, it is natural to assume that two members  of the Appeal Board, being public servants themselves, will be sympathetic towards the appellant, especially as one member of the Board is elected by popular vote from the same grade as the appellant. I have in mind a case in which the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright,</inline> an able and, I think, a tactful man, was concerned. Some years ago he declared! two officers, one a letter carrier and the other in the General Division, to be incompetent. They approached the Appeal Board in the ordinary course, and the Board upheld the appeal, with the result that the men- were returned to the Department. Now, if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline> report deals with this matter, as stated by the press, it should be made available to honorable senators. The press paragraphs also suggest that the report indicates that ment does not receive due recognition in the Public Service; that seniority takes precedence. We cannot expect to have an efficient Public Service in such circumstances. I admit that if two officers of equal ability are candidates for promotion, the senior man, because of his longer experience, should receive the appointment; but we ought to provide that seniority shall not take precedence over merit. I have previously asked for the report, and in view of the statements appearing in the press, I shall be glad if the Government can see their way clear to make it available .as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - The present is an excellent opportunity to again bring under the notice of the Government the necessity for altering our present effete and unsatisfactory method of national taxation. A number of people in this country, very properly, I think, argue that Australian ideas should have full play ; that we should not slavishly follow Great Britain's example in all things. In this free and semitropical country, for instance, we have the spectacle of men at any social gatherings dressed up in black suits, as if they were in sackcloth and ashes. They cannot go to a dance unless they are rigged out in a- dress which is gradually being discarded in other parts of the world. I was pleased to read that the young men in New Zealand, during the visit of the Prince of Wales, disregarded these dress regulations at many of the functions and appeared in suits made from New Zealand tweed. I trust their excellent example will be followed very largely in Australia while  His  Royal Highness the Prince is in the Commonwealth. This, however, is a small matter. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The question of national taxation is one which, I think, has not engaged the attention of this Government to any extent during the past few years. Just because Great Britain collects a large amount of revenue through the Customs and a substantial sum from income taxation, we are told that we should do the same. Some honorable senators think there is nothing like a high revenue Tariff - some of them call it a Protectionist Tariff, and say that the object is to exclude goods manufactured in low-wage countries. From their point of view, no doubt the scheme ' is a good one. The income' tax is a much more objectionable impost. It is- an ancient device for raising revenue. I do not know how many millions sterling were collected in Great Britain last year by means of this tax, but when honorable senators are speaking they never fail to point out that the conditions in Great Britain are very much worse than in Australia, and from this I deduce that the income taxation is levied upon those who can pass it on to others who are not able to bear it. This system of raising revenue was introduced to Australia by a Labour Government, in an evil moment, and unfortunately it has been adhered to ever since, successive Governments being satisfied, apparently, so long as its Treasury is kept full. </para>

                        <para>- I would not be surprised if the present Labour Government in New South Wales increased income taxation, and looked around in other directions for additional sources of income from taxation. They can hardly impose Customs duties, as that is the function of the Commonwealth Parliament. Just because Great Britain imposed an income tax, the same idea has been foisted upon this country. </para>

Only last week I read an article in the official organ of the Labour party of New South Wales, which pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Storey</inline> - perhaps very much to the annoyance of gentlemen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> - that his Government ought not merely to increase the income tax, but to impose such a heavy rate upon high salaries as would render it unprofitable for their recipients to collect them. </para>

Indeed, the tax is a purely nominal tax which does not produce more than Â£2,000,000 a year, whereas, about Â£10,000,000 is derived from the income tax. As time goes on, that amount will probably be increased. </para>

                        <para>- There is an area in the western district of New South Wales, comprising some 80,000,000 acres, which is undoubtedly drought-stricken. But the Federal land tax operates there only in a very limited manner. Indeed, over the whole of the area, the State land tax produces only about Â£2,500 a year. It is quite true that the drought in New South Wales extends half-way across the central division of the State. But it does not extend to the eastern divison. </para>

                        <para>- By the fact that a drought does exist in the western division, which is the pastoral division of that State. More than half of the central division, and the whole of the western division, have been for some time in the grip of a drought. But that is not the part of New South Wales in . which great land values are to be found. It is absurd to argue that large land values exist either in. the western division or the western part of the central division of New South Wales. The bulk of those values is to be found in the eastern division of that State along the seaboard. In Sydney alone, land is being sold at up to Â£1,000 per foot, and a similar price has been realized for land in Melbourne. Yet we are told that the persons who can afford to pay these prices are, in reality, too poor to pay anything. At the same time, anybody who dares to go to a picture show is required to pay a tax upon every shilling he expends there. Unless an individual purchases more than Â£5,000 worth of land- </para>

                        <para>-But even 5 feet is a very substantial item in any of the main thoroughfares of those cities. I repeat that the conditions which obtain' in parts of the eastern section of the central division of New South Wales, as well as in the eastern division of that State, are not those of drought. In my opinion, the people who own the country should pay the taxation of the country. The only way in which we can compel them to do that is by levying a tax upon the value of their land. </para>

                <para>I have previously referred to cases in which men have gone overseas to fight for the broad acres of some honorable senators. When one of these men who had been in Egypt chasing the Arabs, in Mesopotamia, and in Damascus, returned to Australia, and desired to make a home for himself here, he was asked to part with the whole of his deferred pay to enable him to begin operations. Some time ago, I endeavoured to ascertain from the Government how much money the returned men had to pay for the right to live in Australia. Several months have elapsed since I asked that question, but, strange to say, no reply has yet been forthcoming. Probably the amount is so large that Ministers are ashamed to let it be known. If they had been anxious to obtain the information, it could have been supplied long ere this. </para>
                <para>If the Government would levy a sufficiently heavy tax upon land, vast areas would soon be made available for settlement. It would not pay anybody to keep land idle if such a tax were imposed. They would be compelled either to use the land or to sell it. So long as present conditions continue, there is bound to be industrial discontent. We do not yet know precisely what has taken place in Russia during recent years, because of the censorship which has been in vogue. It has, however, leaked out that the working people of that country were so tired of the conditions which exist there that, almost with one accord, they declared all land titles to be non-existent. They refused absolutely to recognise the owners of land in Russia. </para>

I do not suggest that the same thing will occur in Australia. The point I wish to make is that the Russian workers were so determined in the matter that they would not stop to impose land taxation. They decided that the land belonged to them, and so they passed out the rent extractors for ever. </para>

                        <para>- I do not profess to be an authority on the subject, but, so far as I have been able to secure information, despite the War Precautions Act and censors abroad, I understand that the Russian workers have passed out the landowners, and have taken possession of the land themselves. In Australia, just because it was the fashion in Great Britain and some other countries, we have continued the system of land tenure that obtained in those countries. The Russian people, so far as I know, have been the first who have been game and determined enough to pass out the land-owners. I  do not know that the method they adopted is the best way to get rid of the landowners. It seems to me to be somewhat harsh. I would very much prefer to get rid of the land-owner by such a constitutional method as I suggest. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite evident that we cannot expect the State Governments to impose additional land taxation, that would result in good land being made available for settlement. Queensland is the only State that has moved in the matter, and even there the additional amount of taxation imposed has not been sufficient to make the land easily available, as they have an exemption of Â£300. It must be evident that when there is an. exemption from taxation that a part of the estate will be more costly to purchase even if it is taxed down to the last <inline font-style="italic">Â£1.</inline> With the exception of Queensland no effort has been made by the Australian States to make land available by these means. There is only a nominal tax in Victoria, practically none in New South Wales, and a small one in Tasmania, Western  Australia,  and South Australia. The most scientific Act is- in Queensland, "but even there its incidence  is  not sufficient to compel the owners of vacant land to use it or to dispose of it, and while this condition continues it must be evident that the present exceedingly acute shortage of land for housing must continue. I know that the scarcity and the high cost of building material, as well as the scarcity of labour, has something to do with it, but the main difficulty is in securing suitable sites for homes- Most people desire to live near a large city, and in the vicinity of Melbourne or any  other of the State capitals a person requiring land would need from Â£150 to Â£200 to purchase a block. It may be an easy matter for some who have ample money available, but it is a very difficult proposition for a man who is only receiving Â£4 or Â£5 per week. Even if such a person were able to find the necessary cash to pay a deposit he would be compelled to pay interest on the balance at 6 per cent. There is very little hope of the States making land available through the State Parliaments, and the municipal and district councils have very limited powers in this direction, although in some of the States they are doing something, notably in New South Wales and Queensland. But in Victoria if anyone dares to build a home in the suburban areas he is immediately taxed on the value of his improvements, and the same can be said of some of the other States, including Tasmania. The difficulty in that regard has been removed to some extent in South Australia, but even there I understand that in many cases improvements are taxed. If we consider the work that is being done by the State Parliaments and municipal or district councils, we cannot expect these authorities to assist to any extent in making land available at a reasonable price. I do not know how many hundreds of returned soldiers are waiting for land in the various States. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Repatriation knows very well that it is a difficult matter to secure building sites at a reasonable price anywhere near the centres of population. The only way in which an improvement can be effected is by inducing the Government to amend the Federal Land Tax Act in such a way that owners of vacant blocks would be compelled to put their land to a proper use or sell it. It has to be remembered that in the near future additional taxation will be required, as we have to raise annually about Â£5,000,000 for old-age pensions, about Â£6,000,000 for war pensions, as well as meet an annual interest bill of Â£15,000,000. To that may be added another Â£15,000,000 for ' interest payments to be met by the various States. We are up against the problem of having to pay away Â£41,000,000 each year, and it would appear that there is no tangible result, as nothing is now 'being produced in return for the expenditure. This is no doubt largely responsible for the high cost of commodities,, and there is no immediate prospect of any improvement. We have been informed that the Government were unable to pay the returned soldiers their war gratuity in cash. </para>

                        <para>- I was merely pointing out that if our Federal Land Tax was increased, the Government would have been able to pay the gratuity in cash, but if you rule, sir, that I am out of order in discussing that question, I will not continue. Additional taxation must be imposed, and incomes have been taxed heavily enough. Estate duties are high, and the entertainments tax should no longer remain on the Statute Book. The people who own this country are the ones who should be called upon to pay in proportion to the value of the land they possess. </para>

                <para>During the course of my remarks, I find that I was not quite accurate in describing the portions of New South Wales that are at present experiencing a drought. Probably drought conditions exist a little further to the east than I mentioned, and over the greater portion of the eastern part of the northern division. The eastern division, however, has not experienced a drought to any extent. I trust the Government will make a substantial increase in the land tax. as there appears to be little prospect of the States moving in the matter. </para>
                <para>I wish to refer to the question of the erection of memorials ' to fallen soldiers. I understand that some time ago* a Graves Commission was appointed consisting of members appointed by the Imperial authorities, and I understand a representative of the Commonwealth. I believe it is the intention to erect imposing structures for specific purposes, and also separate memorials over the graves of fallen men. I have heard that it is intended to give Italy a contract for the supply and delivery of the necessary gravestones, and  if such is the case, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should explain why this work is not being done in Australia, as we have large deposits of marble eminently suitable for work of this kind. There are extensive marble deposits in New South Wales and in some of the other States, and there are also deposits of granite in New South Wales equal to anything in the world. </para>

That material is practically imperishable, and is eminently suited for the purpose of constructing memorials. Instead of giving a contract to Italy, the work could be just as well, if not better, done in Australia, of Australian granite or marble. I trust that the Minister for Defence will acquaint the Senate with what has been done so far, and will say whether a contract has been let to Italy. A deputation representative of the stonemasons of Adelaide, and of Victoria and New South Wales, waited, upon me to-day, and urged that I should endeavour to secure the attention of the Government to this matter. </para>

                <para>Some little while ago, I brought forward the question of the suggested amendment of Military Regulation No. 409. It is a matter of sufficient importance to induce the Minister's attention. It states, in effect, that a soldier who has served twenty years in the Military Forces of the Commonwealth is entitled to six months' leave on full pay at the expiration of the twenty years, or at the retiring age. The trouble is that if an employee of the Department desires to retire before he has been employed for twenty years, he cannot receive consideration unless, meanwhile, he has reached the retiring age. With regard to men who have served for twelve to fourteen or fifteen years, this regulation should be reviewed, so that they should get leave or monetary return in proportion to the number of years of their service. -In an answer to a question, the Minister for Defence has indicated to me that men placed as I have just described have no redress whatever. I trust that that unfair position will be done away with. </para>
                <para>I understand that the bulk of the money which the Senate is asked to vote to-night has been already expended, and that there is little hope of securing a review of any item of expenditure. There  i3  just one matter, in conclusion, to which I call attention, and that, I think, comes within the scope of the Federal Government, under the Department of the Postmaster-General. There are six pedestals placed in front of the General Post Office, Sydney, in Martin-place. They have a hard stone base, which is surmounted by marble. This marble, I understand, we imported many years ago, either from Belgium or the Pyrenees, and it is now in a state of decay. It was never any good, and is getting worse every year. It is a disgrace to the neighbourhood; and I hope that the Government, if they have the power, will remove the eyesores which these pedestals have become. </para>

                    - the solÂ© representative of the Opposition who has been here through this week, helping to carry on the business of the country. I rise, to-night particularly to draw the attention of the Minister in charge of the Wheat Pool
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline>
                    to the very acute position regarding stocks of wheat, and concerning the obligations of the Commonwealth for shipment oversea. Yesterday, I asked a question following upon these lines. I in-  tended it to thoroughly deal with present stocks; and I got a complete answer. It indicated to me that the opinion which I had formed", namely, that the position is somewhat critical, may not be very far from correct. It is common knowledge that the position regarding wheat in New South Wales is acute. We practically  have no stocks at all in that State; and, unfortunately, owing to the ravages of drought - which, by the way,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline>
                    has denied - our total crop last season was only about 4,500,000 bushels altogether. That is not above one-third of the total State food requirements for the year. The answer furnished by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline>
                    was to this effect: That, according to the books of the Wheat Board - that is, in accordance with paper figures only - there was a stock in the four wheat States, plus the stock in the mills, of 50.000,000 bushels of wheat; and that the obligation upon the Commonwealth for shipping wheat already sold to overseas markets amounted to 16,000,000 or 17,000,000 bushels. The Minister further stated that the book figures which he gave me did not provide for any stock adjustment in South Australia, and that other States had not advised that any further adjustments are necessary. The last figures given me were that seed requirements will be supplied from 1916-17 wheat, and that the estimated consumption for human food in Australia, till the 1st January next, is 19,500,000 bushels. I desire to analyze those figures of the Minister, first, on the basis of the figures actually supplied in reply to my questions, and, secondly, on the basis of other statistics which I shall submit.

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will look at paragraph 4 of my reply, he will find that he was in error in referring to my statement about writing off. I said that in the matter of writing off wheat for the seasons 1917-18, 1918-19, and 1919-20, there, was no need to write off, because there was no wheat lost.' </para>

                    <para>- The Minister did not say that in his reply. His full reply, contained in paragraph 4, was that the milling wheat now held in the Commonwealth is mainly that of the seasons 1917-18, 19T8-19, 1919-20; that New South Wales is the only State which has made any adjustment on the wheat of any of these seasons, and that the other States have not advised that adjustments are necessary. I point out that they did not tell the Minister that there might not be some adjustments by the time the whole matter was cleared up. If the other States have not advised that adjustments are necessary, they have not yet advised that no adjustments will be necessary. </para>

                <para>Referring to the figures submitted - and perhaps the most important matter for New South Wales to-day is that of stocks of wheat - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> states that the total book stocks of the Commonwealth amount approximately to 50,000,000 bushels; and that we have balances, due for export sales yet to ship, of 16,000,000 bushels, plus certain private flour contracts to be executed. Suppose we call that 17,000,000 bushels in all; there will be a remainder of 33,000,000 bushels, according to the books of the Wheat Board. The figures which the Minister has given as the requirements for food for the whole of the people of the Commonwealth until the 1st January next - which is the earliest day that we must take into consideration -are 19,500,000 bushels. That, deducted from the 33,000,000 bushels, will give a book balance of 13,500,000 bushels. There have been no stock adjustments so far as South Australia is concerned, and,  according to the statement made by the late Premier of South Australia, the losses there - I am speaking from memory -are admitted to be about 6,000,000 bushels. I think, therefore, that we must deduct this amount from the 13,500,000 bushels, leaving then a balance, according to the books of the Wheat Board, of only 7,500,000 bushels. I heard the other day - the Minister will correct me if I am wrong - that the Government of West Australia will not allow any more wheat to be exported from that State, so, if we deduct West Australia's 5,000,000 bushels from the figures which I have been dealing with, the carry over, so far as the three principal wheat-producing States are concerned, will on the Minister's own figures be only 2,500,000 bushels, without any allowance being made for the clean up, which will probably show, amongst other things, a large quantity of second class wheat, fit only for the manufacture of second-grade flour for export. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. So far as I can understand the position, from the stocks held in Victoria at country stations, and estimated to be available at  depÃ´ts,  it is a very moot question whether, after adjustments have been made, the total in this State will reach the figure appearing on the books of the Wheat Board. It is obvious, also, that we cannot take into consideration any increase duo to the gain in weight because, in New South Wales, where the stocks are practically clear, no addition has been made on this account in respect of the A, C, D, and E crops. </para>

If all the wheat had been shipped, or consumed during the year in which it was gathered, and had there been no mice or weevil plague, or other pests, it is estimated that the increase in weight on the A crop would have been equal to nearly 1 lb. per bushel, on the B crop nothing, owing to its pinched condition; on the C crop Â£ lb. per bushel, and on the D and E crops nearly 1 lb. per bushel, or a total of nearly 5,000,000 bushels extra. </para>

                        <para>- It would have been a fair average quality increase, and, up to the outbreak of the war and at the beginning of this primitive storage system which the war forced upon us, this addition to weight was regarded as extra, profit for shipping agents. </para>

                </continue><para>I have dealt with the figures supplied by the Minister. I now wish to present the figures relating to the wheat position from my own stand-point, which is not quite so optimistic. I take the stock of wheat held in the Commonwealth as appearing on the books of the Wheat Board at 5.0,000,000 bushels, and from that I deduct 17,000,000 bushels representing contracts yet to be completed and flour yet to be shipped, giving a remainder of 33,000,000 bushels. But at this point I branch off from the calculation made in the answer supplied to the Minister, in connexion with the food and seed requirements of the Commonwealth. So far as I have been able to ascertain, our total requirements for seed, food, and manufacturing for export, are in the region of 45,000,000 bushels per year. Up to the middle of this month three-eighths of the year had gone by, and consequently, estimating on this basis, I have to take five-eighths of 45,000,000 bushels as our probable total needs for the remainder of the year, so that the figure will not be 19,500,000 bushels, but 28,000,000 bushels. And if this total be deducted from the 33,000,000 bushels above referred to, there will be only a balance of 5,000,000 bushels, without any adjustment whatsoever having 'been made in respect of South Australian stocks. As I have already pointed out, on the authority of the late Premier of South Australia, stock adjustments will have to be made in that State to the extent of 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 bushels, so that there will not be any wheat at all left in the Commonwealth, even if every bushel shown in the books of the Wheat Board is actually available. Then, if Western Australia will not allow any wheat to be exported, what will our position be? Instead of a surplus we shall be faced with an actual shortage, and be obliged to use up a certain amount of second quality wheat that is bound to be in the remainder of the stocks and which can only be made into second quality flour. The position in New South Wales is critical. We have no wheat there now, and if the position develops as I indicate, we shall possibly have to import from overseas to feed the people in New South Wales, and that wheat may cost us from 20s. to 25s. per bushel. </para><interjection>

                </continue><para>A paragraph in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 19th March stated that at a meeting of  steam-ship  companies engaged in the Eastern trade held to consider a statement of the Ship Comptroller that additional tonnage would be required to bring wheat from Australia during the months of April, May and June, it was reported that special provision had been made to lift 300,000 tons of Australian wheat during those months. In the statement supplied 'by the Minister yesterday the total allowed for export, on account of the British contract, was 400,000 tons, and I repeat that we are taking a considerable amount' of risk in supplying the whole of that contract. Even on the Wheat Board figures we have a very small margin, and I hold that, in view of the experience of New South Wales this year, we ought not to run the risk of allowing our stocks to become bare. We should have a few million bushels of wheat available in Australia on 1st January next, because it is quite conceivable that barely sufficient wheat will be grown in Australia next year to meet internal requirements. I therefore urge the Minister not to take too optimistic a view of the future, but to play for safety. I suggest that, as apparently we have oversold, the Government should endeavour to persuade the Imperial Government to cancel 100,000 tons, if not 200,000 tons, of the contract referred to, because it will be a calamity if we sell at 5s. 6d. per bushel and have to import at 20s. or 25s. per bushel, to supply the needs of New South Wales and possibly Queensland as well. </para><para>I have given the two sets of figures and analyzed them both, and on my own estimate there appears to be a distinct risk of shortage with the need for importation.

                        <para>-Then the position is all the easier. It might suit the British Government not to take so much of our wheat. I am glad to have this information from the Minister, because I regard the export of wool as being infinitely more important than the export of wheat. We do not want to send our wheat away, but we do want to ship our wool. Consequently I suggest that the Minister give serious consideration to my suggestion at an early date, so that we may reserve a greater quantity of wheat for Commonwealth requirements. There will be plenty of wool to ship instead of wheat, and the sooner we get it away the better. </para>

In view of the shortage of the last crop, the drought from which we are suffering, and of the net results reaped by our Australian farmers, surely the British Government will agree to the cancellation of a portion of their wheat contracts. We occupy an isolated position, and if we had to import wheat we should have to bring it over many thousands of miles of ocean. I rose merely to set against the figures supplied by the Minister, other figures which tell another story, and I believe that a full consideration of the matter on his part will induce him to arrive at the conclusion that it is his duty to play for safety. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the spirit in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has approached this matter. But there are one or two points to which he referred, and to which I desire to take exception. In this connexion I may mention his reference to Micawber. I may tell him that the Australian Wheat Board not only recognised very early the danger he has emphasized, but took such steps as will guarantee this country against the disaster which he anticipates. New South Wales, the State that he represents, is alone responsible for her present position. She continued to export wheat long after the Australian Wheat Board had advised her to discontinue the practice, and, finally, the Board had practically to prevent her from doing so. Whilst New South Wales, therefore, is not entitled to whine in the hour of her disaster, the fact is that the other States have treated her most generously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has said that Western Australia will not allow any wheat to go out of that country.  His  statement is not correct. The trouble of Western Australia is that she objects to selling wheat to New South Wales - which exported more  than she ought to have exported - when she is obliged to refuse for it overseas a much higher price than she can obtain in the mother State. Some six months ago the Wheat Board deliberately investigated the stocks of wheat in Australia, and as the result of a conference advised the States that it had no power to hold wheat in the Commonwealth, with the result that every State, including New South Wales, to-day has* command of more than sufficient supplies of first-class wheat to last up till the 1st January next. The 'trouble of New </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">South Wales is not that she is unable to get wheat, but that she has full contracts until January, when her new crop will come in.  Her  complaint is that she is not able to get from the other States the wheat for which she has contracted. Instead of the figures which I have submitted being of an optimistic character, they are extremely conservative, because although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has spoken of the quantity of wheat lost in South Australia and other States, more than 90 per cent. of the wheat in Australia to-day belongs to the crops harvested in three years during which we had neither mice nor weevils to contend with. This wheat has probably increased a little in weight. In respect of that wheat which belongs to the 1917-18, 1918-19, and 1919-20 crop, we do not anticipate any trouble. The figures show that, out of 49,000,000 we are obliged to supply, 33,750,000 bushels are not likely to be delivered before the end of January next, but if a real crisis should arise we can still retain some of that wheat. I would further point out that New Zealand will be able to get rid of all the wheat which she has contracted to deliver within the period I have mentioned. No less than 107 of the vessels referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> have already been diverted to the export of wool, which, I agree with him, is of more importance to Australia to-day than is the export of wheat. </para>

After providing for our contracts, and for the supplies needed in Australia up to January next, we shall thus have a surplus of 14,250,000 bushels. Within the last few days there has been splendid rains in the Wimmera, there is a magnificent prospect of a good season in Western Australia, every inch of the wheat area in South Australia has participated in the bountiful rainfall - in short, there has not been a year since 1915 which has opened with such good prospects for the coming cr op. For every bushel of wheat which we now hold in Australia, the sale price of which is 7s. 8d. to-day, we could easily obtain 12s. 6d. overseas. Whilst, therefore, we should do everything that is necessary to insure that sufficient stocks shall be kept on hand for our own requirements, we should be exceedingly careful not to deprive the Australian farmer of the results of his hard work by keeping an unduly large quantity of wheat here. </para>

                        <para>- We shall have a surplus, after allowing for our own requirements up till 1st January next, of 14,250,000 bushels. Only a few days ago, I was speaking to a miller in New South Wales, and I asked him if any trouble had been experienced in supplying bakers with flour. He informed me that every baker there, recognising that this difficulty was looming ahead, had built up stocks of flour, so that millers found it very hard indeed to place any quantity of that commodity with any baker in New South Wales to-day. We intend to make doubly secure the position in Australia, and we have, therefore, suggested that each State should take practically a census, in order to ascertain how many tons of wheat have been converted into flour which is now held by bakers in New South Wales. No serious crisis in flour or foodstuffs can arise in New South Wales for many months to come. That State would be very foolish to attempt to import wheat from other countries, seeing that it might cost her anything up to <inline font-style="italic">Â£1</inline> per bushel, whereas she can obtain wheat from the other States for 7s. 8d. per bushel, provided that the necessary shipping is available. If it is not available, we are not likely to get shipping from oversea markets in which to bring wheat here. None of our contracts are likely to be completed this year, but I feel sure that if a real crisis should arise the British Government would release a portion of the wheat which they have purchased. Some time ago we approached them on this question, and also offered to repurchase a portion of our own wheat. The Imperial authorities, however, were not very enthusiastic over the proposal, because Australia was not able to prove that she was really short of wheat. I trust that we shall be able to complete our contracts, but none of them are likely to be completed before our next crop is available. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> took advantage of about three months when he urged that January next would be the earliest period at which Australia would have the new crop. May I point out to him that in Western Australia wheat is harvested at the end of November? </para>

                        <para>- Everybody knows the enormous price of wheat overseas. We are missing that price to-day. Whilst we ought to insure the safety of Australia by providing amply for her requirements of wheat, it is consoling to reflect that after having made that provision up till 1st January next, we shall have a surplus on hand of 14,250,000 bushels. ' Next year I would not be surprised to see a record wheat production in Australia, especially if the present seasonal prospects continue. In the Riverina last week there were two good nights' soaking rain, and a similar condition obtained in Victoria and South Australia. In conclusion, I may tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that the position is being closely watched day by day by the officers connected with the administration of the Wheat Board, and if there should appear to be the slightest danger of any wheat shortage, or shortage of foodstuffs in the Commonwealth, we shall take whatever action is necessary to insure a sufficient margin of safety to carry us well into next year. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is quite right. I hope that the Minister's anticipations of the coming crop will be fully justified, because, with the splendid prices that are now being obtained, our farmers should derive considerable benefit. The worst of our position in the past has been that whilst high war rates have been ruling for our  productions.  the Australian producers have had no chance to reap the benefit of those high rates. Now, apparently, when we are just about to share in the high prices, Providence has imposed a most frightful drought upon the greater part of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> says about one-half "of New South Wales is suffering from drought) but I say that at least three-quarters of  that State is suffering from one of the worst droughts we have ever experienced. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the Minister that, with a comparatively small rainfall at this time, our wheat crops may be assured. At any rate, the rain will bring about germination, but we can never tell until about October what is going to happen with the wheat crop, as a few hot winds may change the whole position. </para>

                <para>The financial position of the Commonwealth requires our most careful consideration, and if the Treasurer were in the Senate we could discuss these financial matters with him. We have in the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> the representative of the Treasurer, who, I hope, will make a note of any suggestions that may be made. I see that there is to be a Conference of State Premiers next week, and I trust that when they come together they will do a little more than they did at their last meeting, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> returned to Sydney in so precipitate a manner. I hope that on this occasion the Conference will discuss the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State taxing Departments. This is a hardy annual, and I have spoken about it so often that I am afraid that I may be placed in the same class with my honorable friend on the other side, who so continually refers to the land tax. It is quite time that the taxing Departments of the Commonwealth and States were amalgamated. Every candidate for election to Parliament puts this reform on the forefront of his platform, but we never seem to get any further. There is also to be considered the amalgamation of the electoral Departments of the Commonwealth and States. I believe a few steps have been taken to bring that reform about. </para>

Besides the expense of the present duplication, it is a very great inconvenience to electors to have to find out first of all whether they are on a State roll, and then whether they are on the Federal roll.

                        <para>- France has sent buyers of wool to Australia for the last thirty or forty years. Some of the French buyers made1 a lot of money, and no doubt, will come here again; but some will be unable to do so. It is a very different thing to finance the purchase of wool in London when the purchaser can obtain the wool within a week or ten days from the time it is knocked down to him, and to finance the purchase of wool in Sydney, Melbourne, or Adelaide, when it' will take three or four months before the purchaser can secure possession of the wool and turn it into cloth. I am afraid that for this reason we shall not have anything like the buying here that would be possible in London. That is a most material consideration. The man who has to carry the financing of a transaction over four months is in a much worse position than the man who has to carry it only for a few days, and I am afraid that this consideration will tend to limit the buying power here. We ought to be very careful in the circumstances not to close the London sales altogether. We should allow shipments to the Old Country for sale there. I know that a great number of Australian wool-growers want, to sell their wool here, as they have done in the past. I suppose that nearly 90 per cent, have sold their wool here in the past, and will do the same in the future. But when our financial position is so strained as it is, it would be very unwise, in my opinion, to shut off the London sales for any considerable time. I hope that the final settlement of this very difficult problem will be on the lines I have suggested. Australia wants the best possible market for her produce, not only in the interests of the wool-growers, but in the interests of the community generally. We must have as much cash as possible in the Commonwealth if we are to carry on with anything like comfort and convenience to the community. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. I have thought the matter out very carefully. I think that a number of Australian wool-growers are in a better position to finance the gaps than are, say, the people of France and Belgium, who have had to put u,p with such calamitous times. Some of our people can ship wool, while some require the money here. Those who can ship it, I think, will do so, and get the money on the other side of the world. </para>

                <para>We are there again met with the question of exchange, which is depleting Australian resources very seriously. Canada, India, and Australia are exporting more than they are receiving. In Canada the exchange has gone very much against Great Britain, as the pound sterling is worth only 16s. 5d. In India the exchange is tremendously against Great Britain; but the extraordinary part of it is that it is the other way so far as Australia is concerned. There is no reason, so far as I can see, why some arrangement could not bo made whereby Australia could be placed in as favorable a position as other parts of the Empire. It would appear that n battle is proceeding between the United States of America and Great Britain to see which country is to become the main money centre of the world. We all desire to help Great Britain maintain the strong position she previously held ; but, in doing so, .Australia alone should not be called upon to assist. Why should not Canada give a hand, as she has escaped a heavy war expenditure, whilst Australia has been heavily involved, and, owing to her isolation, has not been able to receive the world's parity for her commodities? Notwithstanding our unfortunate position in this regard, the exchange position has also been against us, and we are losing millions of pounds sterling per year in consequence of the existing rates of exchange. This is a matter which requires very careful attention by a competent financial expert, as I believe some arrangement could be made to place our exchange on a more satisfactory basis. If this were done, we could materially assist the Mother Country in maintaining her proud position as the financial centre of the world, and at the same time enable our burdens to be shared by other parts of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- This embodies the estimated receipts and expenditure for the year ending 30th June, 1920. The previous year's Estimates have been placed by my bedside, and have been the means of inducing sleep on several occasions. If the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> is ever suffering from insomnia, he might try a close perusal of these figures as a remedy. There are one or two points which in all my political career I have been unable to master, and I trust the Minister for Repatriation will be able to throw some light on them. I have selected the Lighthouses Branch, the details of expenditure of which are set out on page 203. I have not selected this Department because I believe that any unnecessary expenditure has been incurred, but merely because it. illustrates my point. This Department has necessarily been in existence for many years, and, according to the figures before us, there is an amount of Â£17,600 for paying for 208 temporary assistants. It seems extraordinary that in such an old Department it is necessary to employ temporary men from year to year at such a heavy cost. </para>

                <para>I hope that before the next financial year has advanced we shall be supplied with a proper Treasurer's statement, because we cannot carefully consider our financial position without such a document. Great Britain is actually reducing her war debt, but here it is increasing. We are shortly to be asked to sanction a loan for Â£20,000,000, but up to the present we have not heard for what purpose it is required. It is, however, another addition to our national debt, and I hope it will be possible to raise the necessary amount in the Commonwealth. The fact that we are to float an additional Â£20,000,000 in Australia makes it appear that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has been unable to raise .the money in London. I do not think I am disclosing any secrets, but that is my assumption. . </para>
                <para>In dealing with public expenditure, I trust it will not be the policy of the Government to dispense with Business Boards, and revert to bureaucratic management. It was suggested in the Economies Commission's report that there is no efficient control of expenditure, and it is very desirable that a Business Board, consisting of paid men, should be appointed, because reliable men  cannot be expected to do the work gratuitously, ft would pay the Government to appoint a Business Board, with power to go into the different Government Departments, supervise expenditure, and exercise a continual oversight. Many of our departmental heads are able men, but they have not the close control exercised by men occupying similar positions in private businesses. I trust the Minister will' give an assurance that action will be taken in this direction, so that the money will be judiciously expended. Our obligation in the matter of invalid and war pensions, and in other directions, are so heavy that it is imperative that there should be a keen oversight on all financial matters. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that this is the last opportunity during this financial year that honorable senators will have of addressing themselves to the matters that are included in an ordinary Appropriation Bill, and, of course, this is the last occasion that will be afforded honorable senators of talking at large. It is not my intention to deal with a number of subjects ; but there is one matter to which I have frequently referred, either on occasions similar to this, or by means of questions addressed to Ministers, and that is the Public Service. A great deal of the Commonwealth expenditure is occasioned by the reimbursements to the officers of the Public Service; and if honorable senators will peruse the schedule of the Appropriation Bill, they will see that much of the money we are appropriating under this measure is for the payment of the salaries of public officers. I have asked, more than once during this session and during the preceding Parliament, when the Government would be likely to introduce the long-promised Public Service Bill. Two reports of the Acting Public Service Commissioner emphasize the necessity of a very radical amendment of the present Act. I heard with pleasure from the lips of the Governor-General, when declaring the policy of the Government this session, that it was intended to introduce a measure to deal with the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Our Public Service Act dates back to the very early days of Federation. We have now had nearly twenty years of actual experience of the workings of that Statute, with certain slight modifications introduced from time to time. The </para>

                <para class="block">Federal Public Service to-day is not as it should be. I am not going to say that it is in a chaotic condition, such as it has been described by others.

Their responsibilities have been considerably augmented and complicated by events arising from the war. </para>
                <para>Very properly, and with the approval of all honorable senators and of the members of the other branch of the Legislature, the Government adopted the policy that, other things being equal, preference should be given to returned soldiers in respect of public appointments. In the actual working of this .principle, however, results have been achieved such as were not contemplated by the originators of the policy. Some curious anomalies have occurred. It has been stated to-day, in answer to a question by an honorable senator, that, after the adjournment upon which the Legislature is now to enter, the Government will introduce a measure to deal with superannuation for the Public Service. I have been informed that the result of the policy of preference to returned soldiers has occasioned a paradoxical situation, in that certain of those who returned earliest - and who, thus, were the least engaged in the war - succeeded in getting the best jobs; while those who came home later, after having given greater length of war service, have had to content themselves with the leavings. The result now may be that, with the establishment of a superannuation system, those who returned among the first will' have gained a considerable advantage over the men who came back later i </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It is suggested that the position may be due to their opportunities for exercising influence. I think it is due rather to the fact that others have not an opportunity to demonstrate their capacity to those in authority. I received some assurance in that regard on the occasion of a recent visit to Tasmania, when officers in one of the Departments of the Commonwealth, both senior and junior, told me that certain officers who had been borrowed and sent to the Central Branch in. Melbourne had, in a matter of about sixteen months, considerably outstripped their seniors who had remained behind. These latter officers said, " Good luck to them ; we have no objection to their rapid advancement, but we, apart from that, are entitled to be on the same level as they now are. We, however, are in outer darkness, and  look with little confidence to our chance of progress, notwithstanding that we have fulfilled all necessary conditions entitling us to advancement." The Government, during the adjournment, and before introducing the new measure, might well give this point full consideration. Nothing will insure an adequate and efficient Public Service if we cannot guarantee that salaries paid for work done shall be commensurate, and that opportunities for promotion - no matter where the service may be performed - shall be properly provided. ' If a man is employed at a scene distant from the Seat of Government, and does not come frequently under the notice of Ministers or heads of Departments or Public Service Inspectors or Commissioners, it is only natural that he should not hope to advance, and so will not go very fast. When the original Public Service Act was passed it was hoped that the Commonwealth would have one of the finest services in the world. But we must see that full and fair consideration is given to the rights of every public officer. </para>

                <para>Reference' was made by the Minister for Repatriation to the fact that it is quite possible that certain of the returned soldiers who have served in the General Division, and have qualified for the Clerical Division of a public Department have failed to receive promotion because there are no vacancies. I admit that possibility, but it reminds me of a further circumstance occurring in Victoria. I understand that in the Federal Taxation Department there have been for a considerable time  either twenty-five or twenty-nine vacancies, and that the requisite number of nominees to fill those positions have been designated by the Acting Public Service Commissioner, but that no appointments have yet been made. </para>

I acknowledge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> periodical sermon upon the question of direct taxation; but I suggest that he is making a mistake in enunciating his principles in this chamber. He should endeavour to impress them upon the members of his own party, who are in occupation of the Treasury benches in New South Wales. If they take his words to heart, and set us an example, we shall then be able to see how his views work out in actual practice, and if they prove satisfactory, we may be encouraged to adopt them. </para>

As to the electoral system, the position is as indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> In our Electoral Act there is a standing invitation to the States to come in.

If any one is blameworthy for remissness in connexion with the amalgamation of the Departments, it is not the Commonwealth, which has all along shown a willingness to work with the States, if only they will disclose a similar spirit.

                    also mentioned wool contracts. He cannot expect me to enter into a discussion of that subject to-night, more particularly as negotiations are now proceeding; but I feel sorely tempted to express my opinion generally upon the attitude of the Government's  critics with regard to these various Government control activities. The Government has, with a considerable amount of success, handled several of these big problems; but it has received nothing but abuse, criticism, and misrepresentation from the very people whose interests have been conserved. The Government may have made mistakes. After all, we are but human, and, as honorable senators know, every business firm makes mistakes. Speaking for myself, I feel desperately tempted, whenever I hear criticism in connexion with these matters, to tell the people who rend the Government tooth and nail for mistakes, that for the future 1 will listen very carefully to all suggestions made, but will think twice about taking control. The Government has given up control of the coal position; and as we have seen, within twenty-four hours the Premier of this State made a pathetic appeal to the Government to continue a system for which we have been abused from one end of the country to the other. It is one thing to carry a heavy responsibility when those for whom the burden is being carried appreciate what is being done; but it is quite another thing to do this and at the same time keep in view the national interests, and receive nothing but abuse for our trouble.

I know nothing about that matter, but I have been informed that the apparently heavy charge incurred is due to the fact that it costs more to send relief to lighthouses than to relieve employees in the city, for not only has the temporary employee, appointed to relieve a lighthouse-keeper, to be paid for the actual time worked, but frequently for two or three days is occupied in travelling. It costs more to relieve this branch of the Service than any other section.

                    also made reference to the need for economy, a term which is being rather extravagantly used of late. I speak of it thus because quite a large number of people preach the doctrine and interpret it to mean a cutting down of expenditure which somebody else may want, but a lavish expenditure in directions which they favour. I do not suggest that the honorable senator regards the matter in that light. I can only repeat the assurance given in the Governor-General's Opening Speech, that the Government proposes to bring in a Bill to give effect to the Economies Commission's recommendations. When that measure is introduced, honorable senators will have a full opportunity of seeing whether it will really make for effective, and not a spurious, economy.

                    raised several matters in connexion with the Public Service, but I am sure he recognises the difficulty himself. In fact, his speech disclosed the fact that he fully appreciates the difficulties of handling the Public Service so as to secure opportunities for advancement without at the same time leaving the door open to some possible favoritism. I am hopeful that the new Bill which the Government will introduce at no very distant date will contain machinery enabling us to appreciably improve the present position. As to the grievances which the honorable senator voiced with regard to public servants in distant parts of the Commonwealth, I can assure him that nothing is done intentionally to place them at a disadvantage. My own experience suggests that the position is not quite so serious as it would appear to be, because responsible officers in distant States are themselves always looking for alert and smart men, and it is not long before their records reach headquarters; so, sooner or later, they get their chance. It is, however, a little curious that, whilst accusations are made that those nearest the "throne" get all the advantages, quite recently complaints have been made in the Defence Department that the principal positions nearest the " throne " have gone to Queenslanders.

They inform me that some time ago it was decided to create a number of positions, and accordingly advertisements" were inserted in the press inviting applications. In the meantime, a doubt arose as to whether it would be necessary to make all the appointments ; and, under the circumstances, especially in view of the demand for economy it was thought desirable to suspend the making of the appointment for a little while, in order to ascertain how many, if any, would actually be required. Obviously, it would be unwise to appoint permanent officers if, in a few weeks or months, their appointments could not be justified. I think I have dealt with most of the matters mentioned during the second-reading debate; and, if desired, I shall be pleased to supply what other information I may have during the Committee stages of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - In speaking previously upon the subject of twenty-five vacancies in the Taxation Department, Central and Victorian, perhaps I failed to make the position quite clear. I find upon further reference to my notes that the positions a3vertised were really applications for pro motions, and that simultaneously applications were invited in connexion with corresponding promotions in the other States. All the action necessary to fill the positions by promotions was taken both in the other States and in Victoria. Strangely enough, those officials who had been nominated for the positions in Victoria by the Acting Public Service Commissioner have not yet been appointed, although the officers who were nominated for similar positions in the other States have received their appointments. In Victoria the appointment of the successful applicants has been held back for some reason or other, and their positions have thus been endangered. I quite recognise that the Minister may not be able to get full information in respect of this matter at a moment's notice; but I should like an assurance from him that he will inquire into it with a view to seeing that those officers who have fulfilled all the necessary conditions for promotion are appointed to the positions for which they have been nominated so long. </para>

I take it that if any such building is erected either by the Commonwealth or by the State, or by both, due regard will be paid to the housing of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, who now occupies a position somewhere in Queen-street. Is the Minister <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> a position to say what action is likely to be taken to relieve the congestion which obtains at present, and which equally prejudices both the State and the Federal Courts? If he is. the information will be exceedingly welcome. In both the Arbitration Court and the High Court considerable inconvenience is occasioned by lack of accommodation, and the Judges of the State Supreme Court have frequently to make use of their own chambers as Courts for the time being owing to all the other Courts being occupied. If a new Law Court building is to be erected, will an opportunity be taken to reduce some of the rents which the Commonwealth is now paying by housing the Crown Solicitor and other Commonwealth officers there? </para>

                    <para>. - I take this opportunity to refer to the Post and Telegraph Department and the answer I received to a question I put recently with reference to the position of the telephone service in Sydney and its suburbs. The answer was from the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> but it did not say that he had placed an adequate amount at the disposal of the Postmaster-General. If this parsimonious policy is to continue in connexion with a service that has fallen into a state almost of chaos, then we are going to have interminable trouble in Sydney and its suburbs in connexion with a most important public service. Speaking from memory, the Department made a profit from this service during the last year of between Â£40,000 and Â£50,000. I am one who does not believe, shall I say, in the mishandling of money by the exercise of a parsimonious policy of saving a. few thousand pounds on a service of great benefit to the public and expending it in less laudable directions. I direct the attention of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to the fact that the Acting Treasurer has not said that he will allow an adequate amount of money to bring this service to a state of efficiency. </para>

                        <para>- I should say the Postmaster-General, and the engineer for the telephone service to which I refer, who has said that the service has been starved for years, and that the present position is practically the fault of the Treasurer. I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to make representations to his colleague that this is a matter which cannot be longer subjected to a cheese-paring policy. The service rates have been raised more than once, and the people are paying very stiff rates indeed for a telephone service that they do not get. We are playing the confidence trick with telephone subscribers in Sydney, since we are not giving them what they pay for. This is a serious matter, and, as a representative of New South Wales, I intend to pursue it until the position is rectified. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to make representations to the Acting Treasurer that nothing short of an adequate amount of money to buy the material necessary to bring the service up to a reasonable state of efficiency will be a fair thing, and that the present position cannot be allowed to continue without the strongest further protests. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not profess to know what is the reason underlying the defective condition of the telephone service in Sydney, but I do know that the service available in Melbourne is better in every respect. There is something radically wrong with the Sydney service. Surely the people of Sydney and its suburbs should be given a service equal to that supplied to the people of Melbourne and elsewhere. Complaints have been made of the Sydney service, to my knowledge, for the last fifteen months, and they should be brought to an end. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Now the honorable senator complains that the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has not said that an adequate supply is made available, and the thing is delightfully vague and nebulous. I do not know that in that regard the reply given to the honorable senator could surpass his own statement, which I took down in these words, "That an adequate supply of money be provided to bring the service up to reasonable efficiency." That is as vague as a statement could well be. The question is : What would be an adequate sum, and what would the honorable senator regard as a reasonable standard of efficiency ? </para>

                <para>This Supply Bill is necessary at this juncture in view of the forthcoming adjournment. It will make provision for the month of July, and includes provision for ordinary services for the full month, and for salaries payable on the 9th and 23rd July. The total of the Bill is Â£1,838,847, made up as follows :  Ordinary Votes, Â£811,182; War' Services payable from Revenue, Â£227,665; Refunds of Revenue, Â£50,000; and Treasurer's Advance, Â£750,000. This Supply Bill is based on the Estimates for the year 1919-20, to which the Senate has only just assented. No new services are provided for, but it will be necessary to provide out of the Treasurer's Advance for expenditure on new works, additions, &amp;c., in July, as well as for unseen items, and this accounts for the inclusion of the  comparatively large sum under that head. The total amount appropriated for the current financial year is Â£21,186,961. One-twelfth of that amount of Â£1,765,580, which is Â£73,267 less than the amount in this Supply Bill. This slight excess is due to the amounts included for Refunds of Revenue and Treasurer's Advance. </para>

                    <para>. -  I asked a question to-day concerning the annual report of the Chief Commissioner for Taxation. I was informed that the report is not yet published, but that the Acting Treasurer would expedite its publication, as it contained a dissection practically of the incomes of the people of Australia, and would be very valuable to honorable senators in the consideration of the forthcoming Budget. I should like to ask the Minister for Repatriation if the Income Taxation Commissioner's report is not available at an early date, say, within a few weeks, to request the Acting Treasurer to have prepared the dissection I asked for in my question, so that it might be available, say, at the beginning of the new financial year. , The question of finance will loom very large when Parliament meets again, and we are faced with the consideration of how  we  are going to pay the many millions that we have voted away. The information for which I have asked will, I am sure, be of very great value to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. -  It has been represented to me that in connection with the work of the Graves Commission; the Commonwealth will probably be involved in an expenditure of Â£750,000 to provide memorial headstones for soldiers who died at the Front. If that be so; I think the Committee is entitled to some information as to what is being done in this matter. If the memorial headstones can be executed in Australia the work should be done here. 1 should like to know whether steps have not already been taken to place  the  work in the hands of the Italian authorities, and, generally speaking, what has been done in the matter. I understand that each of the headstones is estimated to cost approximately Â£15. The Committee is entitled, if the Minister has the information, to know what is being done, and I should be glad if he will supply honorable senators with any information he has on the subject. </para>

                    <para>. - In connexion with the vote for the Department of Works and Railways, I desire to know whether the attention of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has been drawn to a letter which appeared in the press under the signature of a well-known contractor, who wrote in opposition to the day-labour system.  This  gentleman referred to the excessive cost of the East-West railway, and inferred that it was due to the methods adopted. Every one knows that the cost of material advanced enormously during the period of construction, and it is grossly unfair to say that the expenditure was increased because the line was constructed under that system. It is true that wages advanced slightly, but the main cause, in  my  opinion, was the extra cost of material.I do not think that such a statement should be allowed to pass unchallenged. Has the Minister for Repatriation seen the report? </para>

The honorable senator will remember that I have already explained that this amount is to be expended on public works now in progress. Certain additions have also to be made that will require a considerable portion of that amount, and every penny that is spent has to come before this Chamber for approval. It is not possible to bring in detailed estimates of the new works and buildings proposed for the whole year, but they will be presented later.; This amount is to meet current payments on works and buildings, and those miscellaneous works continually going on.

                <para>Clauses 3 to 5 were hastily inserted in another place, are not in strictly correct form, and are in other respects unsatisfactory in their verbiage. It is, therefore, desired to substitute a new clause in lieu thereof. The effect of this clause is to make the Auditor-General's Department a separate Department instead of being a branch of the Prime Minister's Department, and to give the Auditor-General the powers of the Public Service Commissioner in regard to his staff. The Public Service Act will still apply to his officers, but the functions of the Public Service Commissioner will be discharged by the Auditor-General. This amendment has been recommended by the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence Administration. The following is an extract from their report :  -  " That a separate Department be created for the Auditor-General, and that the staff thereof be exempted from the operations of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, and, further, that the Auditor-General be authorized to maintain a sufficient staff in the Defence Department to enable a continuous and effective audit to be conducted." </para>

                        <para>- I am entirely opposed to that, and I hope the proposed new clause will not be embodied in the Bill. As I understand the position, the Auditor-General in future is not to go to the Public Service Commissioner or any of his officers in connexion with his Department, but is to have the right to choose his own men. It is not only the Auditor-General who is asking for this change, because there are heads of other </para>

                <para class="block">Departments asking for something similar. I am sure that if the Government Meteorologist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> were approached he would say he could do better work if he selected his own staff. The Secretary to the Postmaster-General's Department and the Secretary to the Department of Trade and Customs would also express the same opinion. We are informed by the Minister for Repatriation that the position of Public Service Commissioner has not been permanently filled, because the Government contemplate introducing a Bill to amend the Public Service Act. If that is so, it appears that we might delay this matter until that measure is introduced, as we aro very seriously interfering with the Public Service. We are allowing the Auditor-General to deal with his own men, and I can quite understand the Commission to which the Minister referred making such a suggestion, as it consisted' of practical men who were not members of the Public Service. A business man considers that he cannot conduct his business satisfactorily unless he is allowed to select his own officers. He says, "I appoint whom I desire, dismiss whom I care to turn out, and select whom I wish; and unless I have that power I cannot run my business." He brings the same principle to bear in respect of a Public Department, and asks 'how the head of that Department can run affairs properly unless he possesses the same power. We cannot give the Auditor-General that power, however. Although he has the right to select his own officers, he may not dismiss them; indeed, he is actually restricted in his scope of selection, in that be must choose from among the officers of the Public Service. Even this new clause does not give the Auditor-General . the right to go outside the Service. If he could say that there was no one within the Public Service capable of doing the work required, he would be free to go' outside and make his selection. The same applies to the Public Service Commissioner, who may choose _ from without the Federal or State Services if he cannot find a competent man inside it to fill a particular post. If we grant to the Auditor-General this proposed right, it will intensify the facts as related by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> this evening. The honorable senator has stated that the fur ther a civil servant is away from headquarters the less chance he has of being brought under the notice of those in authority and, thus, of securing promotion. In the Public Service Act an endeavour has been made to obviate that disability by the appointment of inspectors; but I understand that to-day there are still only the same number of inspectors as were appointed years ago, when the Service contained about one-tenth of the total number of officers employed to-day. The original- idea was to appoint inspectors, who would ' travel throughout the length and breadth of each State, and report upon the work and' capacity of public servants employed in distant parts. The Auditor-General, however, has no inspectorial staff travelling in the interests of his requirements. If he finds it necessary to select additional officers, he will almost inevitably choose them ' from among the comparatively few who come under his notice. The officers at present in the Auditor-General's Department are not very keen on this new proposal unless their rights of securing advancement by selection to posts in other Departments are protected. The Auditor-General can make promotions from amongst the officers in his own Department, and can give increments under the Act without reference to the Public Service Commissioner; but the inspectors working under the latter official have nothing to do with the Auditor-General's Department, and cannot know the nature of the work of the officers engaged therein when it comes to a matter of making selections to fill important vacancies iri any branch. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitton</inline> was a member of the Auditor-General's Department a number of years ago when an important vacancy arose in the Customs Department. He had had no knowledge of working in that Department, but the Public Service Commissioner nominated him for the post, and he was selected. If the' Auditor-General's Department is now to be removed from the purview of the Public Service Commissioner and his inspectors, the officers under the Auditor-General feel that the Commissioner will not be in a position to make himself acquainted with their capabilities when it comes to a matter of -filling important positions in other branches. One of the chief reasons for my objection to the' clause- is that I am.  still a strong believer in the general principles of the Public Service Act. Another objection is that the tendency will be to make the Department watertight, to the detriment of the officers under the Auditor-General. </para>

                    <para>. - The arguments of the Minister can be applied to every Department. The Postmaster-General may say, for example, that the work of his Department is skilled, and that he- requires specially-trained officers, whom he should have the right to select, in order that the Department may be carried on economically and efficiently. In the proposal of the Government we see the introduction of a novel scheme as applied to the Civil Service, the effect of which', I fear, will be to disintegrate the Service and make each Department a petty Civil Service of its own. The Auditor-General cannot succeed in his important duties unless he has men under him who have confidence in him and' in whom he has confidence. But if a civil servant 'finds himself so placed that he can not avail himself, of . the public officer's ordinary opportunities of advancement, he will, naturally, be discouraged. ' </para>
