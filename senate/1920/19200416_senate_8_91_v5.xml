                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Defence whether his attention has been called to the utterances of an ex-member of another place with regard to the condition of affairs in the Defence Department. Mr.&#39; Kelly, who, at the outbreak of the war, was a Commonwealth Minister, is reported in the following way : - </para>

Dug-outs were a feature of the fighting fronts, he said, but they did not want another sort of dug-out just now in the Central Defence administration. There had always been cliques at Head-Quarters directed against ability. When the war broke out General Bridges was the man marked out by ability and office for the command of the Australian Army, &#34; Yet&#34; went on

                            &#34; I found him accidentally in Brisbane on the Saturday before war broke out, under orders to proceed to Fort Darwin on a trivial mission. I took it on myself to order him to return to Melbourne, and acquainted my colleague, the Minister for Defence, of my action. But for that accidental meeting,&#34; concluded

                    <para>The question I base on that is this&#39;: Is it a fact that there was then, and there still is in the  central  Defence Office, a clique, the members of which are evidently out to prevent ability being utilized by the Department? If so, what steps will the Minister take to have the members of that clique&#39; rooted out from their dugouts? </para>

                            <para>- The clique  referred  to, if there is a clique, must be the Military Board, and under the new appointments recently made &#169;very member of it wa,s&#34;&#39;ou active service during the war. The Government charged with the direction of  affairs  connected with the war and the appointment of officers at the commencement of the war waa one of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> was a member. General Bridges, of whom he speaks, was a member of the Military Board, and had been sent to Brisbane on business connected with the Military Board by the Minister for Defence of that time. The statement quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is one of those loose, inaccurate statements which wore common during the war, and made by those who desired to earn a little cheap popularity by flinging gibes of that kind at the Department, which was then carrying the heaviest burden of any Department of the Commonwealth service. </para>

No; but further inquiry will be made. Any rainfall data mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> in his reports is taken from the official rainfall bulletins supplied to him by the Meteorological Bureau, and at no time has he submitted any rainfall figures based on observations at his ow;i stations. The operation of a rainfall stimulation station in a district has apparently, in every instance, coincided with a more than average amount of rainfall in that district for the period of working. Increased rainfall is of such vital importance in Australia generally that it has been decided to  continue for a time the operation of the two existing stations. </para>

            <para class="block">It had been my intention to submit an amendment with a similar purpose on clause 2. If the amendment is agreed to the effect will be to include in the payment of the gratuity a number of persons who were engaged in such work as mine-sweeping and other services, and will bring within the scope of the Bill the members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade. I want to put before the Committee as a distinct issue the inclusion in this Bill of the members of that brigade. My claim is that those men volunteered and enlisted, so far as the Government was concerned, because they were called up for service, and were available for service, and are therefore as justly entitled to the gratuity as are men who enlisted, went into camp, and never left camp. It is true that the Government have drawn a line leaving out the members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, but this is the first opportunity honorable senators have had of considering the matter, and I want them to draw such a line as will include these men. When men who went into camp for two months, and never left camp are to get a gratuity of1s. per day, how in the name of justice can we leave out men who were called up and used for local service, who were at the disposal of the Government throughout the war, and who not only volunteered, but clamoured to be sent abroad? I ask that the Committee shall draw the line in such a way that these men will be placed in the same position as others who are included, but who are less deserving, because they rendered less service. If&#39; any good reason can be given why the members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade should be omitted from this Bill, whilst men who went into camp and never left it, are included, I . shall be willing to withdraw my amendment. I submit it purely with a desire to do justice to a not very numerous section of men. I am credibly informed  that the additional amount of expenditure that would be involved by their inclusion in the measure would not amount to more than &#163;150,000. </para>

One of the chief duties of Parliament is to so frame its legislation that the balance shall be held evenly between all sections of the community. The number of the men for whom I plead is so small, and their claim is so good, that I do ask honorable senators not to treat this proposal as one in connexion with which the Government have drawn a line that must be adhered to, but to deal with it on its merits. If the justice of the claim appeals to honorable senators I ask them to agree to the amendment. </para>

I do not intend to prolong this debate, but I shall be pleased to hear any reasons which can be advanced for opposition to the course of action which I have suggested. If the matter were left to my judgment I would prefer to exclude from . participation in the gratuity those men who were in our Australian Imperial Force camps and who did not go to the Front, rather than the members of the Naval Brigade who were engaged upon home service for some months. I hone that the Committee will arrive at a just decision upon the merits of the case. </para>

I propose, therefore, to be . as brief as possible in replying to his remarks. In the first place I would point out that there is a very great difficulty in the way of adopting his proposal. The honorable senator maintains that we can include in the Bill members of the Naval Brigade who were engaged upon home service, and stop there. I contend that we cannot logically do so. It is true there was a. statutory obligation under which these men could have been sent upon active service overseas. But the Government did not send them. </para>

                        <para>- If they were accepted and passed into the Australian Imperial Force they will get the gratuity. But if we adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> proposal we cannot logically stop at the Naval Brigade. We must also include our garrison soldiers. When permission was given the latter to offer their services, practically every one of them volunteered. Having been granted permission to volunteer their names were put down upon a list from which men were subsequently drawn as the occasion demanded. But as the opportunities for the service of these men were very small, only a few of them were accepted from time to time. It is nevertheless a fact that from the time their names were listed there was an obligation upon them to serve overseas. They were thus placed in actually the same position as were the members of the Naval Brigade. When once their names had been registered, the Government had a right to send them overseas if they wished to do so. Consequently, if the amendment be carried we shall not be able, logically, to stop at the members of the Naval Brigade. We shall have to include the whole of our garrison forces. I doubt very much whether we shall be able to stop there, because there are thousands of persons who offered to enlist, and who were turned down either because they were an inch too short in height or because they could not pass the medical test; </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> upon having elucidated the situation that he has conjured up in regard to the Naval Brigade. Whilst as a Government supporter I am anxious to draw the line which inevitably must be drawn, it seems to me that the naval men&#39;s claim should be placed before the Committee in such a way that at least we can thoroughly understand it. Despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> disclaimer that he does not read the newspapers, I am of opinion that he is not so short of information as he would have us believe. Perhaps he does not read some newspapers which are inimical to the political party of which he is one of the leaders. But despite what is said in condemnation of our newspapers, there are perhaps some thirty lines in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this morning in which the claims of the naval men are put in such a way that they should receive consideration at the hands of this Committee. The paragraph to which I desire to direct attention reads - </para>

                    <para>Representatives of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade waited upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> at Parliament House yesterday morning for the purpose of bringing under his notice certain amendments desired by members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade in connexion with the payment of the war gratuity. It was contended that in so far as it affected the Naval men the words &#34; from date of embarking in a seagoing ship &#34; should be deleted from the Gratuity Bill. It was claimed that it was &#34; unfair and absolutely indefensible &#34; that one man should receive, say, &#163;130 because he performed his sea service in 1914, while a man who was not drafted to sea until, say, 1917, should receive only about &#163;30, notwithstanding the fact that he was on active service for the preceding years. The exclusion of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade from the operations of the Bill was vigorously protested against, because of the fact that the men had been called up by proclamation and their services availed of for every conceivable branch of naval work They had been on duty as guards, signalmen, stokers, and as gunlayers on armed merchantmen in the war zone. Some of them had been torpedoed. They were prevented by the authorities from enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force. It was considered they should at least be paid the home service rate of1s. a day from the date they were actually called up. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is a very terse and able presentation of the claims of our naval men, and it is for this Committee to take the responsibility of determining whether their case is one which should be ruled out. There is, I think, a material distinction in favour of the Naval Brigade who actually went into the war zone on armed merchant vessels, for example, as against the Garrison Artillery. </para>

Although I admit that the distinction is a very fine one, I do not think that the two cases can be regarded as being on the same basis.

                    <para>. -  This is a question that demands the fullest consideration, and I want to put the case of men known to me personally. When war was declared, members of the Naval Brigade were called up. Some had to leave their employment, and for four and a half years they served their country, in the meantime losing promotion which they otherwise would have gained in private employment. In the case I have in mind, the man applied three times for permission to go to the  Front, but was told that his services were required in Australia. That being so, why should he, and others in his position, be shut out from the gratuity while  men  who went into the military Camps towards the end of the war are included? Some of the Naval Brigade, employed in the Intelligence Department, were sent into German districts, and upon their report a great number of Germans were interned. These Germans will never forget, and the men who were responsible for their internment will stand in danger as long as they live. </para>

                    <para>.- I want to make my position upon this vexed question quite clear, and if I do so now, I may not have to encroach further upon the time of the Committee. In the debate on a Bill like this, it is very popular to move to widen its scope, because while this invites no condemnation from anybody, on the other hand, it brings considerable approbation from those who  are likely to benefit by an amendment. </para>

                        <para>- From the interjection which the honorable senator has made, I am inclined to think that it is a standard he has set up for himself. I always endeavour to do what is right for all sections of the community, and on this subject I find myself in the position of being obliged to support a proposal which, undoubtedly, will inflict a certain amount of injustice upon a very considerable number of people. I have had interviews with other men who performed war service, and whose claims for inclusion are equal to those of the Naval Brigade. I refer to the home service men, who were anxious, and asked repeatedly to be allowed to go to the Front. They did not want to go to the Front to gratify their own ambitions - I do not think anybody desires to go. to war for its sake alone - but they wanted to be able to say that they did not shirk their duty when their country demanded their services. &#39;Now, these men are excluded, and I say that if the amendment is carried and we include members of the Naval Brigade, we shall have to bring in thousands of others. Yesterday, by interjection, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> if he would restrict payment of the gratuity to those who actually went into the firing line. That may be an unpopular thing to do, but I believe that there would be a greater element of justice in it. </para>

                        <para>- I shall support the honorable senator, although the amendment may be unpopular; but it would be better than the anomaly of paying the gratuity to some members of the Australian Imperial Force who, after all, had rather a good time. They had a trip to London, and faced no greater hardships than were endured by those who served in Australia. If the operation of the measure were restricted so as to provide for the payment of the gratuity only to those who actually served in France, Egypt, Gallipoli, or other danger zones, then I say that while a great number would be shut out it would be much fairer. If I support the amendment I shall have to. support a proposal to include munition. workers, members of the mercantile marine, and I am not sure that I should not be obliged to include even coal miners, who provided the wherewithal to conduct the war. I might, indeed, have to go right on until everybody received the gratuity, and I do not know whether I should not have to agree to pay the gratuity to a large number of private citizens, who worked practically night and day during the five years of war in order to strengthen the position of our boys at the Front. I have come to the conclusion that I must support the Government, but if an endeavour is made to restrict the operation of the Bill to those men who actually served in the danger zones, it will have my support.. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> asks for reasons for drawing the line where it has been drawn. I am glad he has, because only by reasoning can we hope to convince him that his amendment will actually mean the opening of the flood-gates, as the deletion of the words proposed will let in not only the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, but also the Naval Brigade staff. Does he think they should be included? And how can we exclude the radio men, who, in many cases, were subjected to dangers as great as those which confronted the men in the firing line ? </para>

                    <para>. - It has been argued that if the members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade were included the coal miners, wheatgrowers, and others, would have to be similarly treated. That is a rather exaggerated idea, as those people were carrying on their ordinary employment under peaceful conditions, and were not called up for service. The members of the Naval Brigade were called up, and would have had to fight if necessary. A man hewing coal or growing wheat is not in the same category as one who had to hold himself in readiness for active service. I am not speaking in any way disparagingly of the work performed by the coal miners and the wheat-growers, as I know the former very often have to incur considerable risk. But this gratuity has been promised by the Government to certain men in the Naval and Military Forces, and those <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> seeks to include were members of such Forces. The members of the Australian Garrison Artillery have also a strong &#39; claim for consideration, and if the line is to be drawn there the Naval Brigade staff and the Permanent Guard should also be included. I have some information in regard to the work of the men of the Australian Garrison Artillery. I understand that these men at different times experienced a good deal of unpleasantness, and were twitted with being &#34; stay at homes.&#34; In this connexion I wish to quote a letter sent by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> on 11th March, 1915. It reads - </para>

                    <para>I have received your letter of 17th February, bringing under my notice the fact that the men on garrison duty at Newcastle arc being continually twitted for not going to the Front. I am glad that you drew my attention to this matter, as it  affords  me an opportunity of acquainting you, and through you, those irresponsible people who in ignorance  are meting out such treatment to our men on the Permanent and Militia Garrison Artillery. </para>
                    <para class="block">I can imagine the uproar there would be if a proposal were made to abandon the forts at Newcastle, and leave this important centre of coal mining and other activities wholly unprotected. Yet, if we allow the man behind the gun to enlist, we would, be doing exactly the same thing; for what use are guns without gunners to train them? I wonder if these people would have urged the gunners to go away from the forts during the first phase of the war, when the. German cruisers were on top of the water? It is true that they are at the bottom of the water now, but can these people foresee events in the Pacific ? Can they assure the Government that the Pacific will always be as free as -it is now? Le&#39;t these people bear in mind that defence is a matter for the Commonwealth Government, and that the Government, in considering military interests, have decided that these men  shall  not be allowed to go out of Australia, The nien themselves, in staying hero, are as truly defending the Empire as if they were in the trenches. Very possibly the people who are dealing out such treatment are doing much less. </para>

                    points out in Lis letter that, during the early stages of the war, when the German cruisers were in Australian waters, these men played a very important part in the defence of the Empire. Men who went into camp a few months after these ships had been sunk are to receive the gratuity, but those who were assisting in defending the coast when the cruisers were within shelling distance of Australia are not to receive anything. This is an anomaly that should be removed, as the Minister has shown in the letter I have read that they were performing a very necessary service.

                        <para>- The honorable senator is referring to the allowance in lieu of leave, and that is a very small concession when compared with the additional pay received by men on transports. In the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 12th March, 1915, the following statement concerning the men on garrison duty appeared : - </para>

                    <para>Men on garrison duty, says the Minister for Defence, are as truly defending the Empire as if they were  in  the trenches. Unquestionably they are, and the people who make cheap sneers would be giving themselves a little moral education by letting the truth sink home. Expressions of public opinion fluctuate from extreme to extreme, much under influence, and very little, indeed, under that of thought. The courage and intelligence of men who are too ready to attribute timorousness to others are always very doubtful. It was the characteristic trick of the duelling bully of older days to suggest timidity as the only motive for a reluctance, real or supposed, to &#34;  come  out.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">I understand .that towards the end of the war the older hands comprising the Permanent Guard at Port Darwin were replaced by returned soldiers. The members of the Permanent Guard at Port Darwin were under active service conditions the whole time . It was once rumoured that an enemy cruiser had landed forces on an island adjacent to Port Darwin, and the members of the Permanent Guard, on being sent out to investigate, ascertained that a skiff, manned by a few niggers, had gone ashore. That demonstrates that these men were undergoing active service conditions the whole of the time. They were accepted for the permanent guard only if they were not &#39;fit for service overseas. In view of all these circumstances, and of the Minister&#39;s own acknowledgment of the position of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, it is not unreasonable to ask that these men be included at the rate of ls. a day. </para>

                        <para>- This is the first time that the Senate has had an opportunity of dealing with this matter, and it. is: our duty to draw for ourselves any lines that we think ought to be drawn. We have no right to excuse ourselves by saying that other people have drawn the line,  and that all we have to do is to follow them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> insinuated that I was popularity hunting. If I had been I could have started on a way that would have won me some popularity, but no such thought ever entered my mind. If, in dealing with all these amendments, it is to be suggested that the movers are seeking popularity, it will be of no use to move amendments at all. Apart from popularity hunting, I deliberately worded this amendment in such a way that we could have a definite test on the question of the naval men. I shall have no objection, if the amendment is carried, to the Government so re-drafting the clause that it will deal only with those men. On the question of where the line is to be drawn, I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> intends to test the question of the men who served in the danger zone. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is also, inclined to test it. If so, I do not mind withdrawing my amendment, and asking the Minister to go right to that question. I say emphatically that if the Government are not prepared to deal out even-handed justice all round, I am ready to risk popularity by supporting any amendment that will prevent a, gratuity being paid to anybody except those who served in the danger  zone. I want absolute justice. I ask foi justice for the naval men. Men were called up and served four years, and get no gratuity, while others who served for one month are <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> get it. They went to Rabaul and came back, and then went about their ordinary business, but they are -paid1 the gratuity from the day they went-, although for the greater part of the time they were outside the service altogether. Honorable senators talk about the in justice done to men who wanted to go to Rabaul, and were prevented by the Government from going. I am- speaking of those who went ita ships after a certain date- and gave a month&#39;s service, and yet will draw the gratuity money up to the date, fixed by the Bill, probably over &#163;100, white another man with two years&#39; service draws only &#163;30. I recognise that there is some justice in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> says-, but I am sorry he took seriously my flippant remark that I never read the newspapers. That was merely an echo of a remark that was made by somebody else years ago, which I thought so amusing as to be worth repeating. My idea was to put a clear-cut issue before the Committee.. To honorable senators who say that I am popularity hunting, I reply, &#34; Move that no gratuity be granted, and see whether&#39; I will stand by you.&#34; If it comes to that,. I will hunt for popularity the same as other honorable senators do, and no further. The justice of the claim of the naval &#39;men has impressed itself on my mind, but I took the fair attitude that if the Committee could give me one good reason why they should be excluded, I would withdraw my amendment. That reason has not &#39;been furnished, and even the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> recognised that the men had a claim. He added that if their claim was granted,, other bodies would come forward with claims. </para>

                        <para>- That is the position; and the reason is that the thing has been done and&#34; the line drawn so hurriedly that men who should be on the right side of it are left on the wrong side,, while there are men on the right side who&#39; should be, to some extent, put back. I understand that the Bill applies also to officers. Take the case of an officer who went to London in the early days of the war, set his watch by the clock at Westminster, and then came back. </para>

                        <para>- Then to Egypt. Such an officer never had one day of inconvenience or heard a shot fired. He drew increased pay from the day he came back, and will enjoy it for the rest of -his life because of his pleasure trip. He will also get the gratuity. The men on whose behalf I am speaking were called up from their ordinary avocations. Every day they served they sacrificed at least as much money as they were getting. Let me take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> as a personal illustration - if&#39; he will pardon me, as I mean nothing offensive. He went to the Front, was wounded, and won distinction on Gallipoli. He comes black, and is rewarded by a position in the Senate, and for every day that he sat here up to the date named in the Bill, drawing as much, if not more, remuneration than he was getting before he went to the war, he will be paid the gratuity at the rate of ls. 6d. per day. Other men who never had the opportunity to do as he did - although they were just as willing - were kept in the naval employ, and served there for four years, with no chance of distinction or of extra remuneration, and are shut out from the gift. </para>

                    <para>. - There is no need to stress the fact that we are all anxious to do justice, while recognising the difficulties of the task before us. The whole thing is telescopic. When you bring out a new section of deserving people, you find that that does not end the matter, but involves the appearance of another section who have some claim approximating to that of the previous class. Can the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> state, roughly, how many men belonging to the ordinary Citizen Forces were called out, but all of whom, perhaps, did not volunteer for the war, although they were all compelled to do war service in Australia, and would have had to fight had Australia been invaded? In a sense they have an equal claim, although I would not say quite equal, to those of the Naval Brigade who were called out and did duty, not in an outside war zone, but in Australian waters. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of such of the 10,000 as did not offer to enlist, but who gave obligatory service in Australia. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell</inline> say that if we dealt with the claims of the Naval Brigade men, we should be compelled, almost as a matter of justice, to deal with the claims of members of the Citizen Military Forces who were called up. It appears to me, however, that the claims of the two sections are not upon the same basis. All the members of the Citizen Military Forces called up could not have been forced to go outside Australia; but the Naval Brigade men who served could have been compulsorily constituted as combatants at the volition of the Ministry. I am inclined to think that the claim of the Naval Brigade men to1s. a day from the date they were actually called up is valid. There is no force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> argument that claims could be made on behalf of the coal miners. For that matter, they could be made on behalf of the metal miners; but I do not think that, in the sense of a war gratuity, there is any validity in claims made on behalf of the non-combatant members of the community, so far as their ordinary occupations are concerned. I ask the Minister whether he has any idea of the amount involved in paying the home service rate of1s. per day to the members of the Naval Brigade who were called up, and who, I think, he said numbered about 2,000? </para>

                    <para>. -  I am very loath to take up any time whatever in dealing with this question. It should be quite apparent to any one that if we accept the amendment we must go much further. No argument has been adduced in support of the inclusion of the members of the Naval Brigade that could not be used with greater force to support the inclusion of men of the mercantile marine, and in that case the munition workers must be similarly treated. On my trip during the war I saw sufficient to warrant me in saying that the munition workers were really more in the danger zone than were any men connected with the Navy. The munition works in the north of England were the special mark of German aeroplanes. I visited one large works in the north of England, and saw the place where a bomb had been dropped through the roof and had killed every man employed in that part of the works. The men employed in the munition works were, in my opinion, in far greater danger than the men of the Navy, because the enemy very carefully kept as far away from the Navy as they could. To accept the amendment would be to open the floodgates to the admission of all sorts of persons to the benefits of the Bill, and we should not know where to stop. </para>

                    <para>. -  It seems to me that under clause 3 a very large section of the Naval Forces is already included. All the men who were actually in the danger zone are included. The gratuity is properly intended for men who actually were in the war zone, or were called up or enlisted and liable at any moment to be called upon to face its dangers. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> poses as an authority on this matter, but I ask him whether men who went in an unprotected ship, perhaps in the dead of night, over seas that they did not know were strewn with mines, did not run greater risks than did the men who were sent out to a definite place to fire their rifles at mines which they saw in the ocean. If men of the Naval Brigade and the Garrison Artillery are included, can any one say that the munition workers should not be included ? They went overseas into the danger zone, and in some cases, their transports were torpedoed, and some of them lost everything they had. </para>

                        <para>- That is just the point I am making. The munition workers, when in England, were exposed to the dangers of air raids. Many of them suffered hardships, and their health was broken down. We have heard much of the large earnings of some of them, but we have heard nothing of the small earnings of others, who were <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the verge of starvation in England, and in bad health. Many of these men, since their return to Australia, have told me of their  sad experience. How could we exclude these men if we included the members of the Naval Brigade? I suppose that other honorable senators, in common with myself, have been supplied with a circular from the Naval Brigade, setting out their claim. In my opinion, there is not a great deal in the circular. I should have thought that, in putting their case before members of this Parliament, they would have been able to state some better reasons in support of it than are contained in their circular. They complain that they are excluded from the benefits of this measure, that they volunteered for active service, but were prevented from going abroad because they were required for home defence, and their work in that connexion was looked upon as of national importance. They say that many of them were prevented from completing their apprenticeships, and that on release, although they are now over twenty-one years of age, they have to complete their apprenticeship at a very low rate of wages. The last objection is due to the fact that they are not eligible for the benefits of the repatriation scheme. Some of us tried to extend those benefits to them in dealing with the Repatriation Bill which was before the Senate recently. <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guthrie. - They could only have their apprenticeship at sea.</inline></para>

                        <para>- That is not so. Many of these men were taken from private occupations to which they were apprenticed on shore. Whilst members of the A.I.F. can obtain sustenance allowance, or an opportunity to finish their apprenticeship at a trade, school, or institution, the Naval Brigade men who were apprentices are not eligible for those benefits. That, in my opinion, is the greatest hardship which the men of the Naval Brigade have to suffer.. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that we are in any particular hurry. We are too prone in the Senate to hurry over legislation upon which honorable members in another place talk as long as they please. I do not greatly care whether this Bill passes this week or next week. I intend by argument, and by listening to the arguments of others, to see that when it leaves the Senate it shall be as perfect a piece of legislative machinery as we can make it. At the same time I have no desire to unduly delay the passage of the measure. I believe that the correct thing has been done, as far as possible, by the persons responsible for the drafting of this Bill. I have no doubt whatever that much time and thought were given to it. Those who framed the measure saw just how far they might go in a certain direction, and that if that line were crossed no limit could be put to the persons who might be brought under its provisions. For that reason they excluded certain men from its operation. </para>

It applies to paragraphc, and the effect of it will be to exclude any men who, either in camp or elsewhere in Australia, rendered service in connexion with the war. It will show that only the men who embarked for service overseas are entitled to any gratuity whatever, and it will test the feeling of the Committee with regard to the inclusion in the Bill of munition workers and wireless operators. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should like to take advantage of the opportunity to place upon record my position in connexion with these amendments. I have no hesitation- in saying that the war gratuity in its incidence, but not in the amount, errs on the liberal side, and that, in connexion with our Military Forces particularly, many officers and men were never so well off in their lives as when they were on war service. At the same time I freely admit that, with regard to at .least one-half of the men- those who actually endured all the dangers and made the sacrifices of war - nothing we could do for them would be too much. But I cannot see how this Parliament can deal with a problem connected with, say, 250,000 returned men, without inflicting an injustice upon somebody. I heartily support the principle of a flat rate which makes no distinction between officers and men, and I should like to see the British Government follow the same excellent practice because, in my opinion, the Imperial gratuity scheme errs on the side of liberality for officers, and economy for the rank and file. It was aptly said in another place, that this gratuity is really a gracious gift. It was proposed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> with the acquiescence of the Cabinet, but, with all due respect to him and the Government, I do not regard the proposal as being sacrosanct, at least so far as the details are concerned. The Bill has been presented upon the lines approved by the Nationalist party at the last election, and, therefore, as members of that party we must support it, seeing that it includes all the promises made by the Prime Minister, members of the Government, and Nationalist candidates. But I represent also &#187; large body of taxpayers in New South </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Wales, and I remind honorable senators, that it is easy to move to include this or that section of the Forces with the greatest of good faith and belief in ,the justice of the claim. Personally, I would prefer that the operation of the Bill were restricted to members of the Australian Imperial Forces who actually went to the war zone, if this could be done,- An amendment of this nature would, of course, exclude thousands of &#34;dodgers &#34; who never entered the war zone, and who really had the time of their lives while the war lasted. As, however, I cannot evolve an amendment that will give expression to my views, I must content myself with stating what my desire is. I shall oppose the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> because I think the door has been opened too widely already. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has informed us that . the amount involved in the payment of the gratuity will be about &#34; &#163;28,000,000. I think it will be more like &#163;35,000,000, because, as one honorable senator has pointed out already, although a member of the Australian Imperial Forces may have spent only one month overseas, he will be entitled to the gratuity from the time he left Australia up to the signing of peace. If honorable senators will examine the figures concerning enlistments, and allow for an average of about three months for camp&#39; training in Australia, they will find that the amount will be very much nearer the total I have stated. If my approximation is anything like accurate, it will mean that the taxpayers of Australia will be required to find &#163;35,000,000 at 5&#163; per- cent, free from Federal and State income taxation, and this condition will really represent an addition of. about 21 per cent, in the course of four or five years. Therefore, I shall oppose every amendment to extend the scope of the Bill. There is another point which has not yet been touched upon and that is, that the bonds are absolutely the best investment in the world,- Great Britain can get all the money she wants at 4 per cent., free of income tax, and up to the present our Commonwealth gilt-edged bonds are only 4^ per cent., so that in respect of the gratuity bonds the taxpayers of Australia will have to bear another f per cent. It is clear, therefore, that the bonds will be sought after by the investing community, and I believe that, if the financial position eases in the not distant future, the Government will probably see their way clear to make them more negotiable than at present. If they do, there is not the shadow of a doubt that every man with spare money will be eager to buy these bonds which, as I repeat, represent one of the very best investments in the world. I am satisfied that the majority of men in the Australian Imperial Forces never expected a gratuity. They were content to do their duty, and I believe that if a poll were to be taken to-morrow, the majority of our returned soldiers, realizing the financial position of the Commonwealth&#39;, would vote to exclude everybody from the gratuity except those who saw service in the war zone. Yesterday, the Minister told honorable senators that up to the present the total of war gratuity paid by the United States of America was &#163;180,000,000, and I find in this morning&#39;s press the Minister&#39;s announcement, that up to 30th June next the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will be responsible for the expenditure, or earmarking, of &#163;60,000,000 for our returned soldiers. I point out that if our expenditure were on the American basis in proportion to population, it would be only &#163;9,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator doubtless considers it his duty to represent the taxpayers when they are asked to contribute something to a large and deserving section of the community. He has brought this matter before&#39; the Committee, and I quite agree with his attitude to a certain extent, because the money of the taxpayer has to be very carefully handled. I am anticipating, however, that before very long <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will be endeavouring to benefit one section of the community at the expense of the rest of Australia, when we shall be asked to expend some millions in order to give an advantage to a small number of conservative people. When that time arrives <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will see that I am also a special guardian of the taxpayer, and I shall take great care that I exercise my right. This proposed amendment is worthy of consideration, although it is not so important as the  one  on which I divided the  Committee.  The division on my last amendment has given me an indication of the temper of the Senate, and if other honorable senators are not desirous of speaking I am quite prepared to divide the Committee without delay. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie referred to the munition workers employed in factories that were the targets for aeroplanes, and on behalf of those men I may say that for weeks at a time they were subjected to severe and continuous nervous strain. Men on vessels carrying foodstuffs and troops in a war zone never knew when their vessel was to be torpedoed or bombed by aeroplanes, and surely they  are  entitled to consideration. They were always in peril, and their work is comparable with that of those who, in a moment of extreme enthusiasm, &#34;hopped over the top.&#34; Notwithstanding the splendid service these men rendered, it is, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in the interest of the taxpayers that they are not included in the Bill. This is not a question of protecting the taxpayers, but of considering how the money should be expended. The taxpayers, and particularly those who have large vested interests in the country, are under a debt of gratitude to the men I have enumerated, and the expenditure of a few million pounds in the form of cash to wipe out the debt is fully justified. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I find it extremely difficult to further contract the gratuity, I think I have already stated that if I could give a reasonable working definition I would be in favour of including only the men who had been in the fighting zone, and I would be prepared to test the feelings of the Committee on that point.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> expressed some poetic and extremely characteristic views in moving his previous amendment when he referred to the stress and strain experienced by practically everybody who crossed the Equator from the Southern Hemisphere. Out of the kindness of his heart I believe he would, in the words of the interjection of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> include the last man and woman, the last sock knitter, and also Australia&#39;s last shilling. I have had some experience in the war zone, and in travelling in the Mediterranean one of my most thrilling experiences was the sight of small fishing craft, on which 2-inch guns were mounted, searching for submarines. On the next voyage the ship on which I had been travelling was torpedoed.. I also crossed the North Sea with a lifebelt on my back at a time when we did not know when we would encounter submarines or mines. I believe I was then performing a duty that was of some service to the people of New South Wales. But this gratuity is for soldiers and not for civilians. &#34;Nearly every right-thinking man and woman throughout the Empire was proud to render some service or perform some duty in connexion with the war, for which they would scorn payment. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is in favour of including the munition workers. They of course rendered some service, but I would remind him that their pay was much higher than that of the soldiers.I have seen the pay envelopes of munition workers who went from Australia to Great Britain, which showed that some received  &#163;6, &#163;8,  and &#163;10 a week. </para>

Many men in Australia were absolutely debarred by the action of the Government from going to the Front. They were at the call of the Government during the whole time, yet because the Government made no provision, and, in effect, prevented them from leaving these shores; the amendment would cut them out of the small amount to which they would otherwise be entitled. I oppose the amendment, and regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has moved in this direction. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment as drafted would include in the gratuity those who embarked after the armistice.. Several hundred men were ready for embarkation when the armistice was signed, and as we could not be sure that the armistice really meant the end of the war they were allowed to embark. Some of them only got as far as New Zealand when it became obvious that there would be no renewal of hostilities, and we then had the ships turned back. The honorable senator would give those men the gratuity, although their fellows, some of whom enlisted at the same time, but who did not actually embark, would be cut out of it. The only point which I would stress is that in the proposition that the Government put before the country all those men whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would exclude were included. We may take it that the country took that into consideration at the elections as one of the parts of the scheme, and the country indorsed the scheme the Government put forward, because it put into power the Government and party who were behind the scheme. We must assume, therefore, that this formed part of the policy that the country indorsed. The Government could not now go back on the policy which it announced at the elections, and upon which it was elected. I must oppose the amendment.. </para>

                    <para>. -  There is a good deal to be said for the attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> was one of the details of the proposal made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and endorsed by the Cabinet, upon which we went to the electors; but, as it is a detail, the will of the Government is not the will of the nation until it has passed through Parliament and has stood the test of all the criticisms that we have to make in our individual and collective capacity in representing the many diversified interests that constitute the Commonwealth.I see the force of the. Minister&#39;s contention, and have nothing to say in criticism of that attitude; but, so far as I am concerned, I did not dot every &#34;i&#34; or cross every &#34;t&#34; of the pronouncement made by the Prime Minister when I was speaking to the electors, nor was I before them for election. That pleasure is to come. With the many and persistent attempts that are being made to extend the Bill, I feel I have the same right as any other honorable senator to move a minor amendment that will so contract it that the gratuity may be paid only to those who, I feel, honestly deserve it. Nobody objects to giving the benefits of the splendid repatriation and war service homes proposals to the members of the Australian Imperial Force who enlisted and did not embark. We do not take from them the benefits of Australia&#39;s generosity in those directions, but it is not beyond the bounds of reason to confine this Bill specifically to those men who went overseas, and to cut out all those who were in camp. We should establish the principle that no one but those who went overseas shall participate in what is,  after all, a gracious gift. I am stressing to-day not the question of the money so much as the principle. </para>

They were in the danger-zone, doing work as necessary as going &#34;over the top.&#34; They were made the target of bombs dropped from aeroplanes, and at one munition-making branch every man was wiped out. Honorable senators know as well as I do the difficulties and dangers that these men encountered.

                    <para>Please bear in mind that munition workers cannot get the slightest assistance in any shape or form from any of those philanthropic societies. All the &#163;5,000,000 subscribed are exclusively for soldiers and sailors. As an invalid inRandwick, I had to buy everything. No repatriation, no pension, and apparently no gratuity; quite ignored on every hand, a sad contrast to England, where it cost millions for munition workers until they secured employment. And as to this tale of the great money we earned - and this is the point I want to stress - the truth is that the utmost paid to the very best men, bonuses included, was1s. 4&#188;d. per hour. By working eighty to ninety hours per week, we could earn from &#163;5 to &#163;5 10s., and out of this it cost us some 50s. per week for board and lodging (see Colonel Barraclough&#39;s letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald) .</inline> In short, we were better off here. I was paying men1s. 6d. per hour. Some seventy of us went under, and, sad to say, I can&#39;t find that any allowance is given to their starving wives and children.

                <para class="block">I am asking that the munition workers shall be included in this Bill, and I make the plea also on behalf of their dependants. I have had no means of testing the statements of my correspondent, but as he writes simply and intelligently, I accept what he says as true. He states that some seventy of the munition workers have died, leaving dependants who,Ihope, will be considered by honorable senators in dealing with this Gratuity Bill. I do not know that I could strengthen my case by talking at greater length. I have put the claim of the munition workers briefly before the Committee, and I ask honorable senators to support it. I believe that if honorable senators were themselves drawing the line to decide who should be included in the benefits of this measure, they would certainly include the dependants of men who died at munition work under  the conditions of stress and strain depicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, because th munition works were the special target of enemy aeroplanes. I cannot claim that these men have a stronger claim than those on whose behalf I have already moved, but their claim is certainly a just one, and it is in the name of justice that I ask for their inclusion in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not agree to the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> He proposes the inclusion certainly of a very deserving class of men. I have nothing to say in derogation of the work of the munition workers. I am proud of it, and proud to have been associated with the sending of them oversea. . But I remind honorable senators that, on the whole, these men have been well treated by the Government. The Government paid their passages to and from the Old Country, and Australia and made certain allowances to their wives and families. The Commonwealth was involved iri considerable expenditure in the carrying out of the munition workers&#39; scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has suggested that high wages were not earned by the munition workers, and has quoted the rate per hour which was paid to some of them. The fact remains, however, that a great number of these men were engaged on piecework, and it is on record that many of them earned  &#163;5, &#163;6,  and from  &#163;8  to  &#163;10  per week on piece work. I do not question that they gave good value for the money they earned, but even if they did not earn what they might have earned in Australia, it is, I submit, foreign to the principle of this Bill to include them in it. With regard to the cases of hardship amongst them, to one of which the honorable senator has referred, I may say that the Government have already taken action to deal with such cases. If. these men are suffering from illness due to&#39; their services overseas an arrangement has been arrived at between the Treasury and the Defence Department by which they can secure assistance. It is also proposed that they should be given consideration under the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. As that Act is worded at present, these men who contracted diseases and disabilities Overseas, and not in Australia, are not covered by its provisions. That is a matter which will be remedied, and it seems to me that that is a more equitable and reasonable way in which to deal with their cases than to bring them within the provisions of this Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> seems to have given the whole case away. But he might have gone a good deal further than he has done. He has informed us, that, bcause of the fact that some of these men contracted illness during their service abroad, the Government contemplate amending the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act to bring them within the scope of its operation. The additional expenditure involved in including the munition workers amongst those to whom the gratuity is to be paid would not amount to very much. That, however, should not be the concern of the Committee. The question for us is whether these men are justly entitled to the same consideration as other men who went oversea to render service during the war. I feel certain that a considerable number of men will receive the gratuity who will not be nearly so much entitled to it as are many of the munition workers. We have been informed that at least seventy of these men have lost their lives through having gone abroad. Some cases have been brought under my notice of munition workers who have not yet returned to Australia, and who have left wives and families here. It seems that, under existing legislation, we have no power to compel the return of these men to their wives and families. They voluntarily terminated their agreements with the authorities abroad, and while, in some cases, they are supporting their wives and families in Australia, they have declined to return to this country after their work in England was completed. That may be somewhat apart from the question under consideration, but I remind those who may be inclined to oppose the amendment that the claim which the  munition workers are able to put forward is &#39;so strong that already it has been decided to extend to them the benefits of the provisions of the War Service Homes Act. They are entitled to the same advantages under that measure as are the members of the Australian Imperial Force. Certain allowances were made to their wives and families, because of -their service abroad, and it is the intention of  the Government to extend to them the benefits of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> proposes is but a trifling extension of the consideration which it is admitted is due to the munition workers, and I trust that his request will be supported. </para>

I find, however, that some difficulty would be created if I proceeded with that proposal, because a somewhat similar amendment was moved in another place and was ruled&#39; out of order. The Government have no desire to create a constitutional difficulty between the two branches of the Legislature, but they have given an undertaking that the dependants of these particular men will be dealt with. Before the session closes, an amending measure will probably be submitted in order to give effect to our desire in this connexion. Consequently, I do not propose to move the amendment which I have circulated. At the same time I give a definite undertaking on behalf of the Government that the alteration of which I speak will be made. I now move - </para>

                    <para>. - I embrace this opportunity to protest against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> withdrawal of the amendment of which he had given notice. My protest is based upon the reason which he urged for its withdrawal, namely, the fear of creating a constitutional difficulty with the other House. It is surely an unheard-of . thing for a Minister to say that our practice must be regulated to suit the convenience of the other Chamber. There may have been a constitutional difficulty in the way of the other branch of the Parliament inserting an amendment which&#39; would have the effect of increasing a charge or burden on the people; but what of that? If we requested the other Chamber to increase the taxation of the people by the payment of an additional 6d. per day to certain individuals, surely the Government would at once proceed to obtain the authority needed to give effect to our request in the ordinary constitutional way. I would also point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has himself admitted that the amendment which he has circulated is a most desirable one. I protest against his attitude and against the Senate being placed in such a position that a necessary amendment has been withdrawn merely to convenience somebody else. </para>

                        <para>-  Apparently the Senate is unanimous, although there were dissentient voices, that this matter should be decided forthwith. I want honorable senators to realize that we are not discussing my offence to the  Chairman  of Committees, but deciding whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. President,</inline> after receiving the statement from the  Chairman  of Committees, was right in giving his decision before I had an opportunity of speaking. It is a most important matter, and one which the Senate must not overlook. All the evidence is before us. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> came in and took his seat. The  Chairman  of Committees immediately read the statement of what had occurred in Committee, and handed it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> through the <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk. Mr. President</inline> then rose, read the statement to the. Senate, and immediately gave his decision. I was prevented  from  putting my case. It may be that you will say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that there was only one side to the question; but you, sir, not being present in the Committee, had not any official knowledge of what happened in Committee. I consider it was your duty to give me an opportunity of stating my case. I have pressed the matter at this stage, not with the desire of wasting time, but in the endeavour to settle a most important point. Although some honorable senators may joyfully vote against me, there can be no disputing the fact that I did not have an opportunity of speaking. You,- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would doubtless claim that I am misstating the case. </para>

                        <para>- There is not much to reply to, as the facts are plain. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> came into the chamber without any official knowledge of what had occurred in Committee. You had received from the  Chairman  of Committees a statement which was handed to you by the  Clerk.  You rose in your place, and until you did so there was not anything before the Senate. The Committee had ceased to sit, and we were then in the Senate, and I had no right to address you until there was something before us. Immediately you read the complaint, I fully expected that I would have the right to speak; but apparently you had prejudged the matter, and then gave your decision. </para>

                        <para>- I have ruled that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> remark was a reflection on the Chair, and I ask that it be withdrawn. Apart altogether from any personal feeling, it is essential for the proper and harmonious working of any deliberative body that its rules and practices should be honoured by every member of it. It is one of the rules of the Senate - a rule adopted by every deliberative assembly in the world - that the Presiding Officer must not be reflected upon by any member of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> remark about myself, which, of course, has no effect upon me personally, but affects my position as  President,  I took to be a distinct reflection upon the Chair. I have asked the honorable senator to withdraw it, and, until he does so I do not think that the Senate should proceed further with the discussion. As it is 4 o&#39;clock, I have now, under the Sessional Order, to put the motion, which must be decided without debate, - That the Senate do now adjourn. </para>

I made a statement which was not intended to be a reflection upon you, and which would not have been taken as a reflection by anybody but yourself. I am not speaking offensively, and I hope honorable senators will not treat flippantly what I am saying in earnest. The statement I made was that in giving your decision, or in the after debate, you said that my offence was so obvious that it was at your discretion to do certain things. I said that that showed that you had prejudged the matter. There was nothing offensive in saying that. It was a statement of simple fact. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think the Minister for Defence would have been well advised if yesterday evening he had decided to go on with the consideration  of  the War Gratuity Bill instead of adjourning at a little after 10 o&#39;clock. There was no reason whatever why we should not have continued the consideration of the measure until much later last night, especially if the Minister was so very anxious, as he suggests, to push it through. </para>

His  withdrawal was, in my opinion, against the Standing Orders and against all the practice and procedure of the Senate. He was called upon to withdraw a statement which honorable senators must admit was a reflection upon the whole of the Senate, and he withdrew it with a condition which I would not have been permitted to attach to a withdrawal. </para>

                            <para>- It is not sufficient for me. I have been bound down to unconditional withdrawals. I want to say that, so far as withdrawals are concerned, if Ministers may make conditional withdrawals, which, in my judgment, constitute as great an offence as the original statement objected to, private members of the Senate must have the same right. The balance must be held evenly, and if Ministers set a bad example, they have themselves and not private members of the Senate to blame if that example is followed. What happened with regard to the War Gratuity Bill? As a matter of fact, we have been  actually hurrying through the clauses today. Provisions affording legitimate scope for lengthy debate have been hurried through. When we came to a finance clause, at 3.40 p.m.&#39;, concerning which a good deal could be said- </para>

When Ave came to that important clause at that time, in view of the fact that I knew there must be a long debate upon it, I asked the Minister for Defence to carry it over until next week. It would not have put us any further ahead to have debated the matter for thirty-five minutes to-day and have to begin its consideration again at our next sitting. </para>

I do not wish to prolong the difficulty, but I tell the Minister that if he regarded my antagonism to the  Chairman  as antagonism to him he was assuming something that he had no right to assume.

                            <para>- I realize that I will be out of order in discussing what we have done or what we are likely to do in connexion with the War Gratuity Bill next week. If the Minister believes that time has been lost, I may tell him that I have no objection to the Senate&#34; meeting to-morrow if he cares to withdraw his present motion. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator thinks that such a proposal would not secure the support of a majority &#91; shall be prepared to vote with honorable senators opposite and meet them in the most ample way, but they should not make an excuse that twenty minutes time has been wasted. I hope that the Minister for Defence in connexion with the further consideration of the War Gratuity Bill will not act as he has acted to-day. I trust that he will not jump to hasty conclusions. </para>

                    <para>I take advantage of the motion for the adjournment of the Senate to mention one or two matters to which I should like to call attention. I referred to-day to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> concerning the Defence Department, to the effect that there is, and has been for a considerable time, a clique in the Department opposed to the utilization of ability in that Department. There is in that Department, according to the statement of a gentleman who occupied a Ministerial position at the beginning of the war, a clique opposed to ability - and he says it is still there, and he wants the members of it rooted out of their dugouts, or words to that effect. I should like to know from the Minister for Defence if he is prepared to add to the information he gave me in reply to the question I addressed to him this morning. The Minister seemed to think that bringing the matter before him in the form of a question was merely another method of giving effect to some of the criticism passed on the Government during the war, but there was no occasion for him to make that statement, because the gentleman who had uttered the remarks I brought under &#34;his attention was one who, during the war, was. never niggardly in his support of the Minister or ungenerous in his criticism of the Government. I &#39;believe that lie is entitled to be _ regarded as an authority upon the subject upon which he spoke, and if there is in the Defence Department a clique so strongly entrenched in their dugouts as to be regarded as an adverse influence against the advancement of men with perhaps more intellect than themselves, the Senate could not use the opportunity for speaking on the motion for the adjournment in a better way than (by discussing the matter. It is a grave charge that on the Head-Quarters Staff, among the men responsible for the future defence of this country, there is a clique so secure in their positions that they can, as it were, prevent any one of superior ability from approaching them or disturbing them in those positions; and instead of the Minister petulantly saying that the matter was merely raised for the purpose of embarrassing Ministers, he should ascertain whether there is any possibility of such a clique in the Defence Department being able to use its powers to the detriment of the defence of Australia. It may happen that there is a social set in the Department which looks upon men who have worked their way up from the ranks as beneath it. It nearly always happens that the man who works his way up from the ranks has the most ability, . and in consequence is marked out for treatment which should not bo meted out to him. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was acting as Minister for Defence, I brought under his notice the treatment of Captain Hayne, whose health, if not his life, was lost in the service of the Defence Department. He had been a sergeant-major, and had passed excellent examinations, and when he left the Department because of the trouble brought about by the hard work he had undertaken, the administration actually cancelled his name from the list which showed the record of those who did service in the organization of the Australian Imperial Force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> admitted that it was a mistake, but I could bring forward letters to show that twelve months previously the Department had been informed of the mistake and refused to rectify it. They were anxious to rob this officer of his record, and it was only when the matter was mentioned in Parliament that we got the admission that Captain Hayne&#39;s name had been omitted by error. When the list of records of service were published, Captain Hayne and others complained that their services had been overlooked.  I  asked him what the trouble was, and he replied that it was because he was  a Tanker.  However, he is now outside the Service, and the administration cannot interfere with him, or hurt him  in  any way, but there is an impression in the minds of many that there  is a  clique in the Defence Department who believe that they are &#34; the salt of the earth &#34; and consider that men who have worked their way up from the ranks are to be treated as they see  fit  to treat them. These  are  the facts, yet the Minister is petulant when I bring under his attention the statement of  a  gentleman which I thought honorable gentlemen opposite would take notice of. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> has  a  very acute mind. We know his attitude with regard to General Bridges. When he found that officer on  a  trip to Darwin on  a  comparatively trivial matter, he took the responsibility of cancelling the trip and telegraphing his decision to the other Ministers. As  a  consequence, General Bridges was recalled to Melbourne. All this is evidence of incapacity, or worse, on the part of the Defence administration. I take it from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly&#39;s</inline> statement that General Bridges was to be shifted to Darwin, so that an inferior might take his place in Melbourne. It could not be done in any other way. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly&#39;s</inline> statement, these men are still at Head-Quarters, and if that is the case,  it  is not good for the country or the Department.  I  hope that the Minister will see that there is more reason to look into these things with an earnest desire to improve his Department than to act petulantly and say that charges are hurled at the Government with  a  view to harassing Ministers. There was no such intention on our part. I have no desire to make any declaration of war against the Government or the Minister for Defence, but now that the great war is over, I shall not be sparing in my criticism of the Minister or his Department, in the hope that such criticism will bring about  a  remedy for any evils that may exist. He may be petulant when  a  question is asked, but before many months he will find that there is plenty of room for complaint. </para>
