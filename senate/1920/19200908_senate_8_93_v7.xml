                        - I desire to inform the Senate -that up to last night the sum of Â£21,000,000 had been subscribed towards the Second Peace Loan. It is intended to extend the period within which applications may be received to Monday next, particularly with a view of giving pastoralists an opportunity to invest their recent wool dividends. Further, an additional extension will be granted to the end of the month to back-country districts of Queensland in order to enable residents of the more scattered portions of the continent to participate in the loan.

                        <para>In moving the second reading of the War Service Homes Bill in the Senate some fortnight ago, the Minister for Repatriation announced that the Housing Commissioner was on the eve of completing two deals of considerable magnitude for the purchase of certain timber properties, and that when completed the purchase would go a long way towards meeting certain of the Commissioner's requirements. Although a few outstanding details yet remain to bc adjusted, matters are now sufficiently complete to permit of a definite announcement, and also an outline of the new policy which the Commissioner, with the approval of the Government, is being compelled to adopt owing to the difficulty, indeed, the impossibility, of otherwise obtaining supplies either in sufficient quantities or at satisfactory prices. </para>
                        <para>Under the War Service Homes Act, the Commissioner is- empowered to purchase building material, and shortly after assuming office he ondeavoured, in the several States, to make contracts in the ordinary trade channels for the purpose of obtaining not only supplies for immediate uac, but, by means of extended contracts, to make provision for some reasonable time ahead. The result of these efforts was by no means satisfactory. With one or two exceptions, the best terms that he could obtain represented only a trifle in advance of ordinary trade discounts, and even where arrangements were made with regard to price, contractors failed to deliver the quantities required. It became evident, therefore, that unless he was to be seriously hampered in his operations, or the cost of the soldiers' homes was to be swollen, some other means of obtaining supplies would have to be discovered. </para>
                        <para>It was obvious that, great as the difficulty was in obtaining supplies at satisfactory figures, it1 would be intensified as he extended his operations unless additional supplies were brought on to the market. Without such additional supplies, the more . he purchased the more would be the likelihood of the market rising. . So long as he remained in the market us a competitor with other builders, the effect of his competition would be to harden the price and to reduce the limited supplies available to the building trade generally. Some relief might have been obtained by importations, but it was not deemed advisable to resort to such a course until other means had first been tested out. </para>
                        <para>After giving the matter full consideration, the Commissioner decided that the only effective way by which he could reduce the cost of his supplies, and consequently the cost of houses to soldiers, and at the same time insuring adequate supplies without seriously depleting the market, was by obtaining timber areas from which his wants could be directly supplied. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">On 6th May, 1920, the Commissioner reported to the Minister for Repatriation upon this matter in the following terms :  -  " It has been very evident for some time past that  it  is impossible to secure supplies of timber at anything like reasonable rates for the erection of War Service Homes. This is largely owing to the operations of Timber Combines, who control prices and who meet monthly, and each meeting for the . past six months has produced a further rise in the price of timber. The Government Departments in Queensland and Western Australia have not been any more reasonable than the merchants. </para>
                    <para>Owing to the enormous quantities of timber required (80,000,000 super, feet per annum), and to insure continuity of operations at reasonable cost all over Australia, and especially in New South Wales and Victoria, the only policy left to the War Service Homes Commission was to acquire saw-mills and forest areas to meet its own demands, thus insuring supplies at reasonable cost and allowing thereby the general public to have their original sources of supply for public requirements uninterfered with. </para>
                    <para>The' scheme for timber supplies has been developed as the result of very careful and exhaustively conducted investigations in all States with timber merchants, timber merchants associations, and State Government Departments, over a period of several months, coupled with a careful investigation of the position in America and in the Old World. </para>
                    <para>Unless the requirements of the Commission arc protected at this stage in regard, to timber, I gravely doubt the success of the War Service Homes Commission." </para>
                    <para>A submission to this end was presented- to Cabinet, and the policy was generally approved with the proviso that each separate, undertaking was to be subject to the approval of the Minister. The- Commissioner thereupon proceeded with certain preliminary negotiations, and having obtained reports from his officers, supplemented by outside inquiries, he recommended the purchase of properties owned by Messrs. Lahey Brothers Limited and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> F. Brett, of Brisbane. Details of these pro- ' perties are given later. </para>
                    <para>In view of the magnitude and complexity of the venture, it was deemed both desirable and necessary to have the proposal checked from its business side, and to that end the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> E. Barton, F.C.P.A., the well-known  consulting accountant, of Sydney, were obtained. That gentleman, after exhaustive investigation, recommended, with certain modifications in detail, the purchase of the properties in question. </para>
                    <para>The price at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brett's</inline> property wa3 placed under offer was Â£245,000, with the stipulation that the vendor was to be relieved of Federal and State income tax resulting from the transaction. </para>
                    <para>The price agreed to be paid is Â£220,000, half cash and half in war bonds, the vendor retaining the right to the tops on the two properties. The proviso regarding taxation exemption was deleted. </para>
                    <para>The Brett property consists of 10,057 acres freehold, and the timber rights over an additional area of 7,380 acres, and three sawmilling plants. These are situated at Killarney, Samford, Blackbutt, and Beaudesert. </para>
                    <para>It is estimated, conservatively, that on these areas there are 47,700,000 feet of pine, 54,000,000 feet of hardwood, and 21,700,000 feet of scrubwood. </para>
                    <para>The Lahey properties consist of 10,412 acres freehold, situated at Canungra, adjoining the Brett property,' 6 3-7 acres at Beaudesert, upon which is a saw-milling plant, and 5Â½ acres at Brisbane, upon which are joinery' works, timber-yard, and offices. The timber on the 10,412 acres is estimated at 50,000,000 feet of pine and 7,000,000 feet of scrubwood. This property includes, in addition to milling machinery, railway siding, tramway, locomotives and rolling-stock, traction engine, bullock teams, and waggons. </para>
                    <para>The price originally asked in the case of the Lahey property was Â£250,700, and the price agreed upon is Â£243,000, half cash and half war bonds. </para>
                    <para>The following is the estimate of yield, cost, and savings of both properties: - </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-style="italic">Pine.</inline>
                        - The pine on Brett's and Lahey's properties is 97,000,000 feet in the round. This, will produce 65,000,000 feet of sawn timber. On July market prices, after deducting 3 per cent, discount, this quantity of timber, partly dressed and partly rough, would cost the Commission Â£1,811,875.
                    </para>
                    <para>The cost to the Commission of producing its own pine timber, allowing a sinking fund of 12s. 6d. per 100, will be Â£1,283,750. This will result in a saving of Â£528,125. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-style="italic">Hardwood and Scrubwoods.</inline>
                        - These timbers total 83,000,000 feet in the round, which will produce 45,000,000 feet sawn.
                    </para>
                    <para>On July market prices, after deducting 3 per cent, discount, this quantity would cost the Commission Â£1,005,000. </para>
                    <para>The cost to the Commission of producing its own hardwood and scrubwoods, after allowing for a sinking fund at the  rate of 6s. per 100, will be Â£819,375-a saving of Â£185,625. </para>
                    <para>This shows a total saving of Â£713,750 over the working period. </para>
                    <para>The sinking fund has been worked out to cover not only the cost of timber, but the cost of land and plant. By the . time the timber is worked out, the properties will be written right out of the Commis-. sion's books, although there will still remain assets of considerable value, such as 10,000 acres of freehold, various saw-mill plants, and a joinery plant. </para>
                    <para class="block">Further, the scrubwoods, many of which are valuable timbers such as rosewood, silky oak, red and white cedar, beech, bolly-gum, &amp;c, have been reckoned as worth no more than hardwood. </para>
                    <para class="block">The question of the management of these properties has yet to be decided. Two courses are under consideration. The first, the direct control by the Commissioner working through a salaried manager; the other, a contract under which the contractor would undertake to deliver the timber at so much per '100 feet. Each of these methods has alike its advantages, and drawbacks, and they are being investigated. Whichever method is finally adopted, preference of employment to returned soldiers will be provided for. </para>
                    <para>The Commissioner anticipates obtaining from 'the areas in question 6,000,000 feet of hardwood and 12,000,000 feet of pine per annum. The hardwood is being used solely in Queensland, the requirements of which State being 6,000,000 feet per annum will be met from these areas. In the matter of pine, the Commissioner's annual requirements for New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria are 18,000,000 feet. It will therefore be seen that even with this new source of supply available, he will not be over-supplied. </para>
                    <para>In New South Wales and Victoria redwood imported from America is now "used for certain purposes. It is proposed to substitute Queensland pine for this timber. The market' price of redwood in New South Wales is 97s. 6d. per 100 feet, and in Victoria 122s. By this substitution a saving of several thousands of pounds per annum will result, in addition to the savings already mentioned. </para>
                    <para>Particulars of other undertakings enabling the Commissioner to obtain certain supplies at greatly reduced prices are being prepared for presentation to Parliament. </para>

                        is entirely wrong when he says that crossbred wools have not appreciated in price as far as Australian manufacturers are concerned. The prices issued by the Central Wool Committee for returns of wool unmanufactured at 30th June, and for ear-marked wool, show, in the case of the Commonwealth Government Mill at North Geelong, an appreciation of 33 per cent, to 120 per cent, over the appraised price. The average increase in price of wool used by this mill is 55 per cent., and in no case is it less than 33 per cent. The increase in the wool from which Defence tweed is manufactured is 60 per cent.

                    <para>.- Throughout my political career I have always been in favour of adhering to our Standing' Orders, but during the. war period it was found necessary to waive them  from time to time when important measures were coming along which had  to be  expeditiously dealt with. Very often we incurred risks by hurriedly dealing with important Bills, and at times some honorable senators, who had not previously received notice of the business to be (transacted, had not a proper opportunity of discussing them. The war period is now over, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> should either give some reasonable excuse for suspending the standing order in question, or allow the business of the Senate- to be conducted in the ordinary way. So far as I can see, there is on  this occasion no particular reason why the standing order should be suspended.  We  appear to have got into this habit, as in connexion with nearly every Bill introduced into the Senate, the Standing Orders have been suspended to enable it <inline font-style="italic">to be</inline> dealt with at once. I think it is the general desire of honorable senators to get away from that habit, and to deal with the different measures according to our Standing Orders. I am not going to strenuously oppose the suspension of standing order 192 on this occasion; but I sincerely trust that it is not  the  intention  of the  Government  to  continue  to  follow the present procedure unless there is a good reason for  so  doing. </para>

                    <para>. - I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has somewhat overlooked the reason for the motion submitted by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Eussell).</inline> The motion has not been moved to curtail debate or with the idea of hurrying the Bill through. We have no control over the other branch of the legislature, and, therefore, cannot say exactly at what time or at what rate they will send us Bills for consideration. The Government have, so far as possible, intimated to honorable senators what their intentions were, and on the motion for the adjournment last week the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that it was expected that this Bill would he introduced in the Senate this week. If we literally follow our Standing Orders, which, I submit, were framed for our protection and convenience, it will mean that the Senate will have to adjourn at this stage, as we have no other business on the notice-paper. It' is the intention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to explain the purpose of the Bill, and after he has delivered his second-reading speech it will be open for &gt;any honorable senator to ask for an adjournment of the debate to enable honorable senators to consider the Minister's speech. It cannot be suggested that the Government are anxious to hurry the measure through, or that honorable senators will be deprived of an opportunity of discussing it. It is, indeed, giving honorable senators an extended opportunity, as honorable senators are not to be asked at this juncture to express themselves concerning its provisions or to record a vote. If the Senate does not favour the proposal, the Government will not be perturbed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is quite right in protesting against the suspension of our . Standing Orders, which have been adopted for the preservation of free debate and of the rights of honorable senators; but I submit that, in the present instance, not only will the opportunities afforded for full discussion not be withdrawn, but they will actually be enlarged by the adoption of the course which has been proposed for our acceptance. </para>

                    <para>..- I desire to say a word or two on behalf of representatives from the more distant States. The Senate has been called together this afternoon, although there is nothing upon the business-paper to engage its attention. Every consideration is extended to the representatives of New South Wales and South Australia, who are enabled to travel to and from their homes once a week; but no consideration whatever is extended to the representatives of Queensland and other distant States. They can visit their homes only at rare intervals when there is a long adjournment. The Government have scarcely treated them fairly by calling the Senate together when there is no business to occupy its attention. Nothing would have been lost had there been an adjournment over this week, and the representatives of distant States would then have been in a position to visit their constituencies. </para>

                <para>I am very much inclined to think that honorable senators will recognise in it an old friend. But, after all, I do not suppose there is to-day a more important question, either in the Commonwealth or in the wide world, than is the industrial one. Every country is at present engaged in a struggle to get back to industrial harmony, so that they may be able to produce more rapidly, more effectively, and more peacefully, with a view to meeting the big responsibilities which lie ahead of them. At the outset I must ask honorable senators to keep well in mind the fact that we already have in existence an Arbitration Act. The Industrial Peace Bill which was recently passed by this Parliament is not the foundation of our industrial legislation, but merely represents an addition to it, which  is  designed to meet the specially chaotic conditions of industry which have arisen out of the recent protracted war. My own opinion is that in Australia the great steadying' factor in industry will eventually prove to be the force which will be exercised by the Arbitration Court. Under normal conditions I believe that the workers, as well as the employers, of this country will be better satisfied to see a steady, orderly progress made in this connexion than to witness the creation of particular tribunals in order to meet special conditions. It is true that we have recently been passing through an abnormal period with the result that abnormal conditions had to be specially dealt with. But for more than twenty years Australia has been attempting to grapple with this industrial question. Until recently, it has been perfectly obvious that the limited powers granted to&gt; this Parliament under our Constitution made it impossible for us to have a workable Arbitration Act. Consequently there has been a tendency for the spirit underlying arbitration to become unpopular with the great majority of the workers of this country. But when we have regard to the fact that the alternative to arbitration is the weapon of the strike it becomes manifest that we must have a Tribunal which will provide the parties <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> industrial disputes with reasonably expeditious and just decisions. </para>
                <para>This Bill does not deal with any new principle. It merely represents an attempt to . simplify the existing machinery by enabling the Arbitration Court to give cheaper and quicker decisions in the cases which come before it. It is also intended to strengthen the powers of the  President,  of the Court by providing that when an award has been made it shall be obeyed in a reasonable manner. We cannot promise to do&gt; certain things if the parties concerned are allowed to thwart the basic principle of the principal Act. Consequently it is "proposed to strengthen the hands of the  President  in regard to this matter. Most of the provisions of the Bill are more suitable? for discussion in Committee. But the measure provides for a broadening of the definition of the terms" strike " and " lock-out." Under the Arbitration Act a strike must be general before the Arbitration Court has any power to act. Under this Bill it is provided that if a strike is only a partial strike, but there is an obvious intention to extend it, it shall be deemed to be a strike within the meaning of the Act. Equally, where a few employers, for the sake of influencing the Court, organize a lock-out in any industry, which is not a complete lock-out, it shall be deemed to be 'a lock-out within the meaning of the principal Act. </para>
                <para>Personally, I believe that a good deal of the present industrial unrest is due to&gt; the  high cost of living, and I know that many employers have been quite willing to grant increased wages to their employees to en-  able the latter to meet that condition. But the conscientious employer, who is obliged to compete with unscrupulous employers, is subject to limitations in this regard. If one man attempted, for sentimental reasons, in competition with his rivals who were not so thoughtful, to increase the wages paid to his employees by 10 or 20 per cent., he would find himself on the sure road to the Insolvency Court, which business men always try to avoid'. But even if employers and employees, by common consent, wanted to  approach the Court, the machinery of the Court was so slow moving, because of technicalities, that it caused them practically to refrain from taking action at all. ' By the time people got through the technical procedure, the application for registration, and the formal process of approach to the Court, and obtained an award, they often found that the conditions had completely changed, and that the cost of living had gone up by 10, 15, or 20 per cent. That sort of delay created .a prejudice, but it was a prejudice against the process of arbitration, rather 'than the spirit or principle of it. </para>
                <para>In the case of a compulsory conference, which could be called by the  President  of the Court to avert a threatened strike, it was necessary for summonses to be personally delivered in each case before the parties could be brought together. We propose, by this Bill, to empower the  President  of the Court to summon any man by telegram to such a conference. That, I think, is only a fair and right provision, because it is the delay that is the real cause of most of the troubles that have occurred in connexion with the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. There are many other reasons, but even before the Public Service organizations were entitled to go to the Court there were still too long delays, some of which were caused by appeals to the High Court. The power of appeal to the High Court on many matters has now been taken away. The . congestion of the business of the Court has been due to a great extent to the tremendous increase in the cost of living, which caused- an all-round demand for increases of wages, and to the fact that the functions of the  President  were extended to cover Public Service cases. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Power has existed for some time to appoint a Deputy President, but under this Bill authority is given to appoint, not only one or two Deputies, but as many as six, if they are necessary to avoid  delays  in the hearing of arbitration cases. I think that provision will have a very great effect in doing away with a good deal of the  prejudice  that exists at present against the Arbitration Court. That prejudice, as I have tried to indicate, is not against the principle of arbitration, but is due to unnecessary and expensive delays, and the impossibility' experienced by many workers of obtaining a decision. </para>
                <para class="block">Another important provision in the Bill relates to the question of the standard hours of labour, lt is an undoubted fact that throughout the world there has been for a number of years a growing tendency to reduce the hours of work, and we in Australia are rather proud of the fact that we practically led the world in that direction. Some people even thought we had struck the ideal number. At this period, recovering as we are from the effects of the war, any action we take to reduce the hours of work must be regarded as a very serious proposition. Every one who takes an interest in public matters must recognise that increased production is necessary to enable all those countries which were engaged in war for the last five years to get out of the financial chaos in which the world now finds itself. I am not dealing with the merits or demerits of any particular number of hours of work per week, but I am justified in pointing out the enormous effect of a reduction of one, two, or three hours per day, expressed in terms of the amount of wealth that this country produces. The same applies to other countries. For this reason the question should be approached scientifically, and should not be decided according to the whim of one or two individuals. Whatever <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> done should be the well-considered and well-investigated policy of some responsible body. For that reason we do not give the power to vary the standard hours of labour to the  President  of the Court alone, or to a Deputy-President, who in ordinary arbitration matters possesses all the powers that belong to the  President.  We provide instead that no decision to increase the hours of labour in any industry can be given by any individual Judge. It must come from a majority of a Bench of at least three Judges. The same provision applies to the reduction of hours. We 'do not purpose interfering with any industry where eight hours is worked today, or with any in which forty-four hours per week is the standard, but we do say that the alteration of the standard of hours is such a serious proposition, particularly during the next few years, if not for even long after that, that it should receive the mature consideration of a body of men, whose majority decision should be final. The number of hours worked is going to be a very big question all over the world, and I believe will not be regulated by law, but it is as well to have in this measure a provision which practically says: " Go steady, and give full consideration to a matter which is so important to this and other countries." I do not want what I have said to be confused in this debate with the discussion of the merits of a six-hour day, or a forty, forty-four, or even forty-eight hour week. That ds not the question. All I contend is that when this biggest of all questions in the labour world comes  on for hearing  it  must not be subject to the whim of perhaps one particular mind, or one particular man or to the conditions of one particular period, but must be fully and exhaustively considered and settled as part of the deliberate policy laid down  in  the decision of the Court. </para>

We propose in this Bill to amend the law by providing that, where new conditions of an abnormal character arise, the Court should have. power to revise an award, because in some cases it would be a greater injustice to keep the award in operation than to alter it to meet the changed conditions. This is a very serious proposition, because when a contract is entered into between a body of employers and a body of employees, fixing wages and conditions of labour over a period of years, , it should be observed at all hazards, if possible. Once a contract is departed from, both side3 lose confidence in it, and it is not so likely to be a success. ' But there are extreme and abnormal cases which must be met, and we are now trying to meet them. We have been through an exceptional period, during which the cost of living has. gone up by an enormous percentage, and no man, woman, or child in Australia can be expected in 1920 to work for the wages which contented them in 1914. The machinery of the Court was not sufficiently mobile to enable people to get quick decisions to meet these constantly changing conditions. We propose by this Bill to alter that state of things. </para>
                <para>There was very limited power in the principal Act for the  President  to appoint a Board of Reference. As a rule these Boards of Reference deal with petty questions arising in connexion with the conduct of different industries. The High Court has ruled that a Board of Reference has power only to deal with matters referred to in any award or agreement registered in the Court. Such  a Board may be called upon to deal with a dozen little difficulties arising in a work-shop. It is. our desire to take the means of arbitration to the workers, in order, if possible, to prevent strikes. </para>
                <para>Under this Bill power is given to the Arbitration Court to appoint Boards of Reference and to extend the scope of their operations, in order to enable them, if possible, to nip industrial disputes in the bud. An important matter which may be dealt with by a Board of Reference is the matter of demarcation in connexion with any industry. Any one who has any knowledge of the work of trade unions must be aware that the question of  demarcation, especially in big industries, such as shipbuilding and coal mining, is a frequent source of quarrelling amongst the workers themselves; and this Â©rings about conditions which have practically the same effect as a strike. It was quite a common thing' in Great Britain, especially before the war, to have strikes amongst workers because of disputes amongst themselves, with which their employers and the community had nothing whatever to do. Those disputes arose because of differences of opinion on questions of demarcation. For instance, plumbers and engineers have quarrelled amongst themselves .as to the size of pipe which should be handled by either a plumber or an engineer. There is, I suppose, some border line setting bounds to the operations of particular craftsmen- </para>

                        <para>- There are a great many, and some very large clubs in Melbourne, Sydney, and other capital cities of the Commonwealth. I do not say that these clubs do not pay their employees decent wages. I believe that, in the majority of cases, they pay better wages than are paid to employees performing similar work for hotels and restaurants; but if any clubs do not pay fair wages, their employees should be given the protection of the Arbitration Court. I fail to see why a pantryman who works at Menzies' Hotel should have a right to appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to secure fair wages and conditions, if a man working for the Commercial Travellers' Club, for instance, is not given a similar right. I do not think that any of the clubs would expect to be given special privileges by being excluded from the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. No decent employer who is prepared to treat his employees well has anything to fear from the operation of this measure. I hope that its various clauses will receive close consideration from honorable senators in Committee, because the measure is calculated to have a most important effect upon the conduct of industries in Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to reply to some remarks made by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> earlier in the afternoon, in reference to the increase in the price of tweeds manufactured by the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong, and purporting to disprove a statement I made last week in reference to the present prices of crossbred wools. The information given to the Minister by the manager of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills was correct in one respect, but, I think, somewhat misleading in the main. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Under the appraisement scheme the manufacturers of Australia obtained the whole of their supplies at the following prices:- In 1916-17, at 11.17d. per lb.; in 1917-18 at 12.59d.; in 1918-19, at 13.09d.; and in  1919-20,  -when they took a higher grade of wool, at 15.36d. per lb. The average for all the wool taken by the manufacturers of Australia for three years and a half during the operation of the wool appraisement scheme was 14.23d. per lb. </para>
                    <para>Under the appraisement scheme the woollen manufacturers of Australia were given first choice of the wool in each catalogue in any part of Australia at the original appraised price; but since the close of the appraisement scheme, on the 30th June last, the woollen manufacturers of Australia, including the  Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong, would have been able to get their crossbred supplies of wool at considerably below the flat rate of 15Â½d. per lb. <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline> warehouse at which it was sold to the British Government. The British Government paid, as a matter of fact, 16Â¼d. per lb., and manufacturers in other parts of the world paid from 100" to 400 per cent, more than the average rate of 14.23d. per lb. at which Australian manufacturers, including the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, were able to secure their wool supplies. . </para>
                    <para>As I have said on a previous occasion, the Commonwealth Woollen Mills are very well managed, so well managed, indeed, that, during the year ended 30th June, 1919, because they were getting their wool so very cheaply from Australian growers, whilst they were able to supply splendid tweeds at from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per yard, after writing down for depreciation on machinery the fullest amount allowed, and properly keeping their books, as is shown by their balance-sheet, of which honorable senators received a copy the other day, they made a profit for the year, selling tweeds at' the low price I have mentioned, amounting to no less than Â£22,689. We can imagine from this figure what sort of - a profit other manufacturers in Australia were making from the sale of tweeds, not at 6s. 6d. or 7s. 6d. per yard, but at double those prices. </para>
                    <para>With respect to the remarks made  by  the Minister for Defence in reference <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> present wool supplies, it should be remembered that the Central Wool Committee, knowing that the appraisement scheme was to be brought to a close on the 30th June, notified all manufacturers,. including the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, that they' would be able to secure their reasonable requirements up to  that  date at the appraised price, which, as I have mentioned, averaged , 14.23d. per  lb. ,  and, further, that any wool they might require to carry them on until the  new  clip became available, and it is  available  now, would have to be ear-marked  by  them, and they would be given  an  option over same at the world's parity. </para>
                    <para>I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Goldfinch, who is at the head of  the  British Department now running  the  great wool purchase, cabled out  to  the Central Wool Committee here,  telling  the Committee what price they  were,  to charge for this ear-marked wool. Whilst the London market for wool, since the  appraisement  scheme -closed, is from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, higher for fine  wool  than the appraisement prices, it is very much lower for coarse sorts of wool.  The  Australian manufacturers, including  the  Commonwealth Woollen Mills, thinking that prices are fictitiously high, are  not  taking the wools they were given  the  option to take, for the simple reason that they can buy in the open market at a very much lower price. There is any amount of wool available today to the woollen manufacturers of Australia, including the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, suitable for making the best tweeds, at from 10 per cent, to 15 percent, below appraisement prices. </para>

                            <para>- They  are  purchasing them. . Wools are divided  into different qualities, according to spinning counts. Wool-owners are selling, every day, 50's to 40's at from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, below appraisement prices on the 30th June last, and are prepared to sell, thousands of bales at  those  prices. In the circumstances, I fail to see what justification the Government can plead for increasing the price of tweeds. Tweeds suitable for returned soldiers, and the very best tweeds, can be made out of fleece wools of 46's and 50's qualities. If the manufacturers cared to take a lower quality, they might make nearly as' good a tweed, and obtain the wool practically at their own price. </para>

                    <para>We are facing a colossal difficulty in Australia at the present time. We have about 1,000,000 bales of wool', for which it is particularly hard to obtain a market. The coming clip of Australian wool will amount to 1,600,000 bales and probably we shall be unable to obtain a satisfactory bid for 500,000 bales of that wool,  simply because the stronger qualities of wool are not in favour, being temporarily out of fashion. Nevertheless, the Government made most of their tweeds out of 50's from the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. </para>

                            <para>- On present prices for cross-bred wool, they could make tweeds at 5s. a yard, and it would pay them well, because they could come down' one count to 447s, which is 20 to 25, per cent, below appraisement prices. Knowing these facts, I say that it is merely throwing so. much dust in the eyes of the public to state that manufacturers have to pay from 30 to 120 per cent, above- appraisement prices. If anybody wants the finest silky merino ear -marked wool for clothing, he will have to pay a great deal more; but our manufacturers are not taking those wools in any quantity. Growers are selling' every day to the Australian manufacturers wool at considerably below appraisement prices, and are prepared to sell, probably, 500,000 bales at 20 per cent, under appraisement rates. In view of all these facts, I fail to see any justification for the increase in the price of tweeds from the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. There is no reason why the nubile of Australia should be called upon to pay exorbitant prices for their clothing. </para>

                        <para>There is no justification for the rise in the price of clothing. The movement should be in the reverse direction. The excuse made by the manufacturers, and, I understand, by the Government, for the increased prices which they threaten to charge for tweeds, is that since the appraisement of wool ceased on 30th June last, the price of wool has gone higher. . . . I wish to point out reasons why the long-suffering public have claims to be represented on these tribunals. Whether there is or is not collusion between employers and employees when wages and prices are put up, there is no justification whatever for increasing the price, of clothing to-day. </para>

                            <para>- And I am going to prove one or two things before I sit down. I can, of course, speak only of the tweed manufacturing industry in my own State, but I can speak from firsthand knowledge of two large factories. One mill uses not less than 25 per cent, of the highest quality wool, and the other not less than 60 per cent, of the highest quality wool. Neither buys the cheapest sorts for the purpose of tweed manufacture. </para>

A dissection of the long list of purchases by this firm shows that the prices they agreed to give for merino combings averaged 96 per cent, above appraised rates; for one line of crossbreds an increase of 40 per cent., another at 49 per cent., another at 61 per cent., and on still another 65 per cent, will be paid over the flat rate controlled price. </para>

I want to place before the Senate a clear understandable statement of the real position, and I say that so far as this particular firm is concerned all the crossbred wool that they earmarked for use in their factory for the manufacture 'of tweed, until the wool sales commence, has been priced to them by the Central Wool Committee at from 40 per cent, to 65 per cent, above the flat rate. I am prepared to stand by this statement. If 5s. per lb. is given for the best merino, it will only furnish a yield of 57 per cent, of wool, and this in its turn will only give 40 per cent, of tops. </para>

                            <para>- I have proof of my statement, and I shall be glad to show it to the honorable senator. It can be proved in the ordinary way, and by information direct from the Central Wool Committee. It will be seen that if 5s. per lb. is given for merino wool, which! will produce only 40 per cent, of tops, which, after all, is practically raw material for clothing, the wool for tops will cost 12s. 6d. per lb. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said that Australian tweed was being manufactured only from crossbred wool. I have already said that the minimum charge to the factories was 40 per cent., that the maximum was 65 per cent., more on crossbred, and that in the case of  merino it went up to 96 per cent. more. In regard to profits, are there not others than the wool-growers who are entitled to make profits? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> thinks that the tweed manufacturers have done very well. The Inter-State Commission has pointed out that they have made 16 or 18 per cent, profit on their capital, but we must remember that they also have to pay income tax and a war-time profits tax out of that. </para>

                                F. Guthrie has also suggested that an extraordinary price was charged for the cloth. Some time ago I brought down, and laid on the table of the Senate, samples, to which prices were attached, of tweeds that were being distributed by factories in Australia. The lowest price, so far as my memory serves me, was 6s. 6d. per yard, and the highest price for the best colonial tweed manufactured was 12s. 6d. per yard. I do not think that the tweed factories of Australia, which, on the whole, acted in a very fair manner during the war period, 'should all be besmirched by reason of the fact that tailors, retailers, and wholesale merchants charge high prices; and it is only fair that we should place the facts before the people. As far as New South Wales is concerned, there is an increase of 28 per cent, in wages since January, as a result of the operation of the basic wage principle. There is an average increase of at least 40 per cent, in wool, and on one invoice there was an increase of more than 50 per cent, on ear-marked wool wanted before the sales commenced. The increase in price that the factory charged to the distributor was only 25. per cent. I have said sufficient to disprove two definite statements which have been made in this Chamber, The first is that Australian tweed was made from crossbred wool and nothing else, and the second that instead of the price of the cloth going up it ought to come down, owing to the wool being cheaper.

                            <para>- It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to say " Hear, hear," but I believe in fair play and in meeting facts as they really are. I have submitted definite statements, and I am prepared to stand by them. I have shown the Senate in two specific cases what Australian manufacturers have had to pay. In one instance they had to pay over -Â£2,000 more on a Â£5,000 stock, and in another an average increase of over 50 per cent, on the merino and crossbred wool ear-marked. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who represents the wool-growing and grazing industry, to remember that the extra money being paid by the tweed manufacturers is going into the pockets of the wool-growers, and I do not begrudge the wool-growers securing the highest possible price they can for their commodity. I say, " Good luck to them," because it will be better for Australia. We have to remember, however, that there is no necessity to besmirch a very important Australian industry, and there is no occasion to make inaccurate statements which, if they go out to the public, will also be the means of creating unnecessary unrest and dissension. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government are primarily interested in this matter, because they decided some time ago to offer to every returned sailor, soldier, and nurse a suit length of tweed. The Government fixed the price at practically the cost of production, including the overhead charges, and entered into an agreement with the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia to distribute suit lengths. As we were not controlling the price of wool, a condition was embodied in the agreement that if there was an increase in the price of wool the cost of the tweed would have to be correspondingly raised, and when an increase occurred, we notified the League accordingly. I was, therefore, concerned when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> F. Guthrie made certain statements' in the Senate, on 4th August, and [ called for a report from the manager, because it was obvious to me that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> statements were correct we would not be justified in increasing the price. I could not understand why the manager submitted a request for an increased price if the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> were accurate. The manager's report has now been submitted to the Senate, and it has not been brought forward to in any way shield other manufacturers if they have been charging too much. I do not wish to take ut&gt;  that attitude, and I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> owing te the nature of his profession, has an intimate knowledge of the wool trade'. I would not pit my opinions against his, and I would hesitate to criticise any of his statements on such a subject. This debate, at any rate, has shown that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has revised some of the statements be made in this Chamber on the previous occasion.

                                inadvertently I am sure, stated to-day that the profit made by the Commonwealth' Woollen Mill had been on the basis upon which we are now supplying tweed to returned soldiers, but that is not correct. During the war the price of the tweed used for the manufacture of uniforms, flannels, and blankets was fixed in this way : . First of all, the Commonwealth Government took over the woollen mills, and then had to arrive at what would be a fair price, to pay for the products. A conference was held between the officials of the Defence Department and the woollen manufacturers, and
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline>
                                who was the manager of the Commonwealth Woollen Mill, was asked to submit expert advice on the' cost of manufacture as he would be guided by his own experience in that mill. The result of the investigation was taken to the Business Board, and the cost charged to the Department was adjusted by the Board from time to time on the fact3 submitted after allowing a reasonable profit. The Commonwealth Woollen Mill was credited with the same price per yard, according to the material produced, as other manufacturers were receiving, and a profit was made on that basis, and not on the basis of what we are now getting for the tweed we are selling to returned soldiers. It is correct to say that the manufacturers themselves did not fix the price at which they sold the products, and, furthermore, whilst the average profit on the capital invested appears large, it has to be remembered, as I interjected when

                            <para>- They are not making blue serge for officers' uniforms, but tweed for soldiers' suit lengths. Whilst I bow to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> knowledge of 'the wool trade, in regard to the manufacture of tweed,I prefer to accept the view which has been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson,</inline> the manager of the mill; and, after all, this. is a question of the manufacture, and not of the sale, of wool. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> can have no possible interest in increasing the cost of tweeds to the soldiers. By doing- so, he does not get any addition to his salary. Upon the other hand, he knows that there will be a little bit of opposition exhibited by our returned1 soldiers to any increase in the cost of those tweeds. Consequently, it is to his interest to purchase the cheaper wools of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has spoken, if, by its use, he can turn out an article of equal quality. But suppose . that he does what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has suggested, can he assure us that we shall have no complaints as to the inferior quality of the tweed which we shall be supplying? We have undertaken to supply tweeds of a quality up to the samples which we have given to the League, and we must adhere to that condition. It is part of the contract. We have to supply this tweed at a given price, and the only increase which we can charge the League is the increased cost to us of the raw material. That is the position as it appears to me. I shall certainly refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> further remarks to the manager of the mill, with a view to seeing if the scheme which he has outlined is a practical one. If we can get suitable wool at a cheaper price, why should we not do so? </para>

                            <para>- We must keep to our agreement, even if it costs us more to do so ; but if we can carry out that agreement, whilst purchasing cheaper wools, there is no reason why we should not do so. That is the only interest which I have in this debate. I do not wish the impression to go forth to our returned soldiers that in supplying them with these tweeds the Commonwealth is making a greater profit than that to which it is entitled. The only increase which it is permissible for us to charge them is the increase in the cost of our raw material, and, according to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson,</inline> that material has appreciated in price to the extent of 55 per cent. </para>
