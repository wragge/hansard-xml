                            <para>- The answer is- 1  and  2.  Members of the instructional staff who attained commissioned rank while serving in the Australian Imperial Force are being granted commissions  on  the unattached list of the Citizen Forces  or  in the Permanent Forces as the  case  may be. This privilege is  not being  accorded  to  members of  the  instructional stall who did  not  proceed on active service. </para>

                            <para>- The answer is-  1 and  2.  As the reports of military commandants are furnished for the information of the Minister, and to enable him to arrive at a decision, it is not considered advisable to make such reports public. The honorable senator  can be assured that all reports and recommendations of commandants will be given full consideration in connexion with the preparation of the Estimates. </para>

                GARDINER  (New South Wales) I must enter my protest against this method of procedure. The Senate has not met for some weeks, and now the Minis  tgr  forDefense.
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline>
                after being allowed &#39;without objection to carry the first reading of, this Bill, proposes the suspension  of  a standing order to enable him to move . the second reading. No honorable senator is at present in a position to gauge the importance of this measure, and I think  it  should be in the hands of honorable senators sufficiently long to enable them to know what its provisions are, so that they may follow the speech of the Minister in moving the second leading. I enter my protest against the suspension of  the  standing order. It may be the idea of some honorable senators that to get business done quickly is to get it done well, but that is not myidea.

                    <para>.-I should like to allay any alarm which might be created by the remarks of  SenatorGardiner.  The motion for the suspension  of  the standing order has been moved to enable the very thing to be done which the honorable senator thinks ought to be done. It is proposed to so far suspend the Standing Orders as &#39; to enable the Minister for Defence to make his second-reading speech, and thus explain the provisions of the Bill. After  he  has done so, I have  no  doubt that he will agree to any reasonable adjournment of the debate that honorable senators may desire to enable them to study the provisions of the Bill, and, if they think fit, the speech which the  Minister will make in  moving the second reading. </para>

                        <para>- Very well. I shall adopt the Minister&#39;s suggestion. The Minister apparently, thinks that no matter what course he takes, he may do so without explanation, because he feels secure in his &#34; common-sense&#34; following. Our Standing Orders were drafted by a Committee of the Senate for the purpose of conducting the business of this Chamber in a regular manner, but the Minister for Defence, with the &#34; common-sense &#34; following, again adopting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen&#39;s suggestion, simply moves for the suspension&#39; of a standing order without offering any explanation. I protest against this course. If we cannot get through our business without suspending Standing Orders it would be much better if we altered them. Or why have Standing Orders at all, if, without reason, they may be suspended at the will of a Minister? It is of no use for honorable senators to say that we all know what is in the Bill. We do not. The Bill, for all I know to the contrary, may have a very important bearing upon the Public Service, and it should take the ordinary course of being placed on honorable senators&#39; files, after the first reading, so that we may become acquainted with it, and, perhaps, suggest improvements or point out defects; and, moreover, those in the Public Service and most concerned in it would then have an opportunity of ascertaining what its provisions mean. If we suspend standing order 192 and allow the Minister to deliver his second-reading speech he might then graciously agree not to proceed with  the Bill until, perhaps, to-morrow morning, when it might go right through. -The Standing Orders governing our procedure reflect the wisdom of centuries of parliamentary practice. They describe the method by which any Bill should be taken. This hurry is particularly obnoxious, because if persisted in, no honorable senator will have an opportunity of studying a measure before it is passed. Our Standing Orders provide for the various stages of a Bill. There are the first reading, second reading, and the Committee, report, and third reading stages, which experience has shown are essential where bodies of men are called upon to deal with measures affecting the public welfare. This Bill might, of course, be a very unimportant one. On the other hand, it might be all-important, and these safeguards concerning the different stages of the measure should not be set aside at the will of a Minister, backed by a &#34; common-sense &#34; majority, prepared to vote Yes or No at the dictation of their leaders. If this measure is urgent, why have we been absent during the last three weeks. As a matter of fact, it will not surprise me if, in the course of a week or two, we are again released from work, and so I protest against this attempt to hurry Bills through without adequate discussion, because, possibly, of a desire to get away. Personally; I have no wish to remain here, particularly while the Parliament is sitting in Melbourne, which, from a health point of view, is a most objectionable place. </para>

                        <para>- This Parliament is fresh from the people, and possibly the Ministers in charge of business in the Senate feel that the people approve  of this method of conducting public business here. If that be so, why should I hamper Ministers by attempting to delay the Senate, even for a few minutes, to object to the suspension of a standing order ? I can quite realize, of course, bow much it would add to the harmony of the thirty-five representatives in this Chamber if I allowed business to proceed without delay, and if the business is to be conducted in this way I may, perhaps, take other steps ,to relieve honorable senators of my obnoxious presence. </para>

                        <para>- Of course the honorable senator does. It is merely outside propaganda. It is not very long ago that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself informed us that the Senate was greater than its Standing Orders when he wished them to be suspended for his convenience. The Senate is greater than the Standing Orders; but let us see if we are doing anything detrimental to the interests of the people. If the Senate declined to allow the Minister for Defence to explain the Bills it would mean that we would have to adjourn after a short sitting until to-morrow, when the second readings would be moved. Such a procedure would not inconvenience the Minister in charge of the measures as much as it would the Senate generally, and by adopting the procedure suggested we are expediting business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> suggested that reasons should be submitted for the action we are taking; but I stated in the Senate yesterday that it was the intention of the Government to act in this manner to enable the second-reading speeches to be delivered on two measures, and then to ask for a reasonable adjournment so that honorable senators would be in a position to study the Minister&#39;s explanations. That is a business-like way of proceeding. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> suggest that we should be continally in session and adhere closely to the conditions which the Standing Orders prescribe? Is he prepared to be present on every occasion if it means a meeting of only ten minutes? If that is the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion, I am prepared to accept his sincerity on its face value. </para>

                        <para>- I am fully conscious that the honorable senator has been here more often than I appreciate. He stated that the first reading was moved without a word&#39; of explanation, and I am surprised that such an old parliamentarian should expect a discussion on the first reading, which, under our Standing Orders, is merely a formal motion. The proper opportunity of explaining the provisions of a Bill is on the second-reading stage, and the Minister in charge of these measures is only asking the Senate, to allow the Bills to reach that stage today rather than to-morrow. That is a business-like course to adopt, and one which will commend itself to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. -  As one who has on several occasions voted against the suspension of the Standing Orders, I desire to deal with one or two phases of the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> There are times when the suspension of- the Standing Orders is purely a matter of common sense - anti-red tape - and this in an occasion when I believe it will be entirely for the benefit of honorable senators if the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is permitted to deliver his second-reading speech. There are, however, occasions -when the suspension of the Standing Orders is not in the interests of the Senate, such an occasion, for instance, as when there is a rush of business towards the end of a session and when the consideration of Bills has been delayed owing to protracted debate in another place. Under such circumstances, we have been called upon to discuss measures of great importance without having had an opportunity of fully understanding what is involved. Under such circumstances - speaking generally - I am likely to oppose the suspension of the Standing Orders; especially when moved at the end of a long and protracted sitting when honorable senators are wearied. I trust that the Government will remember that there will be some opposition to the suspension of the Standing Orders under such conditions. I believe that honorable senators generally will sympathize with the Government when confronted with unforeseen difficulties which are not of their own creation. We are entitled to review and discuss legislation passed in another place in a proper manner, and, in a sense of fairness, the Government should allow this Chamber reasonable time to consider what we have before us. I believe the motion we are now discussing has been moved for the convenience of honorable senators, and, not being a servile but a common-sense supporter of the Government, I support it. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to know that in a few moments the little error complained of, will. Have been rectified,. Copies of the Bill should have been here, and I had a definite promise that they would be here at 3 o&#39;clock. I am sorry that they were, not available at that time, for I specially asked that . they should, be here, so that honorable senators should have copies when I was moving the second reading. There has been no general amendment of the Public Service laws of the Common wealth for&#34; many &#34; years, although there have been some temporary amendments to get over temporary difficulties. It is obvious&#39; that, with&#34; the lapse of years, and the change, that has been taking place in public affairs, our Public Service laws need overhauling, and the Government propose during this session to bring forward various Bills which will effect a complete revision &#39;of the whole of the. legislation dealing with the Public Service. These twoBills - the one of which. I am moving the second reading now, and the other, which is to follow - are, only part of the plan of. the Government to deal with the Public Service. They will be followed by a Bill dealing generally with the conditions of the Service, and. also by a supplementary Bill dealing with the question of superannuation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, all our Acts are subsequently printed as consolidated Acts. The Bill I am now presenting is perhaps one of the most important of the four, because it constitutes a striking; and important change in the management and control of the Public Service. Under the Public Service Act of 1902-1918, the Service was placed under the control of a Commissioner, who had six inspectors, one in each State.. This Bill proposes to replace the Commissioner with a Board of Management; but it proposes, also, to give to that Board much more extended powers than have been possessed by. the Commissers. The very term applied to the Board indicates . that it will have something more to do than merely to deal with the questions of appointments, promotions, transfers, and classification. It, will be found on a survey of this Bill that it creates, as the term implies, a real Board of Management of the Public ServicedTheBoard will consist of a  chairman  and two, members. One of the members will be appointed for five years, one for four years, and one for three years, and the subsequent&#39; appointments will be for a term term. not. exceeding five years. ; The object&#39; of that variation ; in the terms of. the. appointments is to secure continuity of policy in the management: of the Public ; Service by insuring that all three of the members of the Board shall not retire at any one time. The members of the Board will, . ofcourse,be eligible for reappointment; but. if they all retired at the one time and three new appointments were made, there might easily be a break in the continuity, of the policy. </para>

The members of the Board can, be removed from office only by a joint resolution of both Houses of Parliament. In case of misbehaviour or incapacity, they can be suspended by the Governor-General; but that suspension must be reported to Parliament within a set period, and will not become effective unless Parliament, by a joint resolution, indorses it. </para>
                    <para>In order to show the extended powers that are given to the Board, I shall quote and direct attention to clause 11. It must be&#39; remembered, first of all, that the Bill incorporates in the Board all the powers that are given to the. Commissioner by the existing Act, and then proceeds to give to it these additional powers, and duties - </para>

Under this proposal the audit will take place, not after the money has been spent, but before it is spent, or while it is being expended. The clause of the Bill from which I have quoted shows that the Board of Management may be asked to report upon contracts and methods of supply, or that a particular contract for supplies may be referred to them for report. I say. as a Minister of some experience, that it will be of immense advantage to a Minister, especially in dealing with large contracts for buildings, to have, in addition to the departmental o&#39;fficers, no matter how efficient and well qualified they may be, another body of capable and qualified men to give a second judgment upon any particular proposal. No Minister of the Crown, however industrious he may be, can find time to personally make a detailed examination of all contracts for supplies. It is necessary that he . should have a thoroughly independent judgment upon such contracts apart from: the recommendations submitted to him by his departmental officers. </para>

                        has raised the objection that this may lead to centralization. I cannot see that the appointment of a Board&#39; of Management will lead to centralization any more than the appointment of an Auditor-General does. We must centralize the responsibility, but it is obvious that, as the public audit is carried out in the various States now by officers working under the Auditor-General, so inspection and a considerable amount of the work of the Board of Management will have to be carried out in the various States by officers responsible to the Board. But there is nothing to prevent members of the Board visiting the different States, especially in connexion with any matters specially referred to them for report.  I can speak as a Minister who has had some experience of a Board of this charac-  &#34;  ter,  because during the war a Business Board in connexion with the Defence Administration was set up, which proved to be of great value to the Department. Although the head-quarters of that Board were in Melbourne, the members of it continually visited various States and personally inspected hospitals and other institutions carried on by the Defence Department. The members of the proposed Board of Management of the Public Service will be able to do the same.

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. I can quote a case in point of a contract involving the expenditure of a very large sum of money, which I referred to that Business Board for report. The  chairman  of the Board told me that he took up weeks of his time in investigating the details of that contract. It was impossible for me to give as many minutes as he gave days to the investigation of that contract. No Minister  of the Crown can attend to Parliament, to the Cabinet, and to the details of departmental work, and, in addition, give the time which the Defence Department Business Board was able to give to the consideration of the contract to which I have referred. Even if the Minister had the same qualifications as members of the Board, he has not the time to give to this particular business. From this stand-point, I say that it is a good thing for the Public Service that there should be a Board, invested with power to examine all propositions involving expenditure, that will be free from any responsibility for policy, and from the responsibilities which a departmental officer may naturally feel to back up advice which he has previously  given  to his Minister. It is perfectly natural that an officer, having recommended : certain . action to his Minister, should. feel <inline font-style="italic">;it.</inline> incumbent upon him to: justify- his recommendation. This Board of Management,&#39; &#39;.dealing with . departmental proposals, and criticising them with an unprejudiced mind, must lead to economy in the- Service. </para>

                    <para>It is obvious that if the Board of Management is to be -&#39;of : the value we hope it will be, it must be &#39;invested with considerable powers&#39; in the direction I have indicated, and also over the Departments themselves. &#34;We know -that there is such a thing as passive resistance, and unless a Board of this kind -is&#62; armed with proper authority to enter a&#39; Department, call for persons and papers,, take evidence and do what its. members may-. consider necessary to pursue &#39; their inquiry, they may find themselves up against &#34;the &#187; wall of passive resistance, represented&#39; sometimes by the expression &#34;red tape,&#34; and may be unable to do any useful work. Extensive powers are, therefore, to be given! to&#39; the Board of Management to enable them to thoroughly carry out the duties imposed upon them. <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> The appointment of a Board of Management opens up a new avenue, inasmuch as it will give to Parliament  a power which it has not hitherto had, to obtain a direct report upon the work of Public Departments that will not- come through any &#39; official or Ministerial channel. A good. deal is said in these days of the restoration of parliamentary control of finance. That is&#39; a very high-sounding phrase,- but there is a good deal. of humbug often talked -by those who use it. How can Parliament really assert an effective control over finance unless it knows from independent sources all that is going on ? There is no blinking the fact that at present Parliament has to depend on the honesty of Ministers for the completeness with which they put a case before it to enable it to estimate the advantages and disadvantages of any particular- proposal. Human nature being what it is, one can readily understand that at times the best side is put foremost and the worst side kept out of sight. In this Bill it is proposed to give the Board of Management the power to make not only an annual report to Parliament, but also to report upon any particular matter coming within the scope of the business of a permanent head, or Minister in charge of a department. If the Board is unable to indorse what- has been done in any particular matter, they will be able to make a report to that effect, and it will then be for Parliament to say. .whether it will stand by the Minister and approve his action, or will carry out the policy recommended by&#39; the Board of Management. </para>

Of course, if members of the ..Board feel strongly on any matter, that is to&#39; say, if they feel they are being blocked by a Minister or the permanent head of the Department, they would be foolish if they did not take Parliament into their confidence. </para>

                    <para class="block">MayInowsayaword about the powers of the: Public Service Commissioner, which under this Bill will pass over to the Board .  When first appointed the Public ServiceCommissioner had a great deal more power, and more duties than he has to-day. He had authority to fix salaries in the various grades, power of classification, power to determine conditions, rates of increments, and so on; but under the Public Service Arbitration Act he has practically none of these responsibilities; they have passed over to a Public Service . Arbitration Judge. Under this Bill the. proposed Board will bo charged with the duty of fixing rates of salary, increments, conditions of employment, classification, promotion, and kindred matters, but there will be the right of appeal from the Board to a Public Service-Arbitrator, whose appointment is provided for in the. Bill next to be submitted to the Senate. At present the decisions of the Public Service Commissioner are revisable by a number of industrial and other authorities, some of whom have little or &#39;no knowledge of Public Service conditions whatsoever, and when I am submitting the other Bill to which I have referred, I shall endeavour to show why - seeing that the Public Service stands by itself, and does not link up with industrial avocations generally -we should have available to us the services of men immersed in the study of the Public Service as a whole and therefore more qualified to register satisfactory decisions. . Members of this Board will be so immersed in the study of PublicService condition&#39;s. They will have executive power as regards the fixing of salaries, , promotions, transfers, and other matters. They so, to speak, will bethe eyes of Parliament as to the actions of Ministers. and the expenditure of public money, and. if an appeal from their decisions can be made to another, authority, also familiar, and by reason of his position kept familiar with the Public Service, we shall, I think, have a much more- workable scheme than the present haphazard and disjointed system. </para>

At all events, we can adjourn the debate till Wednesday next; and if there are any good reasons why it should not be proceeded with then I shall be prepared to consider them. I hope that the Bill will commend itself to honorable senators, and that they will give the Government the benefit of any suggestions they have to make in order to perfect it. The one desire of the Government is to insure an efficient Public Service and that the taxpayers get full value for money spent through Government channels. </para>

                    <para>The Public Service Arbitration Act 1911 provides for the application of the principle of arbitration on the lines laid down in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and also that various branches of the Public Service may form and register as organizations, and obtain awards in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court in the same manner as outside industrial organizations. This Bill does not alter that principle in so far as the methods of obtaining registration and approaching the prescribed tribunal are concerned, but it provides for the appointment of a special Arbitrator - the appointment to be for a period of seven years - to carry out the administration of that Act. It is proposed to give him a salary of &#163;2,000 per annum, although this is not specifically set out in the Bill. If it were, the measure could not be initiated in the Senate. The Arbitrator may be suspended by the Governor-General for 40 days for misbehaviour or incapacity, but he will be removable from office only on a joint address from both Houses. There are the usual conditions in regard to engaging in outside employment as in the case of Judges. Under this Bill an organization will have authority to file plaints- </para>

                            <para>- No, there will be no limitation in the selection. As I have said, an organization, if dissatisfied with the salaries fixed, or other matter determined by the Board of management, will have authority to file a plaint before the Arbitrator, who will then submit it to the Board of management or to the Minister concerned, and if no appearance be made, the Arbitrator will have power to concede the claim of the claimant organization. If, However, the Board of management lodges an objection to the plaint, the Arbitrator will be empowered to call a conference of the members of the organization concerned, and the Board of management or the Minister&#39;s representative, or both, as the case may be, will , hear evidence and have power to make an award. This, substantially, is the procedure followed under the Public Service Arbitration Act. </para>

In the first place, the Government think that as the conditions and nature of employment in the Public Service are different from private employment, it is essential to provide a special tribunal for all matters in dispute. At present an Arbitration Judge might to-day be dealing with a plaint by shearers; to-morrow with a plaint lodged by linesmen, or clerks, or some branch of the clerical division; and the following day with a case affecting miners. It is obvious that, under these circumstances, he could not be expected to have that thorough grasp of Public Service conditions generally as might be expected of an Arbitrator whose sole duty would be to deal with Public Service cases. </para>

                            <para>- It may be, but what I have said is happening every day, and I am not, in any sense, reflecting upon the existing Arbitration Court when I say that every judgment given in Public Service cases leads to confusion. Such a condition of affairs must result so long as -we have a Court dealing&#39; with numerous&#39; cases and conflicting interests. If we have an Arbitrator dealing with the Public Service as a whole, and nothing but the Public Service, be will become saturated with its conditions, and will have a better knowledge of its work than an arbitration Judge who has to deal with cases covering all sections of our industrial life. This Bill should, therefore, provide the means of obtaining something approaching a connected&#39; policy in the determination of the pay and conditions of our Public Service. At present we have two separate Judges dealing with similar classes of employment in the Public Service, and awarding varying rates of pay and conditions. No sooner is one award made -than another branch of the Service becomes dissatisfied, and lodges a complaint because of the differing pay and conditions. It really resolves itself into a game of seesaw, and the measure has been drafted in the hope of making the conditions more harmonious and to prevent conflicting judgments. </para>

                    <para>It will also be the means of facilitating the hearing of cases in our ordinary Arbitration Courts. Honorable senators have recently been bombarded&#39; with circulars requesting them to use their influence with the Government in facilitating the passage of business through the Arbitration Courts. If honorable senators will peruse the list of plaints awaiting hearing, they will find that more than one-third relate to the Public Service. If this Court ie established it will relieve the congestion in the ordinary Arbitration Courts, eb the Public Service cases awaiting hearing will be dealt with by another authority.  Under present conditions considerable delay and irritation is experienced, and unless a change is made there is a danger of direct action being encouraged. </para>

                <para>I desire to bring before the Senate a confirmation of what I quoted yesterday from the historical records of New South Wales. I was quoting from memory, but I find my memory served me well,&#39; when I referred to the manner in which a certain Methodist minister was treated a hundred years ago. As there seemed to be some doubt as to the correctness of my statement, I have taken the following extracts from a letter from Governor Macquarie to Earl Bathurst. It reads : - &#39; </para>
                <para>Whilst on this subject, I beg leave to report to your lordship that in the month of August last a person named Samuel Leigh arrived here on board the ship <inline font-style="italic">Hebe,</inline> merchantman, without any letter or  pass  from your Lordship&#39;s office. This person is a Methodist preacher, and was sent out at the expense of that .society to preach the gospel in this colony. This man has conducted himself very quietly and inoffensively since his arrival, and I have no fault to find with him, as he is no expense to the Grown. But though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leigh&#39;s</inline> eonduct has been hitherto very correct here, still I should strongly recommend that no person of this description should in future be permitted to come out to this colony. We require regular and pious clergymen of the Church of England, and not sectaries, for ft new and rising colony like this. </para>
