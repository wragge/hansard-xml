                    <para class="block">The amount which the Government desire to borrow under this Bill is £4,286,490. That is the total estimated cost of the works proposed to be carried out. There is already available under appropriations made by previous Acts, £305,768, and the total amount required is £4,592,258. This is essentially a Committee Bill, and in moving the second reading I shall content myself with stating the total amounts required for the different Departments. For the Prime Minister's Department the amount required is £186,500; for the Department of the Treasury - for the construction of ships - £3,000,000; for the Home and Territories Department, £96,175; for the Works and Railways Department, £976,269 ; for the Department of the Navy, £69,500 ; for the Trade and Customs Department, £40,000; and for the redemption of Northern Territory Loans, £223,814. These figures make up the total of £4,592,258. Two-thirds of the total amount covered by the Bill is required for carrying on the ship construction programme, particulars of which were given in the Budget speech. </para>
                    <para class="block">Last year £2,198,000 was spent on  the  construction of ships, and the amount was charged to the War Loan, but from the 1st July last all expenditure in connexion with ship construction will  be  charged to the Works Loan. Provision is made in this Bill for £150,000 for initial settlement and preparatory work (at the Federal Capital. The other principal items are, £100,000, subscription to the capital of the Refinery Company in accordance with the Oil Agreement Act; Mobilization stores for the Defence Department, £167,000; Naval Bases, £1S7,000; Murray Waters scheme, £132,000; Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway, £100,000; and for the redemption of Northern Territory loans, £223,814. There are a number of smaller votes for works already in progress, and for additional works in connexion with these establishments. In Committee I shall be pleased to give honorable senators any information they may desire in connexion with these items. </para>

                        <para>. - We hare before us now a Bill which includes many heavy items of proposed expenditure, some of which will probably be debated at some length. The biggest item is one of £3,000,000 for shipbuilding, but in order that we may get on with the business I propose to confine my remarks on the second reading of this Bill to the debatable question of expenditure on the Federal Capital. I wish to set out the case as I see it in a fair, calm way, and from a national point of view, without any reference whatever to parochialism, for the passage of the item in this Bill to enable the Government to go on with the work of establishing the Federal Capital. </para>

The Minister, in another place, also stated that so far, only £58,000 has been expended upon buildings within the Capital area. I would point out to honorable senators that the land belonging to the Commonwealth in this Territory embraces an area of 900 square miles, and that most of that land has been given to the Commonwealth by the State Government without fee or other charges, in the performance of its part of the compact for the building of the Federal Capital Nine hundred square miles, roughly, represents 600,000 acres, so that if the sum of £740,000 has been expended upon the resumption of land in the Federal Territory, that expenditure represents an average of only 25s. per acre. </para>

                            <para>- Assertions are being made in Melbourne to-day that New South Wales does not care whether she gets the Federal Capital or not, and I am attempting to show, by extracts from the leading newspapers of that State, what is the feeling of her people upon this matter. As one of the representatives of the Mother State I affirm that the extracts which I am quoting fairly reflect the feeling of a majority of the electors there. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> writing upon this question, says- </para>

                        <para>There cannot be a satisfactory Government of Australia until that Government is housed in its own Territory, away from the local influences, which have now grown so strong that any serious movement to transfer the Federal Government to its proper home is actually resented as an attack upon the long-established privileges of Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>The unearned increment of property and values in the Federal Territory would accrue to the Government, and we know that a substantial set-off to the cost of the Capital at Canberra would be represented by the rents which the Commonwealth Government now pays to private owners in Melbourne. But this is not an occasion for counting merely the cost. The Government of Australia cannot be truly national until it functions from its own home. The aspirations of Australia, as well as its Constitution, demand the creation of a Capital in whose serene air the national business may be conducted as remote from the influence of cities like Sydney and Melbourne as Washington is from that of Chicago or New York. </para>

References have been made to the choice of Washington, and to the creation of the district of Columbia in connexion with the building up of that great nation, the United States of America. Those who have read the history of the first twenty, thirty, or forty years of that country must be struck by its many points of similarity to our own history. There were State jealousies, threats of secession, and controversies regarding the capital site. The wise builders of the great American nation, therefore, decided that the Federal Capital should be established altogether outside the influences of the States. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- But coming, in the first place, from the sea. The city of Washington is co-extensive with the district of Columbia, which is 60 square miles in extent. When Washington was first established, it contained only about 8,000 or 9,000 people; but in 1860 the population was 61,000 ; it grew to 109,000 in 1870; 203,000 in 1885; 230,000 in 1890; and in 1920 it was 437,000. Ottawa was originally incorporated in 1827, and the population of the city municipality grew from 24,000 in 1871, to 31,000 in 1881; 44,000 in 1891; 59,000 in 1901; and in 1917 it was 101,000. The value of the old Parliament House, which I assume was the cost of it, was about £200,000. What is important also is that the assessment of Ottawa in 1913 was over £26,000,000; and in 1917, over £29,000,000. </para>

                    </continue><para>I am trying to put up a reasonable business case for the building of our Federal Capital, and it will be interesting to make an analysis of unimproved capital values in two or three directions, to enable us to make some sort of guess or reasonable forecast of what will happen in the way of increment, which will eventually come to the Commonwealth, upon land in the Federal Territory. I have given figures for Ottawa, which do not directly bear upon the unimproved capital value position of the Federal Territory, because the assessment of Ottawa also includes improvements. But in Sydney and suburbs the unimproved capital value in 1907 was £39,791,000, or about £72 per head ; while on the 31st December, 1917, a little more than ten years afterwards, when the population had increased from 550,000 to 762,000, the unimproved capital value had gone up to nearly £68,000,000, or an average of £89 per head. To take an illustration at the other extreme, let me make a comparison with an average country town in New South Wales, such as Orange. There are about 7,000 people in Orange. The local government area consists of 1,325 acres, and the unimproved capital value is £335,000. We get, then, a creation of land values by 7,000 people at nearly £50 per head, and a creation of land values by 750,000 people in Sydney at approaching £100 per head. </para><para>In 1909, the Commonwealth Statist predicted that the population of Australia in 1920 would approximate 5,227,000 people. The actual population of Australia in March, 1920, was 5,274,000 people, or about 50,000  more than the Statist predicted over ten years ago. I think, therefore, we may pay a little attention to some figures that he gave in connexion with the possibilities of the Federal Capital to the then Minister, who I believe was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. (now Sir George)</inline> Fuller. Remember that these figures were given by the man who, ten years ago, made that marvellous prediction about the population of Australia to-day. He estimated in 1909 that, for the then Commonwealth requirements, the minimum population that the Federal Capital could possibly carry was 8,000 people, .and that there would be a minimum increase of 4,000 people at the Capital for every addition of 1,000,000 to the population of the Commonwealth. He estimated that there would be over 6,000,000 people in Australia in 1930, and over 7,000,000 people in 1940. Starting, then, with a minimum population of 8,000 people in the Federal Capital, based on the Commonwealth requirements at the time he- made the prediction, he estimated that in ten years the extreme minimum population would be 12,000, and in twenty years 16,000. But since 1909, the Commonwealth activities may reasonably be said to have quite doubled; so that, based on the Statist's figures, the minimum population with which we can start Canberra to-day to carry out all our functions of government, i.&lt;s 16,000 persons. Again, based on the Statist's figures, those 16,000 persons in ten years' time will show a minimum increase of 50 per cent. Consequently, if we start the Federal Capital now, there must be in- Canberra in 1930 a population of nearly 25,000 people, based on the Statist's computation. I have shown that in a small local government area like Orange 7,000 people have increased the unimproved value of land from nothing to £50 per head. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Let me proceed with a further computation based on the figures I have given. If we are going to have in 1930 a minimum population of 25,000 people in the Federal Capital to carry on the services, administration, and government of the Commonwealth, the actual experience of Orange and other country towns proves that that population will add at least £50 per head to the unimproved capital value of the Territory, or an increment of £1,250,000. But it is reasonable to assume that they will add more than that, because, as I showed in the case of Sydney, a population adds value in a geometrical and not in an arithmetical ratio. That increment to the unimproved capital value will take place in a Territory of 900 square miles, or 600,000 acres in extent. In addition to this unearned increment, which will all accrue to the Commonwealth, we shall save a good many thousand pounds per year in rents that are paid in Melbourne. We shall save the total <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> tax on the whole of the population in the Federal Territory. We may reasonably assume that, capitalized, the Federal land will return the Commonwealth 5 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The Northern Territory is no illustration of the present position. I am speaking of the addition that population gives to the value of land. Consequently, we approach the sum of £150,000 ner year which will accrue to, or be saved to, the Commonwealth as the result of removing the Seat of Government to Canberra. That represents interest on £3,000,000. I submit, therefore, that the Federal Capital will not cost the Commonwealth Government the many millions that some of its critics say it will. </para>

The whole of the people of New South Wales, so far as their views are expressed by their political representatives, are unanimously in favour of going on with the work forthwith. The Capital will give some hope of decentralization. It has access to the sea so far as Jervis Bay is concerned. The New South Wales taxpayers themselves will pay half of the money that will be spent upon this scheme. We of New South Wales are the people who are concerned as a State, and we are the people who are chiefly concerned as taxpayers. I hope that this State's House, formed originally by the Constitution to protect State rights, will take a larger minded view of this matter, and pass the item as one long overdue in connexion with the foundation of our Federal Constitution. </para></speech>

                        <para>. As a second-reading debate has been started on this measure, I may be permitted to refer to certain items upon which I desire some further enlightenment. The first, I notice, is the proposed vote for the London office, £60,612. I should like to know the policy of the Government concerning Australia House and the London office generally ; whether, by the expenditures of this vote, it is intended to make the London office more characteristically Australian and more actively concerned with our interests than has been the, case for some years past. All the Tasmanian representatives in this Chamber have received an extensive letter from the Agent-General for Tasmania stating that Australia House might very well be used to a greater extent as an' advertising medium for' the products of Australia than it is to-day. He points out that there are several very fine display windows on the Strand side, and that at present these are used practically exclusively for the lighting of the banking chamber. The whole of these windows, as well as the main hall, he says, should be used for the display of Australian products in order to attract the attention of the millions of people who pass down the Strand. Honorable senators know that if people have to enter any special hall for the purpose of viewing products, the chances are they will not do so; but, that if these products are properly displayed in a convenient location, their attention will be drawn to them. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have done so. They were the first among the State Governments to recognise the value of Australia House; but, as Tasmania is a small community with a comparatively small business and small revenue, the cost, at that time, was too great; but they have now shifted from Victoria-street to Australia House., They recognised from the very beginning the desirability of the whole of the States being associated with Australia House. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the item £15,000 for Kirribilli House, Sydney. I have not the remotest idea what the vote is for, but if it is to be expended on a residence, already erected, for the Admiral, it seems to me a considerable sum of money. </para>
                    <para>Under the control of the Department of Works and Railways there is also a proposed vote of £14,787 for the Williamstown Ship Building Yards pumping plant. .In connexion with this matter, I would remind honorable senators that the Public Accounts Committee made an investigation recently and found that the work was not being carried out in the most economical manner. It is desirable, if the Commonwealth is to continue in the ship-building industry, to have ample room for the laying down of three, four, or five ships instead of only two, so that the overhead charges may be spread over the whole of the operations. The question which exercises my mind is the suitability. of Williamstown as a shipbuilding yard. I should like to know if the Government have made inquiries as to the possibility of purchasing more land at Williamstown to allow of an extension of the yards to provide for the most modern system of shipbuilding, including, the use of overhead cranes, and to make it possible to lay down at least three, and, for preference, four, keels at' one time. If they have made these inquiries and find that they cannot get a - sufficient area at Williamstown, the best thing they can do is to shift operations to some other locality, because the local conditions at Williamstown are by no means favorable, the rise and fall of \ the tide being only about 3 feet. Its principal recommendation, of course, is its proximity to a large population. </para>
                    <para>The next item to which -I desire to refer is that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> at some length.  The honorable senator's address was reminiscent of the past. Tt was historical, interesting, and reminded us forcibly <inline font-style="italic">ox</inline> our obligations under the Constitution. We are, no, doubt, all  agreed  upon that point, but I should like to state my own position. An obligation is imposed on us by the Constitution to proceed with the building of the Capital City, but in my opinion the condition is a foolish one and should never have been inserted in the Constitution. Some time ago I threw out <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> suggestion that, even at this late hour, if the Government are not too far involved in construction works at the Capital site, the whole position might be reviewed. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and bow to your decision. I felt that we were indulging in rather a detailed discussion. All I am going to say, in conclusion, on this question is, that the present is the very worst time for the Government to indulge in expenditure on the Federal Capital. All the material required for the construction of the Federal Capital, which it is proposed to purchase with the  £150,000,  is at present at inflated values, and the expenditure of the amount I have mentioned, if deferred for a few years, would do  50  per cent. more than it can to-day. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Thereis also another point of  great  importance. The time is not far  distant  when this Parliament will be called  upon  to find employment for a large  number  of Australian people. To-day there  is  undoubtedly a dearth of labour  in Australia,  but the occasion may arise  when  the Commonwealth Parliament and the Parliaments of everyState  will have to  find work for the people, and we would be fortunate indeed if we had the amount that is set down in the schedule for the Federal Capital to expend in this direction. While recognising the justice and accuracy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> statement, I appeal to him to agree to this item being deferred to a more opportune time. For the reasons given, it is my intention to record my vote against the expenditure. </para><para>There is also an item dealing with the erection of cottages at Lithgow. The amount already available under appropriations made by previous Acts is  £29,858,  and we are appropriating under this measure an additional  £18,923.  I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to give the Senate some information on this particular item, as I am anxious to ascertain whether, in connexion with the construction of these cottages, a system of modern town planning is being followed. </para><interjection>

This measure has only just been circulated, and,' as an enormous expenditure of money is involved, I shall be glad if the Minister will be prepared to grant an adjournment at this juncture. </para>

Going through the items in the schedule, we see that there is an amount of £150,000 for temporary buildings in the Federal Territory; but surely the time is not opportune for an expenditure of such magnitude, which cannot be considered reproductive. We are up to our eyes in debt, and have a huge external obligation. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> in his Budget speech, time and again referred to our enormous debt, and to the necessity for economy. We know that Australia's total external debt is £656,000,000, or £131 per head of population. The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, says on page 5, " We shall act prudently if we brace ourselves meantime to the alternative of paying our own debts." Later he says, " Greater production, less consumption of goods, and reduced expenditure, both public and private." In face of these very wise remarks of the Treasurer, it appears that a keen attempt is being engineered, no doubt by the Federal Capital League of New South Wales, to, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has said by interjection, "bullock" this item through, and at a time when the Victorian and Queensland representatives in the Senate are away helping our own party in a strenuous election campaign. As regards our own debt we are indebted , to the British Government for money paid in connexion with our soldiers and sailors, approximately £42,000,000. Again referring to the necessity for economy, the Treasurer, in his Budget speech, on page 23, under the heading of "Economy," says - </para>

                            <para>- It will always be bush. I do not believe in the policy, but I presume it has to be carried out at some time. It is not wise to proceed with the work at present, because the position is totally different to what it was before the war. No one knew that we were to be engaged in such a conflict at so great a cost, and it could not be perceived in the early days of Federation that we were to be loaded up with a huge debt that may be very difficult to liquidate. It is absurd for the representatives of the Government, or any honorable senators, to take the public platform and refer to the need for economy, and then advocate the spending of millions on a bush capital. I do not approach this question in a parochial spirit, and I realize that some honorable senators may think that, because I represent the State of Victoria, I am opposed to the Federal Capital being constructed in New South Wales. That is not my attitude. I would not protest if the Seat of Government were transferred to Sydney, but I do object to unnecessary expenditure of the taxpayers' money at such a critical time in our national history. The whole thing is reeking with extravagance. We are, as it were, on the crest of the wave, and Australia, both publicly and privately, is living beyond her means. I was glad to see that New South Wales was not altogether unanimous <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> this question, because, last week, two or three resolutions were carried in New South Wales protesting against the expenditure of the money on useless unproductive public works. </para>

                            <para>- Instead of throwing away £150,000 on iron huts at Canberra, when iron is at a very high price, we should be spending money on such reproductive works as the conservation and distribution of water, which should really be our religion in this country, and on railways and immigration. There is a paltry sum of £100,000 for immigration. We are holding a great empty continent, and at a time when population is necessary in the interests of production, and for defence purposes, we are not spending nearly sufficient on immigration. The cheapest way to defend the country is to populate it. </para>

                            <para>- What period will expenditure of £150,000 on the Federal Capital cover? This is merely a commencement. In relation to the necessity for population, which is more important than anything else, I desire to quote the latest figures of the Government Statist. The Commonwealth consists of 2,974,581 square miles, and we have a population of 5,247,019, or 1.76 persons to the square mile. Victoria has 17.02 persons to the square mile - an easy first; Tasmania has 8.27; and New South Wales 6.47. The Northern Territory has . 009. </para>

                            <para>-  I was endeavouring to show that it is unnecessary to waste public money by spending £150,000 on a bush capital when it could be more effectively spent in other ways. There is no public outcry for the " bush " capital, but quite the reverse. The whole trouble in connexion with this matter is due to two curses that are afflicting New South Wales; that is to say, the Millions Club, composed of people who desire that there should be a million people crowded in one city instead of being scattered over the. country, and the Federal Capital League. Already no less than £1,738,000 of the people's money has been squandered by the Government on this project. We heard that from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> this morning. </para>

                    <para>In my opinion, temporary buildings erected at Canberra cannot be regarded as a tangible asset. Much of the present prosperity in Australia is artificial. We are all too optimistic. The seasonal position is good, but we  must  remember that enormous losses of stock have taken place. In 1891 we had in Australia 106,000,000 sheep. To-day we have only 76,000.000. This represents a decrease of 30,000,000 head of sheep. We are living in a fools' paradise, and in conditions of inflated prosperity, due largely to the circulation of too much paper money. </para>

                    <para>I take exception to item after item in the schedule to this Bill, and I wish to protest against the extravagance of the Government in expenditure. Not enough consideration is .given to items of expenditure, and if "we go on spending in the ratio of the past, and have strikes and a . slowing-down policy as well, we have a very bad time ahead of us. I think that we should drop  parochialism,  and all pull together to economize and produce. If we continue this extravagance we must look for trouble. Extravagance by the Government will lead to a financial crisis, and a financial crisis breeds the very gravest form of discontent. We have a much more serious political, financial, and industrial time ahead of us in Australia than people are generally inclined to think, because we are enjoying an inflated prosperity at the present time, and I wish again to protest against this unnecessary expenditure of money upon temporary buildings at Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- We are now reading a stage in our history when we shall find, it impossible to borrow any more money, and, that being the case, the building of theCapital City at Canberra must be a work of the distant future. The Bill 'also provides for an expenditure of £187,000 upon Naval bases: This money should also come out of revenue, because Naval bases cannot be said to be' reproductive works' in any sense of the term. It is further intended to expend £100,000 upon the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. . Nobody can call that a reproductive work. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the ballasting of the line should be proceeded with, but I contend that the money for the work should come out of revenue. Then it is proposed to expend £6,000 upon the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway. That is not a very large amount, but I suppose its expenditure is merely for the purpose of keeping the line in repair. Ought we to borrow money to expend upon works of this description . seeing that they are. not of a reproductive character? </para>

                            <para>- I would not have so much objection to it then. But I have not come to Canberra yet. I shall be glad if the honorable senator will permit me to "continue my conversation," if I may be permitted to use the words that were employed by a friend of mine in another place. I object to the amount which it is proposed to expend upon the London Offices. I do not knowhow the £64,000 provided for in the Bill is to be spent. </para>

                            <para>- Did the Prime Minister look into this matter when he was at Home? Three floors must be a good part of the building. Here is another £64,000 on the London Office. My goodness! No doubt the office is a splendid advertisement, situated, as it is, in one of the finest parts of the city of London, but I thought we had done with the expenditure on it. I wonder what return we shall get. </para>

It is  not  a matter for joking, when we find that the Federal debt amounts, including the note issue, to £437,500,000. Of course, there are many assets against it, but we may say that that is the absolute . debt. No New South Wales man, when he voted for the Federal. Capital site, contemplated or . ever dreamed - although he might have had a nightmare -  that  this country would owe such an enormous sum. </para>

So far as the Empire is concerned, we are the hardest hit part in every possible way. Our situation cannot be compared with that of Canada, which made good money out of the war. </para>

                            <para>- We certainly did not. What is the use of making good money when it all goes in taxation? I am surprised at the honorable senator's interjection. State and Federal income taxation in Queensland, on the top rates, is11s. 6d. in the £1, and a great number of other things, not included in income taxation, have  to be met out of income. Australia, both in the number of our poor fellows who were killed, and the number wounded, was, next to Great Britain, the hardest hit part of the Empire, and, from a financial point of view, I can produce figures to show that we have been at least as hard hit, and that we owe as much, on account of the war, as the Old Country herself. Canada actually made money out of the war. Her income tax is only £2,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- Very nearly, when we take off what England advanced to other countries, although some of that she may not get back. Taking those amounts off, she owes only about £4,000,000,000 owing to the war. Dividing that by ten gives £400,000,000, and that is about what we in Australia have spent on the war in one way and another. I will give these figures more in detail on the Budget, when honorable senators will find that, from every point of view, Australia has been very hard hit through the war. Years ago nobody contemplated anything of that sort. The New South Wales people had no idea of it when  they  voted for a big expenditure on Canberra. We shall have to borrow all this money. What is the good of making two bites at a cherry? What is the use of spending a little money now to build workmen's homes, ( many of which will have to be removed later on to make room for more permanent buildings? What is the good of doing this until we know whether we can go on and finish the job? It is not likely that we can finish it for many years to come. No doubt we must keep the bargain with New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is not. If the matter had to be decided to-day the position would be very different. No frightful expenditure of another £3,000,000 would be sanctioned. A move of this sort means swapping horses as we are crossing the stream. The people know now where to find some of the Commonwealth offices, although they are scattered about in a terrible fashion, but if they were closed up and taken to Canberra, when we are facing the terrible financial load, I do not know where the people would be. We shall have to borrow this £3,000,000, because the money cannot possibly come out of revenue. There is no revenue left for it to come out of. If the New South Wales people were told the facts, they would say, " We want to help the people of the other States; we do not want to impose a huge burden on them. We must see that no burden beyond what we can bear is placed upon ourselves and them." That is the view that the high-spirited people of New South Wales would take. </para>

                            <para>- It is not my intention to detain the Senate very much longer. I have put the grave financial position of Australia as clearly as I  caD  to honorable senators, and I feel sure  that  if it were made abundantly clear to  the  people of New South Wales, they would not be any more inclined than are other people in the Commonwealth to borrow another £4,000,000. We can see by the market quotations for 6 per cent, stock what rate of interest we are likely to pay for our money in future. Altogether, the financial situation seems to be surrounded by so many difficulties that we should not encumber ourselves further by expenditure which might, for very good reasons, be deferred to a later date. I have endeavoured to put this position as clearly as possible. </para>

This additional expenditure is not in accord with the policy of the Government. They are pledged to economy, and. to save every penny possible to meet our just liabilities. </para>

                            <para>- The first item in the schedule is a proposed vote of £60,612 for the London Offices. I have heard a good deal about these offices, but have not seen them. I should imagine, however, from what I have heard, that, if properly administered, they should be a splendid advertisement for Australia. It has been said, that it is the intention of the Government, in the near future, to re-organize these offices at Australia House, and I think that a short time ago one member of the Government went to London with instructions to re-organize them on a practical basis. </para>

I congratulate the Government, and particularly the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> upon what I regard as the most statesmanlike enactment passed by this Legislature. I have no objection to this expenditure. </para>
                    <para>Then there appears the sum of £2,500 for the Williamstown Shipbuilding Yards, buildings, plant, and machinery. I have no doubt that is all right, but honorable senators are at a disadvantage in that no details of the expenditure have' been furnished. </para>

A good deal has been said for and against this proposition. I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> who says that if the Federal Government assist a private enterprise of this kind applications will be received from other organizations not anticipated at the present moment. </para>

We merely have the bald statement of proposed expenditure. It would be helpful if we knew some of the details. </para>
                    <para>There are two other items under Home and Territories Department that I do not understand. One is "Land in Federal Capital Territory, £10,800." I always understood, and I think the people of Australia understood, also, that when the Federal Territory was handed over by the New South Wales Government, it came to the Commonwealth free of cost; but now we have a vote of £10,800 for payment in respect of certain lands in the Territory.The other item to which I refer is £15,000 for Kirribilli House, Sydney. Is that the Admiralty House? </para>

                    <para>I have no doubt that most of the items in the schedule are justifiable, but at present honorable senators have no information at all about them. I am in favour of a spending policy, provided expenditure is upon reproductive and developmental works. It is the duty of this Parliament to examine carefully all items of expenditure, particularly those that are not likely to be reproductive. </para>
                    <para>There is, under the Department of Works and Railways, a vote of £14,787 for the Williamstown Shipbuilding Yard pumping plant, £90,000 for Federal Capital Territory initial settlement, and £60,000 for preparatory work, or a total of £150,000. I have heard all that has been said to-day in connexion with this proposed expenditure. I can quite understand that Senators Pratten, Duncan, and Cox should support the vote for the Federal Capital, and pose as the champions of upright parliamentary conduct. They tell us that we are only asked to give effect to a certain promise. On the face of it, this seems a fair proposition, and I ask them to accept my assurance that I am not speaking in a spirit of animosity towards them when I say that they are merely doing what their supporters expect them to do. </para>

                            <para>- But this is a very serious matter. They should remember that the promise was made twenty years ago, and that we are dealing with it now in another day and generation. I recollect, quite well, when this issue was a burning question throughout the Commonwealth, and I remember, on one historical occasion, a visit to Ballarat by the late  Hon.  C. C. Kingston and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid. At that time, it was practically a public secret that Ballarat was to be the Federal Capital, and I believe that city would have been chosen but for the indiscretion of our worthy mayor of that time. Many things have happened since the agreement as to the Seat of Government was arrived at, and I think the most encouraging feature about the whole matter now is the attitude of the New South Wales people themselves. I have interviewed many prominent business men in Sydney, and have been informed by them that the great majority of the people in New South Wales do not care two straws where the Seat of Government is. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, I will summarize my remarks by saying that the circumstances and conditions which existed twenty years ago are not present to-day. When it was- decided to erect a Federal Capital, it was thought that it should be away from the sea-coast to be immune from attack from the sea. That condition, however, does not now exist, as has already been explained by some honorable senators. I am not in any way advocating a repudiation of an agreement which has been entered into, but we have to remember that it is the policy of the Government -to exercise economy in every possible way. It has frequently been stated from public platforms that economy in public expenditure is absolutely essential, and, in view of this, I do not see how we can justify the action of the Government in recommending the expenditure of such a large amount on work which cannot be regarded as reproductive. Under these circumstances, I consider the item unjustifiable, and shall record my vote against it. It is somewhat difficult for an honorable senator to advocate economy, because he will doubtless be twitted with the fact that he did not 'hesitate to increase his own salary. I know that all honorable senators are worth £1,000 per year; but I must confess that in view of the need  for economy, my conscience has been somewhat  twinged  in receiving the extra remuneration. I strongly protest against the expenditure on the Federal Capital, and shall record my vote against it. </para>

                            <para>- No ; my vote is not for sale. In dealing with such items as are contained in the schedule, and realizing that a distinct promise has been made in connexion with the north-south railway, I am astonished to find that I am precluded from alluding to it, and that the discussion is to be limited. We should have the right, not only of discussing the items in the schedule, but those which should be included. I do not blame the representatives of New South Wales, because they are supporting the interests of their own State, and I am fighting for the interests of the State I assist in representing. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that the Senate is placed in an unfair position in discussing a Loan Bill if we are not allowed to refer to the details in the schedule until we reach the Committee stage. We have to pass the second reading without having any information as to the manner in which the money is to be expended. The Bill is for an amount of £4,286,490, and on one single item which absorbs £3,000,000 we have not had a two minutes' explanation from the Minister. Honorable senators will realize that our time in Committee is limited to a quarter of an hour, and that we have then to confine ourselves to a particular item. Honorable senators are prevented from discussing the Bill as a whole. </para>

What has been decided is in accordance with the proper parliamentary practice, and that is that no detailed discussion can be allowed on any particular item on the second reading. That is a well recognised parliamentary rule. The honorable senator has complained that honorable senators have not the right to discuss any particular item.It seems that there has been too much detailed discussion on some particular items, and no reference at all to others. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not my intention to reply in detail to the statements made by honorable senators in discussing the second reading of this Bill. It would have been practically impossible for me to have given detailed information on every item during my second-reading speech. But the information is available, and will, if necessary, be supplied in Committee There are certain well-established parliamentary rules, which I have endeavoured to follow, and I am sure honorable senators will admit that the expenditure can be fully justified and satisfactorily explained when we are in Committee. During the whole of the debate there appears to have been too much of a desire to pit one State against another. It must be remembered that this is a National Parliament, and, whilst New South Wales representatives are anxious to quote the New South Wales .public opinion on an important question, as expressed in the press, they should also be ready to admit that newspaper reports can also convey the public opinion of Victoria. We should endeavour to be fair.  One  honorable senator said that to discover the morality of a man we must examine his teeth. Although I was not sufficiently advanced in years to vote on the Referendum Bill, I was in sympathy with the movement for the establishment of a Federal Capital. But the people of Australia - not a few, and not a section - entered into a compact with the people of New South Wales, and that arrangement can only be altered by the voice of the people. The Parliament has to honour that compact. The past generation of Victorians entered into this contract, and I am not going to be a contract breaker at the invitation of any one. At four different elections in Victoria, at one of which </para>

                    <para class="block">I was returned at the top of the poll, I always gave the answer to questions on the subject of the establishment of the Federal Capital, that the people of Australia had deliberately entered into a contract in connexion with the matter, and whether it was good or bad I, as .a Minister of the Crown, would not consent to break it. As to whether it was a good or bad contract, I am prepared to say quite candidly that I personally would not have been a party to it. The majority of the people of Australia, by a large democratic vote, have, however, committed the Commonwealth to the contract, and no one can .break it now without being guilty of dishonorable conduct. Where contracts are made between Governments, our very civilization depends upon their being kept. What is wrong in the industrial world to-day but the disregard of contracts? What is wrong with international relations which create war but the dishonouring of treaties and the breaking of contracts? Let Governments fail to observe contracts made between them and other people, and it will be a case of God help our civilization, because its foundations will have gone. </para>
                    <para>I personally would prefer that the Federal Capital should be established at some more suitable place than Canberra, but we cannot continue to ignore the contract which has been made. The representatives of the people of Australia in this democratic Parliament, declared by a majority that the Federal Capital should be established in the district of Yass-Canberra. I stand by that vote. Whatever the merits of the selected site may be, I shall uphold my personal honour in giving effect to the contract which has been made, and which can be altered only by the people who made it. </para>

                            <para>- No, I am glad to say that the spirit of Australians is such that it is not necessary 'to use compulsion in connexion with these loans. I suppose that behind every War Loan there is a shadow of compulsion, but we need not discuss that, and Australians have shown themselves willing to respond with men, and with wealth when appealed to, to achieve a big purpose. I hope that the day will never come when it will be necessary to use compulsion in this country in connexion with these matters. I have said that we are bound, in my opinion, by a contract deliberately entered into, and by a vote of a majority of this Parliament, to establish the Federal Capital on the site which has been selected. That site was selected after great consideration, and I may say that I visited nearly all the sites that were suggested. If. after all that has transpired, the Government did nothing in this matter, they would be dishonoured as a body of men for failing to observe a contract. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRUSSELL. - Of the increase in the value of the land due to the Commonwealth expenditure, the owners are not to receive a penny, but much of the land has. still to be acquired. The position with respect to the acquisition of land in the Federal Capital Territory up to date is that we have acquired 203,054 acres, at a cost of £760,000. The area of unacquired freehold land in the Territory is 41,269 acres, and the area of unacquired land in process of alienation, under conditional purchase, or conditional lease, is 79,124 acres. This represents a total of 120,393 acres of land still unacquired in the Federal Territory. The estimated cost in 1917 of this balance of unacquired land was £328,000. No valuation has been made, and I have been informed that this estimate is only approximate. The revenue from the acquired lands is £35,43311s. 3d. I wonder what any member of the Senate would think of the position if he held £5,000 or £6,000 worth of land on the conditions on which land is held by people in the Federal Capital Territory. I think that honorable senators must agree that if we desire to do the honest thing by the holders of land in that Territory, we must give them their money, and take over their land at once. I know that I would never have stood the treatment to which they have been subjected for the last twenty years. I should, in similar circumstances, have been on the Government doorstep every year to know what was going to be done. </para>

                            <para>- I have stated before that Commonwealth Ministers have been asked to work in dog boxes, and our public servants to carry on their duties in unhealthy offices, whilst we have been waiting for a home of our own. We have been afraid to take our courage in our hands, and provide proper office accommodation for Commonwealth servants. The complaint is often made 'that Melbourne desires the erection of permanent buildings by the Commonwealth for temporary occupation, but I can inform honorable senators that the accommodation provided in some of the offices occupied in Melbourne is an absolute disgrace. What is worse is that they are nearly all rented premises, and are costing us annually more than would pay the interest on the cost of constructing permanent suitable office accommodation. Members of this Parliament should be ashamed of the conditions under which some public servants are obliged to carry on their work. </para>

                        <para>. - Even though there was no contract entered into between the Commonwealth and the States upon this matter, there was certainly an understanding that the State Agents-General would be accommodated in Australia House. I am not enthusiastic about Agents-General, but Australia should certainly be unitedly represented in London under the one roof. At the present time there is* unnecessary duplication. For some reason all of the States, with the exception of one, have held aloof from Australia House. But we have learned a lot during recent years, and to-day there is a great tendency for representation to be concentrated under one roof. ' Everybody who has visited London lately speaks most highly of the possibilities of Australia House if it be conducted upon proper lines. I hope that in the future we shall have a more united form of representation in London, particularly in regard to trade matters. We must secure the services of first-class commercial men, Apart from the representation of the Commonwealth by the High Commissioner, we need special commercial agents in London at the present time. I have been asked how the £64,000 set down for the Commonwealth offices in this Bill will be expended. My reply is that there were odd contracts which had been entered into prior to the war, and in which it became necessary, under the stress of war conditions, to offer a small bonus. In the case of some contractors, for example, the increase of wages which they had to pay amounted to, probably, 100 per cent. It would not have been fair to ruin these men because they could not overcome difficulties which were created by war conditions. The balance of the expenditure is needed to complete Australia House. This is not an original vote. It is intended to be expended upon the completion of contracts which were entered into prior to the war, but which were suspended during the war period. </para>

It is necessary to have this building in London, and we desire it to be occupied by men who are engaged in pushing the interests of Australia to the best of their ability. I' repeat that the vote in question does not represent new expenditure. I suppose that 95 per cent, of the building has already been completed, and the proposed vote of £64,000 represents the balance of 5 per cent, which is required to finish the job. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> whether all the employees at Australia House are Australians, and whether, in appointments to the clerical staff, preference has been given to soldiers? Instead of the Commonwealth spending money upon art decorations there, I suggest the wisdom of taking advantage of the windows of Australia House to advertise the wares of this country, as, for example, by making a proper exhibit of wool. Although our wool clip in Australia is worth from £40,000,000 to £45,000,000, it is a fact that we have not a single exhibit of wool there. I therefore suggest to the Minister the advisableness of employing as much of the window space of Australia House as possible for the purpose of displaying a proper collection of Australian wool, timbers, grain, fruits, &amp;c. We know the crying need which exists for attracting immigrants to our shores. </para>

                    <para class="block">House. That building is equal to the very best structure in London. It is a handsome edifice, and is in every way a credit to the Commonwealth. Yet, despite all its advantages, quite a number of the States refuse to house their representatives there. If we have not the power to levy directly upon the States for their share of the expenditure upon that building, which was erected for the  entire  Commonwealth, we certainly have the right to tax them indirectly, seeing that it is the same taxpayers, who have to provide the money. But we might present the position to the people in a somewhat different form from that in which it has hitherto been presented to them. The Treasurer might outline in his Budget that each State will be required to contribute a certain sum towards the upkeep of Australia House. If it went forth to the people of Australia, for example, that they had to pay £50,000 for offices in that building, whilst they also had to maintain offices for their Agent-General in another part of London, the folly of the position would be brought home to them. </para>

                            <para>- No. It is about time that the Government did something practical in this matter, with a view to awakening public opinion upon it. The present position is due entirely to petty jealousy between one Agent-General and another. The High Commissioner stands upon his dignity and the Agents-General stand upon their dignity like a lot of children. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will induce the Government to take such action as will shame these people into doing what is right. </para>

A number of geologists have been making preparatory, examinations there, with a view to determining the most suitable places in which to put down bores for oil. I cannot give any indication of the developments, but very successful work has been done in connexion with the selection of  a  site for our own refinery in Australia.

I observe in the newspapers cables to the effect that big shipping companies in England are cancelling their contracts for new shipping right and left. They hold the opinion that the present cost of shipping construction cannot be justified by the profits which can be made from running the ships. It looks as if the Commonwealth is going on blindly constructing ships with  the  cost of material and labour at the very highest. We can never hope to make them pay under normal conditions if that is the case. . . </para>

As one who has had control over shipping for four out of the last five years in Australia, I assure the honorable senator that, had it not been for our action, freights would have been at least 50 to 60 per cent, higher now. I can prove clearly that we saved many millions to the producers of this country on the one hand, and to the consumers on the other, by our organization of shipping. The question now asked  is,  " What are we going to do? " Certain rumours and reports are going about, but I tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> that our ships in Australia, that is the seven we now have, and  a  number on the keel, have been built at the cheapest boat-building rate of any boat building country in the world to-day. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We  have  several  Contracts  in Great Britain for big boats. If there is one danger to  a  country like Australia, that has  a  large oversea commerce, it is the development of the British Shipping Combine. If the- honorable senator thinks it is judicious to do so, there -will be no difficulty in selling our boats to-day at very high prices; but, if those boats are sold, the producers and consumers of Australia will' eventually pay the whole amount in the way of extra freights. We have not yet reached the stage at which we should sell our vessels. The bulk of this money is for completing contracts already entered into. Six boats have been ordered in England, of the latest and most up-to-date type, and all the contracts for them are signed.. The only difference is that we were building them as war measures, and we are now transferring the expenditure from War Loan Account, as we do not think it legitimate to build them out of that account now, to the ordinary Public Works Loan Account. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Constitution was practically suspended in that regard during the war. Peace has not yet been finally signed, and we still have the power to take such action as we think essential for the safety of the nation. The High Court said that, during the war period, it was lawful for the Commonwealth Government to take every action deemed necessary for the protection of the country, and that to that extent the Constitution was practically suspended. The High Court added that the Executive was not compelled even to give reasons for its actions, because it might, during war-time, have secret information which it would not be judicious to reveal to. the public. Now that the war is over, and we are making our financial statement as a Government, we tell Parliament that we are not going to charge these things to War Loan Account any longer. Therefore, in order to complete our contracts, it is necessary to borrow the money. We have not the revenue available for the purpose. This money is for the completion of contracts, and not for new contracts. Most of them are already in hand. I sum not enthusiastic about the State running lines of steam-ships, but, until we know the real basis upon which the British  Empire is going to conduct its shipping, whether, for instance, it is to be managed directly by the British Parliament, I hope we shall not sell one plank of our boats. Except for that important consideration, we could, discuss the question as an. open one. I regard it, at this stage, as largely a matter in which we have no option. .We must either have our own ships or leave ourselves at the mercy of the British Shipping Combine. </para>

                        <para>.- Can the Minister give us some idea as to the definite policy of the Government with regard to ship-building? He says that the power to build ships was taken under the War Precautions Act during the war period, but I was hopeful that the policy of building ships would become a national policy carried out by the Government irrespective of war conditions. The successful development of this country depends largely upon transport and communication. It is vital to the interests of the people of Australia that we should be in a position to construct our own commercial vessels. </para>

                        <para>. -  The house referred to is the old Admiralty House on Sydney Harbor. Some additional land was to be put up for public auction, and the Government recognised that it would be essential before very long to secure it for naval purposes. I understand that that was the last opportunity of obtaining a suitable block adjacent to Sydney Harbor for those purposes. The land will probably be much more valued later on. </para>

                            <para>-  I still say that, apparently, the Government have money to burn. A few years ago they imported an American to draw up  plans  for Canberra. I understand he  is  drawing a salary of £1,000 a year, but I do not know whether he is shooting opossums or what he is doing. Recently the Government paid him the huge fee of £3,298 for doing something in connexion with the Sydney General Post Office. I understand this gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> B. Griffin, is not a member of the architectural staff of the Commonwealth. I contend, therefore, that the Government are not giving sufficient consideration to the necessity for economy. It is not going to do us any good at the next election as Nationalists if money is going to be " chucked " about in this fashion. It is up to the Minister to give us some explanation as to why this sum of £3,298 was paid as a special fee to a gentleman who is retained in connexion with Federal Capital work. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> came out under engagement to the Federal Government to do certain work, but still had the right of private practice. Three or four years ago there was a clamour in Sydney for alterations and extensions to the General Post Office there, and, by an arrangement with the ex -Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> and the ex-Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. King O'Malley), Mr. Griffin</inline> was instructed to go into the matter. He has a great reputation as an architect, and as there was no clause in his contract to prevent his employment, the transaction was quite clear. He waited two years for his money, and was paid last year. Whether his plans are adopted or not, I trust that before long substantial improvements will be effected in the Sydney General Post Office, which is a very badly designed building. </para>

There was a strong recommendation by first class engineers to cut down the Henderson Base a good deal - from, I think, £11,000,000 to about £3,500,000. We are not spending large sums of money on these works. We are simply finishing up and clearing the decks, so to speak. </para>
