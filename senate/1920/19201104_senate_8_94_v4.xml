The amendment recommends the adoption of a fairer course. Under normal conditions, the ship-owners and ship agents will he liable for the expenses incurred in quarantine by their passengers and crews ; but in the event of a national outbreak of disease, such as the recent influenza epidemic, the Commonwealth will shoulder this burden. </para>

                        <para>- But under this Bill it was proposed to make them solely responsible. Now, however, the other branch of the Legislature has inserted an amendment with which the Government are in perfect agreement. In connexion with the influenza epidemic, it will be recalled that, owing to lack of proper precautionary measures by the States, chaotic conditions resulted. We desire to possess the requisite power to prevent the spread of any such epidemic throughout Australia. That power will be used with discretion for the purpose of protecting the citizens of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- One does not score too many victories in his advocacy of various principles, and consequently I rejoice that this amendment has been made by another place. Upon a previous occasion, I stressed the danger in which the isolated portions of the Commonwealth stand, in the event of such an epidemic recurring as that from which we suffered a little time ago. There was every indication that the experience of the shipping companies upon that occasion would lead them to tie up their vessels at our wharfs rather than incur the risk of being called upon to support in quarantine a considerable number of passengers, to pay the wages of their crews, and also the cost of maintaining their vessels. </para>

                <para>Upon the 13th October last, I quoted a paragraph from the report of the Select Committee appointed to inquire into the oversea carriage of goods, in which it is stated that one company trading to Tasmania lost upon a single trip during that epidemic, &#163;1,162. Obviously, if such an epidemic recurred, our shipping companies would not be disposed to carry on a service between Tasmania and the mainland, or, indeed, between our chief ports and those parts of the Commonwealth which have no railway communication, and which are therefore dependent upon water carriage. Apart from the equity of the amendment, the Government have taken a wise step in endeavouring to avoid what would be a calamity to various portions of the Commonwealth in the event of another epidemic of disease visiting our shores. I have pleasure, therefore, in supporting the motion. </para>

It is too complicated to permit me, at this stage, to enter into details. I need hardly remind honorable senators of the chaotic condition of the world&#39;s exchanges, and the problems which they present as a result of the recent war. Things to-day are not what they seem. Currency, as we understand it, quite apart from values, is not what it is represented to be. There has been a very heavy increase in the -cost of living throughout the world, due ito the partial cessation of production in all the countries that were at war; and we now find that, as a result of this dislocation of industry, exchange rates vary from J per cent, in the more favoured countries to about 62S per cent, against Poland. The desire of Australia, as expressed in recent legislation, is to give adequate protection to the industries of this country, preference to Great Britain, and, as far as possible, sympathetic treatment to our Allies in the late war ; but, owing to the peculiar movement of the exchange position, Great Britain, in many cases, is not in the enjoyment of the preference given -to her under the existing Tariff as against countries like the United States of America and Japan; and France, our principal Ally in the late war, is .heavily penalized. I do not wish to go into the details of the currency position of all the principal countries of the world. but I should like to give a comparative table of the mintage par rate and the bank rate of the following countries: - </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a good illustration of &#34;the chaotic condition of the &#34;world&#39;s currency. &#34;We do not propose to lay down in this Bill an all-embracing lule. That cannot be done. It is our desire, if possible, to adjust the position as between Australia and other countries. At present, France is in a very disadvantageous position compared with America and Japan; so much so, that it has been stated that goods in bond from that country will not be landed for use or consumption in the Commonwealth unless the adverse exchange position is met by some &#34;satisf factory arrangement such as is suggested in this measure. Our desire is to assist France, as far as possible, and without working any injury to our own manufacturers, in order that she may rehabilitate herself in a commercial and manufacturing sense. The Bill gives power to the Minister - for Customs to refer to the Board of Trade the method by which Customs duties shall be calculated, whether upon the mint par rate of exchange, or the bank rate of exchange. It provides that if the bank rate of exchange is more than 10 per cent, above or 10 per cent, below the mint par rate, the Minister shall refer to the Board the question whether the bank rate of exchange shall be used as the basis for the computation of value for duty on goods imported. The intention is not to alter the basis of computation merely for the sake of making an alteration, but to adjust the duty charges on an equitable basis, and thus to give expression to the declared intention of Parliament. I have here another comparative table showing the current bank rate and the mint par rate, based on the &#163;1 sterling value; and I have no doubt that it will be of interest to honorable senators - </para>

                    <para class="block">The industrial condition of the respective countries due to the dislocation of  the industries following upon their difficulty in obtaining; raw material to carry on normal activities appears to be fairly accurately reflected in the condition of these exchanges, and it is our desire, as far&#39; as possible, to remove hardships at present imposed upon our Allies in the late &#34;war, and generally to give effect to the intention of Parliament in our relationship with those countries, while, at the same time, extending a fair measure of .protection to our own- industries. The Board of Trade to which reference for the computation of duty will be made in certain circumstances will have the full powers of a Royal Commission to ascertain the facte. We cannot look for a rapid return to normal conditions, but I have no doubt that, in the course of time, as the nations of the world settle down to business again, the position will eventually right itself. &#39;Great Britain is more highly developed commercially and industrially, and, therefore, is in a better position bo meet the present difficulty, but if a big country like Great Britain, with its large population, found it necessary to take action, it must be self-evident to honorable senators that iri little, struggling Australia such protection must also be given. The matter is affecting Australia very largely, and is ako affecting France, and not to the mutual satisfaction of any of us. I trust that honorable senators will give the Bill that consideration which it deserves as an attempt to meet a national difficulty. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> in introducing this Bill, has made a number of very general remarks, most of which are based on the assumption that the interpretation of the law by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is the correct one. My humble opinion is that the Minister for Trade and Customs is wrong. I understand that the question is being decided in the High Court, and that a judgment will be delivered to-morrow touching the majority of the provisions of this Bill. I suggest, therefore, that it is advisable, in order that senators may be fully informed as to what actually is the law, that this debate should stand over until to-morrow. With that object in view, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

                LARGIE (Western Australia) T3.34&#93; - This is not a measure upon -which a great deal may be said, further than that it is much gore satisfactory and cheerful to be making peace than making wax. We are glad to have an opportunity to pass a measure of this kind after such a long term of the opposite condition of affairs. Bulgaria was not one of those countries with which we were brought closely in contact, although it has figured very much in the world&#39;s affairs, like most of the other Balkan States. Those countries, although they may be small, seem to have the knack of making considerable trouble and tremendous noise in the world. Bulgaria undoubtedly acted very unfairly to the rest of the world in taking sides -with Germany as it did, and especially with Turkey, the country which inflicted those unspeakable atrocities on her not so very many years before. Bulgaria soon forgot the services rendered to her by Gladstone, when he roused the civilized world in Bulgarians favour and against Turkey. It is satisfactory for the Senate to have a measure of this kind before it, so that it may put the hallmark of its approval upon the peace which was arrived at some considerable time ago.
