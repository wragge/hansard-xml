                    <para>. - If a soldier dies after his discharge as the result of something which happened to him during his war service a legal application in his case will still be possible under the Bill. The only effect of the amendment is to increase the number of causes which might result in death which may be brought under the operation of the measure. It will be in no sense a limitation. I take the case of two men who joined the army - one receives a gunshot wound and dies three months or six months after his discharge; he would be eligible. The other man receives an equally serious injury when he is merely an onlooker in camp, and while in practice that interpretation is not followed, by a strict  reading of  the clause as it stands, that soldier would not have received his injury in the course of his employment. He would, however, have received it during the period of his service, and whether he died before or after his discharge would not affect the matter. Honorable senators may remember that a case occurred of a soldier sustaining an accident on the railway -while going home on leave. He could not literally be said to have sustained the accident in the course of his&#39; employment, but it was during the period of his war service, and obviously he would not have been in the  position in which he sustained his accident but for &#39;his enlistment. It is in order to remove any doubt that a legal claim may be entered in respect of such a case as that that I submit the amendment. </para>

The returned soldiers will be well represented on the Commission, and there is no fear of any act of injustice being committed by the members of the Commission, to whom the Committee can very well leave the settlement of matters of this description.

                        <para>- Time can be taken up by a lawyer just as easily on an appeal, if a soldier fancies himself aggrieved and has money to spend, to the detriment of other legitimate claims which might otherwise be promptly settled. It is the custom in military trials to allow a man to have some one to appear for him, but the Commission will not hold criminal investigations or try offences. It will have purely civil functions, and will inquire as to matters of. fact. It will be much better and will save a great deal of time to leave the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. -  We are informed on excellent authority that an historical personage once spoke in his haste. The purpose of the Committee being to enable us by discussion to make the Bill as perfect as possible, I have no hesitation in admitting that I have unfortunately followed that somewhat pernicious example. It did not appear to me on the first view. that there was any great harm in the amendment, seeing that it is the practice to-day to permit an appellant to ask the Commission or Board for permission to have some one to represent him, where there is good cause for it. But I have been reminded of a tendency already growing up to create a class of so-called agents who are really birds of prey on the soldier. Honorable senators will have seen in yesterday&#39;s papers the case of an architect who was heavily fined for imposing, or attempting to impose, upon soldiers, by using words which the Court held constituted an attempted fraud. It is clear that if encouragement is given, or the door left open in the slightest degree, there will grow up a class of so-called agents who will seek to get their living out of the soldier for doing services which the soldier, with his friends on the Commission and on these Boards, is quite able to do for himself. There is always a very&#39; active branch of the soldiers&#39; organization in existence, and if there is any reason to suppose that the Commission is being only partially informed, or has given a decision contrary to the merits of the case, the organization very quickly asks for a review. Never in a single case that I know of has that review been declined. Sometimes the request has come to myself personally, and sometimes to the Commission, and I know of no case where the papers have not been sent for and the matter retraversed. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> to pardon me if I have misled him, but I think it is better to be quite frank with the Committee, even if I have to admit that I spoke rather rashly. </para>

                    <para>.- - The Minister has somewhat exaggerated the position, so far as &#34;birds of prey&#34; are concerned. I am sure he will accept my assurance that I should be one of the last to encourage people of that type to take advantage of the soldier. There may be occasions when a small legal technicality occurs, and the Department, which has all the advantage of the advice of the Crown Law Office, the best legal advice in Australia, is in a far better position than the appellant, who is unable to get legal assistance. When I moved the amendment, I was not thinking so much of legal advisers as of men who, on account of what they have suffered through war service, or because of nervousness of disposition, or for some other reason, are unable to put their cases as concisely before the Commission as others could. Will the Minister meet me to the extent of providing that in such cases a member of the returned soldiers&#39; organization may appear on behalf of the soldier? That would do away with the possibility of any legal gentlemen desiring to act as birds of prey on the soldier, as represented. </para>

                    <para>.- I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> is assuming that the purpose of the. Department will be to defeat any appeal made by a returned soldier by bringing to bear against him the whole of the legal knowledge and oratorical force of the Crown Law Department. I cannot imagine that such would be the desire of the Department. I am sure that the aim of the Repatriation Department will always be, as it has been from the beginning, the sympathetic administration of the Act. I am rather strong in my objection to the legal fraternity. I do not say this out of any disrespect to them, because they are a very useful organization, but in practical investigations they undoubtedly cloud the issue. Often a verdict is obtained, not on the merits of the case, but from the force of arguments advanced by these gentlemen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> latest suggestion does not relieve the Minister or the Committee very much from the position that we see and object to, because the returned soldiers represent all grades of society, and the fact that a man has been to the Front is by no means an absolute guarantee of an angelic disposition. Some men who have been to the Front would be just as apt to indulge in the practices outlined by the Minister as those who have not been. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> might agree to move that the secretary of the returned soldiers&#39; organization should be allowed to represent the appellant. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened attentively to the suggestion which has been made, and it seems to me that its adoption would involve the possibility of very serious disabilities. If a soldier has the right to employ a legal advocate before the Commission, he must also have the right to select that advocate. In other words, he should not be bound to. an official of an organization who may already have expressed an opinion adverse to the position which he is called upon to support. I look upon the returned soldiers&#39; organization not so much as a body which is involved in the advocacy of particular cases, but as an organization whose view is valuable in respect of a general policy. If the secretary of that body is obliged to take up the case of a particular man, it is not unreasonable to assume that he may -become biased in respect of it, and that as a result the organization may be placed in a false position. I repeat that if an appellant is to have a right to employ a legal advocate, he should also have the right to select that advocate. I ask the Committee to retain the provision as it stands. I have an assurance that the Commissioner of Pensions has never refused any person the right to put his own case or to employ somebody to put it for him. I have known the Repatriation Commission to refuse to grant interviews to persons in respect of cases which were parallel to others that had already been decided. For instance, if a decision had been arrived at in the case of A, and B comes along to-morrow with a similar case, it would only be encouraging fa&#39;lse hopes in his breast to grant him an interview. </para>

                        <para>- Similar inequalities obtain as the result of judicial decisions to-day. One man who goes before a jurY gets six months, whilst another individual is acquitted in almost identical circumstances. These results arise from the inescapable effect of the personal equation. It is a mistaken notion that either the pensions or the repatriation authorities have endeavoured to administer the principal Act unsympathetically Of course, they have&#39; had to put their foot down firmly in certain cases. But it must be remembered that a great ma.pority of the Repatriation officials are returned soldiers, so that 99 times out of 100 the applicant who goes before them has sympathetic friends working for him. I ask the Committee to allow the clause to stand in its present form. </para>

                    <para>. -  In the great majority of cases it is quite impossible for an applicant to plead his case without the assistance of a trained expert. No doubt some of those who are directly concerned are very efficient. But on the other hand many of them are quite incapable of supporting the claim which they desire to put before the State Board or the Central Commission. What harm can result from allowing these people to employ a solicitor? </para>

                        <para>- We have technically excluded lawyers from that tribunal, but, as a matter of fact, they are still employed there, because the men who are engaged in advocating the claims of the various trade unions are fairly well trained from a legal stand-point. They are as good as most lawyers, and better than a great many. Under the Bill there is no obligation on the part of a soldier to employ either a solicitor or the secretary of the Returned Soldiers Association. It would be a very great mistake to throw the work that would be involved in appeals upon the secretary, whose time, I . presume, is already fully occupied. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly there are amongst the Australian Imperial Force a considerable number who are not able to put their own cases half as well as other persons could state them. That is the reason. why people employ paid advocates. Doubtless it was an oversight on the part of the draftsman of the Bill that some such provision as is embodied in the amendment was omitted from it. </para>

                    <para>. - I would point out that the appeal which we are now considering is an appeal from the decision of the State Boards. Now, those Boards will be thoroughly seized of the facts connected with&#39; any particular appeal, and that appeal will be to the Commission, one of whose members, at least, will be a returned soldier. The result of any such appeal will, therefore, not depend so much upon the way in which the appellant gives his evidence as upon the nature of the evidence given before the State Board. We all know that it will be the desire of the Commission to discover the true facts of the case, whereas it may be the object of a paid advocate to cloud the real issue, and to place the case in an entirely different light, which may not always be to the benefit of the soldier. I prefer the clause in its present form. </para>

This matter has been under very careful consideration by those responsible for the administration of the Pensions Act for some time, because it affects pensions rather than repatriation. All the medical advice goes to indicate that it is absolutely impossible to say if certain forms of invalidity are permanent or otherwise, and it is not thought right to fix a limit of the kind suggested, because if a man be completely restored to health a few months after his application for a pension, it is only right that the payment should be reviewed. The majority of cases fortunately do show some degree of improvement as time goes on, and so the amount of pension is gradually written down. No great hardship will be involved by requiring a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> pensioner to present himself, say, once in six months, to enable the doctor to see how he is getting on. If his invalidity is permanent his pension will not be affected, but if his invalidity is passing away, then his pension payment should likewise be less. We cannot ignore with safety the medical advice on the subject. If after apparently having been restored to health, a soldier&#39;s invalidity returns, he may become an applicant again. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause gives me the impression that the power to capitalize the pensions up to 30 per cent, of total disablement lies in the hands of the Commission without any safeguard for the pensioner. If the Commission assesses a lump sum as commutation of the pension, the pensioner will be bound to accept the assessment. Consequently I suggest, for the consideration of the Minister, that some amendment of the clause is needed. It is the desire of the Committee, I take it, to protect the pensioner. I would not like to see the clause pass in its present form, seeing that it places an arbitrary power in the hands of the Commission to commute the pension at an amount which might not be acceptable to a pensioner. The addition of on&#169; or two words would, I think, make it perfectly clear that any commutation made by the Commission should be subject to acceptance by the pensioner. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to tell the Committee what the practice is under this clause. No cases will be considered unless a specific&#39; application comes from the pensioner. I do not know on what percentage basis the Commission will work, but I submit that if the Committee has any doubt as to how the commutation will be made, I would prefer it to determine the point. What might be a reasonable basis for commutation to-day, might not be a reasonable basis five years hence. If a pension of &#163;12 were capitalized to-day it might be said that &#163;200 would earn the amount, whereas la, few years hence a much larger sum might be necessary. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I suggest, therefore,  that  discretion should be left to the Commission. I understand very few applications will be made under this clause, but if it is so &#39;amended as to permit a pensioner to make application, and then decline the commutation, I venture to say that there will be thousands of applications from pensioners, who desire to know the capitalized! value of their pensions, but have no intention of taking it; in much the same way as many policy-holders apply to insurance companies to ascertain the surrender value of their policies. The amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would throw a tremendous amount of work upon the Commission, so I suggest that the clause be left as it is. </para>

                    <para>. - I am still not quite satisfied, and wish to show what is actually taking place in connexion with accident insurance policies. If a man is covered in an accident insurance company, and is unfortunate enough to sustain injuries that interfere with his full earning capacity, he has certain rights, under our State laws, and receives a stated amount per week according to the extent of the injury. Very often men so injured are unfit to follow their usual vocation and desire to branch out into some other line of business, and so they make application to the insurance company for a commutation of pension payment. If an applicant does not think the sum sufficient he &#39; has a right to decline it, and is not prejudiced in any way by his inquiry and application. Under this clause, if a pensioner is partially disabled or prevented from following his ordinary occupation, and if he inquires the capital value of his pension, thinking that he would prefer a lump sum in lieu of a continuing payment, the Commission will have power to assess the lump sum, and the soldier applicant will be obliged to accept it, though in his opinion it may not be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- I do not favour a compulsory clause. If a person has been granted a pension, we may assume that he is justly entitled to it. If the Commission has the power to say that a lump sum may be given, there may be the desire to get the case off its hands. The pensioner should be able to accept or reject the sum; but perhaps the Minister will be able to say how far this provision extends. A case may come before the Commission in which a man receives less than one-third of the totally incapacitated rate, and such a case might be assessed by the Commission and a lump sum offered to abrogate all further claims, </para>

                        <para>- The clause refers to &#34; the member &#34; of the A.I.F. The lowest rate in the schedule on page 20 is one-half, which means that a soldier receiving a life pension will not be able to get the benefit of a lump-sum payment. I desire to ask the Minister to consider the question of amending the provision so that it will apply to a man who has only one eye. I know of a case in New South Wales where a man applied to have his pension capitalized. He was a steady person and one likely to be successful working on his own account. He had been a member of the Flying Corps, and as he had lost one eye, he was receiving only one-half of the full pension. Apart from the disability mentioned, be is in possession of all his faculties, and although he is not able to follow  his  trade as an employee,_ be is capable of entering business on his own account. I think it is reasonable to ask the Minister to extend the facilities to a man who has lost one eye. </para>

                    <para>. - Although the question raised is worthy of consideration, I do not think it is of major importance. 1 therefore suggest two amendments, which I think will meet the views expressed by all but the last  speaker.  It has been pointed&#39; out that if the clause is literally interpreted it would leave the Commission free to initiate action, but I, too, think it right that the action, if initiated at all, should be at the request of the pensioner. To meet the position, I shall later move to insert at the beginning of the clause, &#34;Upon the application of a pensioner and&#34;. That will mean that no action will be taken unless the pensioner so desires. I shall also move to add after &#34;shall&#34; (line 10) the words, &#34;with  the consent of the pensioner.&#34; That will meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Pratten&#39;s  objection. </para>

                <para>In regard to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I may say that it was never intended to get away from the present pension system. It would be rather undesirable, on a broad scale, to pay capital sums to a large number of men. Many of them would undoubtedly make good use of the money, but there would be others who would not. It would be idle to ignore the fact that some would be tempted to indulge in dissipation, and to spend the money in undesirable ways, or dispose of it in a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> effort to start in an undertaking for which . they were ill-equipped. In such cases further applications would be made when the pension had been exhausted. The idea of spreading the payment over a period of years is to provide a form of insurance and to enable the pensioner to receive assistance from time to time. The intention was not to make the payment of the pension in a lump sum general, but to deal only with special cases. For instance, at the outbreak of war some new arrivals from the Old Country, who had not been here sufficiently long to take root and make friends, joined up with the Australian Imperial Force. After having seen service abroad, they returned to Australia injured, and rather than remain here they desired to take the pension in a lump sum, and return to England to be with their friends. It was to meet cases of that kind that the Commission was  empowered  to take action. This does not apply to life pensions. The Commission has said that in cases involving a lump-sum payment of perhaps &#163;10 to &#163;20, the money has been paid, and the recipients have gone. </para>

                    <para>. -  I totally disagree with the point of view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil.</inline> I am in entire sympathy in giving discretion to the Commission to commutate a small pension up to 30 per cent, of the rate allowed to totally incapacitated men, hut I strongly oppose the power being given to the Commission, the Government, or any one else <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> capitalize pensions of a higher amount. It all seems to point to the illustration I previously submitted, that there are many men who, to a minor extent, are , prevented from following their old occupations to whom this clause would be of special benefit, as it will enable them to engage in some other occupation, and eventually become successful and useful citizens. We are here to do our best for the soldiers, and&#39; the clause, as amended by the Minister, will assist. But we are also here to protect the soldiers, even against themselves. I cannot support the commutation of a pension which is the major part of a man&#39;s sustenance, as the capitalization of a minor portion is going quite far enough. Those receiving over 30 per cent, of the total rate should be protected from themselves. If no &#39;discretion is given to the Commission, a higher rate than 30 per cent, of the pension will have to stand, as at present. I am not in favour of commutation of life pensions. </para>

Under the existing Act, a widowed mother is entitled to claim a pension in respect of each of her sons who has died as a result of war service, whether she was dependent upon him or not.

                    <para>. - The reason why the clause is submitted in its present form is that it is felt that it is rather a serious thing to withdraw a pension once it is granted. It was thought preferable not to leave such a decision to a State Board, but to take it to the highest authority established under the Bill. Another reason for the adoption of that course is that, the Commission acting for the whole Commonwealth, there would be greater uniformity in the principle upon which such decisions would be arrived at. If honorable senators prefer that a State Board should give its decision first, and that that decision should be subject to review by the Commission, I have no objection, and I move - </para>

                        <para>- The earlier proposal was to bring munition-workers under the provision regarding pensions. That proposal was defeated. It is intended by a subsequent clause to clothe the Commission with power to make recommendations to the Governor-General for regulations to provide for the granting of assistance and benefits to Australian soldiers upon their discharge from the service, or the children of deceased or incapacitated Australian soldiers, while those children are by reason of physical or mental disability incapable of contributing to their own support, or are under the age of eighteen years. In a number of other cases, as set out in clause 46; the Governor-General in Council is to be armed with authority to make regulations providing for the disbursement of assistance and benefits. With all due respect to your opinion, sir, I think I am entitled to ascertain whether the Committee is prepared to extend that assistance and those benefits to the persons named in my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The two clauses are so closely interwoven that it would be an advantage to consider them together. The Minister has suddenly moved a considerable number of amendments which were difficult to follow. Some of them have been circulated and others have not, or I have not seen them. Clause 46 deals with a number of very important cases, which we should be allowed to consider when dealing with clause 45. In view of the services rendered by the munition workers, and the hardships their wives and families suffered during their .prolonged absence in Great Britain, we might very well extend the privileges granted under clause 45 to them, notwithstanding the decision arrived at by the Committee, and the decision apparently already arrived at by the Government. We have to-day considerably enlarged the scope of the Bill, and made it possible to pay out a great deal more money, and, therefore, my amendment ought to be favorably received. At one time nurses were not regarded as active participants in war-like operations. Today no branch of the service is more honored than the nursing staff. The Medical Corps and a number of other bodies attached to an active army were not regarded as at all in the same category as the men in the actual firing line, but to-day that difference in their treatment has been swept away. The small extension I ask for will not lead to great additional expenditure, but it will mete out to these people a degree of justice which they have hitherto been denied. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> stated the other day that the total number of persons involved would not exceed 5,000. The great majority of them returned to Australia in good health, and will make no claim whatever against the Repatriation Department, but no doubt there are some cases where it would be giving only the barest  justice to incorporate this amendment in the clause. I am anxious to see the measure put through; and only  regret that the Committee did not sit all night last night to complete it. I am sure that if my amendment had occurred to the Government when the Bill was being drafted they would have included it, and they should not hesitate, now that the matter has been fully explained to them, to extend the benefits of the Bill to this small but very useful body of men. </para>

                    <para>. -  Under clauses 47 and 50 sums of money are permitted to be raised by a specific method. Such moneys are to be distributed amongst the cases mentioned in the clause, which is now under review. Now it may happen that one of the Local Committees may desire to assist  a  returned munition worker, who has contracted a disease, or sustained an injury while he was absent abroad, by building a house for him. It may be anxious to help him by discharging similar functions to those discharged by it in the case of returned soldiers. Then I think that  a  considerable amount of usefulness might result from local charities working in conjunction with Local Committees for the benefit of returned men. </para>

Local persons raising money to-day are at liberty to spend it just how they choose. Previously they could not do that. But, as soon as the war ceased, it was recognised that it was desirable that we should refrain from interfering with the ordinary affairs of the population, and leave local authorities to do just what they liked. No harm can result from the freedom which has been given to them.

                        <para>. -  The argument advanced by the Minister is an exceedingly good one when applied  to matters  outside those which have arisen out of the war. But it is a weak argument when applied to our war workers. Last night, the Minister mentioned the case of our wheat-growers, and the part which they took in helping to win the war. May I point out that they were not liable to personal injury as were our war workers. </para>

                        <para>- I grant that&#34; the marine workers have a claim. But one argument does not vitiate the other. The ; claim that the farmers of this country assisted in winning the war does not derogate from that of the munition workers who incurred a great deal more risk of personal injury. Many of these men were employed within the danger zone of air raids, and to debar them from the benefits conferred by this clause seems unjust. I wish to recognise the services which they rendered to the community. </para>

I would have preferred that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> should have moved for a recommittal of a prior clause, because I fear that, under the amendment, we shall be opening the door to expenditure very much  wider  than we should have done under his proposal of last -evening. I fail to understand exactly the liability which the adoption of his amendment would impose upon the Commonwealth, and for that reason I cannot support it with the same heartiness that I did his proposal of yesterday. </para>

In the Pensions Department, for instance, work is being done by certain State officers, and it is necessary, in the transition period, that we should take advantage of their experience and knowledge. As the honorable senator will know, it would be impossible to transfer, between Saturday night and Monday morning, all the work of the Department to a new staff. It may, and probably will, be necessary to utilize the services of the existing pensions staff for a certain period. </para>

The clause has special reference to donations of money or property which generously disposed citizens may see fit to give for the purpose of benefiting our soldiers.

Like individuals, they vary very much; but, as I mentioned in my second-reading speech, making allowance for the fact that the gentlemen who comprise these honorary bodies are men of force and character, it is only to be expected that occasionally they do not see eye to eye with the Administration. I feel, however, that it is a matter for congratulation that the causes of friction have been so few. Here and there a Local Committee has made up its mind that the </para>

                    <para>. -  The clause provides that the books and accounts kept by a Local Committee shall be subject to audit as prescribed. I take it that the prescription for the audits will be contained in the regulation, and I hope that some elasticity will be allowed in connexion with the accounts of small committees. For instance, a Local Committee,  200  or  300  miles in the interior, should not be subjected to departmental red-tape methods. It should be sufficient, I think, if a local man were given instructions to make the audit and furnish a certificate. I am raising the point in order to prevent any unnecessary trouble to hundreds of estimable citizens who have been giving their services gratuitously for the purpose . of benefiting our returned soldiers. </para>

                    <para>. -  The view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is one which the regulations have been framed to conform to. It was recognised that with so many committees in existence it would be foolish to stipulate in an Act of Parliament exactly how the audit should be conducted. It is therefore to be left to the Commission to determine the matter, and I have no doubt that that elasticity for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is pleading will be provided for. Two points are covered by the clause- one, those funds for which the Department is responsible, and the other, funds which a Local Committee has raised itself. We propose to release all control of the latter. In future these committees can raise funds and administer them as they like. In regard to the books of account, they are acting as agents of the Department in administering public funds, and it is quite clear that there must be a sufficient and satisfactory audit. I do not say an irksome one, but there should be proper protection of public money, and also an audit in conformity with the Audit Act. Everything is done in the way of a proper presentation and examination of accounts. </para>

                    <para>. -  Before the amendment is put, and in view of the possibility of being ruled out of order if I were to raise the point at a later stage, I may state that the words &#34;King&#39;s Dominions&#34; are hardly accurate. I believe the proper designation of the Empire is, &#34;Great Britain and Ireland and the Dominions overseas.&#34; That clause is intended to apply not only  to  the King&#39;s Dominions overseas, but  also  to the temporary residents of the United Kingdom. It is intended to apply to  all  parts of the Empire. The drafting appears  to  be rather crude. </para>

                    <para>. - It  is impossible to run through all the various grades, but I can supply the honorable senator with basic figures. For instance, the present pension of 30s. in the case of total incapacity is raised by this Bill to 42s. The pensions in the case of every lesser degree of incapacity are correspondingly increased, since these are based on a percentage of the pension for total incapacity. For instance, a man adjudged to be incapacitated to the extent of 50 per cent, is, under the existing law, receiving a &#39;pension of 15s., and under this Bill 50 per cent, of the basic rate will bring his pension up to &#163;11s. In every other case of lesser incapacity the pension will be raised under this Bill proportionately in accordance with the difference between the basic figures of 30s. and 42s. fixed for total incapacity under the existing law and under this Bill respectively. The wife&#39;s pension, in the case of total incapacity, is at present 15s., and that by this Bill is raised to 18s., so that, in the case of total incapacity, husband and wife will, under this Bill, receive &#163;3 per week as against <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 5s. paid under the existing law. The widow to-day receives 42s., and will receive the same amount under this Bill, plus the allowance for children of 10s. for the first, 7s. for the next, and 5s. for each succeeding child. If there are no children, the pension is lifted from &#163;1 to 23s. 6d.; but if in the opinion of the Commission, because of ill-health or for other reasons a widow is unable to look after herself, the allowance may be raised to the level of that paid in the case of a widow with children. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will find in column three the fortnightly rate of payment. The figures I have given cover by far the larger number of beneficiaries. There is one very important increase provided for, and that is in the case of pensions paid to blinded and otherwise totally and permanently incapacitated men. The pension to-day is 30s., and under .  this Bill it will be raised to 80s. Men so afflicted will not only receive that amount of pension, but their wives and children will be entitled to the pensions allotted to wives and children generally. Unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> can indicate particular cases upon which he desires information, I do not know that I can profitably add to the statement I have just made. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to direct attention to  a  feature of the schedule which specially appeals to me. I notice by column five that the pension payable to the wife of  a  member of the Forces who is totally incapacitated is the same amount per fortnight whether the husband drew pay at the rate of 6s. per day or 17s. 6d. per day. That, so far as I know, is something new in our legislation, and it meets with my entire approval. The Government have in this matter gone a long way in the right direction, and later on they might see their way to carry the same principle throughout, and give the same amount per fortnight to the wife of a member of the Forces who is totally incapacitated without respect to the military pay which he drew while in the service. </para>

It indicates that, roughly, there is to be an increase of 40 per cent, on the basis first fixed for those totally incapacitated, and 20 per cent, increase in the case of dependants. I am perfectly satisfied that the reply to those who say that the pensions at present are too small is &#39;that this Bill raises them by 40 per cent. </para>

There might well have been another column added to the first schedule of this Bill giving information showing the grades of members of the Forces receiving the various rates of pay set down. I was puzzled by the schedule as it stands, and I confess that I do not know who gets 6s., and who gets &#163;2 2s. I do not know whether a private, a major, or a lieutenant-colonel gets any particular rate of pay set down. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot see the force of the honorable senator&#39;s argument. I conclude that what he thinks ought to be done is to have a column showing that a private gets a certain pension, a lieutenant such another pension, and so on. Instead of expressing that by the ranks of various individuals, it is expressed in the terms of the pay they receive. I venture to say there is no soldier who did not know what rate of pay he was getting. </para>

All that requires to be stated, therefore, is the rate of pay received by them when members of the Forces. It would be foolish to put the different ranks into  the  Bill. It is easy to find out from the rates of pay what the ranks were. </para>

                    <para>. - The &#39;honorable senator&#39;s criticism does not condemn me, because I was simply quoting the British Act. It merely shows what absolute wisdom we have in Australia. The honorable senator in a most sweeping way condemns the British Act by saying that the men are no longer privates or non-commissioned or commissioned officers. I think we ought to cable that information to England. All I desired was to make the schedule clear. I had no objection to the Bill, but we should take the opportunity to show clearly what the first column means. We have to get the information, not from the schedule, but from the Minister&#39;s explanation. We cannot pierce the cloud, and only those who have been behind it know what it means. We are passing a schedule which is intelligible only to military .on- naval officers, or others who are accustomed to that kind of thing. </para>

                    <para>. - Power is given to the Commission by this schedule to grant special pensions not exceeding &#163;8 per fortnight, or &#163;4 per week. All honorable senators must be sympathetic with the special treatment of blinded soldiers, who will be paid &#163;4 per week under this schedule, but I am somewhat puzzled by the inclusion of other soldiers,, the words reading, &#34;And to members who are totally and permanently incapacitated (i.e., incapacitated for life to such an extent as to be precluded from earning other than a negligible percentage of a living wage).&#34; So far as I can see, these men are already dealt with in column four of the first schedule, which sets out the &#39; &#39;pension payable to a member upon total incapacity.&#34; I bring this point under the notice of the Minister because, in the absence of an explanation,  there is a clear inconsistency and clash between the two schedules. Some well-defined line should be laid down to show how and why the Commission should grant special pensions. </para>

                    <para>.- The fourth column of schedule  1  refers to &#34;totally incapacitated&#34; men, and schedule  2  to &#34; totally and permanently incapacitated&#34; men. A man stunned for a few minutes may be totally incapacitated for the time being, but he is not totally and permanently incapacitated. He may achieve the same result in a variety of ways that will occur to honor - able senators. The expression &#34; totally and permanently incapacitated &#34; is intended to apply to those men who are literally what the words say. These include cases of spine injury; men who are paralyzed, and who, unfortunately, can never hope to recover. This special rate is designed for those special cases. We are making provision for the majority of them in the hostels, such as the Graythwaite Hostel, near Sydney, and the Anzac Hostel, at Brighton, Victoria. Most cf them -will, by degrees, if not immediately, become inmates of those institutions. They require such constant and varied care and attention that it is not possible to supply it to them in ordinary homes. For such of them as elect to remain outside of those institutions, this provision is being made. </para>

                    <para>.- There are certain forms of injury received by soldiers which may not be regarded as lessening their earning capacity, but which should, nevertheless, be recognised in this schedule. Some of them are very disfiguring, such as serious facial injuries, which would not interfere with the capacity of a man who was employed as a mechanic or workman. As that form of injury is not included in column one, it would appear that the soldier is not entitled to any pension on account of it; but I submit that some cognizance should be taken of it by including it in the schedule. </para>

Whilst there can be no great objection to his proposal, I submit that no advantage would accrue from its adoption. Every particular case which is set out in the British schedule is already provided for in this Bill. In the British schedule, for example, provision is made for &#34; wounds, injury, or disease resulting in disabled men being permanently bedridden.&#34; Such cases are covered in our schedule by the words &#34; totally and permanently incapacitated.&#34; Again, in the British schedule provision is made for cases of &#34; wounds of, or injurious to, the head or brain, involving total permanent disablement or Jacksonian epilepsy.&#34; These cases are also covered in our schedule by the words to which I have already directed attention. Although facial disfigurement is not specifically included in our schedule, the practice has been to regard it as equal to total incapacity. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to doing that. But certainly its absence from our schedule has not prejudiced the claims of any Australian soldier, because in practice the victim of facial disfigurement has been allowed the full pension provided in the case of total incapacity. Again, in the British schedule various rates of&#39; pensions are set out for men suffering from the amputation of an arm. If the amputation . has been made very high, the rate of pension granted is proportionately greater. The rates range from 90 per cent, to 40 per cent. In Australia, however, we have adopted a flat rate of 75 per cent. Obviously, we are extending to our soldiers very much more liberal treatment. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> desires facial disfigurement to be included in the schedule, I shall be glad to accede to his wish. But owing to the fact that we have passed the stage at which he can secure the insertion of his suggested amendment, I will undertake to recommit the Bill in order to afford him an opportunity of moving it. Should anything prevent me from securing the recommittal of the measure, I promise him that his amendment will be inserted in another place. </para>

Presumably they will be included amongst those case which have to come under review every three months. Then, again, a large number of our soldiers were fighting in malarial regions, and. we know that when once malaria has gripped a man he is afflicted with it for life. The individual who is subject to malaria is likely to go down at any time, and for that reason is prejudiced in the matter of securing employment. I ask the Minister to give consideration to the two classes of cases which I have mentioned. </para>

As  a matter of fact, they are. They receive 75 per cent, of the full rate.

When we reflect upon the enormous number of men who enlisted for service abroad, and who have now returned, we must be convinced that there are amongst them plenty of individuals who are perfectly qualified to fill positions of this kind. </para>

We are concerned with the professed policy of the Government, which is preference to returned soldiers, though I do not know how long it is going to last. Here is an opportunity to incorporate the policy in the Bill, and I urge honorable senators to stand up to it. </para>
