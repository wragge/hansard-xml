                            <para>- The Prime Minister intimated on Wednesday last that the Prime Minister of New &#34;Zealand must have been misreported. He pointed ont that the agreement in regard to Nauru was a tripartite one, and that the parties thereto are to receive on the basis of their financial contributions, which are - Great Britain, 42 per cent. ; Australia, 42 per cent. ; and New Zealand, 16 per cent. He also explained that, in the event of there being insufficient phosphate for all, the residuum would be sold, . and the profits distributed on the basis already referred to. </para>

                        <para>In the &#39;first place the Wheat Pool is not responsible for the sale of the flour. It* sells wheat; it does not sell flour. The millers sold this flour. In the second place, the flour, which had been gristed from damaged Victorian second quality wheat, which had been reconditioned, and was described as B grade, was sold upon sample, a parcel of &#39;270 tons having been sent as a sample, and subsequent shipments were up to that sample. But it was sold -up to sample by the millers, and not by the Wheat Pool. Of course, I am sorry for the sake of the credit of Australian flour that there should have been , any occasion for complaints, but there is in the transaction no reflection on the Wheat Pool. I regret that it is not the only occasion in which Australians have done Australia incalculable injury. Those who do this  sort of thing are really guilty towards this country of a crime infinitely worse than those crimes for which men are punished in the ordinary way. The circumstances in which, this flour was bought by South Africa . must be remembered. In that country there was a great shortage of wheat, and they were perilously near the starvation border. Sight must not be lost of the fact that flour made from inferior wheat will spoil very much more readily than what is gristed from high grade wheat. For instance, 70 per cent, flour will keep very much longer than 80 per cent, flour. Weevils would begin to breed more speedily in the former than in the latter, and some time has elapsed since this particular flour was gristed. </para>

                    <para>. -  On this  point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I  may point out that  we  shall  have several  money Bills before the Senate this  week,  and in connexion with them honorable senators should have the privilege  of a  full debate. While I do not think  it  is the intention of honorable senators to repeat themselves in any way, it is of  vital  importance to the Senate that there should be some debate upon the Budget proposals, and  I  think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will give us an opportunity at  an  early date of debating the &#39;Budget,  he  will perhaps save some duplication of debate so far as these measures are concerned. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is one of the Bills upon which honorable senators, on the first reading, have the right in debate to wander from Dan to Beersheba. I need hardly remind honorable senators that  if  we allow the first reading to go - we have allowed the first reading of the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill to pass - there may not be another opportunity to deal generally with some of the subjects that are uppermost&#39; in our minds, unless the Minister will definitely promise us  an  early opportunity for the discussion of the Budget, which includes  all  the matters dealt with in these minor Bills. I realize that if I resume my seat now I shall have lost my right to speak on the first reading of this Bill ; but I am making these few remarks with the object of urging the Minister, if possible, to give the Senate an opportunity to debate the financial proposals of the Government, thus saving in same measure duplication of debate with regard to these smaller Bills. </para>

I think the same thing, identically, cropped up in connexion with the Nauru Agreement Bill. If my memory serves me right, a clause in that measure approved of the whole Agreement, and honorable senators then pointed out that if it were passed, any discussion on the schedule would be redundant. In this Bill, clause 2 approves of the schedule. In the case of the Nauru Agreement Bill, the Minister in charge agreed to postpone the clause approving the Agreement until the schedule had been passed. </para>

I have already said that I believe we are making a mistake in passing &#39; such, a measure; but I desire to throw out the suggestion that even now some effort might be made to make the . State Government of Western Australia shoulder the responsibility in connexion with this undertaking.- Even in the schedule an amendment might be made whereby the company formed under the Companies- Act of Western Australia might obtain a guarantee from the State Government for a redemption of the loan, or any advances made by the Commonwealth Government under this agreement. </para>

I feel sure that we are establishing . a precedent by passing the schedule in its present form which is likely . to cause very much trouble in the future. If a promoter or  a  company has to obtain the backing of the &#39;Government before any advance is made, the Commonwealth Government will be fairly safe. </para>

If the Government can see their way to provide protection in the direction I have indicated, so that the State Government will guarantee the repayment of the money, my objection to the Bill will be removed. I am not prepared to move an amendment, but I am willing to give my assistance in that direction if the schedule is postponed for further consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- When we were discussing the second reading of the Bill, I received an assurance from the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> that the Government of Western Australia would give the necessary backing. In reply to an inquiry as to what the &#34; necessary backing &#34; meant, I was informed that the Government of Western Australia were prepared to find the necessary sites for silos, and I replied that that was. not backing as I understood at. The backing is the financial support of the State in which the project is to be carried out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has submitted a proposition which is worthy of consideration, and I believe the honorable senator is quite right in suggesting that we should amend the schedule in the direction indicated. If the measure becomes law in its present form it will mean that the Commonwealth Government will be inundated with applications from companies and individuals who are anxious to establish industries in a State. The functions of the Commonwealth Government should be to deal with States, &#39;and not with individuals or firms. As the company has approached the Western Australian Government, asking them to pass the necessary legislation in connexion with this venture, surely it is reasonable to suggest that they should go a little further and ask the Government to provide the necessary financial guarantee. I trust that honorable senators will give favorable consideration to this point, because . it will be the means of making the measure absolutely watertight, and show those in other States that th&#169; Commonwealth Government is prepared to help if the support of the State Government is assured. </para>

                    <para>. -  It has been suggested that a State Government should be behind undertakings of this character, and should guarantee the financial responsibility; but the object of the Bill, from the Government&#39;s point of view, is to assist those who are endeavouring to help themselves. The measure embodies a form of co-operation as against State control, and, as. far as can be ascertained, a majority of the farmers in Western Australia are iri favour of a cooperative system. If the State Government were to be brought into the scheme, it would be objectionable to many honorable senators. It is the policy of the Government to support those who are trying to help themselves. </para>

                        <para>- Personally, I think that the local people should themselves decide as to the method which should be adopted, just as the farmers  Of  Western Australia have decided for themselves. When I am asked whether the Government of that State is involved in this scheme, my reply is in the affirmative. We have accepted the word of the Premier of Western Australia that certain lands will be provided for the purpose of this scheme ; I do not know under what conditions the use of those lands will be granted, but probably it will be necessary to pass an Act of Parliament dealing with the matter. </para>

                        <para>- We have the last say in regard to the interpretation of the Bill, and the moment the Government of Western Australia fail to interpret it in the way that we think it should be interpreted, we possess the power to withhold the requisite funds. In other words, if the Western Australian Government do not comply with the conditions of the contract, both in the letter and the spirit, we can cease to advance money. In New South Wales we provided the funds for the erection of silos, and, although we experienced&#39; some little difficulties, these were satisfactorily adjusted so that the Act under which the advances were made has worked very smoothly. </para>

But was the Commonwealth Parliament called into existence to enact legislation of this character! Was it created for the ,purpose of putting &#163;500,000 into an enterprise of this kind, when there are men in this Chamber who will affirm that we have not the money necessary to enable us to honour the compact which was entered into with New South Wales some twenty years ago to establish the Federal Capital in her territory ? I regard the scheme outlined in this measure as an innovation, and  a  dangerous innovation at that. </para>

                        <para>- And the entire failure of it may come from a lack of efficient management. I intend to support the Bill, because it is part of the policy of the party to which I belong to take risks in the matter of State ownership and State control. If honorable senators opposite do not go the whole way with us in that connexion they will at least come half way by providing us with the necessary money. If we started a&#34; huge co-operative trade concern, forming a Soviet, if I may use that term, and could show the &#39;Government clearly that by all our tradesmen working together co-operatively we could establish comfortable homes for them, do honorable senators think the Government would advance &#163;2 for every &#163;1 that we put in ? I do not. I cannot refrain from expressing my astonishment at the Government dabbling in legislation of this kind, and at the hugeness of the sum that they are intrusting to certain people. I know they are people to be relied on for their ability and integrity; but thousands who answer that description may not have the ability to manage affairs of this magnitude. The whole tract of Australia is strewn with the wreckage of concerns of this kind - I will not say where the Government have been interfering, but where private companies and firms have. There are as many wrecks and failures as there are successes. I take the opportunity on this schedule to express my surprise at the action of the Government in introducing the Bill; but they will find a supporter for it  in  me, because it will pave the way for us. </para>

                    <para>. -I am glad to hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that there is some chance of the labour unions bringing forward industrial co-operative schemes on these lines. If they do, their past policy will be entirely reversed. I have pointed out  for years that industrial  unrest  could be solved if the labour unions, instead of striking, devoted their money to buying enterprises. If they did that, we should be on the eve of industrial rest. The cost of one strike would more than run an enterprise of this sort.. From that point of view, if a feasible scheme were brought forward, and &#39;the unions wanted &#163;2 from the Government for every &#163;1 they put in, the &#163;1 being the first liability . to be lost, the Senate would, I am sure, favorably consider it on its merits. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> rightly -says that the whole success of the Western Australian scheme depends on the management. Unfortunately, he was not here when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-brockman</inline> showed how splendidly managed the Western Australian co-operative concern has been, what great successes &#39;they have had &#39;there, and how likely it is that those successes will continue. We talk about a State guarantee; but the farmers do not want any more State interference, and in that I am with them up to the hilt. If the Government guarantee the scheme, there will be all kinds of official interferences in all directions. I would much sooner lend the money straight out to the farmers in a co-operative scheme, where they are putting . in their own cash, than I would run it with a Government guarantee, because they are more likely to fail if interfered with by the Government than if they have a free hand to manage it on business lines such as, -according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> have &#39;been followed in his State. I did want to see some delay, so that we could look into a number of matters; but we are told that the State Government are giving the land free for the silos, and are going to convert their trucks, all of which will cost a considerable sum of money. </para>

                        <para>- How could the Minister possibly lend the money if the State Government interfered with this co-operative scheme, and would not allow the wheat to be carried on the railways in bulk, or refused. to give the land to build the silos on? If the company cannot get the land from the Government, how. are they going to spend the money ? Obviously the consent of the Stake Government is necessary before the company can make a start at aH. &#39;It is a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> scheme. I  6imply  wanted a little delay to look into certain points, and to make quite certain that they contemplated spending far more than the sum mentioned, because that is only the first, instalment. A great number of other things will have to be undertaken, involving as much money again, and this money the farmers will have to spend. They simply want to handle their produce in the most economical way possible. We are threatened with an absolute shortage of bags. We may not be able to get them at all, and, therefore, I think the farmers of Western Australia are on the right lines. This is an exceptional proposition, which is put before us by people who are obviously going to manage it in the proper way. They have given proof of their managing capacity in the past, and we may well support them. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will bring along a trade union scheme, we will look thoroughly into it. If the unions have the backbone to put up a large sum of money instead of spending it on strikes, we will support and help them in every way we can. </para>

                    <para>. -  Clause 4 includes a number of desirable restrictions. I am pleased to see that dividends are restricted, in certain circumstances, to 8 per cent., the excess to be divided between the customers and the shareholders. I am also pleased to see that the company is compelled under the agreement to deal with grain from non-shareholders, and that no person other than a wheat-grower is eligible to hold shares. One point, however, it not quite clear to me. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> provides that &#34; the capital of the company shall be &#163;1,500,000, divided into 1,500,000 shares of &#163;1 each.&#34; &#34;Under this agreement, the maximum amount that the Commonwealth is called upon to assist the company with is &#163;550,000. It is estimated that the silos and elevators to be erected by the company for the purposes of the agreement will cost &#163;800,000. I cannot see the reason for creating a company with a capital of &#163;1,500,000, seeing that the full tenor of the schedule is that the work will be completed for round about &#163;800,000. What is. in the minds of the promoters in putting in that figure, and what is the object of capitalizing almost twice the amount that is shown to be necessary in the agreement ? </para>

                    <para>.- I may perhaps give the information that the honorable senator wants. The farmers of Western Australia are making provision for their immediate requirements, when they estimate that &#163;800,000 will be required to &#39; be spent to provide the silos. It has to be remembered that the company must look further ahead than next year, or even the year after. Certainly not one-tenth of the total available wheat-growing country in Western Australia has vet been brought under cultivation. We may look forward in the course of a few years to an annual crop in Western Australia from 20,000,000 acres. </para>

Honorable senators should bear in mind that when we speak of Western Australia we speak of one-third part of i&#62;he continent of Australia. There is an immense area of land, estimated at about 80,000,000 acres, in Western Australia capable of growing wheat. </para>

                        <para>-Brockman.  -I hope that the production of wheat in Western Australia will in future be a big factor in feeding the world. In the circumstances to which I have, referred, honorable senators will agree that it would be of little use to make provision for a company with but a limited capital. Provision must be made for future extension. It is hoped that in the future additional wheat-growers will be brought into, the company. Provision must be made for the extension of silo accommodation as the requirements of the company increase; hence the provision for  &#163;1,500,000  instead of the  &#163;250,000  which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> seems to consider desirable. </para>

I  can  assure the honorable senator  that  the Western Australian Government handed over  the  control  of  the wheat crop  to  this co-operative concern,  !by  which it was managed, during most of the  war  period. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will, I think, confirm my statement that  the wheat  business was handled better  in  Western Australia than in any other State  under  this arrangement.

As a matter . of fact, the present Government of Western Australia is composed half of members of the Country party and half of Nationalists, and the Government is certainly not going to wreck itself by putting obstacles in the way of the farmers, who are practically the Country party. In view of the assurance we are able to give to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> on the point he raised, and the composition of the present Western Australian Government, the honorable senator need have no fear that what he has suggested as possible will be likely&#39; to occur. </para>

                        <para>- That is just what I am coming to. If it is not obtained the Minister has said that that will mean an end to the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> wishes to make it quite clear that that will be the end of the agreement. He wishes to provide that the. promoter and the company must first of all obtain this authority, and that it shall not be sufficient for them merely to use their best efforts to obtain it. The clause is somewhat ambiguously framed. Senators Drake-Brockman and de Largie have assured us that, so far from it being likely that there will be friction between the Western Australian Government and this company, the contrary is likely to be the case. If that be so the company will have no difficulty in securing the required authority. That seems to me to be the justification for the amendment, and not the reason submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in support of it. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The promoter must obtain the necessary legislative and executive authority to carry out the objects of the company. That is a condition precedent to the operation of the agreement. But if we merely say. that the promoter and the company must forthwith take all necessary steps to obtain from the State of Western Australia the legislative and executive authority necessary, they may hereafter claim that they have done all that they could, and so have fulfilled their part of the agreement and the Commonwealth Government must fulfil its part. We are assured that there is not likely to be any friction between the Western Australian Government and this company; but, as the result of some disagreement in a matter of detail between the company and the Western Australian Government, the company may be unable to obtain what the Commonwealth; Government consider necessary. The com.pany may then say that it has done its best, and the Commonwealth Government will be bound to carry out its part of the agreement. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment is justified by the very arguments which have been adduced against it. </para>

Can the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> give any indication as to the procedure that is intended to be taken in the calling for tenders? I should like this information, because, in clause 10 of the schedule, there appears the estimated cost. Therefore, estimates must have been given by somebody, and some engineers must have been in negotiation with the promoters in connexion with these matters. I should not like it to be said that this has been a cut-and-dried job for any particular contractor. </para>

                    of the rumours that have reached my ears, and I think I am perfectly justified in asking the Minister- to- indicate what is in the mind of the Government; whether the contract will be thrown open to the whole world, or- whether this business has been practically fixed up with Metcalf &#38; Company, Will the contract be made available to engineers, not only in Australia but in America and England. I am given to understand that the engineering difficulties are not very great; that, in fact, the plans are practically standardized, and I do not want Metcalf &#38; Company to start out, as in New South Wales, and South Australia, by getting &#163;20,000 for plans. On behalf, may I say, even of the Western Australian farmers, who are putting their good money into this venture, I should like to know what is intended to be done under clause 8 of the schedule.

I may also add that, before the work is undertaken, it will be necessary to have designs which will be limited only by the number of applicants themselves. During the war, when we contemplated the erection of silos, and invited tenders for designing and supervision, we received communications from only three firms in the whole of Australia. In order to expedite matters we arranged for a conference of the engineers of the respective firms, and. agreed upon a compromise design for storage purposes. Now that we are back to normal times again the designs are a little better. In regard to this matter, the liability of the Commonwealth will be limited to that of finance. We shall not be involved in the internal working or management of the contract, but we shall be furnished with certificates by our engineers. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the New South Wales Government, in the end. did not call for tenders in connexion with some portions of the work, and that the construction was decided upon by mutual arrangement. We are, of course, in favour of every facility being given in this direction, and&#39; are not prepared to hand over &#163;550,000 to be expended in a loose manner. I shall discuss this phase of the question with the Solicitor-General in order to see if a more rigid arrangement cannot be made. I believe provision should be made in this direction, but we must not appear to be dictating unless it is absolutely essential for the protection of Commonwealth money. I shall see that the matter is brought under the notice of the Commonwealth officers, and shall say that it is the general desire that firms in all parts of the world - excepting those in ex-enemy countries, of course - shall have an opportunity of tendering, not only for the design, but for the work. </para>

Unfortunately for the Western Australian Government, the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pearce</inline> were -not sufficiently recognised, and he left them. Much of the preliminary work has, therefore, been done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pearce</inline> and the firm of Metcalf and Co. &#39; I believe other firms have also reported on the probable cost. The figure set down in the  measure is not binding, and as the undertaking is a huge one I am not prepared to say that that estimate is to be strictly adhered to. It may be a little more or a little less, but &#163;800,000 is set down as a fair estimate on the advice available. </para>

                    <para>. - Clause 10 of the schedule has a bearing in other directions. Assuming that the sum mentioned will be exceeded, the Western Australian farmers will find they will have to pay the whole of the extra money required, to complete the scheme. As shareholders, they will have to contribute whatever balance is required, because it is specifically stated in the Bill that the Commonwealth Government is committed to a maximum expenditure of &#163;550,000, irrespective of what the scheme costs when properly completed. In view of this, no Commonwealth Government will be able to lend the Western Australian farmers additional capital. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. During the second-reading debate, I said that on the basis of the cost of storage silos In New South Wales, the &#163;800,000, if limited to that, would provide bulk storage capacity for 15,000,000 or 16,000,000 bushels. But there is a very long way to travel from storage in wheat silos to complete bulk handling; and according to the estimate .given by the firm of Metcalf and Company to the&#39; South Australian Farmers&#39; Co-Operative Union, or the South Australian Government - I forget which, but I believe it was the latter - the cost will be considerably higher now. No honorable senator will deny that the completion of terminal elevators and the supplying of silos with the necessary machinery, and box trucks on the railways, in order to complete the scheme of bulk handling from silos at the railway station, to the point of loading in the ship, will cost somewhere about 4s. per bushel. </para>

                        <para>- I shall take the lower figure of 4s. per bushel. If we pass this measure in its present form, and 1 believe we shall, the &#163;800,000 is going to supply a complete bulk-handling system for only 4,000,000 bushels, because we cannot fill and refill elevators four or five times a year, as is done in America and Canada, owing to the different methods of garnering the crop. Therefore, even if the crop- average over the last five years 10,000,000 bushels - not travelling to the fanciful heights of my honorable  friend opposite, but confining ourselves to what has occurred in Western Australia - the expenditure required to complete the bulkhandling system will, on these figures, more nearly approximate &#163;2,000,000 than the estimate of &#163;800,000 mentioned in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The conditions in America and Canada are totally different, because in those countries they thresh the grain in the farmer&#39;s own time. It has been pointed out by some honorable senators that we .strip and garner the crop in five or six weeks, and that during that time the farmer has no time to cart to the silo. If the Western Australian farmers are to be satisfied with an estimate that will cover Hulk storage for only one-third of the crop, even on a 10,000,000-bushel basis, they will have to provide some sort of bulk storage on the farm, and it is more than probable that they will go back to placing their wheat in sacks on the farm at all event3. </para>

                        <para>- But it is not clear to the Western Australian farmers that move than &#163;800,000 may he required to set this scheme in operation. The point which I desire to stress is that the conditions which obtain here are not those which obtain in Canada and America. The estimated cost of the scheme will have to be largely increased, in order to enable the whole of the Western Australian wheat crop to be dealt with effectively. I am glad the Bill provides that the help of the &#39;Commonwealth shall cease when &#163;550,000 has been advanced, because I consider that a low and misleading estimate has been made. I say &#34;misleading&#34; with the greatest deliberation. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am putting upon record to-day something which ought to make them ashamed to come to the Commonwealth for further financial assistance. According to their own figures, the proposed advance of &#163;550,000 will provide them with all the money that &#39; they require. But, as far as I can judge, they will need the whole &#163;1,500,000 before the scheme can be carried out. However, I am glad that it is the farmers&#39; money, and not the Commonwealth funds, which is to be used for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>-  As an evidence of good faith the company is first required to put up the sum of &#163;100,000. Subsequently the Commonwealth will make advances in the proportion of &#163;2 for every &#163;1 expended by the company. I do not  think that the farmers of Western Australia will be keen upon dodging their obligations. They will rather be anxious to put up as much money as possible so as to diminish the amount which they will require from the Commonwealth. But the basis of the expenditure is as I have stated it to be, and we are quite satisfied that that basis is a sound one. </para>

We have been told that it is merely an expression of the policy of the Government to help the primary producer.

                    <para>. - My attention was directed to clause 24 some time ago,  for  the reason which has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> namely, the great discrepancy which exists between simple interest at 6 per cent, and compound interest at 10 per cent. Apart from that, it seems to me that the clause has been put in a wrong form. Most mortgages contain provision that a higher rate of interest shall be paid by the mortgagor in the event of unpunctual payments. But the usual method of providing  for  this penal rate is to declare first that the higher rate of interest  shall be the governing rate in respect of. the security that is offered, and then to make provision that, upon punctual payment, a less rate of interest shall suffice. The reason is that Courts of Equity have always relieved contractors as against penalties or forfeitures, and where originally agreements were made to pay a certain amount of interest, and in the event of unpunctual payment to pay a higher rate of interest, Courts of Equity have allowed the lower rate, although paid unpunctually, to be a full quittance of the obligation, because the Courts have invariably leant against penalties and against forfeitures. To overcome that disposition of the Courts of Equity, and in view of the fact that Courts of Law now . administer equity simultaneously with law, the usual practice has been to put into mortgages a, covenant to pay the higher rate of interest, and to provide that, if the interest be paid punctually on the date on which it is payable, or within a specified period afterwards, a less rate of interest shall be received. The same effect has been accomplished, and the Courts will sustain such an agreement. I very much doubt whether the Courts will sustain this paragraph, because it is, on the face of it, nothing more nor less than a penalty provision. In ordinary circumstances, the provision is for payment of the higher amount of interest, with a condition that if the interest is paid punctually, a less amount shall be accepted, and the court cannot then say that that is a penalty. As a matter of fact, it can say that it is a relief. The Court will not enforce a contract in which a penalty is agreed to be paid. . </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but it is still subject to approval by Parliament. On the face of it, this paragraph is valueless. We could provide that the company shall pay a penal rate of 20 per cent. I do not think it would have much more effect. As the agreement stands at present, if the company came up with their ordinary interest, even unpunctually, and insisted that the Commonwealth should accept it, and the Commonwealth refused to accept it, and sued them, the- Commonwealth would be in- the position of a litigant before a Court which would not enforce the penalty. Unless there is some explanation or justification for the. paragraph, it is therefore only so much waste print. </para>

                    <para>. - I am making inquiries as to the reason for inserting this paragraph. Probably the company volunteered a suggestion for such a penalty in their desire, to give positive assurances of their good intentions. In doing so, it seems to me that they have gone a little too far. There might have been a second advantage in making such a suggestion, in that the provision would be a very good collector, and of material assistance to the company in getting in their money, because they could point out the risk: to their members. </para>

The Law Department have drawn, up the agreement to protect the Government as far as possible. I hope that they will let me -know in a few minutes the reason for making a special exception in this case, instead of following the usual rule.

This paragraph might be a good weapon. Unless there is any special reason for. it I shall have no objection, if the Committee will let it go through now,, to considering the question of recommitting the paragraph.

                    <para>I wish to make a few statements of a general character. As most honorable senators have read the Budget, I need not recapitulate the reasons given by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> for wanting more revenue. Quite apart from the revenue aspect, every honorable senator is familiar with the vast increase in the cost of material for Post Office requirements. To give a few examples, galvanized iron costs now 600 per cent, more than in 1914, cable 100 per cent, more, and telegraph equipment from 50 per cent, to 250 per cent. more. It does not look as if we were going to be permitted to borrow loosely or wildly in the future for public works&#39;. It is generally admitted on all hands that during the war the financial restrictions placed on the Postal Department and on the extension of postal and other facilities were very hard and drastic, and that the country suffered considerable losses and inconvenience as the result. The Treasurer, in his Budget speech, announced that the expenditure would exceed the revenue by nearly &#163;4,000,000. The increase in salaries paid in the Post and Telegraph Department &#39; over the amount paid in 1913-14 is &#163;1,000,000, although the staff decreased by 116 in the same period. Wherever possible, postal facilities will be given to isolated districts. We must have a buoyant revenue, as the prospects of borrowing for public works will not be very rosy in the future unless we show a genuine desire to pay for a -very large proportion, of our public works out of revenue. This policy will entail more expenditure. Other countries have been increasing their rates of postage. The United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa have all increased their charges, and even our amended and increased rates will still be a long way under those of any other country of the world. The extra&#189;d. war postage will be merged into the ordinary postage rate. I , do not know whether that will be very consoling, because it simply makes what was originally adopted as an emergency war rate part of the permanent charge. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that, question at length on the clause itself. Largely, the reason is sentimental. It is recognised that Australia is a country of wide spaces, and the cost of disseminating information is very heavy. We propose to charge increased telephone rates to the people in the metropolitan areas, but not to those in the country, because we are anxious, by making low charges - even if honorable senators call this method a subsidy - to make the country more pleasant and habita.ble than it is to-day. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. No Government is enthusiastic about increasing charges. The only increase that we have made in postal rates in recent years has been the extra war tax, but we have increased everything else. The cost of material and the cost of labour and all other charges throughout the Department have gone up, and all these increased charges have had to be met. The Government have considered the whole proposition from the point of view of the national well-being, but they think it is only fair that some &#39; commercial principle should be observed in conducting a big business like the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not say that we should make these undertakings exactly pay dividends, but all the commercial branches of our governmental activities should about carry themselves, if no more. The day may come when we shall again have the cheaper rates, but I am afraid that they will never again be so cheap as they have been in the past. The total revenue from the Post Office in 1920 was &#163;6,744,972, and the expenditure &#163;6,649,655. The estimated additional revenue under this Bill is - from postage &#163;1,000,000, and from telegrams &#163;232,000. When one considers the increased expenditure necessary during the present abnormal period of high cost of material and increased wages, an additional revenue from this Department of &#163;1,300,000 is not too much to look for to meet extra expenditure due to conditions arising out of the war. I shall be glad in Committee on the Bill to supply honorable senators with details of increases in rates levied in other countries, and any other information in my possession. </para>

                    <para>With the exception of the votes for the Defence Department and the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, those included  in the schedule to this Bill are. not substantial. Most of the larger items of expenditure will be found included in the Loan Bill, which will come on for consideration later. There is an item of &#163;8.000 for the Federal Capital included in this Bill, and I understand that there is a desire to discuss the question of further expenditure at the Capital. I have no desire- to. restrict that discussion, but I suggest that it should not be taken on the item appearing in this Bill, but on the larger vote provided for expenditure at the Federal Capital in the Loan Bill. </para>
                    <para>The total amount asked for in this measure for additions, new works, and buildings is &#163;3,070,502. Of this amount &#163;2,000 is asked for the. Parliament, &#163;321 for the Treasury,. &#163;41,327 for the Home and Territories Department, &#163;1,302,153 for the Department of Defence (Military), &#163;313,214 for the Department of the Navy, &#163;294,20.0 for Departments of Navy and Defence (Air Services), &#163;42,031 for the Department- of Trad&#169; and Customs, &#163;392 for the Department of &#34;Works and Railways, and &#163;1,074,864 for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department-. These votes will be met out of revenue. Honorable senators will understand that during the war period, and especially from 1917-18 onwards, expenditure upon public works in this country has been very greatly restricted, with the result that many of the Departments are behind in this regard. There is provision made in this Bill for some expenditure in connexion with th&#169; Arsenal. &#34;We have learned that whilst we have the men in this country for its defence we must provide them with arms and munitions. I have explained that a vote of &#163;1,074,864 is put down for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, but honorable senators will agree that justice in the matter of expenditure has not been done to this Department during the last few years. Settlement is rapidly expanding, and our Post and Telegraph Department should be right up to date. I can give honorable senators some figures which show the expenditure upon new works out of revenue in recent years. In 1913-14 the expenditure was &#163;2,575,000; in- 1914-15 &#163;2,600,000; in 1915-16, &#163;2,900,000; and in 1916-17, &#163;4,200,000. Then there was a considerable drop in the expenditure due to war conditions, and in 1917-18 the expenditure on new works was only &#163;622,000. In 1918-19 it was &#163;407,000, and in 1919-20 &#163;312,000,. This year it is proposed to spend, as I have said, &#163;3,070,502, Nearly all the new works provided for under this Bill are works which should have been carried out during the last two or three years, but have been delayed because of war conditions&#39;. I hope that honorable senators will, not find anything to which to take exception in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>. - This vote of &#163;2,,000 is an instalment of a total estimated expenditure of &#163;6,000 on temporary additions on the first floor of the north wing of Parliament House. It is intended to provide hat and cloak rooms, lavatories, and four rooms for the accommodation of Ministers. Any one who . knows this building will agree with, me that the accommodation provided is very limited. I do not think that an expenditure of &#163;2,000 a year for three years to improve that accommodation will be regarded as excessive. Honorable senators who desire to do business here know that it is almost impossible to secure a room in which they can have ten minutes&#39; chat with persons whom they desire to see. The accommodation provided for Ministers is such that nine Ministers are accommodated in one room on the House of Representatives side of the building. I do not think that honorable senators will object to reasonable expenditure to enable Ministers to do their work under decent conditions. </para>

                        <para>.- I suppose that we &#39; must not encroach on  what will possibly be a full dress debate on an item to be presented later on concerning the removal of the Seat of Government to another- position. If I might anticipate that consummation, which several honorable senators devoutly wish may be deferred for some  time, I think it would be well if the Government gave further consideration to a report presented to Parliament by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, suggesting the necessity of the Government reconsidering the whole position regarding the housing not only of the Federal Parliament, but of the public servants in  this  State. It was pointed out by that Committee that, in Melbourne to-day, we occupy about forty premises in about fifteen different streets, and are paying about &#163;20,000 a year in rent for public offices. Honorable senators, from their personal experience, will be convinced that the accommodation provided in this building is altogether insufficient. What will become of the small vote set down in the schedule of this Bill I do not know; but if we are going to move to some other place in the near future, this proposed expenditure of &#163;2,000 will go to the landlords of these premises, &#39; without, I suppose, any compensation to the Commonwealth. I know that additional accommodation for Parliament is badly required, and I am, therefore, very reluctant to oppose this vote. </para>

                            <para>- I have a report stating that a contract was entered into with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> Peacock for eight bores to be completed by 1921 for &#163;16,000. Of these one has been bored but not equipped ; the second is partly bored, and no equipment has been provided. The estimated cost of boring the above holes is &#163;4,830 ; purchase of equipment, &#163;5,018; transport, insurance, freight, stevedoring, on equipment, about 60 tons, &#163;3,608; or a total of &#163;13,456. Additional boring and transport of plant is to be provided for, &#163;1,803. The latter item provides for a bore at Wiandangie - Hatches Creek, the track to break up a long stage between Elkedra and Lake Nash station bores. There are several other details of items covering the erection of oil stores, construction of roads, culverts and bridges, the aboriginal station at Daly River, improvements to buildings at Mataranka, and fencing at Oenpelli. </para>

                        <para>. -  I should like to congratulate the Ministry upon the amount provided for water boring in the Northern Territory. My experience is that the only practical work done for the development of that great empty Territory is the provision for water supplies, both for travelling stock and for those who want to prospect for minerals. I should like to know if the contract with S. Peacock specifies if the bores have to be completed ; that is to say, if he is required to go to any stated depth before abandoning operations in any particular place. I do not know whether the Minister can answer my question, but from my point of view it is important to know details of contracts like these. It is important also, to know the situation of the bores, and whether the contractor is boring for artesian or sub-artesian water. I hope they are being put down on the stock routes, because at present cattle cannot be brought to market from vast areas in the Northern Territory simply because, while there is plenty of grass, there is no water on the track. </para>

                        <para>. -  I direct attention to the proposed vote for the Department of Defence. This covers a number of activities. I do not .know that any honorable senator can say that the money is not required. So far as I can see it is ear-marked for reserve munitions, and for the further development of the Commonwealth factories. The proposed expenditure on additional machinery and plant for  the  Woollen Cloth Factory, &#163;38,240, should lead to .a considerable increase in  the  output, and, from discussions we have had previously with regard to this factory, we may assume that that certainly will not be undesirable. I am, however, somewhat hazy as to the item, &#163;287,048, to be paid to the credit of Trust Fund, Small Arms Ammunition Account, for reserve of small arms ammunition. I am hazy, because I notice there is &#34;&#163;266,000 for reserve of rifles. So far as I can see the first-named amount must mean the sum to be expended upon small arms ammunition. </para>

                            <para>- There is also &#163;262,400 towards the supply of heavy guns and reserve of gun ammunition. I do not see how any honorable senator can criticise that item, for it is common knowledge that we cannot make heavy  gun3  in Australia. Neither can we make heavy gun ammunition. I should like some information from the Minister as to &#39;how the money is to be expended. I will not be disappointed if I cannot get it, because in the absence of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> it cannot be expected that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will have all the details at his fingers&#39; ends. Apparently this money will be spent in England for the purchase of heavy guns and ammunition, as they are not made, here yet; but, if I am wrong in my assumption, all the better, because, in spite of all the furbelows, ruffs, and red tabs of the military authorities, I rather incline to the opinion that the real basis of our defence lies in the development of our munition factories, and that money now being spent on defence really amounts to putting the roof on a building before the foundations have been laid. I am glad to see the sum of &#163;6,152 voted for the Acetate of Lime Factory, machinery and plant, also &#163;35,000 for the Small Arms Factory, and a similar amount  for  the Cordite Factory, and Acetate of Lime Factory reserve stores, because we are now making a start to provide ourselves with the full equipment, and munitions  of  war. I do not attach so much importance to the training of men and officers as to the building up of our existing factories for the supply of munitions and other war equipment, without  which  millions of men do not count. I should like information about the supply of these heavy guns and reserve of gun ammunition, and if I am due for a surprise, and if the Minister is going to tell me that the money is to be spent in Australia, I shall hail with much satisfaction the development that has been made in this direction. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRUSSELL. - Partly. The big guns, of course, will be brought from Great Britain, and the present time offers a good opportunity to get cheap guns of the latest type and reserves of big-gun ammunition. It is not a very pleasant subject to discuss, but we all realize that a country without the biggest and most effective guns available would during war be in a very dangerous position. There is little or no big ammunition in Australia, and the process of building up reserves is a costly one, so it must be spread over a number of years. We are providing instalments of ammunition, and, for the purpose of annual training, we are gradually accumulating a sufficient reserve to give us reasonable protection. I remind honorable senators that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> made a full statement recently concerning the Defence policy of the Government, and probably it would repay honorable senators if they re-read that speech. </para>

                        <para>. - I should imagine, now that the war is over, that there is not the same demand for uniforms, and therefore it should not be necessary to provide for additional machinery and plant at the Woollen Cloth Factory. The factory was equal to the demands made upon it during the war period, and it ought now to be able to keep pace with normal requirements. </para>

                            <para>- The contemplated proposal of the Government is to have five divisions of infantry and two divisions of light horse, which is practically what the Australian Imperial Force consisted of on a war basis. If these mills were constructed to produce sufficient clothing to make uniforms for the members of the Australian Imperial Force on active service, where the wear and tear was infinitely greater than it is on home service, the plant should be sufficient to provide for the needs of a peace army. If it is the intention of the Government to issue cloth to civilians it is another matter. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly so. The Government have provided a large amount for heavy artillery, and in this connexion it may be mentioned that a report recently appeared in the newspapers that Great Britain had offered to supply Australia with a number of heavy guns at practically half price. If such is the case, will that mean that a saving will be effected, and that the amount placed on the Estimates will be reduced? </para>

                        <para>. - No. Great Britain was always prepared to make such a concession, and this is no attempt on the part cf the Government to introduce some socialistic scheme for conducting an undertaking of this character. &#34;When the Government make up their minds to do anything in that direction they will take the people into their confidence. This is a proposal to increase the plant to enable us, when normal conditions of training prevail, to supply the whole of the requirements of our Citizen Forces, and we are attempting to meet the difficulties which arose- under war conditions. The material is required, and we desire to make the best use of the plant that is available. Reference has been made to the work which was- done by the Geelong Woollen Cloth Factory, and in fairness it &#39; must be said that, considering the size of the plant, the work performed was wonderful. But it must be remembered that the requirements of the Australian Imperial Force were met by requisitioning the services of the Vickers&#39; Mill, and those at Ballarat and Castlemaine. Although we did very well by collective effort, it cannot be said that the Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong is entitled to all the credit. It is assumed that if the plant is extended in the direction desired, it will be able to supply more cloth to the soldiers; and, personally, I wish we were in a. position to manufacture five or six times the present quantity. Now the war is over and we are not supplying material for men on active service, we hope the plant will be sufficient to meet the full demands of the Military Forces of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> expressing any opposition to a modest expenditure of &#163;38,000 for increasing the machinery at the Federal Woollen Mill, because it has been, clearly shown in this chamber how necessary it is for the Government to expedite the manufacture of these splendid tweeds at a reasonable price to enable returned soldiers to secure suit lengths. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> would have known that the equipment of the mills at present is quite inadequate, and the Minister has shown that during the war period the output was insufficient, as the woollen mills of Australia had to be requisitioned to supply not only the material required for the Cadets and Military Forces generally, but for uniforms for the Postal, Naval, and other Departments. It is a splendidly conducted mill, which ig very well equipped, and I am led&#39; to believe that this modest expenditure on machinery will be the means of doubling the output. The buildings are large and very well designed ; fresh water can be obtained free, or at a low cost, and there is sufficient power available to run a greater number of looms. Personally, I am very surprised at the smallness of the amount, and if the plant is to do the work which I believe &#34;t will, I cannot understand any honorable senator opposing additional expenditure on such a splendid scheme. I do not consider it socialistic in any way. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; but&#39; I would like to point out that the mill has been a splendid undertaking from the outset, and honorable senators can see from a perusal of the balance-sheet of last year that it is not by any means a white elephant. It has done excellent work for Australia, and has shown a net profit of over &#163;22,000. I understand the Government have cabled for extra machinery, and the sooner it is possible for the whole of our Government requirements to be made in Australia the better it will be for the community generally. I wish it were possible to so equip that mill that cloth could be manufactured at a reasonable price, not only for Government Departments, but &#34; for soldiers, sailors, and their dependants, , because the people of Australia are at present paying altogether too high a price either to the manufacturers or to the Flinders-lane magnates. I welcome any so-called socialistic scheme if it is the intention to work along the line adopted by the Federal Woollen Mills. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> observations as being in opposition to this particular item. He is anxious to obtain from the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> some information in regard to additional expenditure, and surely any honorable senator is entitled to ask for an explanation. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> did not desire to oppose the item, the expenditure in connexion with which is in the interests of our returned men. Personally, I welcome the additional outlay, because I recognise the good work that the Commonwealth &#34;Woollen Cloth Factory has done, and especially do I welcome it because it will make provision for avoiding the contingency which occurred at the outbreak of hostilities, when the services of private mills had to be requisitioned. This caused considerable hardship to many people in Australia, who accepted the inconvenience in a cheerful spirit, because they knew that equipment was necessary for the brave men who went to fight for us. If the Commonwealth mills are placed on a satisfactory basis it will mean that should ever the occasion arise for an increased output in the future, the Commonwealth mills will be able to handle the work expeditiously, and that the private mills can continue working on behalf of the civilian population of the Commonwealth. I trust that the additional amount the Government will have at their disposal will enable the factory to manufacture the requisite quantity of </para>

                        <para>. - I rise again because, under the Standing Orders, I am restricted to fifteen minutes in connexion with any observations that I may have to make in committee. It has occurred to me in going through these Estimates, that we are somewhat &#34; topsy turvy&#34; in our methods, as we ought to be discussing the Budget, which is the foundation of all these items. To-day we are considering departmental estimates piece-meal, including a sum of money for manufacturing tweed, another amount for a cordite factory, ,and something else for heavy guns. We are going right through the whole gamut of Commonwealth administration, .and we have not yet discussed the main principles which ought to guide us on these matters. It is not in accordance with what I consider the proper procedure. </para>

                            <para>- I  am quite aware of that, because I know the items in the Budget come down in a number of separate measures. We have one measure relating to expenditure on works and buildings, and later we shall have to discuss Loan Bills, and measures relating to Supply, and this conglomeration makes up the sum total of the Budget. I think the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> ought to give us some opportunity of discussing&#39; national finance, as I am anxious to deal with fundamental principles. At the present juncture I cannot say whether it is a good policy or not to increase the Defence Estimates, for instance, this year by a sum of nearly &#163;1,250,000, as compared with last year, when I am not given the opportunity of reviewing what we intend to spend, and what can be raised. </para>

Take the Murray Waters scheme as an example. We should be occupied six months if we exhaustively debated the question of voting the amount which it is proposed to expend upon that scheme. </para>

There is a good deal yet to be said in regard to the position, not only of the Australian officers of our Navy, but also of the cadets who have graduated from the Naval Training College at Jervis Bay. I have no desire to anticipate discussion upon the Naval Estimates., but I suggest to the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> that he is looking for trouble if he intends to grant priority in the filling of official positions by Royal Naval men. I have previously voiced the unsatisfactory position  - from  the stand-point of the Commonwealth - that is occupied by the naval men  who  have been loaned to it by England. I am hopeful that before this Parliament rises from a long, arduous, but, I trust, practical, session, the Minister will make some pronouncement in connexion with the revolution which is now in progress in our Navy - a pronouncement which will be satisfactory to all who believe that an Australian Fleet should be manned by Australian officers. </para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline>
                            to a regulation under the Quarantine Act which presses harshly upon Inter-State shipping companies. I suppose that every honorable senator has received a memorandum from these companies in regard to this matter - certainly I have had reams of correspondence concerning it. It appears to me that a very genuine case of hardship is involved, and one which may seriously affect Australia should another epidemic of disease of a contagious character break out here. Under our quarantine regulations, shipping companies are responsible for the maintenance, nursing, and medical attention of the whole of the passengers who are quarantined during any such epidemic. That provision is quite all right so far as foreign shipping is concerned, because the shipping company is bound to adopt proper safeguards to avoid bringing to Australia persons who are suffering from contagious diseases. It is absurd, however, to suppose that ships trading from Melbourne to Sydney, Brisbane, or Adelaide, should be held responsible for the maintenance, nursing, and medical attention of passengers who are quarantined for the purpose of protecting one or more States from the danger of infection. According to statements which have been made by some shipping companies, they will be forced out of business should another epidemic occur under similar conditions to those which accompanied the influenza epidemic of last year. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will consult his colleagues in regard to the possibility of making some arrangement under which the Government, jointly with the passengers and. the shipping companies, will bear the cost of quarantine under such circumstances.

                        <para>.- The point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> is a very important one, in view of the fact that the restrictions which are imposed in regard to the quarantining of persons infected by contagious disease are imposed in the interests of the whole community. That is the point which should be stressed, and I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and his colleagues will view the matter from that angle. Seeing that every effort made to prevent the spread of disease in Australia is made in  the interests of the whole community, it  is obviously unfair that one section should be unduly penalized. In such circumstances the community should surely foot the bill. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will consider the necessity which exists for amending the regulations under our Quarantine Act, or that the Government, if they intend to introduce an amending Quarantine Bill this session, will bear in mind the representations which have been made upon this matter when that measure is being drafted. </para>

                        <para>.  - There is just one phase of the question which has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> to which I desire to refer. Under our Quarantine Act, the obligation is thrown upon the ship-owner of bearing the expenditure connected with the quarantining of passengers. Seeing that that expenditure is incurred in the interests of the whole community, the community should foot the bill. But in the early part of last year, when quarantine regulations were operating in respect of traffic between Tasmania and the mainland, the passengers themselves were called upon to pay their quarantine expenses. At that time the Commonwealth possessed exclusive control of shipping. By reason of that circumstance, it evaded the obligations which would have fallen upon the shipping companies, had those companies been carrying on under normal conditions. The Commonwealth Government took advantage of its position, and forced upon the individual passengers an obligation which this Parliament had affirmed should not fall upon them, but upon the shipping companies. &#34; </para>

People who went into quarantine not only lost time, but were subjected to expense to which they would not have been subjected had it not been for the Commonwealth Shipping Control. If the Government thinks that is the proper way to act towards the individual in those instances, because it was then controlling and operating Inter-State shipping, it might surely take some proper view of this matter for shipping companies for the future. </para>

                        <para>- - I draw attention to the item of &#163;200 for the animal quarantine station in Victoria. That is not nearly sufficient to make the necessary improvements in the accommodation in this State. There are at the present time animals worth &#163;2,000 each in the quarantine ground on the Yarra-bank, incurring dangers, and with deaths of frequent occurrence, owing to the inadequate provision made for them. I understand that the animal quarantine grounds actually belong to the State of Victoria, and axe leased or lent to the Commonwealth. I am sorry these items are being rushed through because proper consideration has not been given to the accommodation for valuable imported animals. It is the desire of the Governments and people of the Commonwealth to encourage the importation of high-class stud stock. People who import high-class stud stock to any country axe national benefactors; but at the present time those who import stud stock to Victoria find the accommodation scandalously bad and dangerous. Cattle can rub noses with any diseased beast on adjoining blocks of land, all sorts of diseases are contracted, and the animals die. The only safe way that we can import stud stock into Victoria at present is <inline font-style="italic">viti</inline> New South Wales. The accommodation provided by the Commonwealth Government in Victoria for quarantining animals is an absolute disgrace. I am sorry that a larger amount is not included in these Estimates to improve it. I do not know in what manner I can move to have the amount increased. The Government should have consulted veterinary surgeons and other experts on the subject. If there is any way in which I can do so, I should like to fight for a much greater vote than &#163;200 for this very :necessary purpose. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposed vote is largely for quarantine buildings. It includes &#163;62,000 for alterations and additions and for new buildings and stations. The items are portion of a scheme formulated by the Director of Quarantine to provide increased accommodation at the various quarantine stations for the proper &#39;housing of the staffs, and for other services attending the efficient working of the stations. Past experience has shown that such accommodation is very necessary, so that any epidemic which may arise may be coped with. Owing to the reduced provision last year, particularly for Western Australia, services were postponed, but their early completion is considered essential. There is a vote of &#163;10,545 for completing stables and other works at the Serum Institute in Victoria. We ask for &#163;500 for the erection of a tetanus laboratory, &#163;1,000 for the extension of stables for which a contract was let last year, &#163;2,100 for Director&#39;s quarters, &#163;450 for fencing, &#163;550 for removing caretaker&#39;s quarters, &#163;200 for removing old stables, &#163;1,500 for a new refrigerator, and &#163;500 for sundry other works. I forget the exact system on which we contributed last year in the matter of payments for quarantine, but I know we contributed rather heavily. Originally I think we paid at the rate of 27s. 6d. per week, but eventually we agreed to come in and pay half the expense. In addition, a number of soldiers and others were quarantined, and the cost in those cases became practically the full responsibility of the, Com.monwealth Government. My individual opinion is that the cost of quarantine ought to be borne by the whole community as a form of national insurance. It is all very well to say that the chances are that we will escape, and have no expense; but epidemics happen most unexpectedly. To be quarantined means a good deal of expense, and perhaps debt, to a man who has not much money ; and in these times it may take him a long period to get out of debt. I have a .good deal of sympathy with those who have to be &#39;quarantined , and will undertake to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> the question of whether it is not possible t* charge such expense to the general revenue, so that the whole burden may be borne by the community, thus placing it on the same basis as a shipping or accident insurance policy. Something should be done to relieve people who are suddenly brought under quarantine conditions. I hope to meet with some little success in making representations on these lines to the responsible Minister. </para>

It is very badly wanted. There is an indication in the Works Estimates of a complete alteration of the policy of the Department, that alteration being  in  the direction of realizing  that the services  must be efficient, and that hitherto they have been- starved. </para>

The Minister suggested that there was a tremendous amount of urgent business that the Government wanted  to  get through, yet after a sitting that has lasted only three and a quarter hours he proposes that the Senate should adjourn until 3 o&#39;clock to-morrow. </para>

The business will not run through to-morrow as smoothly as it has done to-day, because honorable senators are coming to the conclusion tha.t it is of no use to try to assist the Government. That, is the conclusion I have come to. Personally,  I  should like the Budget to be considered after the usual suspension of the sitting for dinner.

I  am realizing, that for quite a number of Wednesdays we have adjourned before  half-past 6. Many honorable senators have to come a long way to transact public business, and when they are here they like to get through as much important business as possible. Much of that business might be considered this evening. There are quite a number of important questions coming up for discussion. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> was good enough, at my request, to postpone the consideration of one measure this afternoon. It is an important measure, and I should not have asked for the postponement of its consideration had I not expected that other business would be dealt with this evening. I can see now that I helped to delay the business of the Senate by securing the adjournment of the debate on the Postal Rates Bill. </para>

                            <para>- For the simple reason that if the other business which I anticipated would be considered this evening is not to be dealt with, and the debate on the second reading of the Postal Rates Bill is to be taken tomorrow, we may not consider the other business until next week. I asked questions some time ago concerning the erection of War Service Homes. I did not then secure the information I desired, and, perhaps, the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is in a position to-night to reply to the last set of questions I asked. I was informed that the information I sought was .being obtained. I do not know how long it takes Ministers to get information. I put some questions on the business-paper, which were worded in a perfectly fair manner. I desired to learn how many soldiers&#39; homes were constructed by Kirkpatrick, the architect, and how many by the War Service Homes Commission. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> - I am sorry that he is not present, but we shall have to say a good deal about him when he is not here, and I might as well say something now - in answering my questions, did not give me the information I required. I wish to be in a position to set, side by side, the results obtained in leaving the building of these soldiers&#39; homes to the architect referred to, and those obtained where the erection of these homes was undertaken by the War Service Homes Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should appear to be under some misunderstanding. He put a question to me, desiring to know when an opportunity would&#39; be given for the discussion of the Budget. I told the honorable senator that I would confer with my colleagues and see whether a special day could not be set down for a full and free discussion  of it. In the past, members of the Senate had to put up a fight to secure for this Chamber an. opportunity to fully discuss the Budget. I was a fighter in the brigade that won that opportunity, and I certainly do not propose that the Senate should now abandon the right which we then secured. I am a little sensitive concerning the business of the Senate, as I am alone representing the Government at present in this chamber, and I am anxious not to have to work overtime. I do not make any personal appeal to honorable senators, but, if they desire a full and free discussion of the Budget, I am prepared to go on this evening. Whilst I desire, if possible, to meet any request made to me by an honorable senator, I cannot take the request of a single member of the Senate as indicative of the feelings of honorable senators generally. I am doubtful whether we should be able to secure a quorum after dinner if honorable senators are. given to understand that the only matter to be discussed will be the Budget, and that the debate upon it is not likely to be concluded. I am, however, entirely in the hands of honorable senators. If they express a general desire I am prepared to continue after dinner, but I shall not withdraw the motion at this stage unless there is an expression of such a desire by honorable senators generally. </para>
