                            <para>- It is not my intention, in moving this motion, to say anything as to the' circumstances which prevented its consideration at an earlier meeting of this Chamber; hut I think it only right to mention that, in my judgment, those circumstances were entirely beyond the control of the Senate. This is not the time, nor is it the occasion, to deal with them, but for the fair name of the Senate it should be stated that it was not due either to reluctance or to hesitation on the part of honorable senators that the motion was not adopted at an ordinary sitting of the Chamber last week. The motion that I propose is :  - </para>

                    <para>We recall with pride the latest visit to Australia of His Majesty the King before his accession to the Throne, when he was graciously pleased to open in person the inaugural session of the Australian Parliament. </para>

                    <para>We congratulate Your Royal Highness upon the spirit you displayed in the great war now happily ended, and we feel that we may indulge a becoming pride in the thought that the high sense of duty and responsibility by which Your Royal Highness was animated was shared to the full by Australia's sons and daughters, who by their valour and their sacrifices contributed a worthy part to the ultimate triumph of those principles which are the glory and the pride of the British name. </para>
                    <para>Your progress throughout the Commonwealth will afford Your Royal Highness an opportunity of observing the energy, enterprise, and character of our people in the pursuit of the arts of peace. </para>
                    <para>We earnestly trust that your visit to our shores may be fraught with happiness and pleasure to Your Royal Highness, and that your mission to our people may be blessed with an abundant measure of success to the present and enduring advantage of Australia and the Empire. </para>

                <para>HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS was pleased to make the following reply: - Mr.'  President  and Gentlemen of the Senate, - I am deeply touched by your address. It means a great deal to me to be thus warmly welcomed by you, the representatives of all the States which form this splendid Commonwealth, and I shall be proud to convey your assurances of devotion to Throne and Empire to my father the King.  His  Majesty preserves the happiest memories of the day when he inaugurated the Australian Parliament, and no one has appreciated more whole-heartedly than he the gallant service rendered by the men and women of Australia during the great war. </para>
                <para>I thank you, also,  most sincerely for your more than generous references to my own modest service at the front. As a' junior officer, I had no important duties to perform; but I shall never cease to value the opportunity which I then was given of learning to know my brother officers and men from all parts of the Empire as comrades in arms. Through that comradeship I learned to know and appreciate the spirit of the Australian nation, and I am delighted now that I am about to see the men and women of Australia in their own land. </para>
                <para>I greatly appreciate your good wishes, and I reciprocate them from the bottom of my heart. </para>
