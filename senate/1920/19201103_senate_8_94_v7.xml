                        <para>- I have submitted this motion in order that a question which is of vital importance to the good name of Australia may be discussed, and, if possible, some effort made towards the maintenance of that good name, assuming that the statements which I am about to read should prove to be true. Those statements are contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian and Mining Standard</inline> of Tuesday, 28th October last. Before indulging in any comment, I propose to read a few extracts from two articles appearing in that publication, which will, I think, impress honorable senators with the necessity for taking some action in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>The facts and statistics which we publish in another column indicate that the annual toll exacted by the water-front thieves exceeds £500,000. But this estimate is evidently far under the mark, for it takes no account of the immense number of petty pilferings which, although vast in aggregate bulk, are considered individually too small to warrant special claims on the shipping and insurance companies, and are suffered by the victims in silence. Were a strict census to be made of these larcenies, the yearly pillage would probably be found to amount to substantially upwards of £1,000,000. </para>

                    <para>If our water fronts are to be made the happy hunting grounds of gangs of the worst type of criminals, and if to clear our ships we must employ such creatures, then, indeed, it is time we considered whether a White Australia is worth while. We pride ourselves in the knowledge that Australia is white- skin deep - but a black soul is infinitely worse than a black skin. We challenge the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to deny that it has in its membership lists men who, combined, comprise a gang of the worst type of thief. The Waterside Workers Federation, as far as we are able to ascertain, has taken no steps whatever to cull out the criminal from ite ranks. Conviction for pilfering is no bar to membership of this organization. A member caught red-handed taking that which is not his is regarded as unlucky - " stiff " as the " wharfies " term it: After being fined, or after serving a short term of imprisonment, he returns to the wharf, is "picked up," and those who own the ships and the cargo the ships carry, dare not point the finger at him. If this convicted thief is refused work, the charge of victimization is hurled at the employer. Such is the condition of labour on the water front. </para>

                        <para>- The article says: - " The following claims in respect of missing goods are made on the company." I am not sure about it, but the article would lead one to believe that those were. claims on one company only, because the aggregate amount for the year's operations is £500,000, and the writer is of opinion that the total would be nearer £1,000,000 if the whole of the losses were taken into consideration. This statement is one of the most serious stigmas ever cast, not only on the men actually working on the water front, but on the good name of Australia. It behoves every one of us, whether we are private citizens, or members of the "Waterside Workers' Federation, or members of the Federal Parliament, to do our utmost to ascertain whether these things are actually true, and, if true, remedied, or, if untrue, then thoroughly and effectively contradicted. If the statements are true, the newspaper deserves the very greatest credit for having exposed what is going on in this fearless manner. If they are untrue, then it is the duty of those interested in the welfare of Australia to see that the lie is, metaphorically speaking, rammed down the throat of the paper. I hold that there are three parties who ought to be active in the investigation of this wrong, and in either its eradication or the exoneration of those who are now under suspicion. </para>

                <para>There are other phases of this question which are also interesting to a very large number of the people of the Australian States. A good number, who claim to be losers by this system of wholesale robbery, make no " bones " about inferring that the police are in collusion with the thieves on the waterside front. They say that pianos, and cases of boots, could not be removed surreptitiously and unknown to the police. This is a thing which affects the honour of the police <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> the different States as well as the waterside workers themselves. There is in th# minds of a large number of people  very  grave suspicion that a serious combination is operating in Australia, and extending beyond Australia, for the robbery of the people at the different ports. As an indication of that sort of thing, it is stated in the article that boots were favorite objects for pillage, and an exporter, in order to protect himself, shipped boots in sections - the left boots in one ship, and the right boots in another. According to the article, the cases arrived; but when they were assembled, two cases of left boots were missing from one ship, and two of right boots from the other. This clearly indicates that a world-wide organization is at work. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently. If that statement is true, the thieving is not going on solely at our ports, and a combination of very much greater magnitude must exist. It behoves us, therefore, to take steps to ascertain the truth of these assertions. If they are true, it is our duty to eradicate the evil, no matter what it costs. If they are false, it is our duty to exonerate those who are now accused. During the last five years Australia became better known throughout the world than it has been for generations past, in consequence of the work done by our boys at the war. They built up a great name for Australia, and it is our duty to do our utmost to retain it, and to resent a statement which brands us as a combination of thieves. If we do not resist the thefts, we must take the responsibility of being charged with them. I say that also candidly to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation. I know some members of that body in my own State, and am absolutely confident that individually they are honorable men; but I tell them that if they do not become active in resisting this system, or proving that it does not exist, then they become corrupt, although they may not be corrupt as individuals. They must take the responsibility of having associated themselves with those who are corrupt, unless they make an effort to purge their organization of that class of man. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but we do not know to what extent the offenders have been punished. We want to know whether the organization does not value its good name, and whether it is prepared to co-operate with the Federal and State Governments in order to clear itself. If it will not its member? must be regarded as guilty by condoning the action of those with whom they are associated. There are many kinds of dishonest people, the actions of whom are brought under our notice from time to time. There are some who endeavour to defraud the public by selling goods not true to name, and I hold that a man who will sell footwear, consisting of wood, paper, and leather as a leather article is as great a thief as the one who deliberately steals boots from a case. It is quite possible, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> Storrie Guthrie, that some of the pillaging is done before the cargoes arrive here. </para>

I have moved the motion in the hope that this matter will be taken up in other quarters, and that an agitation will be set on foot which will either prove the innocence or guilt of the men.

                        <para>- Then it cannot be very rigid. It is difficult to understand how a strong box could be opened, or how a piano or cases of goods could be removed from the wharfs unknown to the police. I can only suggest that an effort' be made to arouse public opinion, and that something be done to more effectively organize police supervision on the wharfs. It is certainly the duty of the State Governments to make a stronger effort to prevent the wholesale thieving which is going on at present. </para>

                    <para>.- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has done right in directing the attention of the Senate and of the people generally to this alarming statement, because it is alarming if goods to the value of  £500,000  are illicitly disappearing from the wharfs in different parts of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has said that the circumstances set out in the article constitute a stigma upon the good name of Australia, and especially upon that section of Australian labour charged with the crime. I do not quite follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> when he says that there are three parties directly concerned - namely, the Federal Government, the State Government, and the waterside workers' organization. It seems to me quite clear that if the charges are true they constitute a challenge to the police control provided by the. States, and amount to a charge of ineptitude on the part of the police. It is clearly the duty of the State police to safeguard property and life, irrespective of whether the property happens to be on ships or on wharfs, and in that regard the good name of Australia is in the hands of the State Governments. The fact that we have a Federal Government  doe3  not give us more authority to guard the good name of Australia than is contained in our Constitution, and the work is clearly that of the States. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has been forced to that conclusion, and in the article he quoted there was a suggestion that in many instances pilfering could not have been carried out except by collusion with the police. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> seemed to think that because the Commonwealth took a certain degree of control through the Customs Department,^that fact, in some way or other, made the Commonwealth the guardian of property which was the subject of Customs duty. Such is not the case.. Customs control is for a definite purpose, namely, the collection of revenue. The Customs Department is not concerned to know whether an article under its control reaches its proper owner, but that it does not escape taxation. To that extent only is the Commonwealth, by its Customs control, concerned in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I shall take steps to bring his suggestion under the notice of the Government; but it appears strange, if the offence is as serious as is represented by the article, that the commercial community, with its well-known influence, has not been able to secure some inquiry by the State Governments. I have not noted any very energetic representations in that regard. Perhaps the commercial community fears reprisals of the nature indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline></para>

When the Treaty of Peace Bill was passed, provision was not made extending it to the Territories of ' the Commonwealth, and it is necessary now that this should be expressly provided for, hence the introduction of this measure, which provides that the Treaty of Peace Act 1919 shall apply to the Territories under the control of the Commonwealth, including any Territory governed by the Commonwealth under a mandate.

                    <para class="block">The measure is of special interest to me, because on the 10th September,. 1919,. I had the honour of representing the Commonwealth at the signing of the Treaty of Peace with . Austria at Saint Germain-En-Laye, in France. It was a most interesting ceremony, and one that I shall always remember, but it was of less significance to Australia than the signing of the Peace Treaty with Germany. Nevertheless, it is necessary that Australia, as one of the parties to the Treaty, should now ratify it. On the 27th November, 1919, the High Commissioner, as representing Australia, signed the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria. Copies of these Treaties have been before honorable senators for some time, and I take it that they have had an opportunity of perusing them. It is now proposed, by this Bill, to make the necessary provision to carry into effect the terms of the Peace Treaty, by empowering the Governor-General to make regulations and to do such other things as may appear to be necessary. Power is also given in the Bill to impose penalties for breaches of these regulations. The omission in the German Peace Treaty Act has been overcome in this Bill, which provides that the measure shall extend to the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth, including those over which we have a mandate. </para>

                    <para>That the Senate do now adjourn, it would, perhaps, be just as well if I gave some indication of the business the Senate will be called upon to consider. The Bills which I have submitted this afternoon are very largely technical in character, and will be proceeded with. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, will move the second reading of the Customs Bill, which will be circulated now that it has been read a first time. I hope, also, to. have the draft of the Air Navigation Bill, and to move the first and possibly the second readings to-morrow. I understand that this will about exhaust the business available to the Senate, owing to the fact that another place is not dealing with measures quite as quickly as we do. A number of honorable senators will be absent next week, and in order that honorable </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to the position with regard to the war gratuity bonds, which is causing a certain amount of dissatisfaction to a number of returned soldiers in my State, and, I doubt not, in other States as well. Honorable senators will remember that when the regulations dealing with the issue of war bonds were framed provision was made for the payment of cash in  certain  circumstances. In a number of cases soldiers who were not anxious at the time for cash, applied for bonds, feeling that they would be a better investment. Since then, owing to altered financial circumstances, they are now in need of cash, but unfortunately are precluded from obtaining it in return for their bonds, although, 1 understand, they came under the regulations entitling them originally to payment in cash. One very sad case hae come under my notice, and I have communicated with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> but  not  having that gentleman's permission I cannot quote it as an individual case. It appears to me to be rather unfair that, because a man did not originally ask for cash, although he was entitled to it, but decided, in the interests  of  his country to apply for bonds, he should now be unable to draw cash. I ask the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of the. Treasurer, to see what can be done. </para>

I will put the matter as it has been represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> to the Treasurer. It seems to me, however, that it is a question of the submission of individual cases to the Treasurer rather than one of asking him to lay down a general rule such as that to which I have referred. I will obtain a reply from the Treasurer, which I will forward to the honorable senator. </para>
