            <para>. - In beginning the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I am rather sorry to have to strike perhaps a jarring note; hut, as the measure involves an addition of nearly &#163;1,000,000 to the taxation of this country, I feel that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> in moving the second reading of the measure, might well have made a more lengthy and less perfunctory statement concerning it. He practically asked that we should pass this Bill, definitely increasing the postage on ordinary letters from1d. to 2d., because, as I understood him, the price of galvanized iron has gone up a little. </para>

              <para>- I understood the Minister to say that galvanized iron, wire, and one or two other things have gone up a little in price, and, consequently, it is necessary that we should do away with penny postage, and substitute for it a twopenny rate. I rather think that the time has gone by for a discussion on the advantage of penny postage. There have been discussions in times past, not only in this country, but in many other countries, as to the advantage or disadvantage of penny postage, hut I think that the battle has been definitely won for penny postage. It is admittedly of great benefit to the people, and, in my opinion, no substantial argument can be urged against it. I am aware that some persons argue that it does not pay. Some years ago, when this question was being discussed, the argument was advanced that if we substituted penny postage for the twopenny rate- then in force, the alteration would involve a tremendous loss of revenue. It was natural to assume that in the first twelve months after the introduction of penny postage some. loss of revenue would be sustained; but the statistics of all countries go to show how very soon the adoption of penny -postage has paid for itself. In 1899-1900, the last year of twopenny postage in Victoria, Victoria showed a total revenue from that source of &#163;425,000. One penny postage was then adopted, and ten years afterwards - that is, in 1909-10 - the receipts from that source were &#163;561,000. </para>

Still the figures&#39; show that penny postage brought in not only all that was being earned by twopenny postage, but a certain amount extra. </para>

I had the pleasure of introducing penny postage in the other House, and I was looking over, a few minutes ago, the remarks I made on that occasion.

          <para>We <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Australia went in for penny postage in 1911-12. Some people predicted a large loss; but the figures are rather interesting. Through the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Triggs</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane,</inline> in 1911-12, we are in a position to know exactly whether the Postal Branch, the Telephone Branch, or the Telegraph </para>
          <para class="block">Branch pays. Previous to their appointment, and the adoption of the new system of accounts, we found great difficulty in ascertaining whether the branches were showing a profit or a loss. The first year of the complete operation of penny postage was 1912-13, when the Postal Branch showed a credit balance of &#163;23,132. It is very fine to know that, so far as Australia is concerned, the letter-carrying branch of the Department paid under1d. postage in the first year of its operation. In that year the whole Department went behind to the extent of &#163;407,000 ; but that was because the Telegraph Branch lost &#163;164,000, and the Telephone Branch &#163;221,000. There was a loss in that year on penny postage in South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia, and, I think, Tasmania; but there was a profit of from &#163;20,000 to &#163;30,000 in <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales, and in Victoria of over &#163;100,000, with the result that, taking Australia as a whole, penny postage paid in that year. In 1913-14 the profit on penny postage was again &#163;24,000; but the loss on the telegraphs and telephones were still very heavy, and the completeloss on the whole Department was about &#163;500,000. In 1914- 15, when the war started, the conditions were very different, and the Postal Branch showed a loss of &#163;71,000. In 1915- 16 there was, however, a profit of &#163;42,000. In 1916-17 there was a very large loss of &#163;168,000 ; but the then PostmasterGeneral, in his report, showed that the reasons were the payment of an extra sum to the United Kingdom for heavy adjustments, and the payment of a good deal of extra money to the railways. In the next year, 1917-1S, the Postal Branch made a profit of &#163;237,000, which the then Postmaster-General explained by showing that the Department paid in the previous year to the railways more than it ought to have paid, and by an adjustment had to pay that year a great deal less.. It would be right and fair., therefore, to put the two years, 1916-17 and 1917-1S, together. Even then, the Postal Branch would come out about &#163;70,000 to the good. The profit in 1918-19 on penny postage was &#163;239,000, and with telegraph and telephone services the full profit was &#163;524,000.I <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> not think we have the figures yet for 1920. </para>

              <para>- During .the last two years a good profit has been .made on penny postage, and, in addition, the halfpenny increase, imposed as a wartime tax., resulted last year in an amount of no less than &#163;.750,000 being handed over to the Treasury. </para>

          <para>There is &#39;another matter which I think should be emphasized, and which I raised &#60;on more tha-n one occasion in. the House of Representatives, namely, the subsidy of &#163;170,000 per year paid to the Orient Steamship Company for the maintenance of the mail service between Australia and Great Britain. It is very unfair that the whole of this amount should be charged up against the Postal Department of .the &#39;Commonwealth, because, under the terms of the contract, the Orient Company have to give other services, such as the maintenance of refrigerating chambers, and they have to ,go on to Sydney, whereas for the mail: service alone they need not now come past Fremantle. Some other Department, probably Customs, ought to pay a portion of this subsidy. I .am &#39;also strongly opposed to the practice of making the Postal Department &#39;a &#39;tax-collector. The people must expect to pay for all services rendered; and, .1 think, now that we are not under war  conditions,  it is unfair to use the Post Office as .a tax-gathering institution. </para>
          <para>I have shown that during the last year or two the operations of the Postal Department have been &#39;successful. I am prepared to admit that the , profits in 1917-18 and 1919 were not quite legitimate, because in the Telephone Branch especially the Postmaster-General was unable to obtain the material necessary for the development and extension of service. It is only fair, therefore, that w.e should take these facts into consideration. I differ from my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in regard to the complaint that the ex-Postmaster-General was unable to get from the Treasury the money required for the development of departmental services. Whilst the war. was on, everything was in the melting-pot, and the Postal Department had to be starved in order that there might be ample money for the prosecution of the war. I would raise no particular objection if, during war time, <inline font-style="italic">ihe</inline> activities of the Department were not extended as in normal -times, because during that period matters of greater importance had to take precedence. Although some of the profit may not  be  regarded .as quite legitimate, in view of -the fact that part of the services have been starved, owing, as I have shown, to war conditions, still the Post Office has paid without the services being unduly cut down&#39; or the efficiency of the Department impaired. I recognise, of course, that one of the most difficult problems is the country mail services, in connexion with which the ex-Postmaster-General was bitterly, -assailed, chiefly by country members, because he was obliged to cut down some of the country mail! contracts. But there ace two sides to this question. We .are all anxious that the country should be opened .up by the establishment of mail facilities, but, unfortunately, during all drought .periods the Postmaster-General finds it extremely difficult to get men to carry . on the services, and has to pay a good -deal more for the handling of less mail matter.- Taking all these facts into consideration, -&#39;and in spite of the difficulties in  regard to  the country mail services to which I have referred, .the penny postage throughout Australia has been profitable. That being so, it seems unwise now to .abandon it, because I am .afraid that if we adopt the twopenny postage rate we shall have it for a good, many years, probably for the lifetime of some of us. I understood the Vice-President of&#39; the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to state, during his second-reading speech, that the Government hoped to raise an additional &#163;1,000,000 by the increased rates. It is rather unfortunate that we should be asked to discuss the second reading of this or any other Bill before we have had an opportunity of perusing the Minister&#39;s .second-reading speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hamsard..</inline></para>

              <para>- That is worse than I anticipated. If we allow &#163;250,000 for the extra charge of 3d. on telegrams, and another&#39; &#163;250,000- for the increased telephone&#39; rates, it is- fair to- assume that approximately &#163;1,000,000 will be raised by the Postal. Branch. </para>

              <para>-I admit that arrears have to be made up, but the Department cannot spend more than a certain amount- in any one year. The PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> stated that the Government were prepared to spend an additional <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500,000</inline> oil  equipment to overtake arrears of work which have accumulated during the war period. One honorable senator in this chamber complained that that amount waa insufficient; but I am prepared to definitely state that that is all the Department can spend in the time. The profit of the Department for the year 191S-19 was &#163;52.4,000-,. but that is an artificial profit, as &#163;250,000 ought to have been spent on works. If we make a profit of &#163;524,000 on the present rates - even if we should spend &#163;500,000 next year to catch up arrears - we- would still be able to balance our ledger. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps not; but I presume that certain, economies are to be effected. The Postal Department has been somewhat conservative in some&#39; directions) particularly in the use of motor cars; as, in many instances- &#39;these could have been used instead of horse-drawn vehicles in connexion with some of our mail services&#39;. We are informed that Great Britain,New Zealand and Canada have reverted to two-penny postage; but that is no reason why we should adopt a similar policy. In Great Britain the Postal Department has for some years been revenue producing, and it. is now the intention to hand over &#163;11,000,000 after meeting, the cost of administration. If. the British. Postal Department is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> become a tax. collector, that is no reason why the Government should attempt to utilize, the Postal Department of the Commonwealth for a similar purpose. A reasonable rate of postage assists commercial and social life, and by increasing the rate we are handicapping people to an unreasonable extent. It has been said by some that additional postage does, not affect the poor, but only those more favorably situated. </para>

          <para>I come now to the telephone rates: These, I understand, are to be raised a farthing per call in respect of all telephones connected with exchanges which possess more than 600 subscribers. We have- been told that this represents a great concession to country residents. The Government affirm that they do not wish to penalize people who live in rural areas more than is absolutely necessary, and therefore they intend exempting them from the payment of the extra farthing which is to be charged upon all originating  telephone calls. But they stipulate that this concession can be made only in the case of exchanges which possess more than 600 subscribers. Only last Monday and Tuesday I was in the Blue Mountains, New South &#34;Wales. It is a delightful spot where one can live under almost ideal conditions. At Katoomba, where there is a telephone exchange with less than 600 subscribers, one can get into communication with quite a number of adjacent places, including Wentworth Falls and Medlow. Now, the majority of the tourists who visit those centres are fairly well-to-do. Yet they are not to be charged the farthing extra upon the telephone calls which they make. I can go to the Golf Club at Wentworth Falls - a nice residential club - and there I can get into communication with Melbourne or Sydney. But, under this Bill, I shall not be called upon to pay an additional farthing &#34;per ring, because there are not 600 subscribers connected with the exchange there. Surely that is something in the nature of an anomaly!1 Under this measure the pioneer, who goes into the backblocks of Australia to blaze a track, will be required to pay 2d. postage upon each letter that he writes. It would be far better to allow his letters to be carried for Id. each, and to require him to pay the extra <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> upon his telephone calls. After all, the moment one can use a telephone he is in touch with civilization. It is not the cost of the calls which prevents country settlers from having the telephone -connected with their farms - it is the expenditure upon the poles. </para>

              <para>- The extra charge of a farthing per call will produce very little revenue. It would be far better to permit people to have their letters carTied for Id. instead of charging them 2d. postage upon them, than to abandon the proposed extra farthing upon their telephone calls. At this juncture I may perhaps be pardoned for reading a brief extract from a speech made upon this question by the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> a few years ago. </para>

              <para>- I quite admit that. I do not object very much to the imposition of the proposed additional farthing per call, and I am glad to know that the telephone rates at present are sufficient to enable that branch of the Postal Department to pay its way. I have always argued that it should be so. I am prepared to allow every person who uses the telephone - even those connected with exchanges having less than 600 subscribers - to contribute the additional farthing per call which is now proposed, so long as we have penny postage throughout the Commonwealth. The adoption of the latter system would create more satisfaction than will the present proposals of the Government. </para>

          <para> Coming to the telegraph rates, I see very little objection to the Government increasing them. Hitherto, we have had wonderfully cheap telegrams throughout Australia.. But, instead of an additional 3d. upon 6d., 9d. and ls. telegrams, I would have preferred a charge of ls. all round. People in our cities would then have been required to pay ls. for telegrams instead of 6d., those within a State would have been obliged to pay ls. per telegram instead of 9d. , and Inter-State messages would have had to pay ls. instead of ls. 3d. This flat rate would slightly penalize the residents of our cities, but it would greatly benefit country residents. To my mind it would be a better system. The anomalies which are so apparent in the Department today would not be so great if a flat rate were charged upon all telegrams. At the present time a person who is resident on the border of New South Wales can send a telegram from Lismore to Broken Hill for 9cL, but as soon as the rate proposed to be charged under this Bill becomes operative, he will be required to pay ls. But if a man sends a telegram from Albury to Wodonga, he has to pay ls., instead of 9d. That is one of the anomalies arising under &#39;the existing system which is brought under the notice particularly of persons residing near the border of a State. I would have preferred a flat rate of ls. all round. Although this would be to the disadvantage of those living in cities, it would benefit the residents of the country districts. I am most strongly opposed to the proposal to re-introduce two penny postage, and I shall be very glad if I can receive support from&#39; honorable senators in an effort, when we get into Committee, to reduce the proposed two- penny rate to one penny. </para>

            <para>.- I regard the introduction of this Bill as the inevitable. In common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I should prefer the cheapest possible postage rate for the conveyance of the people&#39;s correspondence. We have, however, to consider that since penny postage was introduced the cost of all materials required by the Post and Telegraph Department has been increased by several hundred per cent. We have to bear in mind, also, that the employees of the Commonwealth have had their wages considerably increased, and we have to face further increases in the remuneration paid to some persons that are already overdue. In view of these facts, it is clear that we must pay more for our postage. After all, the service is very cheap. When we come to realize that two persons, one living in Tasmania and the other at Port Darwin, by using the lightest class of stationery, may carry on a considerable correspondence for the sum of 4d., it must be admitted that the cost of the service rendered by the Post Office is very reasonable. We have &#34;post offices established in convenient situations, and we can write voluminous letters, which are promptly . delivered to our correspondents; and it must be admitted that, to have our letters transmitted to any part of Australia for a charge of 2d., is a very reasonable service indeed. </para>

          <para>What I &#39;am chiefly concerned about&#39; is whether the calculations of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> as tothe increased revenue to be derived from the higher rates proposed have been based on the business* done by the Department in pre-war days. If they are, the right honorable gentleman may find that he will not realize the &#163;792,000 which he anticipates from the postal rates proposed. There can be no doubt that large numbers of people will be reluctant to write as many letters when the postage rate is 2d. as they wrote when, the postage rate was1d.. There will, in all probability,, be a diminution in, the volume of business done by the Postal Department which may involve a material reduction in the anticipated revenue. The Treasurer estimates that he will receive from the increased postage rates additional revenue to the extent of &#163;7.92,000, and from the increased postal and telegraph rates combined, additional revenue to the extent of &#163;1,233,000. I do not suppose that the increased rates to be charged on telegrams will make a very great difference in the number of telegraphic messages despatched&#39;, but I have very little doubt that with, the increased postage rates proposed there will be a considerable decrease in the number of letters posted. So the question tha&#39;t exercises my mind is whether the increased revenue anticipated by the Treasurer will be realized. </para>
          <para>I am particularly interested in the postal facilities given to the people in the country districts. One thing which should&#39; concern legislators in Australia is the&#39; necessity for- making country life&#39; more attractive than it has been in the past, and one way in which this can be done is by establishing an extensive and convenient post and telegraph service. The postage of books- to the country- is- a matter of considerable importance- to&#60; country people-, and we should give it serious consideration. Where it is possible to differentiate between the service rendered to city people and that rendered to country people, we should differentiate in favour of country people. </para>
          <para>There is one other- matter which I wish to bring under the notice of honorable senators and the Government; and for which I ask their favorable consideration. I- refer to the correspondence of friendly societies. They have to send out very large numbers of circulars every quarter, and the war tax on their correspondence was a very severe handicap to them. When we come to consider the value of friendly societies to the nation we should make some special effort to give them special consideration. </para>

            <para>- I appeal to honorable senators to give special consideration, to the friendly societies of Australia by allowing their correspondence to be carried at the penny rate. The figures showing the work . being accomplished by, and the importance of, the friendly societies, . as . furnished by <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> for the year 1917, are interesting. There were in Australia in that year 5,018 lodges, with a benefit membership of 478,535. The number of members receiving sick pay, excluding New South Wales, for which the Statist apparently has no figures, was 49,947, while funeral allowances numbering 6,026 were made to the widows of deceased members. The amount of sick pay was &#163;490,743, while the lodges expended &#163;479,844 on medical attendance to members. </para>

              <para>- I believe that is so. No more deserving case for special consideration in the interests of Australia can be shown than that for carrying the official letters of the friendly societies at half rates. I shall move in Committee to . amend the schedule to provide that letters from any registered friendly benefit society, bearing the official1 stamp -of the society, shall be carried for one penny. I hope the Government will agree to the amendment, and that the Senate will unanimously assist these bodies.- I know of no way in which the Government can better increase the social good order of the people than by encouraging that self-help and social cooperation among the people which is so manifest in the working of the friendly societies. </para>

              <para>- I have&#39; not paid the charge in my own lodge. If it is imposed, it is an additional charge on the member himself. Probably the societies have been forced into that position owing to the . considerable -losses they have sustained through the late war, which hit them very severely. Although the additional postage may seem small, it has been a considerable handicap upon their operations. A lodge with a thousand members has to send out notices every, quarter, besides summonses to special meetings. </para>

              <para>- That is &#39;only a penalty on members for neglecting to pay their contributions. The quarterly notices are for the most part formal, printed matter; but they contain a few written words in addition, and that fact compels the lodge to &#39;.pay the ordinary postage, which is decidedly unfair, apart from the fact that the lodges ought to have special . consideration. The one object I have is to obtain special consideration for the friendly societies. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that tha Post and Telegraph Department ought not to be a revenue-collecting institution, and that whatever surplus is obtained should be expended, as I believe is the policy of the present Government, in giving better facilities, particularly to- the country -districts. I shall always be glad to see that policy put . into very practical operation. I hope that before the Bill reaches Committee honorable &#39;senators will give consideration to the justice of. the amendment I have suggested, and; that I shall receive their whole-hearted support. </para>

            <para>.- I have been looking into the Treasurer&#39;s Budget statement with regard to the proposal to increase the postage rates to the people of Australia. The following paragraph reads extraordinarily as a justification of the proposed increase : - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The necessity for raising extra revenue suggests a review of the charges made for services rendered to the public, particularly by the Post Office Department, and new rates are proposed which have a better relation to the increased cost of supplying those services. Increased charges for these public utilities are general, and even world-wide. Railway, freights, for instance, have increased considerably, amounting to over 50 per cent, in some cases. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The comparison of the -operations of the various Railway Departments of Australia with those of the Commonwealth </para>
          <para class="block">Post and Telegraph Department is entirely misleading, because every State has found it absolutely essential during the past few years to increase freights and fares in order to meet the extra expenditure incurred by its Railway Department, but that is not the case with the Postal Department of the Commonwealth, which has been an exceptionally good paying proposition during the last couple of years. Consequently, the comparison made by the Treasurer is apt to be misleading, inasmuch as it conveys to the ordinary reader the impression that the Post and Telegraph Department has been run at a loss, because every one knows that the various Railway Departments have been compelled for their own preservation to increase fares and freights in order to make ends meet. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline>gave some interesting figures as to the revenue of the Post Office during recent years. The total net profit on the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services for the year 1918 reached the large amount of &#163;387,382, while for the year 1919-20 it is estimated that &#163;23S,000 profit will be made out of the Postal Department alone. Consequently, honorable senators are justified in dismissing altogether from their minds the idea that the proposed increases are essential in order that the Department may be made to pay. </para>

Iu addition to a net profit of &#163;23S,000 on the postal services of Australia, the large sum of &#163;745,962 was paid to the Treasury as a war tax on postage stamps. As a commercial concern, therefore, the Post and Telegraph Department has established a magnificent record. If we accept that statement as being reasonably accurate, it is essential for us to try to ascertain what has actuated the Government in proposing to impose this additional burden upon the whole community. </para>

          <para>I may be pardoned for referring to the fact that on one page of the Treasurer&#39;s statement we find a proposal to relieve a certain section of the people of a very large amount of taxation in the form of the entertainments tax. On the other hand, for a service which is of general utility in. the development of Australia, we are faced with a proposal to impose a very heavy additional burden upon the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. It is just as well to make these comparisons, because, after all, if the Commonwealth finds it needs additional revenue - and there is not the slightest doubt that it does - surely the time is not opportune for the removal of a species of taxation which has been very productive of revenue, and has not been at all a burden upon the people who have paid it. I emphasize the fact that it is proposed on the one hand to- relieve one section of the community of some of the taxation imposed either during war time or just prior to the war, and on the other hand to place a heavy additional burden upon the whole community for a service which plays a very important part in the development of the resources of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I have been forced to the conclusion that the only reason for the introduction of this additional taxation is to raise additional revenue. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> stated that the additional cost of material, quoting particularly galvanized iron wire, must of necessity involve the raising of additional revenue by some means or other. I am not satisfied that there is any justification for the proposed increase in the postage rates, on a statement that material to-day is costing more than in prewar times. The figures quoted with regard to the revenue of the Post Office refer to the working results during the war period, when the cost of material was very much heavier than previously. </para>

          <para>It has been suggested by one honorable senator that the Telephone and Telegraph Branches can well do with the extra revenue, and that the users will not mind the additional charges.; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has protested strongly against any interference with the penny postage. When penny postage Avas introduced in Australia it was watched very closely indeed by those interested in the welfare of the Commonwealth, because it was looked upon as an innovation, and although it had been tried with success in the Mother Country, it was anticipated by a great many that it would not be so successful in a sparsely-populated country like Australia. We all know now that  the predictions of failure were not justified, and that in the course of a few years it was demonstrated that penny postage was a commercial success. </para>

              <para>- I have not seen any proposal to give out-back settlers improved facilities without a guarantee that the Department shall be protected against loss. In the policy speech attention is drawn to the fact that it is essential in the interests of the Commonwealth that there shall be a fuller development of our rural resources by the settlement of a large population on our waste lands. If the Treasurer receives the additional revenue that is anticipated from an increase in the post and telegraph rates, surely it is reasonable to suggest that improved services shall be given to country areas. I know of many settlers who have been denied these facilities, and I have in mind one man who came from Victoria, and settled in the northern district of Tasmania 25 miles back from the coast line. He has been there for twelve years, has reared a family, and at present his district has no postal or telephonic facilities whatever. A few years ago a telephone was installed there, but when it was found that the revenue was not sufficient it was discontinued. My point is, that if the Department can show a profit - and during the last two years it has shown a substantial profit - on the present rate of postage, the profit will be greater as a result of the increased rates to be charged, and portion of this  profit,  at all events, should be devoted, to the extension of postal, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities to those settlers who, we profess to believe, are the saviours of the Commonwealth - the men who will go into the out-back country, face all the  hardships  to be encountered there, and make homes for themselves. They should have every reasonable protection for their  wives and children, and this can only be secured to them by providing them with the facilities referred to. </para>

I am not sure that we can ou the figures at our disposal, and that is why I commented on the proposal to remit the entertainments tax. </para>

I do not see why the Treasurer should not be able to obtain, from some other source, the amount of revenue represented by the difference between the 1&#189;d. and the 2d. letter rate. I hope that some proposal will be made to relieve, first, friendly societies from the burden to. be placed on them with the rest of the community, and if an attempt is made to maintain the ltd. letter rate, I shall support it. </para>

            <para>. - I have recognised that it was inevitable that we should have to deal, at this juncture, if not earlier, with a readjustment of the postal, telephonic, and telegraphic rates, and that the principal reason for this re-adjustment would be found in revenue requirements. It is true, as has been pointed out by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and other honorable senators, that the cost of providing all these services has gone up to the Commonwealth.&#39; Material has appreciated in cost, and officers of the Departments concerned have received very substantial increases in their salaries. But against that we have the growing population of the Commonwealth, we have the increase in commerce, and the increase in social intercourse. To some extent these should insure increases in revenue to meet the increased cost in materials and salaries. </para>

          <para>I am a little disappointed at the way in which the Government have tackled this problem. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I think there is no necessity for re-introducing twopenny postage. It is a retrograde step, in taking which the Government have been animated by considerations which, I think, have long since been dissipated  from the Australian mind. We are going back to a stage beyond even that at which we were at the inception of .Federation, because then at least in every capital city, and in many of the large towns in each of the States, except, perhaps, in South- Australia, there was penny postage. We are going back to a stage which is practically outside the recollection of most of us. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and increasing revenue; but as far as each of the individual States were concerned we had a measure of penny postage, under which we federated, and we had only to extend to the rural districts what the cities and some country towns enjoyed. It took time to establish penny postage iu Australia. I am, and always nave been, a strong supporter of penny postage, and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> who happened to be my colleague when Minister in charge of the Department at one time, was also an enthusiastic advocate. One of the reasons why I support penny postage is because the benefits are felt more by the people in the country than by those in the cities. It was in their interests, mainly, that I advocated and supported it, and I see now, with the proposed re-establishment of twopenny postage, that hardship will fall, not upon those in the cities&#39;, but, almost wholly, upon those in the country districts. </para>

              <para>- That was prior to Federation, but we established a uniform system of charges very early in the history of the Commonwealth and before we adopted penny postage. It is clear to any observer that twopenny postage will bear more heavily upon the residents in the country tuan upon those in the city. </para>

There are thousands of that nature, of course, but the great bulk of letters go from the business houses of all kinds in the city. Nearly every business house takes into consideration its postal expenditure for the year, and regards. it as an item to be met, and adjusts its prices accordingly. </para>

              <para>- It is if it  goes  through the hands of an agent, but if it is sent through the post and addressed to an individual, the addressee has to pay the postage. The same applies in connexion with goods sold in the city to country purchasers. Any honorable senator who takes up a newspaper and peruses the commercial advertisements will find that business houses selling suits of clothes, boots, or other articles pf every day necessity, charge a certain rate; but there is another price if they are forwarded &#34; post free,&#34; which means that the purchaser has to pay the postage. It is the people in the country who have to pay. Then, again, we find that if we peruse the rates set out in the schedule there is a specially low tariff for circulars. Do country people send out circulars? There is another specially low tariff for samples. Do country people send out samples? There is another specially low tariff for goods classified as merchandise. Do country people send out merchandise ? There is also a special tariff for mercantile papers. Is that likely to be of any advantage to country people? What is the result? If we averaged the number of postal articles that a business house in every capital city sends through the post every year it would be found that the cost per postal article would be less than1d. If we were to average what the commercial houses pay on circulars, samples, catalogues, merchandise, and mercantile papers we would find that the city house is practically getting1d. postage, and perhaps less than1d. On the other hand, the residents in the country who use the Post Office will be involved, in every instance, to the extent of a minimum charge of 2d. If a country resident purchases magazines or books from a city establishment he has to pav postage, and, generally speaking, the additional charge falls very heavily upon the people in the country. Twopenny postage for&#189; oz. thus falls primarily and mainly upon country residents, whereas the city business men do not have to pay, on an average, more than1d. per ounce on their total postage. </para>

The country business man has to put up a very hard fight to keep his business in his own district, and the Government by this means are helping the big city houses to smother the country commercial man.

          <para>I have already said that I regard this as a retrograde step. It has been stated that postal rates have been raised in other countries. So they have. Is that any justification for these proposals, particularly when Australia already pays a maximum rate for a minimum weight ? We have the lightest weight for that given rate of any important civilized country. What are the rates in Great Britain ? From the information I have received it would appear that, since the war, the inland charge for letters is l&#189;d. for 4 ounces, with an extra&#189;d. for every additional 2 ounces. In the United States of America the postage to be paid on letters to the British Empire - which, pf course, includes the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand - by firms competing with Australian firms is 2 cents for every 1 ounce, and every fraction of 1 ounce. For other countries it is 5 cents for 1 ounce and 3 cents for every additional ounce. Their rate of postage to us is one-half of what we are to be charged when communicating with! them. The Canadian rate is 2 cents for 1 ounce, and is the same as the United States of America, or one-half of what ours was. We are now proposing 2d. per &#189; ounce within Australia, whereas in Canada it is1d. per ounce. In the United States of America it is1d. per 1 ounce, and in the United Kingdom it is l&#189;d. for 4 ounces, and only&#189;d. for each&#39; additional 2 ounces. Will it be said that we are imposing a fair charge upon the public when we are proposing to raise the postage from l&#189;d. per&#189; ounce - &#189;d. of which was a special war tax - to 2d.- per&#189; ounce? We have the lowest maximum weight for the minimum charge of any country with which we can reasonably invite a comparison. </para>

              <para>- That is the information with which I have been supplied. Our half an ounce is the lowest maximum in any country with, which a comparison can be reasonably made. I am led to refer to this &#39; matter because there are more individuals using the Post Office as a means of communication than there are who use the other facilities referred to in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> said that no great hardship would be imposed upon an individual, using light paper, who wished to correspond from, say, Tasmania to Port Darwin, if the rate is fixed at 2d. per&#189;. ounce. That may be so; but&#34; it is a matter that is relative and needs comparison with other countries. </para>

          <para>We have to recollect that nearly every individual at some time or other writes letters. There are, however, comparatively few who use the telegraphic and telephonic system, so we ought to be sensible of the fact that in disturbing the postal rates we touch almost every individual in the community. There are many who cannot afford to communicate by telegram or telephone, and we should be chary in taking away from them the illiberal enough rights and privileges which they now enjoy. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I do not look upon the Post Office as a tax-collecting machine, but as an instrument of government for rendering a service to the community as a whole. The Department, of course, is justified in obtaining an adequate return for the services provided. If the Government take a more liberal view of the situation they could secure the additional revenue without imposing upon every ordinary letter-, writer a minimum charge of 2d. </para>
          <para>Reference has been made to the telegraphic rates, and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> that we have probably the lowest rates in the world. I do not. say that the charge for transmitting a telegram, say, from Melbourne to Geelong or to Ballarat is lower than the charge would be for a similar message for a similar distance in some other part of the world. But when we consider the distance that a telegram may have to travel, and the number of times that it may have to be repeated, we must recognise that our telegraphic charges are the lowest in the world. In this Bill, instead of charging1s. for Inter-State messages of sixteen words, and1d. for each additional word, it is proposed to make the charge1s. 3d. for sixteen words, with1d. for each additional word. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Thomas has suggested that a flat rate of 1s. should be levied upon these telegrams, and that the rate for inland, city, and suburban messages should be the same. Personally, I am of opinion that, instead of charging1s. 3d. for Inter-State messages of sixteen words, the rate should be increased to1s. 4d. That would be the equivalent of1d. a word, whereas under this proposal the charge for a telegram of sixty words will be 4s. l1d. The latter charge irresistibly reminds one of prices at a cheap sales shop in a minor suburb. For a telegram of twenty-four words, the charge under this Bill will be 1s. l1d. Why not make it1d. per word? It would be very much more convenient for the public. Instead of providing that 1s. 3d. shall be charged upon messages containing sixteen words, why should wo not say that Inter-State telegrams shall be paid for at the rate of1d. per word, with a minimum of1s.?

              <para>- Most certainly. If I require any justification for my suggestion, it is to be found in that portion  of the Bill which relates to lettergrams. Upon these, it is proposed to charge&#189;d. per word, with a minimum of thirty words. Why not make the charge for a telegram just double that? Let us, if necessary, fix a minimum of sixteen words, and make the rate ls. 4d. </para>

          <para class="block">That means that the news agent or the news vendor will get no concession whatever if he posts less than twelve newspapers. If an ordinary individual posts a number of newspapers, he will be required to pay1d. each upon them; they need not even be Australian newspapers. But if a news agent seuds out to a station only four or five newspapers, and Aus-&#39; tralian ones at that, he will be required to pay upon them a minimum charge of ls. We are thus singling him out for exceptional treatment by requiring him to pay in postage upon Australian newspapers more than will be paid by the ordinary citizen on even foreign newspapers. </para>

The small country town news vendor is very often obliged to send out four or five newspapers to a station, and upon these he will be required under this Bill to pay a minimum of ls. Why not give him the advantage of the l&#189;d. charge for 20 oz. ? He will be well known to the local postal authorities - just as well known to them as are, say, Messrs. Gordon and Gotch in Melbourne. </para>

          <para>I hope that when the Bill reaches Committee honorable senators will have particular regard to the requirements of residents outside of our cities. They are the people in this community  to whom the post-office means the most. To them the daily mail - or it may even be the weekly, bi-weekly, or tri-weekly mail - is an event of very great importance. In our cities the ordinary delivery of letter&#167; is the most casual thing in the world. Very often we do not know whether it has taken place or not. We attach very little importance to it. But, in the rural parts of the Commonwealth, it is the event of the day or of the week or other period. We ought, therefore, to see that these people get the benefit of a reduction in our postal rates wherever that is possible. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> moves to reduce the postage upon letters to Id., I shall support him. I do not know whether the requirements of the revenue may not justify the retention for a time of the 1-Jd. rate. If so, I shall support any attempt which may be made to maintain the existing postal charge. </para>

            <para>. - I wish, very briefly, to support the views that have been expressed by Senators Thomas and Keating. The latter, I think, has very clearly proved that the proposed increase in our postal rates will penalize the settlers in the country - the very people whom we wish to encourage. Hitherto, the legislation which has been enacted in Australia has resulted in driving &#39;people to our cities. This Bill represents still another pinprick to the outback settler. Let us contrast his position with that of the dweller in one of our cities. I hold in my hand a telegram which I have just received, and in which I am urged to support the modest request that the residents of a particular locality shall get their mail once a fortnight. A* the Pre&#34; sent time they get it once a month. The telegram reads - </para>

We should do everything in our power to make the lives of the people who live in the country as comfortable as possible. Theyshould get their newspapers and letters at as low a rate a6 possible. After all, country residents use the post-office far more than does any other section of the community. The circulars and letters which are sent out by city business firms are not addressed to people who live within the . metropolitan area. To communicate with these people, business firms use the telephone. But they send out their (circulars and Setters -to the producers in the country. Take, as an example, the firm with which I am associated.. I suppose that we receive 500 letters per day, and not 2 per &#39; cent, of them are of other than  a business character. </para>

They are letters to people living in the country, giving them information about markets, to enable them to sell their products to the best advantage. The people living in towns have a theatre next door, and I notice that the Government propose to abolish the entertainments tax. They have theatres, a doctor in the next street, chemists, football matches, races, and ice. In towns one has only to turn a tap and water will run out of it. In my election campaign in this little State of Victoria I found a woman in the Mallee trying to rear a family in a hut made of old -bags. I asked her how far it was to the nearest doctor, and she said that she had never seen a doctor. It was 50 miles from her place to the nearest doctor or chemist, and her children never saw fresh meat, fresh fruit, or milk. We want people to settle and develop the back country, and we should remember that the settlers on the land are producing 76 per cent, of the total wealth produced by the Commonwealth. </para>

It may, perhaps, not be very much advantage to people to be able to send a telegram, judging from an experience I had on Tuesday last. I sent&#39; a telegram from Mortlake to Geelong. It was lodged at 12.40, and though I was not flying, but motoring, I reached Geelong half-an-hour before my telegram. That is a statement of fact, but I do not desire to make disparaging remarks about the telegraphic service generally. </para>

I do so because I think we should do all that we can to make the lives of settlers on the land more comfortable and attractive than they are at present, and because in this State of Victoria we have the horrible anomaly that 52 per cent, of its population resides in Melbourne. I do not see why people living over 15 miles from the city should be penalized by being charged more for sending a telegram than people living inside that distance. It does not cost any more to send a message along 16 or 17 miles of wire than to send it along 14 miles. </para>

            <para>. - I am supporting the increased rates proposed by this Bill, for the very reasons which have been given by Senators J. F. Guthrie, Keating, and others for their opposition to them.  I  should not readily support an increase in the postage rate if  I  thought for a moment that these increases in postal, telephone, and telegraph rates would not benefit the residents of country districts, whom we are all so anxious to help. Honorable senators should not confine their attention to the postage rate and ignore the telephone and telegraph rates. We would be very foolish to go back to the1d. rate on letters, but whether the rate should be increased to 2d. is another matter. I made some investigation of postal rates as a member of a Royal Commission, that presented a very comprehensive report on the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department. At the time of the inquiry by that Commission, and as the result of evidence I heard throughout the Commonwealth, I was against any reduction of the postage to 1d., because I recognised, and I think rightly, that any reduction of the revenue from the Postal Department involved a curtailment of the facilities which it could extend to people living in country districts. It is a simple matter to make a success of penny postage within the limited area of a city. When people live close to each other, and letters have to be carried but short distances, mail matter can be handled much more cheaply than it can in more sparsely populated areas. To institute a comparison in this matter between the Commonwealth and a small country like Great Britain or any other densely populated country, is to ignore one of the most important factors which govern the whole business. If I were a postal dictator, I would undertake to run the Postal Department of Great Britain on a penny postage before I would undertake to run the postal business of the Commonwealth on a twopenny postage, because of the enormous distances which mails have to be carried in this country as compared with the Old Country. Honorable senators know that such enterprises as Cobb and Company for the carriage of mails are practically unknown in the Old Country. In the Commonwealth we have to continue that expensive means of carrying mail matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> F. Guthrie and other honorable senators who have spoken on this Bill are very anxious to help the . people living in the country districts, but in my opinion they make a grievous mistake . when they propose to take a course of action which must result in the curtailment of revenue from the Postal Department. How can they expect, with a reduced revenue from the Department, that it will be in a position to increase the postal, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities given to country people ? I do not often get the opportunity to visit Western Australia, but when I am there I put in very little time in Perth or the other cities. I live most of my time there in the country, and from my experience of country people I am sure that they would gladly pay increased rates if they could secure the facilities they desire. If there is one public service more than another in connexion with which it may be said that we starve the people, it is the telephone service. There are few countries in the world in which the telephone is so little used as in Australia. We are an up-to-date people in many things, but in the extended use of the telephone we are a very backward people. In the country districts I know of nothing that is so much appreciated in a home as the telephone. If the woman of the house is able to ring up a neighbour on. the telephone and exchange conversation with her, honorable senators will agree that that must have a wonderful effect in making her more satisfied with her comparatively isolated condition of life. The extension of telephonic facilities to country districts must tend greatly to satisfy the social craving of people in those districts, and we could not do better in their interests than to assist in securing for them telephone facilities. This Bill puts it within our power to minimize the loneliness of life in the bush by putting a telephone into the home of every resident of the country. </para>
          <para>Our telephone system is, perhaps, one of the cheapest in the world. </para>

              <para>- Complaints about telephone systems are heard in every country in the world. They are not perfect anywhere, but I believe that our telephone system is as good as that of most countries. We cannot look forward with any hope of securing better postal, telephonic, and telegraphic facilities for the. country unless . we derive an adequate revenue from the operations of this -Department. I know that on several occasions the Department has been asked to extend the telephone system to the place where I live when in Western Australia, but the answer has always been that they have not the revenue to enable them to do so. The people of the district are compelled to make use of the railway telephone, which belongs to the State, and is but a poor substitute for a Commonwealth system. The railway officials do their own business over their telephone lines, and the local residents must take advantage of opportunities when the telephone is not in use by railway officials, and at unusual hours, and on Sundays all telephonic communication is hung up. If women are suddenly taken ill doctors cannot be communicated with. Men engaged in the bush in dangerous callings, such as clearing, are often the victims of accidents, and it is impossible to readily summon assistance for them. lt is because of the lack of revenue that we have not our own telephone service established in these places, and we cannot expect to have them established unless more revenue is derived from the Department. I hope in the circumstances that honorable senators will not support any proposal in the nature of cheeseparing, but that they will agree to the proposed increased rates, in order to enable country services to be established wherever possible. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>has quoted some figures with respect to postal rates which must be very old. I think the honorable senator will find that in the United Kingdom there has been an increase in the rates he quoted. The PostmasterGeneral would scarcely quote figures in this connexion about which he was not sure. So far as I know the figures which the Minister quoted are correct, and he has referred to the fact that there has been an increase in the postage rates of the United Kingdom from1&#189;d. to 2d. </para>
          <para class="block">The rate in South Africa has been increased from Id. to l&#163;d., and in New Zealand from 1&#189;d. to 2d., although New Zealand, is a smaller country than ours by far. Our telephone rates are ridiculously small compared with those of other countries. Honorable senators will find that country people are quite prepared to pay as much for their telephones as the people of other countries do, provided that they are given the facilities. They do not want telephones at j&#163;4 and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> a year. They are prepared to pay double that amount if we will actually give them a telephone service. We have a very cheap rate for the carriage of newspapers, I suppose the cheapest in the world. Therefore, taking the whole of our charges in connexion with the Department, our rates compare more than favorably with those of most other countries. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that this is a new method of taxation. I look on it as a fair charge for services rendered to the community. Whilst we cannot in every instance insist that every service shall pay just whatever it costs, if we so manage that the Department as a whole pays its way as nearly as possible, I think we shall be going on safe and proper lines. There are many services that we cannot expect to pay. For instance, in some places outback it costs 2s. 6d., and sometimes as much as 3s. or 4s. to carry a letter. We can, however, make the Department as a whole pay, and that is the proper system which we should strive to establish. To call these increases in rates &#34; more taxation &#34; is to use language very loosely. In a small State like Victoria, which had Id. postage before Federation, it may be possible to make it pay, or approximately pay. </para>

              <para>- It is not, but it is much more thickly populated than any of the others, with the exception of Victoria. It may be possible to make Id. postage pay in Victoria, but I am sure it could not be made to pay in Western Australia, Queensland or South Australia, which have enormous areas. It is not possible to make a comparison between the cost of running the Department in States like those, and in a State like Victoria. We must do something to assist the Department to get out of the condition that it has been in for so long. We hear constant complaints, and never seem to get satisfaction from it. The primary reason is that there is not sufficient revenue coming, in to work the Department as it should be worked. Let us endeavour to get sufficient revenue, and when that revenue is secured we can insist on services such as we have never been able to have in the past. We know that the price of everything has gone up. We cannot expect rates ever to get back to the modest figures of the past. Not only wire, but every kind of material used in the Department - and it uses many different kinds - have undoubtedly increased considerably in price, and the average wage in the Postal Department has gone up nearly &#163;60 per annum. That being so, there is only one thing for us to do, and that is to increase the rates. When they are increased we can surely expect a much better service than we have had in the past. If we cannot get it then, the fault must be looked for in the management of the Department. It will not be possible for a Postmaster-General to say then, as Postmaster-Generals have invariably said in the past, &#34; I am sorry I cannot comply with your request. I recognise the claim you have for a telephone service or a better postal service, but the funds of the Department are in such a state that I cannot recommend it.&#34; It is time we tried to get enough money into the Department to &#39; make it pay, and to give those facilities which we have all acknowledged should be given. Unless we agree to a proposition of this kind when it is before us we sb.all be only beating the air when we ask later on for greater facilities, because we shall have refused to provide the money necessary to carry them out. </para>

The amount of money  allocated from revenue, and required for the increased salaries and services of the Department this year in all its branches, is close upon &#163;1,500,000. Many appeals have been made in this Chamber to put the services of the Department in a state of reasonable business efficiency. &#39;During the war years a continuing pressure wa3 imposed upon the ex-Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Webster)</inline> to pare down his estimates and expenses until they were actually cut to the bone. I believe that during the last year of his postal administration <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> showed a business profit from the Post and Telegraph Department of about &#163;500,000. That was calmly appropriated by the Treasurer of the day, and went to pay for something else. It was probably allocated towards war services. </para>

              <para>- It is likely that the late Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> thought that if he appropriated the &#163;500,000 profit made by the Department then administered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Webster, he would be able to show &#163;500,000 more towards the cost of the war, and, consequently, make a better Budget, and, perhaps, dodge further taxation to that extent. What happened? The whole of the services were cut to the bone. Economies were made here, and cuts were made there, until the services  almost reached the point of confusion. Certainly the officers were unable to carry on .the services efficiently, partly because many of the expert officials went to the war, and partly because of the shortage of money. The Department during the last two or three years in almost all its branches has been a by-word to the community. The public have lost their old feeling of certainty of letter deliveries or ordinary telegraphic deliveries. They  have given up hope. Speaking from the standpoint of my own State, the Sydney telephone services have arrived almost at a state of chaos owing to the shortage of money to buy material when it could have been bought. </para>

          <para class="block"> In. this debate appeals have been made to the Government to reduce the revenue of the country during the current financial year by some hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is a little late in the day to do that. The time to do it was when the -Bills came before the Senate, by which we incurred statutory obligations for the expenditure of money. Only a month or two ago the Senate, in spite of the protests of some of us, passed a vote for &#163;500,000 for the purpose of helping soldiers to form co-operative societies in the country. One honorable senator appeals for increased allowances to old-age pensioners, another for an increase of the maternity bonus and a third for an extra payment to the blind.&#34; All these things, if indorsed by Parliament, make n sum total of statutory obligations that we have to meet by additional revenue. I have spent some time in analyzing what the Budget means. So far as I can make out, our statutory obligations, including &#163;90,000 to Tasmania, the <inline font-style="italic">.per capita</inline> grant to the States, the cost of running the Po3t and Telegraph Department, including the &#163;1,500,000 increase over the cost last year, old-age pensions, interest, Northern Territory Redemption Fund. and many other items, commit us to an expenditure of &#163;91,665,000.

              <para>- At the dinner adjournment I was pointing out that the statutory obligations that have been specifically passed by this Senate in connexion with our national finance were within &#163;7,000,000 of the total estimated expenditure from both revenue and war loans. The Post Office, I think, has been very liberally dealt with by the Government in the Estimates that will reach us from another place in due course. I think that yesterday we passed a sum of about &#163;900,000 on account of the ensuing financial year. As compared with last year, this is nearly six times the amount for the particular items specified. It must not be forgotten, either, that wages have been considerably increased, and that the cost of administration of the Post Office is, 4 so far as I can gather by a cursory glance at the figures that have been presented to us, &#163;600,000 more this year than ever before. According to the Estimates, the 2d. postage rate will &#34;bring in &#163;750,000 extra, and the difference between this sum and the &#163;1,000,000 extra which it is expected the Post Office receipts will aggregate is made up by additional charges for telegrams and telephones. The financial position of a Government is not exactly the same as that of an ordinary trading institution. We have to make our income equal our expenditure, but an ordinary trading concern fits its expenditure to its income, or, in other word6, cuts its coat according to its cloth. I do not want to repeat myself, but I wish to emphasize the fact that time and time again objections have been made by the economists in this chamber to what is sometimes regarded as extravagant expenditure, yet, in spite of this, we have passed Bill after Bill imposing additional expenditure on the Government, and now &#34; the chickens are coming home to roost.&#34; We have to get the money. The question is, how best to get it. I see that the entertaining Melbourne press have coined a phrase indicating that this financial statement of the Treasurer is a &#34; knock-out Budget.&#34; It certainly is, so far as the entertainments tax is concerned, and I do not altogether agree with its policy in that respect. I would be quite prepared to support the weighty arguments that have been adduced in this chamber in favour of keeping tEe postage at its present rates, if there were any reasonable expectation of raising money in some other direction. I had in mind even a proposal to knock out the proposed remission of the entertainments tax, in order to keep the postage rates on letters where it is, but I am in this difficulty : The rejection of the Bill to remit portion of the entertainments tax would only give us about &#163;250,000 per year, and I am a bit doubtful as to the constitutional position of the Senate. We cannot impose taxation, and the rejection by the Senate of the Bill to which I refer would, in effect, be increasing taxation. </para>

By keeping postage at its present rates we are going to lose, according to the Budget Estimates, approximately &#163;750,000, and as one of the representatives of New South&#39; Wales I am not going to risk further inefficiency in the Post Office. We have had quite enough of that already. The war is over. It is nearly two years since the armistice was signed. The skilled employees of the Department are, I hope, back at their jobs; and. if we give the Postmaster-General sufficient money to carry on we have a right to expect efficiency in the Department. If we do not get it we can then properly blame those who are responsible. </para>

I listened with a good deal of sympathy to the argument that any increases in the postage rate on newspapers would penalize the people in the country more than the people in the town, and I am reminded that we are continually calling out to our people, &#34; Produce, produce. Go on the land, young man.&#34; We ought to be practical in our legislation. If it were not for the spectre of finance, I would vote for a proposition to keep letter postage where it is, and if, as a result, we lost about &#163;750,000 of anticipated revenue, to be logical we should have to reject the Bill that is coming before us for the remission of part of the entertainments tax. </para>

              <para>- I am putting the position before the Senate as it appears to me. I believe that if there is anything the matter with the Budget, it is that it does not impose enough taxation. On several occasions in this phamber I have expressed regret that, in former years, Governments have not faced this question of taxation in a satisfactory manner. I believe that had the Government desired to impose taxation in war time the people would have been less, critical than now. Although we are not approximating to the healthy finance of the Mother Country, we are doing much better now than ever before, and, in my opinion, this Budget goes a long way towards placing Australian finances on a reasonable basis. </para>

              <para>- Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Presi-.</inline> dent. But this question of Post Office revenue is so inextricably mixed up with the Budget that I cannot help myself. In the Budget there are the figures relating to the Post Office, approximating &#163;10,000,000 out of a total of &#163;90,000,000 ; and running through the whole of the Budget there are frequent references to the Post Office, or matters in connexion with it. I sit down in a difficulty about this matter. My difficulty is that, even if we do continue the imposition of the entertainments tax as it stands to-day, and keep the postage at <inline font-style="italic">lid.</inline> per letter, we shall be &#163;500,000 short in our anticipated revenue. </para>

            <para>.  - I have looked very carefully into this proposal, but, perhaps, not as closely  as has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> If I understand this matter aright, the halfpenny increased postage which was imposed as a war tax will now be transferred to the Postal Department, so that the Postmaster-General will receive an increase in revenue as far as postal work is concerned. It would appear, therefore, that the Department will be receiving an increase of 100 per cent, in one jump - the Department  will benefit by 100 per cent., but the public will not be charged to that extent. The additional revenue will go towards meeting the difficulties with which, the Department has had to contend. There are also to he increased rates on telegrams, and for the use of the telephone. The increase iu the telegraphic rates, as honorable senators will have noticed, is 50 per cent, in the metropolitan area, per cent, within a State, and, approximately, 25 per cent, on Inter-State messages. The increased income is very extensive, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> if he goes into the question more closely, will find that it is very much higher than he has anticipated. lt appears to me that if we allow the postal rate to remain as it is, and impose additional charges on telegrams and telephones, we shall be giving the Department considerable assistance and easing its responsibility to a large extent. As has already been pointed out by honorable senators, the increased postage on letter-matter affects more particularly those who are living in the backblocks, and persons living in Melbourne or in any other capital city of the Commonwealth are apt to forget that the proposed alterations will affect residents in every part of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> said we are continually urging men to go on the land, but at every turn we are making it more difficult for them to make rural life profitable and pleasant. Personally, I think that, for the present year at any rate - seeing that the Post Office is to receive, approximately, &#163;745,000, which in the past has been a war tax - we should allow the rate on letters to remain unaltered. It roust be remembered that the sixpenny telegrams are not of any great advantage in a city such as Melbourne, because the telephone is utilized to a great extent as a means of communication. Tn imposing an extra 3d. on telegrams there will not be any great gain in the metropolitan area, and instead of the ninepenny State telegram it would be better to have that rate uniform with the Inter-State rate, which is ls. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is also &#34;another phase of this question that must not be overlooked. It must be remembered that taxation must be considered as distinct from revenue, and we ought to keep the Postal Department out of the question, and not look upon the Postmaster-General as a tax gatherer. Taxes are gathered through the medium of the Customs House, and the Land and Income Tax, and other Departments, and it should be our endeavour to&#39; keep taxation within those boundaries, and not allow it to enter the Postal Department, because by doing so we are hampering that free interchange which is a great benefit to the community. It is not my intention at this juncture to discuss the question of penny postage, because I believe that can be left until our indebtedness is much less than it is to-day. I believe that the change that has been foreshadowed will be the means of meeting the requirements of the Postal Department, and give it sufficient funds, at any rate for twelve months, to develop and proceed with work as soon as the necessary material arrives. It has been suggested that the Postmaster-General needs more revenue, because higher salaries will have to be paid. If that were brought forward as a special reason for the increased rates there may have been some justification, but that has not been mentioned by the Minister. He has stated that the additional rates are to be charged because the cost of certain telephonic and telegraphic material has increased. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The honorable senator must remember that this is not put forward as an emergency measure, and the argument he is advancing is purely an emergency one. Taking the figures generally, and knowing what has been the result in the past, we shall be limiting our income if we further increase the postage rates, and we shall also be limiting the usefulness of the Post Office if we place a further encumbrance upon newspapers. In one way it may be beneficial, as it will enable some post offices to overtake arrears of work which at present are a long way behind. </para>

              <para>- That argument does not enter the question, as ,it is one of finance, and not efficiency. It is a well-known fact that much of the printed matter that goes forward to post-offices is left for a convenient time before it is sorted and delivered. I have been told that some newspapers are almost dead and forgotten before they are delivered from the offices. The Government would be well advised if they accepted the suggestion which has been put forward by certain honorable senators, and allowed the postage rate to remain as at present. If the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> should find that the amount at his disposal is insufficient, Parliament will have an opportunity of considering an application for additional money. I do not wish to hinder the passage of the Bill, but I think there is a strong feeling amongst honorable senators that the postage Tate of 1-Jd. is sufficient for the present, because, with the additional revenue to be derived from increased telegraphic and telephonic rates, the Postmaster-General should be able to place his Department on a satisfactory basis, and at the same time render an  efficient service. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with letter matter, but with newspapers. The policy of the Government has been to extend and cheapen facilities for the dissemination of newspapers through the medium of the Post Office, We propose to increase the charges by 3d. in the case of telegraphic messages containing sixteen words. In the United Kingdom the rates have recently been increased from 9d. for twelve words and <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> for each additional word, to ls. for twelve words and Id. for each additional word, which represents an increase of - 33^ per cent, on the initial rate, and 100 per cent, on the rate for extra words. </para>

In New Zealand the rates have been increased from&#34; 8d. for twelve words and <inline font-style="italic">\A.</inline> for each additional word, to ls. for twelve words and Id. for each additional word, an increase of 50 per cent, on the initial charge, and 100 per cent, on the secondary rate.

          <para>The policy of Australia has not been to regard the Post and Telegraph Department as altogether a commercial concern, because we recognise the national importance of developing our back country by granting every possible facility to settlers. But if honorable senators imagine that they are going to promote settlement by means of penny postage alone, they are sadly mistaken. That is too small a matter to affect settlement to any great extent. </para>

              <para>- But penny postage throughout the Commonwealth would assist the promotion of settlement much less than will the granting of adequate postal facilities. Hitherto we have had to tell our people that we could not grant them such facilities. There are members of this Chamber who cannot get the use of telephones to-day because the exchanges are full. Quite recently, a gentleman in Sydney wrote to me complaining that he could not get the telephone connected with his place of business. </para>

The Government attempted to battle along during the war period as best they could, leaving the Post Office in its present inefficient state. We now desire to bring it up to date.

              <para>- Unfortunately, the Senate would not adjourn in order to permit me to do so. Wherever one goes he finds that the telephone service is in a bad condition owing to the lack of requisite material. We have endeavoured to avoid the imposition of additional taxation as far as possible; but to keep back the development of the country by withholding adequate postal facilities would be a suicidal policy. For other works, which are equally important, we shall need to borrow &#163;5,000,000 next year, not because we desire to rush works ahead, but because we are behind in most of these, undertakings. Upon one job, which was started before the war, we are losing money very heavily, simply because it has not been completed. </para>

The proposition with which I am now dealing is a much, larger one, because a quick, reliable and efficient postal service is absolutely necessary for Australia during the period, of post-war reconstruction.

              <para>- Every one knows that, but the news agent cannot take from the sub-agent his particular customers. This &#34;proviso simply plays into the hands of the big publishing houses and the newspaper proprietors. A newspaper published in Sydney or Melbourne is sent to Hobart and Launceston. The Launceston agent may take 300, of which he distributes 200 in Launceston. Of the remaining 100 he perhaps sends twenty to Longford, seven to some other town, and six to some other store or shop. On each of those parcels, even if it only contains five or six papers, the minimum postage is ls. The Minister suggests that the Launceston agent can send them to the individual subscribers,, but he does not know them, and, moreover, the local sub-agent hands them to&#39; his customers when they come to his store, where they probably buy other goods, and perhaps pay for the papers as they get them. This clause will drive those individual subscribers, unless they are numerous enough to justify the payment of ls. postage, into having either to cease to subscribe, or to send to Launceston or Melbourne to have the papers sent to them direct, because the Launceston agent would get nothing out of sending those few copies through the post separately. Even if they were American or other foreign papers, they could be sent individually to these people in the country towns at the rate of Id. each, but as the clause stands, the subagent cannot get a small parcel of Australian papers sent to him except on pay ment of a rninimum charge of ls. Let us strike out this proviso. What is the advantage of it? It will only congest the circulation of the papers into the larger areas of population. </para>

              <para>- I am not asking for anything of the kind. This proviso applies to newspapers printed and published in the Commonwealth and sent to <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> subscribers through <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> agents for distribution. The Government have taken upon themselves responsibility in this clause for that system. What the Minister does not see is that there are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> agents in certain localities who have to supply only five or six subscribers with copies of a paper. Why should those subscribers be denied the benefit of these rates simply because of the paucity of their numbers? The large distributors get the benefit of the bulk postage, but it is denied by this proviso to the smaller distributors in the country towns&#39;, although they are still <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> newsagents. If the proviso is passed, it will be a genuine grievance to local distributors and subscribers in small localities. They will say, &#34;What else can you expect? It is Melbourne all the time. That is all that the Federal Parliament will look to when it is making provision for anything of this kind.&#34; Let us not have that reproach added to us in this case. Let the Government carry out the spirit of the bulk concession, so far as every <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> distributor is concerned, whether he is a big Melbourne magnate or a small sub-agent in a remote portion of the &#39;Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - There seems to be some misunderstanding. The services rendered in the two cases are entirely different. Waggon-loads of newspapers, which ultimately go to different districts, are sent down every night to the post-office and the railway station, but the sender gets the benefit of the bulk postage, even though he is despatching 500 single newspapers to 500 single individuals in 500 different towns. If the minimum charge is reducedbelow1s., we may find that the Post Office is giving too great a service for the money. At present, all the sender has to do is to cart his own mail to the post-office. Is it worth extending the concession any further? There is a difference between the retailer and the wholesaler, because the bigger the business, and the more it is handled in bulk, the cheaper can the handling be done. </para>

              <para>- I think the ls. minimum will get over the difficulty. The point does not seem very important,  but iti may be necessary for the practical working of the Department. The clause is not introduced to assist private individuals to push some little newspaper for a special cause. The idea is to give the benefit of cheap postage on newspapers, particularly the big papers, to the general public. We do not want to penalize smaller papers unduly, but we should not give them special privileges. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has made out a good case, although when he began I was not altogether with him. I am not very favorable, -and ueve&#39;r have been, to this part of the Bill. The newspaper rates under this clause are altogether too low. People try to register ali sorts of prints as newspapers, and it is very difficult to decide what a newspaper is. Some of them are so light that eighty copies will not make up 20 oz. For1d., eighty of those so-called newspapers can be posted at the Melbourne General Post Office and sent to any place, in Australia. I would rather see the principle established of every separate newspaper having to pay &#189;d. postage, but the Government have not proposed that. They are continuing the system of allowing newspapers to go through in bulk. The reason that was done under Federal control was this: When Federation was established all newspapers in New South Wales were sent through the Post Office free. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Keating&#39;s</inline>contention is quite right. I have here a paper printed in, Broken Hill, lt probably does not weigh more than &#163; ounce, and I should say that, in order to come under this provision, the publisher would have to post over forty or pav a minimum charge of ls. The clause will not prevent the bogus newspaper from being distributed in bulk through the Post Office if a sufficient number of them are posted- at one time. The only way to prevent  the bogus newspaper from taking advantage of this provision would be to charge  &#189;d.  upon every newspaper, as is done in New Zealand and England. If the Government intend to penalize the small country newspaper in this way I shall be in favour- of knocking out the provision altogether and putting all newspapers on the same level. </para>

              <para>- The ordinary votes and appropriations provided that the Postmaster-General should receive an additional &#163;750,000. If the PostmasterGeneral is to receive rthat additional amount for the working of his Department, would he not, if the proposed rate were allowed to . remain at1&#189;d., receive &#163;750,000 or a little more by being able to retain what has in the past been a&#189;d. war-time tax? If the rate to be imposed after the 1st October were l&#189;d. for every&#189; oz. of letter matter the additional&#189;d. would give the PostmasterGreneral an extra &#163;750,000 in revenue. I desire to be quite fair in this matter, and it is necessary to turn to the total expenditure proposed in the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department this year. A very large expenditure from revenue is to be incurred on new works, buildings, and sites, and, for the first time in some years, the amount to be provided for this purpose is greatly in excess of what it has been in previous years. </para>

Cannot the honorable senator see that if we accept that statement as indicative of sound finance we are asking the present taxpayers to bear the whole of the burden of improving our postal arrangements and buildings which will benefit, not only those who are contributing to the cost of government to-day, but also those who will benefit in years to come. </para>

              <para>- I desire to compare the amount proposed to be expended from loan money with that to be expended from revenue during the current financial year. I am not referring to the cost involved in the maintenance and upkeep of existing buildings, but providing new works and buildings. It is proposed to spend &#163;1,074,000 from revenue, whilst the amount to be spent from loan funds is only &#163;53,000. Surely it is out of all proportion to suggest that we should spend double the amount from revenue for permanent additions to our postal buildings to what we are spending from loan money, particularly at a time when the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> admits that there is great difficulty in raising revenue to meet the expenditure that is arising from day to day. </para>

              <para>- I do not agree with the honorable senator. The money for the upkeep of buildings must be provided out of revenue, but new works of a permanent character should be paid for from loan money, so that not only the taxpayers of to-day, but those who follow us, will bear their share of the benefits that are to be conferred: on the community. </para>

              <para>- Not at all, it came in quite freely, and it must be admitted that Australia has never asked for money in vain. Can any honorable senator refer to an appeal that has not been satisfactorily responded to ? I am not advocating that the whole of this expenditure should be defrayed from loan money, but we are being asked this year to provide twothirds of the total amount to be spent on new works and buildings out of revenue. </para>

              <para>- It would be  a  splendid idea if we were assured of  a  surplus at the end of our financial year, and we were not imposing additional taxation on the people who bear their burdens cheerfully and with a good heart. But we know very well that the time must come when we shall reach the limit of our powers in regard to taxation. Unless it is imperative for the safety of the nation, no Parliament has a right to impose additional taxes. </para>

              <para>- The clause embodies a proposal to increase the rate of postage on letters, and I am endeavouring to show a way in which that additional impost may to some extent be avoided. I believe that by retaining the current rate of <inline font-style="italic">lid.</inline> we could meet the needs of the Department .with the additional revenue provided in the Estimates for the PostmasterGeneral. I trust honorable senators will hesitate before approving of the proposal in this clause. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said it was a retrograde step, and so it is. We should endeavour to popularize the Postal Service as much as possible, but if the measure is passed in its present form it will mean that the business of the Department will be reduced. I believe that the present rate, with the addition I &#39; have mentioned, will enable the Postmaster-General to carry on his Department successfully, and at a profit. </para>

            <para>. - Every honorable senator sympathizes with friendly societies and appreciates the valuable work which they perform. Personally, I have been a member of the Australian Natives Association for about twenty-five years, though I have never had a sixpence out of it. But I object to the amendment, because I believe that the Post Office ought to be run upon commercial lines, so as to enable it to pay for itself. The amendment is designed to confer a special privilege upon friendly societies, if we are going to grant that privilege because those organizations look after the welfare of the poor, there are other societies which are entitled to much more consideration. In this connexion I may instance the Ladies Benevolent Society and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Further. I doubt very much whether it is within the power of this Parliament to subsidize any organization which is  assocated  with any religion. If that were done, there would be a tendency to develop rivalry, and consequently we had  better leave the thing alone. Membership of friendly societies to-day is practically confined to the steady, thrifty working men, with families, who wish to provide an insurance against sickness and old age. If we wish to devote money to charity, there are other bodies which are doing better work in the way of looking after those who are unable to look after themselves, than are friendly societies. I say that, although I am a full member of a friendly- society, and intend to remain one, because I recognise that I may not always be a member of this Parliament or a Minister of -the Crown, and that some day it may be necessary for me to get back into harness. Men join these societies chiefly as a matter of insurance against the future. But what about the working man who is insured in a State or other accident insurance company today ? Why not give him the advantage of special postage rates? </para>

I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> not to press the amendment, because, although we are all in full sympathy with friendly societies, we ought not to discriminate in their favour in the matter of postal rates.

            <para>. -  There is one point connected with the amendment which, to my mind, makes it quite an impracticable proposal. As honorable senators are doubtless aware, there are some trade unions which com bine with their ordinary duties work of a purely friendly society nature, and work which involves a great deal of notification to their members. Take, for example, the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which make allowances to their members in the nature of unemployment, sick, and accident pay - work which under ordinary circumstances would be covered by friendly societies. As a result, many of the members of these organizations do not find it necessary to join a friendly society. How does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> propose to differentiate between these organizations and what are ordinarily known as friendly societies ? </para>

              <para>- Then the honorable senator will not be acting fairly to the men who are deriving through their trade organizations the same benefits that they would obtain if they were members of a friendly society. It must be obvious that the duty of sending out notifications is a big job, evento these organizations. But if we are going to impose upon the postal officials the task of discriminating between notices of an official character and other correspondence, we shall be asking them to do altogether too much. Upon the other hand, if we affirm that the men who belong to trade unions shall not obtain the benefits which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> would confer upon friendly societies, we shall involve ourselves in a good deal of criticism. I hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has invited us to . oppose it by throwing down the gauntlet. He practically said, &#34; If you dare to oppose this proposition, you must accept responsibility for your action.&#34; </para>

            <para>. - I do not want my attitude to be misunderstood. I did not throw down the gauntlet and challenge honorable senators to reject the amendment at their peril. &#39; The remark I made was in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> F. Guthrie, who rather forcibly asked why I made this suggestion, and left the returned soldiers out. My reply is that if an honorable senator desires to include returned soldiers, I am prepared to support him. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> suggested that I was asking for a special favour or charities towards the friendly societies, but that argument will hardly stand the test of critical logic. The Government differentiate in their postal charges already in connexion with the carriage of newspapers and other things. The friendly societies post a mass of correspondence in bulk, bearing the official stamp, which, a short time ago, would be carried at the Jd. rate. If it was printed matter, it could go open for Jd., but, because a few words or a few figures are added in ink, the society will be called on to pay 2d. for every notice. Surely what I am asking is no charity. I simply want the Department to act as a business concern, and to carry the correspondence for nearly half a million people at a reduced rate, not only because the friendly societies are a distinct national benefit, but because they are bringing trade to the Department, which no single individual does. </para>

              <para>- That is quite a different matter. Although some firms may send out large quantities of letters, they do so for trade purposes, and not for any benefit to Australia. The friendly societies are co-operative concerns for the benefit of over 2,000,000 people, including members and their families. I am not asking for a particular charity for these societies. I am only asking the Department to treat them as any business man would treat a special customer. I also advance the argument that they should be treated as special customers by the Commonwealth Government, because they are bestowing a very special benefit upon Australia. I want the support of honorable senators, but I do not seek it in any defiant spirit. I know that every honorable senator has a perfect right to vote against the amendment if he disagrees with it. This is no new matter with me. I have had correspondence with lodge secretaries long before this, and have made a promise that if I had the opportunity I would endeavour to induce Parliament to order that the official correspondence of friendly societies should be carried at a reasonable rate. I am not asking more than that, when I urge that letters, bearing their official stamp, and posted in bulk, shall be carried at the Id. rate. </para>

These would include a typed memorandum from a commercial firm, stating that they had opened up a new fabric, and would be pleased if their customers would inspect it on a certain day. That sort of thing mav go through the post at lid. for 2 ozs., whereas a friendly society&#39;s notification, on a printed form, with figures added in ink, showing that on a certain date a member will be out of compliance, and owe a certain amount, has to pay 2d. per <inline font-style="italic">i</inline><inline font-style="italic">oz.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">I am rather sorry to have to propose l&#189;d., because I would rather move for 1d. ; but it seems from the debate that we may be able to carry l&#189;d., but not1d. I gather that honorable senators are not anxious that the Department should be what has been termed a tax collector. Those who favour the 2d, rate seem to think that it will bring sufficient revenue into the Department to provide all the money necessary to carry on its various services adequately. Ever since we have been federated, people have beencomplaining of the Post and Telegraph Department, but most of the time the fault has not been the lack of money. I remember the time when the PostmasterGeneral had placed in his hands as much money as he could spend. Honorable senators have given us to understand that, if this money is. available, all the country mail services will be provided, but I may remind them that it is utterly impossible in Australia to deliver letters to everybody. I know it is the proud boast of the Imperial authorities that every house in the United Kingdom is covered by the Post Office. But that has only been the case during the last ten or fifteen years. In a sparsely populated country like Australia, it is impossible to deliver letters to every house. I remember being asked on one occasion to supply a country mail service at a cost of &#163;3,000, when the revenue would be only &#163;3 per year. If we had ever so much money, it would be foolish to grant a. request for a service in those circumstances. Whoever is the head of the Department, he must fix some limit to the expenditure. Some years ago, if out-back settlers wanted a mail service, they could retain the whole of the revenue for themselves, and, in the case of any deficiency they were only called upon to pay one-half. The conditions may be more generous now, but, in any case, some regulation must be provided, and some limit fixed for expenditure on these services. The adoption of the- 2d. postal rate will undoubtedly bring in more money within the next twelve months than it will be possible for the Postal Department to spend. </para>

              <para>- Those who have had any experience of the Postal Department must know that it is impossible to spend more than a certain amount each year. In any case the greater proportion of the . money will not be spent in the Postal Branch, but in the Telephone Branch. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has pointed out again and again that the Sydney telephone service is not what it ought to be. He says that it has been starved, and we have had statements to the effect that the Postmaster-General intends to spend a good deal of money in the purchase of telephonic material. It would appear, therefore, that most of the money to be expended in the next twelve months will not be in the direction of providing more mail services for the country districts. Undoubtedly the bulk will be spent in the cities. I am not in favour of money earned by the Postal Branch being spent in the Telephone Branch. </para>

              <para>- I am quite prepared to do that if the 2d. rate is not sufficient, but I think the 1-Jd. rate is quite high enough. Last year there was a profit on the operations of the Department of &#163;500,000, and, in addition, &#163;750,000, the revenue from the &#163;d. war postage tax. If the Minister expects to get through the whole of that revenue in connexion with the programme he has mentioned, all I can say is that he will be spending the money very fast indeed. </para>

            <para>. - I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> to remember that some little time ago we, in this country, were charged with the responsibility of seeing that he and his comrades at the Front were perfectly equipped for the purpose of winning the . war. It would have been criminal then to have given them anything but the very best. The war has now taken on other phases, and has been transferred to Australia. We are now engaged in a commercial conflict, and our duty is to see that our officials are effective and our Departments efficient. If Australia is going to come out of the present crisis successfully, we must aim at higher standards than ever before. We must have more effective technical training for the members of our Public Service, a better organization of capital, and a more efficient development of our industrial activities. We must have efficiency in the workshops, in the business offices, and in our public Departments. Everything must be brought up to date, otherwise we shall fall behind. If we aim at an up-to-date and efficient Department, we must not be content with fourth or fifth rate telephone or telegraph, services. The amount we are asking for is less than what would have been spent under normal conditions to keep the Department up-to-date, and we have to pick up our arrears as early as possible - in an endeavour to place the work of an important Department on an efficient basis. A small amount has been provided for the Perth Post Office, where business has for some time been proceeding rather slowly. The telephonic material and cables on hand are not altogether suitable for extending certain lines, and it is unreasonable to suggest that expenditure in this direction should be met out of loan and not out of revenue. We have been working on that basis for too long, and it is our endeavour to make a speedy recovery. It is not our intention to erect palatial buildings, but to place the necessary machinery in the hands of the Department to enable its work to proceed as &#34;smoothly and efficiently as possible. </para>

              <para>- Of course it is. It is impossible for the Government to carry out its policy if the different Departments are to have only second-class tools of industry. I ask honorable senators not to think that any of this money is going to the Treasurer unless we are confronted with unusual difficulties, and have not sufficient material to enable the work of the Department to proceed expeditiously. It has been said that much of this money will be spent in the cities, but it must be remembered that, in connexion with large public works, a considerable amount has to be eoe tended in the metropolitan area to enable the necessary extension to be made elsewhere. The requisite power and machinery must be provided in the capital cities, and the intention of the Government is to take into due consideration the claims of country towns and rural districts generally. The policy we are at present adopting is not one that I would favour under normal conditions, but we must remember that some taxpayers are at present contributing to the extent of  126.  in the  &#163;1,  and there must be a limitation in&#39; this regard. </para>

              <para>- That is the position, and if we do not get money we shall have to borrow or allow the Postal Department to remain in a state of stagnation. It must be remembered that it is difficult to borrow money at the present time for ordinary ^public works. During the war period the people of the Commonwealth, in a very patriotic spirit, contributed largely to loans raised for the purpose of re-establishing our returned soldiers in civil life; but it would be a difficult matter, at the present time, to- raise large sums of money for public works. I hope it will not be necessary to appeal to the people of Australia for additional money to assist in settling soldiers, but, if that contingency should arise, I hope we will not be in conflict in raising money for different purposes.&#39; After the most careful investigation we have outlined a policy of public works, and have endeavoured to reduce the expenditure to the lowest possible limit. I ask honorable senators not to treat this as merely a section of the work, but to consider the proposals of the Government as a whole and, if that is done, the Senate will be assisting the Government in meeting the difficulties which confront them. We must have revenue, and if we do not spend this money in the Postal1 Department it will not be thrown away. We are, however, endeavouring to put the Department on a business-like basis in the interests of the community generally. I appeal to honorable senators not to vote for the amendment, but to stand by the Government proposal, which, I believe, will ultimately prove to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth . </para>

              <para>- Take the question of copper, which enters very largely into the matter, and consider the present price and what it will probably be in twelve months&#39; time. It is likely to drop. The proposition before the Committee does not appear to me to be a sound one, and it would appear on the information that has been given that we shall be giving the Postmaster-General more than he can possibly spend in twelve months. It is not my desire to in any way limit the usefulness of the Postal Department, but I think that as we are urged to exercise economy the action of the Government is extravagant in the extreme. </para>

              <para>- It has no bearing whatever, because the Minister might have pointed out, if he had proceeded with his analogy, that adequacy and efficiency did not march step by step with the expenditure, and that very often appliances for which we paid the most were worthless, and that those for which we paid comparatively little turned out to be the most effective. There is no guarantee that the Postal Department will receive a swollen revenue as the result of increased postage. The figures placed before us are only estimates; and we know from experience in other parts of the world that for every reduction in postage there has been more than a proportionate increase in the use of the Post Office. Early in the evening the Minister referred to a statement I made in connexion with the postal rates in force in Great Britain, and said that my information was not up to date. He stated that the inland postage in the United Kingdom was higher than that I quoted. I happen to have had communications from Great Britain, and I have not seen on any of those communications stamps of a higher denomination than those I have mentioned. Is the Minister prepared to produce stamps of a higher denomination covering the weights I mentioned ? </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>has referred to the possibility of an overseas Inter-Empire 2d. rate; and if there is such a proposition, Australia will stand up to it. But I draw attention to the fact that what we are providing for is not merely InterEmpire, but also postage within the Commonwealth, which means that the 2d, rate will be charged on a letter sent from one side of the street to the other, from the city to the country, or, what is more important still, from the country to the city. When the proposition of an interEmpire postal rate &#39; confronts us, we can deal with it. But, at the present time, we are dealing with what is of more importance to us from a &#39;domestic point of view. The motive behind the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is one of consideration for the settlers in our country districts, and consequently I have very much pleasure in supporting it. Indeed, had he been prepared to move for a reversion to penny postage, the proposal would have commanded my vote. To me a compromise at lid. is a most reasonable one. </para>

            <para>. - Any remarks which I may make upon this amendment will be based entirely upon figures submitted by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in his Budget papers. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Rus-. sell)</inline> stated by way of interjection a short &#39; time ago that the PostmasterGeneral had to incur additional expenditure this year by reason of increases of salaries, which would aggregate more than the amount that he will receive in revenue if he is allowed the extra id. postage upon letters, the revenue from which has hitherto been received by the Treasury. I find from the Budget that the expenditure of the Postal Department last year, amounted to &#163;5,707,399, while the amount under this heading which is actually provided on the Estimates for the current financial year, is &#163;6,352,936. In other words, provision has been made for the PostmasterGeneral to expend &#163;645,537 more than he did last year. How does that compare with the additional revenue which he will receive if he is permitted to retain the war postage of&#189;d. per half ounce? Last year the Treasurer received from this particular source a revenue of &#163;74-5,962, a larger sum than the increased expenditure which will be incurred by the Postmaster-General this year. </para>

              <para>- That is so. In other words, there will be an increased expenditure this year of &#163;1,300,000. I have previously pointed out that this year it is proposed to take two-thirds of the amount to be expended upon new works and buildings from revenue, and one- third from loan, quite an opposite policy from - that which has been adopted during recent years. If we make provision for wiping off our indebtedness upon these works within a reasonable time we shall be doing our duty to the people of Australia. I believe that, with a small reconstruction, ample revenue will be provided to meet the needs of the Postal Department, even with the reduction in the rate which has been proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline></para>

              <para>- Yes. I have listened carefully to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> and I see more clearly what I think will be the actual financial position of the Post and Telegraph Department supposing that postage rates remain as they are to-day. The exPostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. &#34;Webster)</inline> was very proud of the fact that the last year of his administration showed a profit of about &#163;526,000. It should be remembered that that was made on the basis of Id. postage, and not on that of <inline font-style="italic">lid.</inline> postage; and, in addition to the sum of &#163;526,000, there was paid into the Treasury - as an outcome of the imposition of the -id. war tax - a sum approximating &#163;700,000. That  &#189;d.  tax was put on expressly for the purposes of the then Treasurer. The postal services actually made, on the basis&#39; of the lid. postage, during the last year of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Webster&#39;s</inline> administration, the sum of about &#163;1,250,000 in excess of what was spent. The opinion has been expressed in this Chamber that it is not desirable that the postal services should be run at a profit. Had not that profit been squeezed out of the postal services by the then Treasurer, possibly, for the purpose of making his Budget look prettier, and for the elevation of his own prestige- </para>

              <para>- I take it that each member of the Ministry wishes to make out the best case possible for his own Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> made no secret of the fact that he was squeezed beyond endurance by the Treasurer of the day in connexion with the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, and that the present state of chaos in regard to some of the services is not a result of his administration, but is due to the shortsighted policy of the Treasurer. I am not willing to see any Minister sacrificed without the truth being known. If the sum whichI have mentioned as having been squeezed out of the Postal Department had gone back to be spent even in connexion with upkeep, the Department would not have been in the chaos in which it flounders to-day. I do not believe that our post and telegraph services should be run for profit; neither am I a believer in the view that they should be run at a loss. I have pointed out that, on the last year&#39;s figures, the profit will be &#163;500,000. The war tax of id. per letter will revert to the postal services, and will provide them with a profit, for expenditure on much needed work, of about &#163;1,250,000; that is, supposing that the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> does not again make a claim. I believe that the services of the Department will cost &#163;500,000 or &#163;600,000 more - largely, as the result of increased salaries and added expenditure upon administration. That will leave about &#163;700,000 for expenditure upon developmental work and repairs. </para>

              <para>- That is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> who ought to know what he is talking about, states that the Department cannot spend very much more than that sum in the whole of the twelve months; and I know that, with regard to material which to-day is so short, the officials concerned will not be able to secure supplies for fully twelve months. What, therefore, is to be done with the money? Will not the fact of it being available tend to encourage extravagance? Let us turn attention to the telephone service in Sydney. The patient public have been told that they must wait another year or two before matters can be rectified, for the reason that necessary material cannot be secured. </para>

              <para>- My remarks are related each to the other, because I am arguing as to the effect of finance upon the question whether the postal rates shall be raised or not. I will not call it humbug, but it is somewhat insincere for the Government to say, in effect, &#34; We are going to extract more money from the postal services and make a profit indirectly for&#39; the purpose of running picture shows free of tax.&#34; I will not stand for that. The sum of . about &#163;270,000 is to be remitted in respect of the entertainments tax. I remember the struggle which occurred in the Senate over the imposition of id. tax on kiddies&#39; 3d. tickets. I shall be no party to the unnecessary imposition of higher postage rates, in the light of the figures which I have quoted, and which I invite the Minister to controvert. I shall be no party to the increased postal rates and the wasting of &#163;270,000 by partial remissions in connexion with the entertainments tax. </para>

          <para>. - I now invite the Minister to consider the suggestion I made on the second reading to make the price of Inter-State telegrams, in effect,1d. per word. The proposed rate is1s. 3d. for not exceeding sixteen words. Why not make it1s.4d., or make the rate1d. a word, with a minimum of1s., or1d. a word with a minimum of1s. 3d. ? It will then be in harmony with the later provision that lettergrams should be charged&#189;d. per word with a minimum of thirty words, or a minimum charge of1s. 3d. My suggestion will make it very much easier for the sender of the telegram, the clerk, the accountant, and the auditor. A man sending sixty words will know that he must pay 5s., or if sending fifty words, , 4s. 2d., while under the clause as it stands, he will have to pay1s. l1d. for twenty-four words, or 2s. l1d. for thirty-six words. If anything, the alteration will mean an increase of revenue. The Inter-State telegram rate will be exactly double the lettergram rate. </para>

It is, after all, only a detail, but the Committee has just taken a division in an effort to reduce the charges, and now a proposal is put forward to increase them, even if only slightly. If the Government feels that the problem of the Post Office is so big that it will want more revenue in the immediate future, and if the Committee is inclined to offer the Government an increased rate, I am modest enough to accept the offer.

The Government always profess anxiety to encourage the people in the country, yet in this case they are penalizing any one who lives more than 15 miles out of the city. Surely the Minister can make the same charge to those living within the 15-mile radius as to those living outside  it? </para>

If we are to give encouragement to people to go into the country, we must provide them with cheaper telephonic and telegraphic services.

          <para>. - It is a sound principle to charge more for country telegraphic services. Certainly, it. would not be a sound policy to adopt a uniform rate when we have such long telegraph lines to maintain in districts where population is sparse. It is certain that the Department could not build telegraph lines 100 miles long to serve a few persons, and expect the whole of the capital cost to be carried by an increase in the rates paid by other people. Long country telegraph lines cost not only more for upkeep, but also for original capital expenditure. </para>

            <para>- But there are porterage charges on letters. If honorable senators want to establish a flat telegraphic rate, let them take the proper course to do it. I am not altogether in favour of conducting the Post Office on the most approved lines of private enterprise, and although no one is more anxi ous than I am to give wider scope to the control of the Department by other than politicians, my idea is that it should neither make a profit nor provide special concessions to any section of the community - that it should not&#34; be run with a benefit to the Treasury, but with magnificent benefit to the country generally. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to draw attention to the excessive use Of official telegrams between State and State and capital and capital. I do not know whether the Post Office is paid for these messages, but I assume that each Department bears the cost of the telegrams it despatches, and which my experience goes to show are all sent as urgent. During the war there may have been some excuse for officers in Melbourne to despatch long telegrams, although very often they could just as easily have been put in letter form ; but the result of their action was that year after year the regular and reasonable delivery of ordinary telegrams lodged by business people was considerably interfered with. As a matter of fact, at present, any business man who wishes to be reasonably assured that a telegram he despatches from one capital to another -will reach his client in decent time, has to pay double rates and send it as urgent. The necessity for this arises very largely from the overloading of the lines by official telegrams that could just as well be typed and sent as letters; and I think some regulation should be laid down by which officials may be prevented from adopting the easiest course, namely, that of sending telegrams, which block other messages, instead of letters which could be typed out and despatched iu the ordinary way. lt would give great relief tu the ordinary users of the lines, and to the Post Office itself, if this were done. The delays occasioned during the war through the crude habits of officials who did not know anything about business were certainly horrible. </para>
