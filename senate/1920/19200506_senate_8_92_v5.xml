                    <para>The great majority of honorable senators will, I think, recognise in this measure an old friend. It has been before this Chamber many times during the past ten or twelve years. In the first place we passed a Bill dealing generally with the navigation laws of Australia. Subsequently, as the result of the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> in 1912, consequent on a collision with an iceberg, a second Bill was passed through this Parliament, but owing to the outbreak of war it was never put into operation. Like all other countries, we have profited by the delay which has occurred, in that we have discovered the need for a number of formal or technical amendments in the Act. I am pleased to say that no great principal is involved in any of them. The main object of this measure is to &#39;give effect to the determinations of the various conventions which were held by the nations of the world soon after the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic.</inline> That vessel, it will be remembered, was deemed by its builders to be practically unsinkable. The terrible tragedy which occurred consequent upon her collision with an iceberg effectually shattered that theory, and the world has not yet been able to produce an unsinkable ship. But, as the result of that terrible tragedy various suggestions were made by the different nations, and Great Britain called a conference of the united nations for the purpose of devising the best means of preventing the recurrence of such a catastrophe, and of providing adequate facilities for the saving of human life. It will doubtless be recollected that, although the day was clear and the sea fairly calm when, the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> struck the iceberg, some 1,500 of the persons who were on board lost their lives. These lives might have been saved had proper appliances been available at the time. Under this Bill no vessel of that description will be permitted to carry passengers unless she is equipped with life-saving appliances for every one of them. The convention to which I have referred was guided by the best experts available, and their. decisions dealing with bulkheads, wireless communication, and a signalling code to indicate the position of a wreck, have been worked out in detail, arid have been accepted by the nations of the world almost unanimously. Those decisions have been embodied in this Bill, with certain limitations. For example, it will not be necessary to insist upon vessels which only travel down our bay, and which are practically in touch with land all the way, to be equipped upon as lavish a scale as deep-sea boats. But in Great Britain these decisions are to be made applicable to every vessel travelling along its coast. The. Act there has not yet been brought into operation, having been suspended during the war period. I understand,  however, that practically a measure the same as that which I am submitting for the consideration of honorable senators will be operative in Great Britain from 1st July next. The Bill provides that boats of a certain carrying capacity shall be equipped with the most up-to-date wireless apparatus. Since the Navigation Act was suspended in the Commonwealth I am glad to say that most of our up-to-date vessels have been so equipped.&#39; But this measure provides that no owner shall be able to escape that obligation. </para>
                    <para>There is another amendment to the principal Act to which I desire to direct attention. Certain powers are to be vested in the Minister to grant a permit under which ships may be released from the obligation to comply with all the conditions imposed by the Bill. It must not be forgotten that when the principal Act was- passed through this Parliament, shipping  facilities were normal, and that we were therefore able to deal effectively with vessels trading in our waters, and to adopt a somewhat independent attitude towards them. But that is not the position today, when quite one-third of the shipping, formerly upon our coast has been withdrawn. If the conditions embodied in the Bill are enforced in their entirety certain vessels have decided not to trade on the Australian coast. Some honorable senators may be disposed to say,. &#34; Very well, let them go elsewhere.&#34; But it would be fatal for us to adopt that attitude at the present time, when we do not possess the boats with which to replace them. The Government recognises, therefore, that it will be better to allow certain Eastern vessels which do not comply with these conditions to continue to trade in Australian waters during the abnormal period which now confronts us, than to entirely cut off from sea communication many of the distant parts of this continent. Vessels trading with the East have advised that if the Navigation Act in its entirety be applied to the distant ports of the Commonwealth, they will be obliged to cease calling there, and as these ports are isolated so far as coastal shipping is concerned, it has been considered advisable to give power to the Minister to issue permits exempting from the operation of the Act those vessels trading with the East, and which call at the distant ports referred to. The permits will be for a limited time only. It is expected that as soon as shipping becomes normal the Act will have general application. </para>

At present, it is a question of accepting these Eastern boats for our north-west coast and the Northern Territory, or getting no shipping at all. Most of the other provisions of the Bill are of a minor character, and may be dealt with in Committee. </para>

We no longer desire to register aliens under that Act, and therefore the regulations relating to aliens are included in. this Bill, in order to retain some control over the 72,000 persons who were registered under the War Precautions Act., We are carrying their registration forward as a matter of form, and in future they will be recorded under the provisions of this measure. The other regulations were all in operation previously, but in a few cases there has been a slight modification. The regulations are very lengthy, but if honorable senators desire any particular one to be quoted I shall be pleased to read it.

                    <para>. - Unfortunately I was not present when this measure was introduced, and I am not quite conversant with the reasons which animated the Government in bringing in a measure of this nature. Evidently it is part of the legacy we have received from the war, and it is legislation which happily has not been very freely in operation in our great Empire. I am speaking more particularly of the definition of &#34; alien.&#34; I have no intention, of making a second-reading speech at this stage, as the Chamber seems to have accepted the principle of the measure, and it has doubtless been guided by the able arguments adduced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> in moving the second reading. I think, however, that there should be some discrimination in regard to legislation affecting aliens of different races and nations, particularly in view of the fact that certain aliens were favorable to our Empire during the great struggle through which we have passed. It does not seem right that such persons should be restricted in the same way as subjects of nations who were markedly hostile to us. I certainly see nothing in this measure that makes for any co-operation between the nations which were banded together in the recent titanic conflict, or which will relieve aliens who cannot be accused of hostility from registering. I do not know if the Peace Treaty affects the situation, but we should make some discrimination between aliens favorable to the Empire and those who are hostile. To group them in a measure of this character is not an acknowledgment of the friendly offices which we experienced at their hands during the war, and which were vital to the safety of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- If there is power to discriminate, it should not be discretionary, and there should be a definition of some kind in the measure. Before the war an Englishman visiting the Continent of Europe often &#39; expressed strong disapproval of the extensive passport system that was employed, and notwithstanding the fact that we have conquered, we are now adopting the practice which in times of peace we regarded as objectionable. Some discrimination should be made between aliens who collectively proved their friendliness and aliens who were the subjects of Powers opposing us. I would like the Minister in charge of the Bill to give us some further information in regard to this matter. I do not like to move an amendment in this Chamber, constituted largely as it is of Government supporters, as it may not be particularly favorably received. But I urge upon honorable senators the necessity of considering the desirableness of making some discrimination in the direction I have indicated. </para>

                    <para>. - Perhaps I may be excused for intervening at this juncture on this question, but I desire to make some comments in consequence of our experiences during the recent war. It is quite true that Great Britain had fewer regulations of this character than possibly any other civilized country, hut any one visiting Great Britain to-day would learn that public opinion has changed. Britons now realize that they can never &#39;go back to the haphazard system previously in operation. One great difficulty experienced in Great Britain - and we had the same difficulty to some degree in Australia - was that they had no record of the aliens in their midst, whereas other countries knew exactly where they were. We had to proceed by a laborious, costly, and somewhat inefficient method of ascertaining where our aliens were located. It must be understood that this measure is not directed against the subjects of any particular country, but the war has demonstrated that every nation must endeavour to protect itself. Our Allies of today may be our enemies to-morrow. No country could be cited as more easy-going, in a sense, than the United States of America, and not only during the war; but before the United States of America entered the conflict, that country went to the extreme in this regard, and outdistanced anything that any other country had dene in regard to control of its alien population. Was it for the mere desire to interfere with the liberties of others 1 No. It was a matter of self-preservation. Notwithstanding the enormous alien population the United States of America had within her borders before she entered the war, she knew exactly where they were located, and took all the necessary measures to have them watched. </para>

                        <para>- But we had the regulations under the War Precautions Act. Surely we have to recognise that, under the present disturbed state of the world, no country can afford to go back to that free and easy style that existed before. When the world has settled down and become peaceful, we may be able to relax and throw away all these safeguards. One has only to look round the world to-day to see that, apart from the question of war and force of that kind, there is another element at work in every civilized country for the overthrow of organized society as we know it, and that this movement is largely engineered and carried on in every country by aliens. One of the weapons by which we can keep control of them, or keep an eye on them, will be the registration of aliens. Is it not the announced intention of the great Bolshevik power of Russia, by force or other means, to overthrow the other nations of the world, or their organized forms of government? Is it not a fact that that power is spending huge sums of money to send its agents all over the world? The registration of aliens is one means by which a nation can keep am eye on those people. So long as they are peaceable, and prepared to become good citizens, it is no reflection upon them, and does no harm to them to call upon them to register; but if they show themselves to be enemies, that registration! then becomes our means of defence and of preventing them from bringing about loss of life and loss of wealth to our country. </para>

I tell the Committee, as the result of what I saw during the war, and from personal experience of what is going on in this and every country around us, that if we do not &#34;arm ourselves with these powers, we shall be placing our country at a disadvantage, and depriving it of one of the best means of preventing war and disturbance. </para>

                    <para>. - Is &#39;it the intention of the Government to constitute a police force to do the work of registration, or will the task be assigned to officers of the Electoral Department, or will special officers be appointed? There is a possibility that by this clause we may be introducing an entirely new Department, with great powers. Certainly it will have a good deal of work to do for a considerable time. Although a large number of aliens were registered under the War Precautions Act, more will be coming here for a number of years, and the more people come to this country, the greater will be the activity demanded from  the officers whose task it will be to keep a complete record. If there is to be an entirely new Department, it will involve considerable expense. </para>

                <para class="block">Government to create a new Department. The work is already going on, and as I indicated previously, 72,000 aliens have already been-&#39; registered.  We do not purpose asking those people to re-register. We shall simply transfer their names from the registers made under the War Precautions Act to those created under this so-called civil law. It is intended neither to create a new Department nor to employ a new outside staff. Most of the work will be done aboard the ships, where registration will be effected by the Customs officers, who are doing the work now. After aliens have &#39;been registered on a ship, if they settle down in Australia and become naturalized, they will become ordinary citizens, but if they take up their permanent abode here and do not become naturalized, then they will be compelled to register. Probably it is not . every foreigner that will be compelled to come under that registration, while the tourist, the commercial man, and others who wish to go through the country temporarily, will be free to do so. We have, however, a right to know what the foreigner who takes up his permanent abode here without becoming naturalized is doing. We should be able to put our hands on him. The Minister has the right under this Bill to grant exemptions, and it fs possible that America, or other countries, will make a friendly international arrangement for exemption on both sides. &#39;Still, I do not know that even that would be good policy to apply indiscriminately, because some of the worst characters that have ever come to this country have been the off-scourings of other nations, kicked out of America. Although they are not <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> very large section in Australia yet, we ought to take every precaution that they do not increase here without our knowing all about them. The work of registration, instead of increasing, ought to decrease, as only those foreigners who arrive here in the future will have to be registered. </para>

A quite innocent person may render himself liable to a very severe penalty by boarding a vessel . on her arrival because there may happen to be an alien on board, though he may know nothing about it. The onus should, I think, be on the shipping people not to allow any one to go on board a ship bringing aliens to this country until they have been registered. </para>

                    <para>.   -  The honorable senator has raised an interesting point. In practice it will be found that the onus will -be thrown on the shipping people. It is a fairly common, thing when a vessel arrives, and the gangways are let down, for people to go on board, and, should the vessel have aliens on board, such persons would not be at all likely to be penalized, whilst the master of the ship certainly would be. The usual practice is for the officer carrying out this work to board a vessel prior to any facilities being afforded to the general public to. board her. If an individual jumped into the water and swam to a vessel to board her, his action, would immediately suggest a motive to evade the law. In practice, the ordinary citizen will probably not be able to get on board a vessel until the registration of any aliens on board has been completed, probably by an officer who will have boarded the vessel long before she has reached the wharf. This class of work has been carried out under the &#34;War Precautions Act, and I have not heard of a single case of inconvenience to innocent persons as a result. We must have complete power to deal with persons who would board a vessel for the purpose of evading the law, or enabling some other person to evade it. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the Minister&#39;s explanation, I cannot see what purpose this clause serves. It provides for the punishment of persons who go on board a vessel before certain things are done, and the Minister tells us that no one is allowed to go on board a vessel until they have been done. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell</inline> that noone can know whether there are aliens on board a vessel or not, nor will a person desiring to board a vessel at once on her arrival know whether he has been preceded by an officer under this Bill, and that that officer has secured the . registration of any aliens who may be on board. It seems to me that the clause is quite unnecessary. </para>

The police and Customs officers of Australia have a reputation all over the world for courtesy and politeness in the performance of duties of this kind, and they are not likely, upon being invested with this power, to abuse it in dealing with ordinary citizens. </para>

                    <para>. -  Unquestionably the man who forces himself on board a vessel upon her arrival, or who gets into a small boat in order to board a vessel, will not be acting innocently, and should be dealt with under this clause. It is quite a common thing&#39; for men to force themselves on board vessels at Fremantle, and ships often carry more passengers leaving that port than they had when arriving at it. This clause will not in any way affect law-abiding citizens who board vessels on their arrival without intention to do any wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> believes that the onus of preventing persons boarding a vessel until the registration of aliens on board has been completed should be thrown on the ship&#39;s master, or shipping company. I may tell him that the regulations will probably provide that the ship&#39;s master shall have a list of aliens on board the vessel prepared for the Commonwealth officer acting under this Bill. If any person is anxious to get an alien quickly off a boat before he is registered, and because he may have some criminal record in another country, that person should certainly be liable to punishment for breaking the law. I have said I have no objection to the use of the word &#34;wilfully,&#34; but it is a very difficult matter to prove wilful intention to do wrong, and I feel sure that in actual operation it will be found that the clause will do no injury to innocent persons. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but under this clause any one apparently may be suspected of being a criminal, and asked to allow a print of his fingers and thumbs to be taken. I would like the Minister to say whether a similar provision is in operation in any other part of the world. I have not heard of this being done in any civilized country. The alien will have to write his or her signature, and will have passports examined in other parts of the world, and I therefore do not think that this drastic provision is necessary. If the Minister is able to give reasons to show that such a provision is necessary to keep out criminals, I shall have to withdraw my objection, but  I  do not know of any good reason for it, and I should like especially to know whether what is proposed is done, in any other part of the world? </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but it is very helpful in dealing with criminals to be able to exchange with the authorities in other parts of the world copies of the thumb prints of notorious criminals. If we get the information, for instance, that a man on board a certain vessel coming to Australia is suspected of being a notorious criminal, it is not an unreasonable thing for us to take his thumb print when he arrives here. This provision will not apply to the ordinary citizen- Another phase of the question is that, to Europeans, all Chinese and people of other Eastern races appear to be very much alike, and this would be a convenient means of distinguishing between them. It has been known for many years that Chinese have returned to China and other Chinamen have come to Australia on their passports. We should have a perfect record of aliens landing in this country if their thumb prints were taken. This provision is not at all likely to be abused, though, of course, I know that any law may be abused. </para>

We have had no information given to justify the. passing of such a very drastic provision, and I therefore think that the words and to allow a print of  hi3  fingers and thumb, or any of them, to be taken on any form or other document should be left out. During the war a great deal of drastic legislation was necessary, but I do not believe that it is wise to continue the operation  of  the War Precautions Act  in  this form. We have  no  information that any considerable number of criminals are likely to come  to  this country. </para>

It is exceedingly offensive to many people to have a policeman demand from them a print of their thumbs. The war is over, and the necessity for much of this legislation ceased with the war. Probably the measure will never be utilized, except for the purpose of securing records. Only a very limited number of people coming to Australia are likely to be dangerous to this community. In view of the objection which will be raised to it by persons who may desire to enter Australia and remain here as citizens, it will be wise for us to strike out the latter portion of this clause.

                    <para>. - Under clause  6,  every child of an alien resident in the Commonwealth will be required, upon attaining the age of sixteen years, to register as an alien, and there is nothing in the measure to show that such a child&#39;s finger prints shall not be taken. The Bill covers all persons entering the Commonwealth who are not of British origin, and also their children when they attain the age of sixteen years. It must not be forgotten, too,  that the  same officer will not always administer the Act. Yet it is proposed that thumb prints shall be regarded as conclusive evidence of the identity of an alien, even although such prints in relation to  -a  criminal are not so regarded by  a  Court of law. I fear that the clause will be productive of much irritation,  without  furnishing the conclusive proof of identity which is necessary. For example,  a  criminal desirous of entering the Commonwealth, could, shortly before his arrival in Australia, use a piece of pumice stone on his thumbs, so that the imprint would not be a good one.  We  have  not  yet reached the stage when such a  provision  as is embodied in this clause  is  needed. Under the criminal law we deal with individuals not because they are foreigners, but because they are criminals. A man who comes from Norway  is  an alien; but, because of that, ought we to treat him as a criminal? </para>

                    <para>. -  Judging by the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Senior,</inline> one would imagine that under this Bill we intend that officers shall board a boat upon her arrival in Australia and say, &#34; I think that this man or that man is a criminal, and that his finger prints should, therefore, be taken.&#34; That is not the way in which the measure will be administered. As a rule, officers do not- take action without definite evidence upon which to base their suspicion. &#39; To imagine a Customs officer going down to a vessel and saying to an ordinary, well-behaved American or Norwegian, &#34; Come on, I suspect you to be a criminal, and therefore I intend to take your finger prints,&#34; is simply ridiculous. It imposes too big a tax upon one&#39;s credulity. But where a man is fleeing from justice upon a forged passport, obviously we ought to have the power to arrest him. Otherwise, it would be better to have no law at all upon the subject. We wish to have the power to deal with spies and criminals who desire to come here. At the present time, there are not many of that class in Australia, and thank God for it. We do not want them. But to-day every  country in the world is legislating to exclude this type of immigrant. The Industrial Workers of the World men, for example, who are being pushed out of America and Canada-, are naturally looking round for the best country to which they may go. These men have actually tried to enter Australia in limited numbers. Are we to welcome them ? If a man is a criminal, it ought to be an obligation on the part of his own country to keep him there. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> wishes to offer him asylum here. I had hoped that the world had advanced beyond the stage when legislation of this kind would be required. But from the experience through which we have passed, we know that if Australia is not protected during the next ten years, she will be faced with serious peril because of the influx of undesirable aliens. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has referred to the necessity, under this Bill, for a child of an alien resident in the Commonwealth to register upon attaining the age of sixteen years. A lad of alien parents who enters the Commonwealth at fourteen years of age is not required to register; but the moment he reaches sixteen years of age he is obliged to register. Why? Because he is a man. We all know that boys of sixteen years of age were heroes during the late war. If the son of an alien resident in the Commonwealth registers at sixteen years of age, there will be no trouble whatever, because he will have obeyed the law; . but if he refuses to register, we must have power to compel him to do so. I ask honorable senators to remember that we are living in a British country, and that Australian and British officers will administer this measure at most of our ports. As a matter of fact, more consideration has been extended by those officers to persons whose cases were on- the border-line than would be extended to them by any other country in the world. From the standpoint of the courtesy which they exhibit to persons entering the Commonwealth, our officers are almost perfection. They are well-behaved, tactful, and resourceful. They perform many acts of kindness to the travelling public, and may safely be trusted to exercise these powers in a reasonable way. </para>

                    <para>. -  Tourists properly credentialled - I have in mind business men and visitors - will experience no difficulty at all. After registering on board, the incoming vessel prior to disembarkation, they will be able to travel without restrictions. But if an alien makes Australia his .permanent place of abode, and does not become naturalized, he must register, and if he wishes to change his permanent address he must re-register in much the same manner as electors are required to re-register on our electoral rolls when they change their permanent address. This procedure is necessary in order to have a complete record of aliens in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no hesitation in expressing my disapproval of this clause, which, in my opinion, is wholly unnecessary. While  a  case may be made out for the introduction of such a measure as this, I look at it askance, for the simple reason that the British Empire deservedly enjoys  a  very high reputation for having dispensed with legislation of this kind and the passport system, and has come through her recent difficulties quite as satisfactorily as any of those other nations which set such great value upon this system of registration. My concern in regard to one feature of the measure was for those who may be termed friendly aliens - the people of those countries that were allied with us during the recent war ; but as the Senate was not with me, I did not pursue my effort to discriminate between them and enemy aliens. My concern now is for a very deserving class of Australians. I refer to those who cater for the entertainment and refreshment of the general public. I want to know why hotelkeepers and lodging-house keepers should be put to all the trouble of ascertaining the nationality of every man who seeks accommodation. The clause is quite superfluous, and, I think, unworkable. </para>

                <para class="block">It appears, therefore, that it will be the duty of everybody who stays at an hotel or lodging-house to give certain information and apprise the landlord of the fact that he is not an alien. It may be said that most of the aliens in Australia  aTe  Eastern Asiatics or of the Caucasian race. And the real trouble is not likely to be with aliens who are not of the Caucasian race, but probably with aliens of that race who are highly educated and able to speak our language without any trace of a foreign accent. If these men come to Australia and run the gauntlet of our Customs and registration officers they will not go to the hotels and public establishments, but to certain private boarding-houses, where they will be in collusion with friends of their own nationality, who will always be .prepared to give them all the shelter that is necessary. The first thing that happens in framing our Australian enactments seems to -be the placing of an onerous duty on keepers of hotels &#39; or boarding and lodging-houses. Happily we are in a position of &#39;being an insular Dominion, and, extensive though it is, it is encompassed with what I hope will always be an inviolate sea. If we can keep these people out of our ports as the result of an examination by Customs House and registration officers, well and good. But if incoming aliens on board a vessel are closely examined and run the gauntlet, it is too much to expect an unfortunate hotelkeeper to be the discriminating factor. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it would. The keeper of such an establishment as I have mentioned has not time, in a rush of business, to make full inquiries into the nationality of his customers, and if he did so, his action would be resented by 99 per cent. of Australian travellers. Is he going to make such personal inquiries as those embodied in the Bill and demand their nationality, date of arrival, date of departure, and their destination after leaving his premises? I feel sure in regard to this clause that in opposing it I will have the support of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. - As has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> this clause, is entirely unnecessary. The class of aliens whose movements we desire to record are not likely togo to an hotel or a lodging-house. The Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has already stated that undesirable aliens are clever individuals, and are difficult to catch, and if this provision becomes law it will be found that such persons will not seek accommodation at public boarding establishments, but will secure accommodation with their friends. The proposed legislation would cause a tremendous lot of inconvenience to the travelling public, but it would not have the desired effect. If an undesirable alien were to temporarily reside at an hotel, I do not think there would be the slightest chance of him recording his proper name. </para>

                        <para>- It is only natural that in many cases he would give a false name. I do not think the clause is of any use, and if it becomes law it will be abused. I have no objection to obeying the laws of the land at the request of Government officers, but I take strong exception to ordinary citizens having governmental powers delegated to them. There are good, bad, and indifferent hotelkeepers, and some might make it particularly objectionable to travellers if they were in possession of such extensive authority. I hope the Minister will not endeavour to pass this clause, because it would not be of any use, seeing that the class of people whom the Government desire to register would have every opportunity of evading its provisions. </para>

The percentage of incoming aliens who could be classed as undesirable must also be small. Those who are undesirable - those whom it would be necessary to keep some record of - would elude&#39; the provisions of this clause,, and would conceal their identity as much as possible. It is not to be supposed for a moment that they would give true and full information when demanded by an hotelkeeper, as it would be an easy matter for them to give a wrong name, or incorrect information as to the date of arrival and departure and probable destination. Whilst the war was in progress some such provision as this was in force in the United Kingdom. </para>

And those of us who were in Great Britain during the war know that, in going from an hotel in one place to an hotel in another, the keepers of such establishments were compelled to provide some such particulars as are required under this provision. The position was that as soon as a person desired to register, he was handed a slip which he had to fill in, but how it was filled in the proprietor of an hotel did not care in the least. In some instances, a boarder would be supplied with a printed slip when he desired to register, and, in some cases, it would be awaiting him when his room had been allotted. Whether the slips left in boarders&#39; rooms were returned, I do not know, but, at any rate, the proprietors of such establishments did not care what they contained. Under such circumstances, what is to be expected ? The whole procedure is valueless. What does this clause provide? It does not confine the obligation to the hotelkeeper, but also includes boarding housekeepers and lodginghouse-keepers. Sub-clauses 5 and 6 provide - </para>

                <para class="block">In Melbourne, Sydney, and elsewhere, there is a great tendency for people to live in flats, and such persons either rent furnished or unfurnished rooms in a building. It is proposed to ask the owners of these buildings to keep a register of the name, nationality, date of arrival, previous place of abode, if arrived by vessel the name of the vessel, date of departure, &#38;c, of persons desiring to secure accommodation. Whatever facilities may be provided in an . hotel in the way of an office for attending to the location of rooms, and for arranging for the disposition of a vacated room, we know that, in practice, boarding and lodging housekeepers, and the owners of flats, have no facilities of that character. We know from practical experience that the owners of hotels with the facilities they have for carrying out a provision of this kind faithfully and honestly endeavour to comply with the law. But what could we expect from others ? This would be a burdensome provision, and it would impose the obligation on such persons to act as detectives when there is reason to suspect that incoming aliens are undesirable, when, after all, the percentage that may be so regarded is exceptionally small. We cannot &#34; track &#34; down such people by a provision of this nature, as the persons we desire to have registered will take good care that their movements are not followed. They will be too elusive to come under such a provision, and it will merely be a matter of beating the air, and imposing a great burden upon hotelkeepers, and those conducting boarding and lodginghouses and flats. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it will be applied in that way, but it certainly will affect every person who has a name which hotelkeepers and others suspect as being foreign. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has stated that there are 74,000 aliens in the Commonwealth, but he must remember that there is a much larger number than that who bear foreign names, or names which may reasonably be suspected of being foreign. The clause in its present form would impose an indignity upon a great many loyal citizens of the Commonwealth, many of whom played their part in the recent war. There are many names which Appear foreign, but which we know have been British for centuries, and hundreds of thousands of loyal citizens to whom this clause would apply would very naturally resent the action of hotelkeepers in this regard. The clause will serve no good purpose. In fact, it will not serve any purpose at all, unless a considerable staff is maintained at some central office, to which all the lists will have to be sent at stated intervals by hotelkeepers and others. It will then be necessary for the lists to be analyzed and recorded. </para>

                    <para>. -  Although the criticism of the clause has been very severe, I do not think it will cause so much trouble as has been predicted. One would think that honorable senators shared the popular impression that officers carrying out public duties went round Australia with a hammer, with the intention of hitting people on the head with it. There is a basic principle behind this Bill. Either we want to register aliens or we do not. If we do, they must be followed irrespective of where they lodge. The tourist and commercial man will be given permits, and these provisions will apply only to that class of foreigner who wants to live  here but not to become a naturalized Australian citizen. There is reasonable ground for suspecting the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of such a person. If a man has a big business, and, for some special reason which is acceptable to the Minister, does not desire to become naturalized, he gets an exemption. </para>

                        <para>- I do &#34;not think there is any objection to a Norwegian or an American becoming naturalized, but there are other aliens who apparently, no matter how long they live here, never wish to become citizens of Australia, and only do so for specific reasons connected with the transfer of property, or, in some cases, in order to draw old-age pensions. It is stretching the meaning of sub-clause 3 to say that &#34; every person, &#34; WilD stays at an hotel must furnish these particulars. - It simply means that a publican, may put certain questions to any person who, he thinks, is an alien. A man may come to a publican, and in a  gutteral  voice assert that his name is Charles Brown, although there is no doubt about him being a German,. No publican who keeps a decent place will insult a traveller who is evidently of British extraction by asking him these questions. I candidly admit that if hotelkeepers are not sensible business people, they will be able to do the things which have been insinuated, but if we want a correct record of aliens in Australia, it is necessary to have some such provision. I am not enthusiastic about this class of legislation, but we must consider the position of Australiaduring the next few years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> claimed that &#39;Great Britain did not tolerate such restrictive laws. Undoubtedly before the war it was our boast that Great Britain was an asylum of peace and industry which welcomed every political revolutionary and reformer from other parts of the world, but experience during  the war proved that those people had another job in hand when they went to Great Britain. I am not sure that many thousands of such foreigners were not privately subsidized by Governments that desired to bleed the very heart of the Empire. I have here a copy of what is the law in Great Britain to-day, and our Bill is practically an exact replica of it in all particulars. I can show it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> so that he may estimate the &#34; freedom &#34; which the Old Country is now conferring on foreigners. It is headed &#34;Aliens Order 1919,&#34; and is dated 18th August, 1919. It was, therefore, passed after the armistice, and not during any war panic. </para>

                        <para>- You do not offend a man by asking his name. The publican is not expected to get every detail correct.  His  duty is honestly to endeavour to get the information. We in this country, although part of the British Empire, have not had the same trouble as has been experienced in Britain; but, as part of the Empire, we have accepted equal responsibilities with the British Government in dealing with aliens, and we should carry out our part. The policy of the British Government is not total exclusion of aliens for all time, but the taking of precautions dictated by experience. We should take similar care, until the world becomes normal. This sort of legislation will probably die in a few years, but we do not know what may happen in the near future, and we should follow the example of Britain, which has passed this legislation, probably more as a war measure than as a civil measure, not for the purpose of stimulating war, but rather to prevent it. I know the sentiment we in Australia have always had about these things, but the war has made us bow to the inevitable, and during the war period many of us have had to do things which we would not care to do in times of peace. We should consider carefully before we reject this provision; but I am prepared to take the voice of the Committee, and if the majority is against it, I shall have no objection to letting it go. </para>

                    <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> pointed out earlier that merchants, distinguished travellers, and other tourists would have to register only at the port of entry, but this clause makes it necessary for them to register at every hotel they go to. That will cause irritation and bad feeling among people whom we are anxious to encourage to come here from allied countries to start industries. The Minister instanced what had been done in Britain, but the conditions there are very different. It takes three weeks for a person to reach here from America, and, in fact, travellers from any other country have to be a long time on the trip. Any suspected alien would become known, and it would be very difficult for him to escape registration. In the case of the Old Country, aliens who cross the Channel in thousands are only a couple of hours on the boat, and there may be an advantage there in insisting on. registration at hotels and boarding houses. I see no good object in providing for it here. As the Minister says he will be content to take the sense of the Committee, I shall vote against the clause, which will not help us to do what we desire, that is, to exclude the undesirable foreign element from our midst. </para>

                    <para class="block">I make no apology for submitting this motion for the consideration of the Senate, but I recognise that I have undertaken a very considerable task ; and as I am not gifted with the powers of oratory of the Leader of the Government in this Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> I ask honorable senators to overlook any shortcomings of mine in recommending its approval. I have no desire to obtain notoriety, but I believe that if the burden of taxation that is weighing so heavily upon the people of Australia at the present time is to be lightened, and our war debt paid off at a reasonably early date, this can only be done by the increase of our export trade. </para>
                    <para>I have obtained from that invaluable source of information, the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s office, a number of figures giving particulars of our exports to various countries of the world. It will be necessary for me, in supporting my motion, to quote these at some length; but I need only quote the figures relating to exports similar to those which are exported from Australia at the present time, but which I hope will in the future be exported in far greater volume than at present. </para>
                    <para>If Australia is to reach that position in the commercial world which we all so much desire to see her achieve, our main objective should be to secure that her export trade shall be unhampered, and that her exports shall be sent to the markets of the world in which they are likely to secure the best prices. </para>
                    <para>It is  unnecesary  for me to refer to the fact that Australia received a wonderful advertisement during the last four or five years of war in countries where the Commonwealth was previously practically unknown. I refer particularly to those countries which were the scene of war operations during that period. If we take the ease of our wonderful ally, France, whilst Australia was practically unknown in that country previous to those four or five years, I venture to say that there is not a township or a hamlet in France to-day in which the name of Australia is not revered. As a result of the wide attention which has been drawn to Australia in other parts of the world, the way has been paved for the establishment of commercial relations between the Commonwealth and those other countries. I have no doubt that people who were witnesses of what the soldiers of Australia did during the war period will be anxious to enter into cordial commercial relations with us. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the wonderful resources of our own country we are shortly to receive mandates for new territories which, if properly administered, and their resources fully exploited, should prove valuable assets to Australia, and greatly assist us in liquidating our war debt. </para>
                    <para>I sincerely hope that in carrying on our export trade in the future we shall adopt a different principle from that adopted in the past. I hope that we shall not to so large an extent as in the past send our raw material to London, to be transferred from there to other centres, to the profit of London merchants, but that our raw material and manufactured articles will be sent direct to the various world&#39;s markets, so that the profits may go into the pockets of Australian producers. I shall not refer, as I might do in discussing this motion, to the wool agreement, but I may point out that, in connexion with wool, it is in the interests of Australian producers that they should have the best markets of the world at their disposal, and should not be under any obligation to send their wool to one particular centre. </para>
                    <para>To give some idea of the extent to which the Australian export trade has increased, I may say, taking the yearly average for a quinquennial period, that during the period 1894-1898 our exports to the United Kingdom were valued at &#163;23,610,267. In the period 1909-1913 the yearly average value had increased to &#163;34,028,258, and in 1917-18, a war year, when shipping was scarce, the value of our exports . to the United Kingdom amounted to &#163;37,637,844. </para>
                    <para>I do not think that it will be necessary to appoint a Trade Commissioner for the United Kingdom, but I do think that it is necessary that greater attention should be paid by the Australian Office in London to the commercial interests of the Commonwealth. I understand that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is on his way to London at the present time, and that one of the objects of his mission is to reorganize the High Commissioner&#39;s office. I hope that the commercial side of the work which may be performed by that office will be taken into consideration by the Treasurer when putting it upon a sounder business basis. </para>
                    <para>In the case of British Possessions outside the United Kingdom, the yearly average value of our exports for the period between 1894 and 1898 was &#163;3,000,964; for the period 1909 to 1913 it was increased to &#163;11,943,654, and for the year 1917-18 it amounted to &#163;16,381,584, an increase of nearly &#163;14,000,000 since 1898. In making a slight review of the distribution of these exports, I may inform honorable senators that our exports to India amounted in value to more than our exports to any other British Possession outside the United Kingdom. I venture to say that India is a country which offers great opportunities for the development of our export trade, especially in view of the fact that the chief exports from Australia to India have been in the nature of manufactured articles - a class of exports that we should do our best to encourage. In the period 1894-98 our annual exports to India amounted only to &#163;440,062; between 1909-13 their annual value increased to &#163;2,231,306; whilst in 1917-18 they amounted to &#163;4,507,156. Taking the year 1917-18 as a basis, let us analyze the character of these exports to India. If we do this, and keep steadily in mind the possibility of our future large trade relations with that country, the statistics which I am about to quote will prove very interesting indeed. During the year I have indicated we exported to that country commodities of the following value :- Biscuits, &#163;204,953 ; coal, &#163;16,043 ; copper ingots, &#163;595,877 ; preserved fruits, &#163;214,134; horses, &#163;479,520; hay and chaff, &#163;7,472; wheat, &#163;54,346; oatmeal, &#163;37,319; jams and jellies, &#163;250,711; leather, &#163;49,794; meats, &#163;1,242,912; piece goods, flannel, &#163;55,068 ; piece goods, other, &#163;67,S08; sandalwood, &#163;1,275; silver bullion, &#163;864,536 ; and wool, &#163;66,780. The items in that list to which I desire to direct special attention are those of preserved fruits, and jams and jellies. We are all familiar with the position which obtained recently in certain parts of Australia, so far as fruit-growing is concerned. We know that, consequent upon the glut of fruit on the local market, certain action was taken by the Victorian Government. It was pointed out on that occasion that, on account of the limited nature of that market, the growing of fruit was not always a profitable occupation, as the demand did not equal the supply. In India we have an opportunity to increase our export of preserved fruit very considerably. I believe that there are very big possibilities of commercial intercourse between Australia and India, with its teeming millions. The latter is a country in which Australia should most- certainly be represented by a Trade Commissioner. </para>
                    <para>New Zealand, during the year 1917-18, imported slightly more than &#163;4,000,000 worth of commodities from the Commonwealth. But, in view of the proximity of that Dominion, and of the fact that it is developing upon similar lines to those we are following, I do not think it is necessary for us to have a Trade Commissioner there. </para>
                    <para>The next British Possession I propose to deal with is South Africa. During the period 1894-1S98 our exports to that country amounted only to &#163;217,047. In the year before the war that increased to &#163;1,799,435, consisting principally of sheep,  butter,  dried fruits, glycerine, wheat, flour, jams and jellies, leather, machinery and manufactures of metal, preserved meats, milk and cream, soap, tallow and timber. </para>
                    <para>Coming to Canada, the position is that for the period 1894-98 our exports to it amounted only to a yearly average of &#163;32,362. In 1909-1913 they increased to an annual average of &#163;125,942, and in 19,17-18 they amounted to &#163;785,130. </para>

                    <para>I come now to Fiji. During the period 1894-98 our exports to that country amounted only to &#163;124,453; in 1909-13 they had increased to &#163;402,877, whilst in 1917-18 they totalled &#163;579,710. In view of our geographical position, the bulk of the trade done with Fiji should be Australian trade. </para>
                    <para>For the period 1894-98 we exported to Hong Kong goods to the value of &#163;414,326; for the years 1909-13 our exports were valued at &#163;741,365, and in the year 1917-18 they totalled &#163;391,525. Practically the whole of our exports to this part of the world consisted of manufactured articles - the very class of export trade that we should do most to encourage. </para>
                    <para>Having given all the large figures relating to inter-Empire trade, I shall now direct attention to our trade with foreign countries. In this connexion I wish specially to refer to two countries which were our Allies throughout the late war, and which consume considerable quantities of Australian commodities. I allude to France and Italy. </para>
                    <para>For the period 1894-98 our average annual exports to France amounted only to &#163;8,725,257; between 1909-13 they had increased to &#163;29,410,508 - an increase of &#163;21,000,000. Of course during the war years our trade with that country suffered a serious decline. The visit of the French mission to Australia is still fresh in our memories, and if there is one thing above all others which that grand old Frenchman, General  Pau,  impressed upon us, it was the need for fostering future trade relations with France. He stressed the great opportunity there was for this country and France to do business with each other. I have already pointed out that there is probably no country in the world which is more respected in France to-day than is Australia. &#39; I think, therefore, that it is absolutely essential that we should at the earliest possible moment appoint an Australian trade representative in Paris. I have no desire to appear tedious by quoting all the figures which I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician, but it is necessary that some of them should be placed upon record in order to show the magnitude and importance of the interests involved in the case I am submitting for the consideration of the Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">During 1913 the actual value of Australia&#39;s share of that &#163;97,135,701 worth of imports into France was only &#163;S,250,000. As we have an abundance of these commodities, there would be every likelihood of our trade increasing if we were represented there by a live Trade Commissioner. Not long ago Parliament adopted a motion, submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> on lines similar to the one now under consideration, for the appointment of an Australian Trade Commissioner at &#34;Washington, and the Government appointed an able Australian, who, I doubt not, has done excellent work, find the facts I have given show that a trade representative is very badly needed in France. </para>
                    <para>I turn now to Italy. Our exports to that country in 1913, totalled &#163;1,399,167, principally raw materials. It is inter  ns&#93;-  2  esting  to note that in the year 1913 the principal imports &#39;of commodities into Italy of a nature similar to those exported from Australia were - Wool, greasy, washed, and combed, over &#163;3,000,000; hides (cattle and sheep), &#163;2,600,000; leather, &#163;1,800,000; wheat, &#163;16,000,000; horses, &#163;13,600,000; .meat (fresh), &#163;400,000; meat (salted, including bacon and hams), &#163;310,000; butter, &#163;47,000; cheese, &#163;90,000; honey, &#163;6,000; lard, &#163;246,000; tallow, &#163;800,000; pearl shell, &#163;23,000; boots and shoes of leather, &#163;696,000; biscuits, &#163;7,600. I have not quoted a number of smaller items. The total imports into Italy for that year amounted to &#163;63,916,S20, and the total exports from Australia into Italy were - Raw material for industry, &#163;450,328; semi-manufactured material for industry, &#163;106,552; foodstuffs and living animals, &#163;841,497; manufactured products, &#163;790; or a total of &#163;1,399.167. </para>
                    <para>It may be argued that our cost of production precludes us from competing ic these markets, but during the past few years the whole of the industrial life of Europe has undergone a very radical change, and as ths policy of the Government is to provide every facility for the establishment of new and the encouragement to existing industries, there should  bc abundant opportunity for trade expansion in Italy as well as other countries. If the introduction of the new Tariff in another place merely insures the home market for our manufactures, we shall not have done very much. I hope the new Tariff will make it worth while for manufacturers to start new industries, and on such a scale, too, that they will be able to provide not only for local needs, but to cater for  overseas  trade, with the assistance of efficient Trade Commissioners in the various countries referred to. </para>
                    <para>I desire now to turn to another part of the world, the Near East, in which there is every prospect of considerable trade development.  Java  offers exceptional opportunities. I have had this fact brought under my notice on several occasions recently by business men who make periodical visits to that part of the world. They have asked me frequently why we are unrepresented there, and I understand that not very long ago one of the local papers commented on this fact. It  appears that owing to the absence of important information in regard to packing requirements, a large contract was recently lost to Australia. An able representative there would have been in a position to advise Australian manufacturers of the. particular requirements of the local market. The increase in . our trade with that part of the world has been so phenomenal of late that it is essential we should be represented there by a Trade Commissioner. </para>
                    <para>A great deal of information has been prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician concerning our exports to Japan and China, but it is not my intention to weary the Senate by reading it. I shall have much pleasure in placing it at the disposal of the Government should they be prepared to consider my proposal favorably.- Although we cannot hope to secure the whole of the markets in the countries I have mentioned for our products, we can, at all events, through the medium of live trade representatives, reasonably expect a substantial increase in business. </para>
                    <para>One industry, among others, that appears destined for development in this part of the world is our wine trade. Prior to the war the principal business in this product was done by European countries, but owing to shipping difficulties a considerable amount has of late been diverted to Australia, though up to the present we have not secured anything like the amount we might reasonably expect to get in view of our opportunities. An expansion of business in this particular industry will substantially benefit our schemes for soldier settlement and primary producers at present engaged in viticulture. </para>
                    <para>I will not further detain the Senate. I thank the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> for his -attention, and submit the motion with confidence that it will be acceptable to honorable senators. If Trade Commissioners are appointed, as I have suggested, we may, I am sure, look for a material increase in our export trade, and thus lighten the heavy burden of taxation at present resting on&#39; our people, and enable the Commonwealth the better to meet its war obligations. It is futile for the Government to have, as a slogan at election time, the cry for more production unless some steps are taken, as I have indicated, to insure the profitable sale of our products in the best markets of the world. </para>

                        <para>. - I second the motion, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Foll</inline> has covered the ground so ably it will not be necessary for me to speak at length in support of what is, in my opinion, a judiciously worded proposal. It will be remembered, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has said, that the Government appointed, as a variation of a motion which I submitted, a Trade Commissioner to the United States of America. The first Commissioner has returned, and he has been succeeded by a gentleman who, I believe, has very many characteristics to recommend him for the position. Therefore, this motion is an endeavour to secure an amplification of policy which has been adopted already. Quite recently Australia stepped on to the world&#39;s stage in the most unexpected manner. Through the generosity, and, I may say, the wise discernment, of the Mother Country, Australia was made one of the signatories to the Peace Treaty, being invested thereby with a kind of independence within the Empire, the proud boast of which is that the Dominions, while of their own free will attaching themselves to the Mother Country, remain self-governing but constituent parts of the Empire. It is to be regretted that we are diplomatically precluded from doing what the smallest of the independent Powers of Europe is doing. We are prevented from appointing consular agents throughout the world, and the fact that we are in the Empire and yet out of it precludes us from appointing  representatives, as is done by such countries as Holland, Portugal; and the South American Republics. Such countries as those I have mentioned have representation throughout the civilized world, but we are without it. But there is open to us, in conformity with our status in the Empire, the opportunity of doing what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has so ably suggested. It is possible for us to have trade agents, or commissioners - if they . may be so characterized - in every important country in the world where there is a possibility of increased consumption, or a market which did not previously exist, for our Australian products. I hope the point will be noted very carefully by honorable senators that Australia is a country  equally important in the eyes of the world as the Republic of Portugal, Holland, and Denmark, and one which does not suffer in comparison with Scandinavian countries; but we cannot secure for its trade such representation as is available to the other European countries I have mentioned, owing to their independence. It is not my intention to endeavour to set up an argument in support of Australian independence; but I am strongly in favour of submitting arguments in support of a policy to enable money to be made available for the Commonwealth to secure the ablest and most intelligent commercial representation in other countries of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I am a Protectionist for reasons which I shall submit to the Senate in due course. I am firmly convinced, however, that, although a policy of Free Trade may be satisfactory in scone countries, Protection is desirable in Australia. With a comparatively small population of only 5,000,000 such as we have in the Commonwealth, Protection is desirable, but because of the paucity of our population and the smallness of our home market in comparison with the markets of the world, outlets abroad must be found. Production on an economical scale nowadays has to be extensive; and if we have a Protective Tariff to encourage the establishment of industries, those industries must be economically conducted, and manufacturing industries, particularly, must te established on such a basis that Protection will result in a very large proportion of our manufactures being exported beyond Australia. Otherwise, limited production must be expensive. Some of the disadvantages - if disadvantages they be - of combating in a commercial sense our advanced Labour conditions, will be counteracted by the fact that action is being taken in other countries  of  the world to obtain similar conditions to those prevailing in Australia, so we will not have that cheap labour, which we at one time feared, to compete with. It is possible that Australia may have to indulge in the policy of &#34;dumping &#34;; but whatever merits or demerits such a policy may possess, I never fail to state the fact that perhaps we shall have to sell our surplus production of manufactured goods abroad at a price very much below that which Australian consumers will be called upon to pay. Our surplus production must be marketed elsewhere ; and we may perhaps have to reduce the price if we can show that, as a result of commercial activities, we may be induced or compelled to adopt the policy of offering Australian manufactured goods and primary products in the markets of the world at rates below those at which they are offered to Australian consumers. It may appear an anomalous position, but it is the inevitable consequence of the adoption of a policy of Protection. </para>

                    <para>A gentleman from an Asiatic country, when visiting the Commonwealth recently, requested the Government of the State of Tasmania to appoint him their agent in the East, as he evidently saw great possibilities in regard to the development of a particular trade between Australia and Eastern countries. If we take such a country as America, we find that the number of its consular agents - who&#39; are really commercial agents - throughout the world is legion. British consular agents in different countries of the world are actually trade agents, and it must be admitted that, before the war, the consuls of such countries as Germany were commercial representatives. Australian representatives abroad have not been called&#39; upon to exercise such functions, but let us at once acknowledge the fact that preparations are now being made by other countries to capture trade where valuable markets exist for such products as can be exported from Australia. German agents at the present moment are endeavouring to secure markets for the products of their country. Similar action is being taken by other countries, notably America, and a tremendous effort is being made to secure markets in countries where profitable sales can be effected. With all due respect to the Mother Country, and to the generosity 6he has shown her Dominions, we cannot&#39; expect her representatives to be active in extending our export trade. If it costs &#163;100,000 a year to effectively represent Australian commercial interests abroad, what will it matter? The expenditure of such a sum would be more than justified if, as indicated by the mover of the motion, our export trade would be increased. The way is being prepared, and it is well for us to awake. I do not intend dealing with the products likely to be consumed in overseas market, as that has already been dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> with care and ability. </para>
                    <para>When I was in China about six years ago, I noticed that in the southern provinces there was an increasing consumption of flour. The staple food in southern China has always been rice, with the exception of a little wheaten flour used for pastry ; but there is now an increased consumption of wheaten flour of a particular kind, which, I ascertained, was received from two or three firms in Vancouver and Canada. I mentioned this fact in certain quarters, as it occurred to me that, as Australia was exporting flour to Manila, there was no reason why consignments should not be shipped to China to meet the increasing demand in competition with two or three firms beyond the Pacific. Quite  recently, Chinese merchants in Australia, in conjunction with some of their compatriots in the East, established a Hue of steamers to trade between Australia and certain ports in the Chinese Republic. I was invited to a luncheon when the first vessel of the line was in port, and I noticed that the products being shipped from Melbourne to the East consisted largely of flour packed in a way that made it particularly  suitable  for the southern Chinese markets. That trade has developed extensively, and, at present, there is a large and increasing export of flour to the East. That was the first vessel of many owned by the company to leave Melbourne, and it is gratifying to know that there is every possibility of the trade developing. In such countries as China, we find American, German, French, and British trade represented, not by one consular agent, but by dozens. Every important centre in southern China has a consul, and there is an ambassador at Pekin. If we could speedily arrive at the number of foreign consular representatives in the East, it would be found that they run into hundreds, and therefore Australian people must not be alarmed if it is suggested that one or two Trade Commissioners should be appointed in countries where our manufactured goods or primary products could be profitably marketed. In such a country as China, there should be a Commissioner for the north and one for the south. The superficies of the Chinese Republic are not less than Australia or </para>
                    <para class="block">Canada, and are equal to that of the United States. There are trade openings in many directions, and all we need is satisfactory representation. </para>
                    <para>Quite recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop,</inline> a representative of Australian commercial interests in the East, returned to the Commonwealth, and, when visiting- Hobart, stated that one Chinese railway alone was anxious to place an order in Australia for, I think, 160,000 railway sleepers. At a railway station in southern China, I noticed some sleepers which I recognised as of Australian production, but which were regarded as too costly. The price of the timber, however, in other countries which have been sources of supply is no longer as cheap as formerly, and Australian timber is now in a position to compete. It is absolutely essential that we should be represented in countries where these tremendous opportunities exist, so that advantage could be taken of them to increase our exports by men alive to the commercial interests and activities of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I could debate this important question at some length, but it is unnecessary to do so, as the virtue of the policy outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> is self-evident. It is not going to be expensive if it costs Australia &#163;250,000 to establish Trade Commissioners or commercial agents in the various important consuming countries of the world where our manufactured or primary products could be profitably  disposed of. It may be said by some that we could not show a return for a year or two, but I am convinced that we could expect immediate benefits from the amplification of a policy which we have already embarked upon. Let me relate the names of two or three of the countries where ample opportunities exist for the development of Australian trade. I have done away to some extent with the belief that Australian-manufactured products may be too dear to compete in those markets, for the products of other manufacturing countries will become increasingly dear because of the increasing demands for better pay and better labour conditions made bv the proletariats of those countries. Look at the Malay Archipelago, only two or three days&#39; sail from Australia. The opportunity of supplying commodities such as European residents there require will be increasingly great. The development of the countries in the Archipelago, even at the hands of a small colonizing power like Holland,  is also going to be increasingly great. The importance of Dutch development in the Malay Archipelago increases with every hour, every day, every fortnight, and every month, and alongside that development there is an increasingly great opportunity for Australian trade. There are also the great native populations of those countries. It is contemplated, I understand, in the Tariff to put  a  heavy duty on cotton textiles, for the purpose of developing cotton textile manufacture in Australia. If we develop that industry, and go in for cotton producing, there is a market right at our doors. Every man and woman of Malay extraction, except, perhaps, those who are wealthy and wear silk, wears a cotton garment or several of them, right through the year. If Australia is going to establish the textile industry on a scale which will provide her with a surplus production - and she must establish it on that scale if she establishes it at all - she must find a market for that surplus in the near East, for that is the market most easily available to us. We shall be able there, I hope, to compete with Manchester, -and with the many other spinning and weaving populations which depend on textile industries in other parts of the world. </para>
                    <para>The main point of the argument which I advance in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> motion is that there is a fair trade between Australia and many of the countries he has named. There are ample opportunities for increasing that trade. The objection that might be raised in regard to Australian secondary products, that they will be manufactured at too high a price, will not hold good in the future, and although  we  cannot be represented, in a consular sense, by agents who are semi-diplomatic and semi-mercantile,  Tight  through the world, it is nevertheless open to us, and, in fact,  an  absolute necessity for us, to be represented in the trading world at the ports of every country where opportunity exists for the development of that trade  in  which Australia,  if  she is going to maintain her status as a civilized country, must have a share. Judging from the enthusiasm with which the present Australian Trade Commissioner was welcomed in America, as well <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> the kindness shown to his predecessor, the step taken by the Commonwealth Government was hailed by  the  American commercial community with great delight. They evidently anticipate that the efforts of Australia and America, followed by reciprocal trade of an ever increasing volume, will be profitable not only to us, but to themselves, as trade in its best sense&#39; should be, for trade, to be satisfactory, must be satisfactory to both the buyer and the seller. I hope that honorable senators and the Ministry will give consideration to the motion  so  ably submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> A great deal can be done, and a great deal must be done. Australian commercial men will, I know, show initiative in these matters, but let us remember that Germany, the  Greatest  trade rival&#34; that ever existed to the British Empire, did not content herself with the efforts of her private manufacturers alone. Her Government, through scientific agencies, through banking agencies, and through shipping agencies, aided the expansion of German trade, so that it became what it undoubtedly was - the remarkable development of only a few decades. Let Australia remember that although she owes much to the initiative of her commercial community and will owe  a  great deal more, nevertheless the efforts of that community can be intelligently directed and pioneered by  a  wise Government appointment of Commissioners who will exercise the functions of those trading and consular agents who represent every European country of importance in the markets of the world. </para>
