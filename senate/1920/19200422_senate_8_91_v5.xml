                        <para>- I -wish to ask the Minister for Defence what arrangements have been made concerning the graves of Australian soldiers in France? A circular has been sent out, signed by the Minister, that if it is desired to add additional words to inscriptions on the monuments over soldiers&#39; graves, the relatives of the deceased soldiers must pay for them. Does the Minister consider that it is fair to men who have died in the interests of this country that relatives should have to pay for the inscription of additional words on their headstones? </para>

                            <para>Arbitration Court decisions can hardly be applied in the case of the permanent Military Forces, for the reason that a soldier receives many concessions which affect the cost of living and which a civilian normally has to provide for himself. For instance - soldiers, their wives and children, receive medical attendance, including the supply of medicine, free. Again, married members, of the Royal Australian Artillery, Royal Australian Engineers, Sc., who are in occupation of Government quarters receive also fuel and light, and foi these services a deduction of 10 per cent, &#39;is made from their pay. In the case of a gunner or private, this deduction would amount to six shillings per week. </para>

                <para class="block">There are a number of men who performed very valuable work in the interests of their country and who incurred as great a risk as any fighting man. I am referring to those who performed Y.M.C.A. work on the battlefields in the fighting zones. There were, I understand, about  200  of these men, sixty-seven of whom were detailed to work with battle units. During the time their unit was under fire they incurred as great a risk as the soldiers with whom they were working. They had to obey the orders of the military officers, but they did not possess any of the privileges enjoyed by the fighting men, who received deferred pay and various other concessions. They took the same risks, but when they returned to Australia they did not receive monetary privileges of any kind in the form of sustenance allowances, or even a suit of civilian clothes. Many of them vacated good positions, which they found impossible to regain on their return to Australia. I have been informed by the highest military authorities - and they should know the service these men rendered - that they are strongly in favour of the Government acceding to the request I am making. The amendment will apply to only sixty-seven of the total number of men who were so engaged. I understand that some of them are finding it difficult to become reestablished in civil life. Three of these Y.M.C.A. officers were killed and fifteen were wounded, and that is surely evidence of the fact that they experienced the same dangers as the fighting men. I believe the authorities have already recognised their services, as sixty-seven have been granted war medals identical to those worn by &#39;the fighting men. </para>

                        <para>- No, they were members of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association staff, and it is generally recognised that they performed very necessary work. The fact that they have been granted medals is sufficient to show that they rendered very useful service, and it is extraordinary if there should be any objection on the part of the Government to granting such a reasonable request. If a man risks his life for his country he should be entitled to the privileges enjoyed by others who take similar risks. I cannot understand why they have not been included in the Bill, and can only assume that proper representations have not been made on their behalf. I know the Government had difficulty in deciding where to draw the line, but I cannot imagine that any reasonable excuse can be given for the exclusion of these men. I do not, therefore. anticipate any objection to the amendment. </para>

                        is wrong in assuming that this matter was- not considered by the Government. Representations were made to the* Government, and- the matter was fully considered. I am not going to say a word in&#62; derogation of the splendid services rendered by the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association. There were 206 representatives sent abroad. In Prance five were attached to each division, practically one for each Brigade Headquarters, one to tha Artillery Headquarters and- other arms, and one to Divisional Head-quarters As there were five divisions that would make twenty-five at a time, but with reliefs there may have been sixty-seven employed altogether. It can be said that they were more or less employed in battle areas,, but it must be remembered that whilst* it may be claimed that they were attached to a battle unit at Divisional Head quarters, t:ho3e Divisional Headquarters would be well away in the back areas,, although they were certainly under shell fire a.t times and possibly also subject to bombing; by aeroplanes.

                        <para>- They were granted Honorary commissions to give them a status because- they had to deal with, military officers, but they were not enlisted. In Egypt one was attached&#39; to each brigade&#34; for&#39; a period not exceeding&#39;  three  months. Honorable senators- will see what a difference there was between them and the ordinary soldiers. Seventy were employed in this capacity altogether. The total casualties were three killed, ten. wounded and ten died from other causes than battle casualties. Altogether 110 were granted the relative and honorary rank of officers, but many of these were employed at the bases and im England. With regard to the statement that representatives of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association acted as stretcher bearers, it is quite possible that individuals on occasions did do so, but, it must not he thought that in this capacity any individual of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association was expected to, or did, go &#34;over the top &#34; in an attack. I have obtained these particulars from an officer who was himself in the battle line, and he tells me that on occasions- he has seen not only members of the Young  Men&#39;sChristian  Association, but the cooks and. batmen, act as stretcher bearers, and that he- himself has so acted, when a casualty occurred ki. the back- areas from a- shell or bombs. No doubt there have been occasions when the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association representatives have undertaken the task, but it must not be assumed  from this  thats they were  expected  to do it, or that it was part of their duties, or that they were recognised as stretcher- bearers. There are recognised stretcher- bearers in every Army Medical Corps Unit and- detail, whose duty it is-&#39; to go &#34;over the. top&#34; with the troop* in an attack, to pick up the wounded&#39;, and in some cases to go out into- &#34;na man&#39;s laud &#34; for that purpose. This was not part of the duties of the members of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association, nor did mv informant know of any occasion when it was done by. Young Men&#39;s Christian Association representatives. </para>

                        <para>- It might apply tff anybody. We could not justify the inclusion o&#163; the Young. Men&#39;s Christian? Association in the benefits of the war gratuity without also including- the Red Cross workers and those who represented) the Australian Comforts Fund.&#39; There is this point to- be borne in mind : that all those people- were employed without any financial liability to the Commonwealth Government. The Red Cross workers and the Comforts Fund representatives, generally speaking, served their organizations in an honorary capacity, but I am informed that the Young- Men&#39;s Christian, Association representatives received pay from their association, so that, on the  ground  of what they have received, the Comforts Fund men and the Red Cross workers have an even stronger claim than the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association men to inclusion. </para>

                <para class="block">Similar conditions applied to the representatives of the Comforts Funds and the Red Cross, so that they and every Young Men&#39;s Christian Association representative left Australia on that distinct understanding. This gratuity is a gift from the people through the Parliament and the Government to the fighting Forces of the nation. These are the noncombatant Forces, and the Government felt, in considering the matter, that they were not entitled to the benefits of this measure. Another practical difficulty in complying with the amendment, as it has been moved, is that, as has been pointed out here, a man may have been attached to a battle unit, and yet have taken no more risk than if he were in England, because some of the battle units may have had their head-quarters away back on the English Channel, and quite outside the actual fighting area, except so far as they could be reached by bombs from aeroplanes. The amendment is so widely drawn that it would include not only the Red Cross, the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association and the Comforts Fund, but also persons such as the members of the Federal Parliament who visited the Front and came under fire. </para>

                        <para>- No, except after they had long been vacated. I am happy to say that the battles were well over before I got there. I seriously believe that the amendment would include every person who went to the battle line during the progress of the war, because every such person was attached for the time of his visit to a battle unit. I hope that the Committee will not agree to the proposed extension of the clause. Again I desire to stress the point that if the amendment be adopted it will be difficult to see where we can stop, and how many men we should have to include within the four corners of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has urged, as one of the grounds for his claim, that some of these men are in necessitous circumstances by reason of the sacrifices which they made in proceeding to the war zone. That may be a fact, but it is rather an argument upon which to base a claim to the Repatriation Department for assistance to rehabilitate themselves in the civil life of the community. It is certainly not an argument in favour of the granting of a war gratuity. We all know that towards the end of the war all sorts of persons were attached to battle units. Let me give a few instances. Press correspondents who were not official war correspondents frequently went to France and were attached to Australian battle units for various periods. Artists went there for the purpose of painting battle scenes, some of which will ultimately  find a place in our war museums. Official photographers were there to take photographs of actual battle scenes, and, as a matter of fact, did take such photographs from the front line. I have seen films taken by Australian official photographers in which one could see (the shells exploding within a short distance of where the photograph was being taken. It is obvious, therefore, that there is a very wide range of persons who actually came under fire other than those specified in the amendment. Consequently, I ask the Committee not to accept it. </para>

                    <para>- Because he has moved the request with that object. The Minister himself has admitted that of these 67 men, three were killed and fifteen were wounded. If the argument of the honorable gentleman is to carry any weight, and if these men are to be denied consideration because their inclusion would open the door to the claims of others, by all means let us have a clear-cut issue limited to these 67 men. The Minister has stressed the fact that they could not be enlisted for health reasons, and that each of them had to sign a statement that the Government were not responsible for him. Need <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> remind the Minister that this Bill clearly lays it down that no soldier has any rightto&#39; the gratuity ? That is a gift of the nation. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has put forward a claim that this Committee should recognise the work of these 67 men who were attached to the battle units, and who accompanied those units when they were under fire. Let this matter be decided upon its merits. Last night </para>

                <para>I referred to a distinguished Australian officer who had used the term, &#34; brave as a stretcher-bearer.&#34; I may as well mention his name now - it was Surgeon-General Howse. His remark struck me as being a tribute to our stretcher-bearers, and one to which too much publicity could not be given. Let us upon this occasion have a clear-cut issue as to whether these 67 men, some of whom were unable to enlist because of their  health,  should not be eligible to receive this gratuity. Of course, it was very amusing for the Minister to point out that certain members of this Parliament got to the front line on the battlefields of France, and that one of them - I presume he referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie - actually  fired a French .75 light field gun. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> too, in the early stages of the war, did exceedingly good Red Cross work, so I suppose that he also should be included. However, I have no desire to debate the subject in a facetious manner. The matter is a serious one. Here are 67 men who, their associates say, were continually under fire with their battle units, and who, I believe, are entitled to this gift by the nation. The adoption of the amendment will not add to the total amount involved in the payment of the gratuity bv more than &#163;6,000. If the fact that they served with their units under fire, that some of them were killed, whilst others were wounded, is not a justification for their inclusion within this clause, I do not know what is. I believe that the phrase &#34;brave as a stretcher-bearer&#34; will become a household one throughout Australia, and with the object of doing these men only a bare measure of justice I intend to support the amendment. </para>

I am satisfied that the claim for the inclusion of the Naval Reserve men, members of the Australian Garrison Artillery, and those members of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association to whom reference has just been made, is stronger than that of the men who merely went into camp. However, the Bill has passed, and the Government and their supporters must take full responsibility for their action. </para>

                            <para>- I know the Senate is secure for a good while yet, but if there is another general or a byelection for members of another place, we shall have the sorry spectacle of large bodies of men playing a prominent part in it. No man will regret that more than I, but if the Government and their supporters had taken their courage in both hands, and despite the financial strain which it might have involved, had arranged to pay the gratuity in cash, it would have been much better for the country and our returned soldiers. A contentious question has been introduced into the public life of this country, and no matter how much we may desire to keep it out, it will present a serious obstacle to our securing the real will of the majority upon any question of pressing importance submitted to the electors. Taking that view during the consideration of this Bill, I endeavoured to have the line drawn so that there should not be in this community any one section of men who offered to serve, did serve, or were willing to serve, in a position to say to another section included in the measure that though they had a better right to inclusion, they yet were excluded. I have tried during the passage of the Bill to remove those distinctions which make it obvious that injustice is perpetrated under the measure. The Government and their majority have thought otherwise. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> should specially provide for the cold-footers whom he is always talking about. I, as an Australian, am more than satisfied with the response of Australia in connexion with the war, and, in my view, the man who blatantly talks about cold-footers is indirectly doing this country a great injustice. Australia  stand&#39;s first in the sacrifices she has made, and bears very favorable comparison  with  any other country engaged in the war. The  much-talked-of  cold-footers exist chiefly in the- imagination of men who used tie war sentiment in a way so discreditable to them that I do not know what, will become of them when the. war sentiment ceases to be a paying- political principle. </para>

                    <para>But I: am discussing the third reading of a Bill in the consideration of&#39; which an opportunity was afforded to this Parliament to lift the gratuity out of the position of being a bribe paid for votes, and to remove it from consideration in the public life of this country. I regret, that it is still there. I regret that because of the decisions of the Government it will remain there until after the next, election anyhow, and that at every byelection between the present time and the next general election we shall have this question coming up to influence voters. That might have been avoided if the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government had *h&#39;ad sufficient courage: capacity, and foresight to say, &#34;Here is a.- large body of. most deserving men in. this country who gave their services- to the country, and to whom we made the promise that the nation would- grant them a gratuity, not as a right, but as- a&#39; gift in recognition of their services, and we. shall give effect to that promise.&#34; So. far from doing, that, the. Government, shirked their responsibility to say: to those men who - made much money, during, the war, to. those who, by profiteering, made huge fortunes, and used war conditions to&#62; make money, &#34;Here is an- opportunity for you people who were preserving&#39; your businesses, and used your opportunities, during the war to make huge fortunes,, to supply the money to pay the nation&#39;s.gift.&#34; To my mind one- of the most discreditable features: of civilization - and. I do&#34; not now speak , of our. own. country alone&#39; - is: that when millions of&#39; men flocked, to the standard of the different na-tions, and offered, their lives, if&#34; need, be&#34;, as sacrifices&#39; in: the interests of their, countries, these harpies- in the big  business houses, and the men behind the big financial schemes of this and other, countries, used their position to- make money out of the want and- suffering of. the wives and- children of the men who were fighting. The Government had an opportunity to deal with these people, but it is not profitable for them to offend their friends. They know that - they are supported in their election campaign by this class, and that it is from these people- - they derive their political funds-. The Government, with their &#39;  well-organized party  - and I do- not blame them for their organization, as I should like myself to be a member of a Government with such an organization - say that the line&#39; drawn by them is to be the line adopted, . and the Senate has no right to alter it, to- make it more elastic, to slacken it in. one place and tighten it in another. No matter iIi. what direction amendments, were moved, they were met in the same* spirit by the Government, and. the majority in- another place, as well as in the Senate!,, acted accordingly. </para>
                    <para>I am not here to lecture honorable senators opposite, nor shall I.- try to do so. . But I do say that so far as our finances are concerned, there is sufficient wealth in this country, if the Government had been willing, to have enabled them to pay this gratuity in cash. This is the last opportunity I have to enter my protest against this Bill. I do enter it as the protest of a man who feels most keenly about the manner in which the Government have permitted the debate on this measure to proceed. It has been a one-sided debate all through, and no matter how deserving may have been the claims of persons sought to be included in the measure by amendments submitted, those amendments were at once squelched by the organized Government majority. I object to this measure going through in its present form, and I enter my protest, here and now, against the way in which the Government and their supporters have so unjustly and unfairly treated sections of our men who did volunteer for service, whose time was occupied by the Government, who were willing to go to the Front, and whose services were given to the State, and particularly the large section, concerning whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> submitted an amendment, many of whose members offered themselves for service, and some of whom were killed. I have nothing further to say. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not want to delay the passage of the Bill, but I wish to say a few words in reply to &#39;the charge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that the payment of the war gratuity was used by the party on this side as a bribe to secure votes at the last general election. It is a well-known fact, as the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has already stated, that the payment of a war gratuity was under consideration by the Government many months before the election was thought of. Negotiations with representatives of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League had been commenced long before the election loomed in sight. It is well known, also, that practically the final arrangements for the gratuity and the terms upon which it was to be paid were fixed up long before there was any talk of the election. It was not honorable senators on this side who made the payment of the gratuity an election cry, but honorable senators opposite who, in an endeavour to gain votes at the expense of the party on this side, tried to outbid the National party for the soldiers&#39; votes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and his party saw an opportunity to offer a sop for the votes of the returned soldiers, and they immediately endeavoured to go one better than the National party. They told the electors that long before the election the National party promised that, if they were returned, a gratuity would be paid to the returned soldiers in bonds, but that they would go one better and pay the gratuity in cash if the soldiers would give them their votes. Why did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and his party, during the many months they were in opposition before the elections came on, advocate something in the nature of a war gratuity ? We never heard one honorable senator on the other side say a word about the payment of a war gratuity. If they were so anxious that the returned soldiers should receive a war gratuity in cash, why did they not, long before the elections came on, advocate in this chamber the payment of a cash gratuity? No, they simply waited to see what would be the result of the negotiations between the Government and the representatives of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, and then, when the elections came on, they went one better than the Government, and offered to pay the gratuity in cash. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> knows that at the recent State elections in New South Wales in which he took part, the members of his party who have now secured possession of the Government benches in the State Parliament, as a result of securing the votes of 23 per cent, of the total voters on the State roll, are where they are through offering sops of this kind. </para>

                        <para>. - It would have been more dignified of honorable senators on this side had they left the lecture which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> has delivered go without any reply. It is not always wise, however, to permit the publication in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of statements such as those made by the honorable senator without offering some reply to them. It is not my intention to take up much time, but I should like to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> if it were &#39;parliamentary to do so, that what he has said this afternoon was,, in my opinion, an impudent thing for any honorable senator to say. I believe that honorable senators opposite were honest, in their attempts to amend the Bill, but honorable senators on this side were as free to vote for amendments submitted by the Opposition as for the Government measure, if they thought these amendments practical and proper. The Committee of the Senate has considered the Bill, and now when it is at its final stage honorable senators are challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and told, in effect, that they are cowards, and that they had not the courage to stand up to the Government, and support any amendments he moved. Honorable senators on this side - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> knows it - have just as much courage and manliness as he has. They are just as much determined to see justice done to the returned soldiers and their dependants. I deny, absolutely, the statements he has made to the. effect that honorable senators on this side are not as courageous as he is, or are not as keen in the interests of justice and fair play to the returned soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> may please himself , but&#34;! hope he will take some advice from a man who is just as keenly interested in the returned soldiers and in the welfare of this country as he is himself, and will refrain from lecturing honorable senators on this side as he has done this afternoon. I trust <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will take this in the kindly way in which it is tendered. I resent very much what he has said this afternoon, and on every future occasion, when lie attempts to lecture honorable senators on this side, as he has done this afternoon, I shall take the opportunity of contradicting his statements, and of informing him that we are as keenly alive to the welfare of the soldiers and their dependants as is the honorable senator and those associated with him. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather sorry .the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> is not in the chamber, as I was rather amused to think that he considered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> amendment as a compliment to the Department under his control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> is to be congratulated on having moved a practical amendment to provide that organizations already in existence throughout Australia shall distribute the money proposed to be placed in the hands of a Trust. I think we should have a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">\ Quorum formed.&#34;&#93;</inline> I am glad the Minister for Repatriation is now here, because, as I have already stated, I was amused to think that he regarded the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> as a compliment to the Repatriation Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> amendment was moved because it was a practical method of placing this fund, which has been created by the whole of the Australian soldiers, in the hands of a Department which has branches in every State. It is not therefore a matter of complimenting the Repatriation Department, but a means of employing existing organizations instead of creating another body. I have nothing whatever to say concerning the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the proposed Trust, but I believe the position will be better met by adopting the amendment that has already been moved. Notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, the canteens were established by the non-commissioned officers and men, and the funds have not been contributed to in any way by other ranks. </para>

                        <para>- It is  probable   that occasionally an officer purchased a packet of cigarettes, but the whole organization devolved upon the noncommissioned officers and men, and the fund was created with their .money. Are the officers to have more representation than are the men ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> amendment is a .practical one, as it gives representation to all of the States, and takes .away the representation from Melbourne. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> has quite recently lectured me, I am quite prepared to vote with him on this occasion. The proposed Trust is to handle funds for the benefit of soldiers and their dependants in every corner of the Commonwealth, and there is no organization in existence that can give those in outside districts better representation than the  State Repatriation Boards. Some senators argue, that the money is likely to be distributed within six months, but the Minister knows that it will not be disposed of in that time, as provision is made in the Bill for the submission of annual. reports and an annual* examination of the accounts by the Auditor-General. </para>

The Minister for Repatriation sta ted that some people did not know the difference between repatriation allowances and pensions, and I venture to say there should not be any difference, as the authority that deals with repatriation should also&#39; deal with pensions. All matters relating to -soldiers should be concentrated under the one control, so&#62; that a soldier or his dependant could bring his case before the one authority. </para>

                        <para>- If it is considered too drastic I will withdraw it, and submit something worse. We have Repatriation Boards in every .State in the Commonwealth, and these bodies have a  real  knowledge of the necessitous cases requiring assistance. The question of scholarships will be covered  by  regulations under which there will doubtless be an endeavour to secure an equality of opportunity ; but .is any honorable senator prepared to say who as likely to receive these scholarships ? The -whole matter will be in -the hands of - a Trust sitting in Melbourne, .and the &#39;Government .are -still of the opinion that Melbourne is Australia. This is emphasized very strongly by the fact that the Trust is to comprise Victorians only, notwithstanding the fact that it has &#39;to administer -a &#34;fund totalling hundreds of thousands o&#39;f pounds in -the interest of soldiers and their dependants in every part of Australia. .1 intend supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> amendment, not because I believe the Repatriation Department has done all it should do, but because the necessary machinery is- already in existence. The slowness of the Repatriation Department is certainly no recommendation, but I .am hoping that it will improve in its methods, and that instead of taking months to deal with cases, it will take weeks, and eventually days. If this amendment is carried, and the administration of the fund placed under the control of the Repatriation Boards in the various States, there will be no objection to the money being distributed by the Central Commission in Melbourne. The Government seem to shrink from their responsibility in this regard, because it is not Government money. But surely it is better to have it under the control of the Repatriation Boards which are so closely associated with the soldiers. Much could be said of the Repatriation. Department. I do not complain of the work that it has done, but of what it has left undone. I know of a young man who attended the Hawkesbury Agricultural College after his return, from the war; a-nd who, during his course of training,, was working in the blacksmith&#39;s shop,, when a. small piece of steel entered his eye. Many months have elapsed since* the* accident occurred, but no assistance has been forthcoming. If he had! been in private employment he would have received some- compensation, hut under the Repatriation. Act he merely waits until he sometimes wonders whether it is worth while bothering about it, or &#34;whether the loss of an eye is merely an incident in the life of a Minister or official&#39; of the Repatriation Department. I would not support the proposal to  put this work on the Repatriation Department if I  thought  it. could not cope with it. I realize that the officers of the Department work hard, and I believe that, with all the faults, and criticisms, and sins of omission that we can bring against it, it is still the only organized Department with branches throughout, Australia whose business it is to deal with a purely Australian question, such as this question is. I support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish honorable senators to understand that one of the results which I am sure will follow from the carrying of the amendment is that the money from the McCaughey trust will not be handed over to the Repatriation Commission. That money, although bequeathed by a citizen of New South Wales, will, if handed to the Trust named in the Bill, be spent for the benefit of the whole of the soldiers throughout Australia. If that Trust is not appointed, what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey&#39;s trustees will do is a matter for themselves to decide. They are responsible for the money, and we have no control over it. They have said that they are quite content to hand the money to the Trust named in the Bill, if it is constituted, for the purposes they have indicated. That is a point which the Committee, in the interests of the soldiers and their dependants, should consider. If the amendment is carried, the only money handed over to the Repatriation Commission to administer will be the sum of &#163;4.80,000 odd, representing the accumulated profits of the canteens funds. I must ask the Committee to remember that, in regard to all -its other functions, the Repatriation Commission has lines laid down upon which to act. In no. case has it to distribute funds. That is no part of its duty. The duty proposed now to be- handed over to it, will be quite foreign to all the rest of its functions. I am sure that if the Commission were called on to distribute this money, it would lead to endless confusion and bickering. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> drew no fanciful picture, but indicated an actual fact, when he said that, a great number of the people of the Commonwealth who are recipients in one form or another of the assistance provided by the Repatriation or War Pensions Acts, are not, able to differentiate, or at any rate do not differentiate, us regards the Department which is responsible, or as to the class of case dealt with by each Department. A good deal of my correspondence is really on matters affecting, not the Defence Department, but the Treasury or the Repatriation Department, and relates to. soldiers&#39; dependants. </para>

No governmental activity has distributed, or is distributing, money in this way. I appeal to the Committee not to support the amendment, which will make the whole scheme unworkable, lead k&#62; confusion, and lessen the usefulness of the Trust. If the amendment is carried, we shall have to- reconsider the position, because the whole aspect of the question will be entirely changed. </para>

I have been influenced in that direction not so much by the arguments of those who have spoken in favour of &#39;the amendment as by the speeches of those who have opposed it. The first to oppose it was

                    He said that if it had been Government money he would have been in favour of Governmentcontrol, but that as it was the soldiers&#39; money he felt that the soldiers would prefer to have it under the proposed Trust. Unlike

It was carried on at first to a large extent by men acting in an honorary capacity. Finally the soldiers clamoured for the appointment of three paid commissioners, and, although the Department did most excellent work with honorary service, the Government bowed to the clamour, and the Senate passed a Bill introduced by the &#39; Minister for Repatriation
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen}, to appoint three paid Commissioners, and do away with honorary assistance.</inline>

                <para>I listened with great attention to the Minister for Repatriation. If any senator -can put up a case for a Bill, it is he. I had no objection to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Trust nominated by the Government. I go so far as to say that if the scheme of the Bill is to be carried, it would be better to have those named as the Trust rather than to appoint persons from all over Australia. Although I am not a Victorian, I do not want to make any bother about its being, a Victorian body. I believe that every person named is competent and well worthy to be on the Trust.  If we had. an honorary committee with representatives on it from the other States, they would have to come here, and the expense of bringing them here and keeping them here would have to be met. It seems to me that, even under this proposal, there is going to be added expense, and I am in favour of handing the fund over to the Repatriation Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said he took it as a great compliment that honorable senators were prepared to take that course. I think highly of his Department, but it is not a very fine compliment to hand the control of &#163;500,000 to a Department which will ultimately be called upon to spend &#163;30.000,000 or &#163;40,000,000. By handing the fund over to that Department to administer, we should save the expenses of administration. The money has been raised by the soldiers through the canteens, and has to be distributed in a specific manner, and the least the Government might do is to see that it is administered without any expense at all to the fund. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and I were in the New South Wales Parliament, the Miners&#39; Accident Relief Bill was passed&#39;, and the Government arranged to pay the whole of the administrative expenses. It does seem to me that this can be accomplished by the Repatriation Department taking over the control of the fund. The Minister for Repatriation has told us that his Department cannot .possibly do this, because it is already working at terrific pressure upon six days a week. I understand that no holidays are observed by his Department, and I do not know whether there is even an adjournment for lunch. In listening to him I came to the conclusion that his officers had no time to read the newspapers. That is, doubtless, a very good testimonial to give them, but I cannot believe that,- with a little additional effort, this fund could not be administered by the Repatriation Department. In a very short time three paid Commissioners will be appointed to carry on the work of that Department, and they may well be charged with the administration of this fund. I take it that the Government will lay down specifically how this money is to be expended. The Repatriation Commissioners would have to carry out the provisions of the Bill as distinct from those of the Repatriation Act. If the administration of this fund were under the same control as the Repatriation Department itself, instead of a recipient under this measure experiencing difficulty because he might not be able to understand exactly the difference between one Department and! another, he would experience no trouble whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has complained that he is obliged to work in a small, cramped, dirty office, because he cannot obtain suitable office accommodation elsewhere. But the trustees whom it is proposed to appoint under this Bill will require to have offices as well as a secretary, a typist, and an attendant to answer the door. Thus do Departments grow, and grow. As the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes remarked, &#34;You start a fellow with a table, a chair, a bottle of ink and a blotting-pad, you go away, and when you come back, six months hence, you find a tremendous Department with a suite of offices.&#34; </para>
                <para>I should be sorry to see this money handed over to the Repatriation Department to be used for repatriation purposes. It must be expended in a specific way. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has told us that if we do not agree to constitute the proposed Trust there is a sum of &#163;450,000 which the trustees of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey will refuse to hand over to a Government Department. We ought to inquire the reason for their action. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has also told us that he has received letters from persons who are willing to contribute money for various purposes, and who have forwarded it to the </para>
                <para class="block">Minister because they knew of no outside organizations to which they could send it. I understood him to say that, in their communications, they had inquired if there were any organizations to which they could forward it. The inference was that they would have preferred to send it to outside organizations. </para>

                        <para>- If persons have that idea. I can quite understand they would refuse to contribute money. But, if we let them know specifically that there is a branch of the Repatriation Department whose express duty it is to deal with this fund, I am inclined to think that they will prefer to send their money to the Government rather than to private trustees. When a man makes his will, he usually prefers to leave his estate in the hands of a public trustee rather than in the hands of a private company. He has his estate handled by private trustees only when he is prevented from placing it under the control of Government trustees. Consequently, I favour the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> and I am prepared to incur the risk of which the Minister for Repatriation spoke just now, </para>

He gave them a splendid character for industry, and I quite agree with him that he has a good set of officers. Although in the past I have had occasion to complain of the methods of his Department, I am quite convinced that to-day it is capably conducting its affairs, and conducting them with a great deal of satisfaction to those concerned. I am sorry that the honorable gentleman is obliged to work in the miserable office which he described, because I know that he is a grafter in every sense of the term. </para>

We all know that he is a hard worker, and I am very sorry that he has not provided himself with an office in which he would be more comfortable. The Minister for Repatriation has stated that, if the amendment be carried, not an hour of the time of - his paid staff can be devoted to administering the funds to which this Bill relates. He told us that his staff is fully occupied, and cannot do anything in the direction of making inquiries regarding applications for assistance, and, generally, of helping in the disbursement of this fund ; but he also informed us that the proposed Trust will have the full assistance of his unpaid staff. There is generosity indeed. </para>

                        <para>- That is practically the same statement. The Minister says, in effect, that his staff cannot undertake this work unless additional appointments are made. He further intimates that the Trust which it is proposed to constitute under the Bill may send requests for information to any portion of Australia, and the local Repatriation Committees will make the necessary inquiries. I do not expect that the Repatriation Department could do this work without extra assistance, because if it could, the&#39; Minister&#39;s statement about the staff being hard pressed already, would not be borne out by the facts. For that reason I am anticipating that, if the work is handed over to the Repatriation Department, it &#39;will be necessary to increase the staff to some extent. If, on the other hand, it is carried on by trustees to be appointed under this Bill, some considerable expenditure will be incurred in the renting of suitable offices and the appointment of inspectors and office staff, because we could not expect the trustees to work under conditions which the Minister has told us obtain in his own office. It will be necessary, also, for the trustees to obtain offices in each of the&#39; States, because the Minister has stated that the  Deputy  Commissioners could not be expected to devote any of their time to the distribution of the Canteens Fund. We can see, therefore, that with the appointment of trustees there will be a danger of multiplying the avenues of possible expenditure, and that in two or three years&#39; time a great deal of the money might be swamped in rents and salaries to the staff, leaving very little for the disabled returned soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson&#39;s</inline> suggestion, of course, would get over the difficulty. He said, in effect, that it would not take long to ascertain the number of widows, widowed mothers, orphans, and other dependants of deceased soldiers, and that it would then, be merely a matter of dividing the whole amount up between them. I am sure, however, that the Minister and the Government are not thinking of doing that. In South Australia there is what is called the South Australian Soldiers&#39;&#39; Fund, subscribed by the people of the State., and controlled by a Board of trustees, somewhat similar to that proposed to &#39;be appointed under this Bill, and quite a number of complaints have been made concerning the disposal of that fund. I have rft&#62; personal knowledge of the work done by that Board, but, judging from the complaints that have been made, the condition of things is anything but satisfactory. The Minister has told us that the trustees of the McCaughey  bequest will not hand that money over to a Government Department; but I may point out that when the bequest was made the Government had no intention of appointing Repatriation Commissioners, and I take it that there is now nothing whatever to prevent the McCaughey trustees handing the bequest over to the Commission. It is no longer a Government Department, seeing that a few weeks ago we passed a measure practically removing the whole of the Repatriation work from the interference of Parliament, the Commissioners being responsible only to the Minister. For this reason, there may be no point in the Minister&#39;s objection that the money from the McCaughey estate could not be handled by the Repatriation Commission. In any case, it will be controlled by some Trust under similar safeguarding  provisions as are contained in the amended Repatriation Act. I feel, therefore, that there need&#34; be no fear in the minds of honorable senators about any difficulty in, regard to the McCaughey bequest, if the amendment is carried. After all, the Minister was merely expressing his own opinion, and. I am expressing mine. I feel sure that under the altered conditions the McCaughey trustees will not object to hand the money over to the Repatriation Commissioners for distribution, and accordingly I ask the Committee to support the amendment in the interests of economy, and so that the fund may be more satisfactorily disbursed. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is not often that I find myself in a dilemma as to how I intend to vote, but after the discussion that has taken place, I am on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand I feel that as this money belongs to the soldiers, it may be necessary to dissociate those charged with its distribution from any connexion with a Government Department; while, on the other hand, the Senate is a States House, and, as a member of it, I am not at all satisfied with the constitution of the proposed Trust. The Government have deliberately set out to centralize the administration of the fund by the appointment only of Victorian representatives, and&#39; if anything like the law of averages obtains with regard to the distribution of the money, the probability is that a larger proportion will be distributed in the State I represent than in Victoria. I am sorry that the Government have excluded representatives of the other States from the Trust. If they will not review the position, and give some sort of promise that there shall be at least one representative from each State on the Trust, I am afraid that, looking at the matter from the angle of New South Wales, which, on the law of averages, should get two-fifths of the money to be disbursed, I shall have to vote for the amendment, on the ground that it will effect a more reasonable distribution amongst those entitled to the money than can be expected from a Trust of Melbourne citizens. I approve entirely of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer</inline> as the  chairman  of the Trust. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but he is a, man of wide Australian sympathies. I may add that every one of the proposed members of the Trust is a reputable and trustworthy citizen. The Minister has told us that the money belongs to the soldiers, and that if it is distributed through the Repatriation Department the thought might arise in. the minds of beneficiaries that Government money is being saved. How can it be distributed fairly otherwise, because already the Repatriation Department is organized right throughout Australia? Recently &#39;we amalgamated the Pensions Department with Repatriation and War Service Homes activities, and authorized the appointment of three Commissioners to carry on the work of the Repatriation Department; and a little while ago the Minister said that the back of the repatriation problem had been broken. That is what I gathered from his observations. </para>

                <para>Let us visualize what is going to occur if we pass this Bill as it is presented to us. We are going to set up another Trust, and to some extent to duplicate an organization already, set up through much stress and sorrow. There is no limitation with regard to the expenses of this Trust. It may, or may not, go on for years. It is, however, the expressed intention of those who own this money, and they are the Australian soldiers themselves, that it should be given to their dependants and their less fortunate mates. I take it, also, that it is an unexpressed but honorable understanding that the Trust shall not take too long about distributing these funds. This Bill will place the trustees in an unassailable position to do exactly as they like. They cannot distribute this money without excessive expense in its distribution unless they take advantage of organizations already set up by the Government for the deliberate purpose of finding out who are distressed and who are in need of relief. For all practical purposes, whether the amendment is carried or the Trust is created, the work must he done through the Repatriation Department and Repatriation Committees; otherwise the information available for the proper distribution of the money cannot be obtained. </para>
                <para>I have no objection to a Trust being created for the distribution&#39; of  this money, particularly if we have confirmation of the statement that the McCaughey bequest of &#163;450,000 will not in any circumstances be paid to an organization that has any connexion direct or indirect with a Government Department. I should be the last to take up an untenable position in this Chamber, by which the soldiers would lose the benefit of such a large sum of money, which practically doubles the fund obtained as profits from the canteens. Whether this is so or not, I do not know, but we may assume, if the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> asserts that it is so, that there can be no doubt about the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the Minister for the correction. In view of what he has said we can assume that a Trust of some sort must be set up to administer the McCaughey bequest. We have to ask ourselves whether it would be wise for us to give the distribution of this fund to a Trust appointed to administer the &#34; McCaughey bequest in order to avoid further duplication of organizations for its distribution. I admit that I am on the horns of a dilemma, but I propose to vote for the amendment for the reason that on the proposed Trust set up by the Bill there is no representation of States other than Victoria. It is to consist exclusively of honorable and highly placed Melbourne gentlemen, although the bulk of this money, if these funds are to be fairly distributed, must be given to claimants outside Victoria. There should be some provision in the Bill to give .representation on the Trust to States other than Victoria. </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened with great attention and interest to the remarks made by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> yesterday evening. He suggested first of all that the average man in the street is placed in rather a dilemma because of the number of different Government Departments, but, as I fail to see how the creation of this Trust will improve his position in that regard, I do not think there was any force in the Minister&#39;s argument. The honorable senator then referred to a doubt in the minds of the returned soldiers as to whether these funds were to be supplementary to, or in substitution for, the funds of the Repatriation Department. There should be no doubt in the minds of the soldiers that these funds have been created by the profits derived from the traffic of the canteens, and have no connexion with the funds of the Repatriation Department. The Minister seemed to me to contend that there is no machinery established for distributing money, and that the work of distributing this money would be foreign to the work of the Repatriation Department. If I have not misunderstood the Repatriation Bill which we recently had under consideration, the distribution of these funds is not more foreign to the work of repatriation, or the payment of war pensions, than is the work connected with the erection of war service homes. By interjection, I alluded to the proposed Trust under this Bill as a smoke screen. It is, in effect, put forward to satisfy the mind of the returned soldier that he is not to he deprived of money . that should be his. We all recognise that these funds belong to the soldiers. The Minister for Repatriation stated that a person leaving money for the benefit of returned soldiers would not be prepared to hand it to the Repatriation Department for distribution, but I think that statement needs some qualification. It would not, of course, be handed over to the Department to be disbursed in the form of repatriation allowances, but I do not think for one moment that the trustees of the McCaughey bequest would object to the Department distributing that money, in conjunction with the canteen profits. I desire to stress the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> Supposing the Bill is passed in its present form, and the Trust created. That Trust will not have one iota of information as to who are desirous of receiving assistance, and it must immediately commence to collect information. The Minister for Repatriation has stated that the necessary particulars required by the Trust will be at its disposal, and yet we are being asked to appoint a body that will have to utilize the information already in possession of the Repatriation Department. The officers of the Department know of every man and his needs, and it would be a simple matter for it to effectively dispose of the funds on the most economical and effective basis. The Minister for Repatriation really strengthened the need for adopting the amendment when he said that it was the intention, when the Trust was formed, to have certain gentlemen in different districts to act as a medium through which the Trust will work. It is unreasonable to make additional- appointments and to create another body when we already have a Central Commission, State Boards, and Local Commit-less dealing with our repatriation work. The appointment of a Trust is nothing more than a &#34; smoke screen &#34; to convince people that this money is supplementary, and not in substitution of that paid by the Repatriation Department. Are we to be guided by sentiment, or are we to take the common-sense and practical view ? Should we not allow the effective machinery already in existence to be utilized in meeting the needs, in a supplementary sense, of the men. and their dependants who are to benefit? There is nothing in the Bill, apart from the appointment of the Trust, that cannot well be carried out by the Repatriation </para>

                    <para>. - At first <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland&#39;s</inline> amendment seemed to be rather an attractive proposition, but after listening to the debate and recalling my own experiences in connexion with applications to the Repatriation Department, I am convinced that it is desirable that this money should be distributed by a separate body. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has had any experience in connexion with applications for repatriation allowances, he will surely realize, as I do, that nine-tenths of the trouble in connexion with payments by the Re-i patriation  Department has been caused by the lack of knowledge on the part of applicants in filling in the necessary forms. </para>

My experience has shown that applicants for assistance from the Government have considerable difficulty in correctly filling up repatriation or old-age pension forms. If the administration of the fund is to be in the hands of the Repatriation Department many of the soldiers and their dependants will think that the money they are receiving is being paid by that Department and not out of a separate fund. It really resolves itself into a question of whether the fund shall be administered by an honorary Trust or by the Repatriation Department, because, as stated bv the Minister for Repatriation, the records of the Department will be at the disposal of the Trust. </para>

Reference has been made to the possibility of the trustees of the McCaughey estate declining to hand over the fund under their control to the Government for distribution. I was interested in a voluntary public effort in Queensland, and when the members of a Trust were approached for a grant they said they would not contribute one penny if it was to- be handled by the Government, because they did not believe in the muddling methods adopted. </para>

                        <para>- Because they are not appointed to do so. Their duty is to hand over certain moneys to certain Trusts, according to the will. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> says that the trustees have notified their willingness to hand the money over to the proposed Trust. We now learn that they object to hand it over to the Repatriation Department. It is much clearer and better, for the sake of the soldiers and their dependants, to create an independent Trust outside of the Repatriation Department. This course will give more satisfaction, and afford the soldiers an assurance that they will be getting their own money back again. I support the Bill as it stands, because it is the best arrangement that we can possibly make. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have spoken again but for the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> emphasized <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> statement regarding the bequest from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey. If ever anything should not have been said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> remarks should never have been made. The McCaughey bequest must go to the soldiers, in any case, as provided by the will. The executors of the estate cannot take any other course. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stands up, and does not mind decrying his Government, by showing that the Government have created such a general distrust amongst business men that there is a reluctance to put anything in their hands. My complaint is that the McCaughey money is being mixed up with the Canteens Fund. It is such a magnificent bequest, made in such a magnificent way by so great a man and for such a splendid purpose, that it could well have stood by itself. It would have been only doing justice to the memory of the man who left the money to allow the bequest to stand by itself. If this amendment would force the Government to have the bequest administered separately from the Canteens Fund, that is an excellent argument for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> practically made a threat to the Committee that if we did not carry the Bill as it stood the soldiers would lose the McCaughey money. That is a most regrettable attitude for the Minister to take up. No Minister should say that if we do our duty some disastrous result will follow. I am annoyed beyond imagination at the way in which the Minister has put the question before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. -I wish to raise two other questions regarding the Trust. The first is that under no set of circumstances can. the Government displace any member of it until he resigns or dies. Some elasticity should be given to the question of the continuity in office of the trustees. The Trust should continue, if the Bill is  passed. in its present form, only at the pleasure of the Governor-General. The second point is that it is exclusively a Melbourne body, and will have the responsibility of disbursing probably at least &#163;1,000,000.

                <para class="block">The Returned Sailors aud Soldiers  Imperial  League may be fairly representative of the returned soldiers of Australia, and yet the  president  of that organization may be elected as the result of a very close conflict in respect of some business connected with that League. Under this Bill it is proposed to constitute a Trust to control a very serious matter, and those who have had experience of various organizations know that very frequently a party contest within an organization results in the election of a  president  who  is  the least fitted to hold that particular office. To appoint to a Trust charged with administering large sums of money a person who may not be chosen because of his fitness for the position would be a grave mistake. If. my amendment be adopted, we shall certainly add to the size of the Trust, but we shall also give the soldiers adequate representation  upon  it. Only the other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> read a statement  which  showed that  there  are 42,000 Victorian members  of,  the Returned  Sailors  and Soldiers Imperial League, and  only  22,000 members in New South Wales.  &#39;Upon  that  basis  42,000 soldiers would  elect  their president here, because we  know  the attitude of Victorians towards the  rest  of Australia. They regard Melbourne as Victoria and Victoria as Australia.  With them  New South Wales  does  not count. New South Wales has at least one-third  more  returned soldiers than has Victoria, and yet if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> figures are correct, these men would have no chance of representation on the Trust or on the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League. </para>

                        <para>- I realize the littleness of my outlook, and that outlook has been decreased since I entered this Parliament. When I came to Melbourne I took as wide an Australian view of matters as did any other honorable senator, but to-day I am convinced that with Victorian people it is a case of Melbourne first and all the time. If honorable senators will turn up my earlier speeches in this chamber, they will find that in those days I spoke for Australia, but Victoria has absorbed everything that she can absorb. So far as New South Wales is concerned, including returned soldiers, she possesses about one-half of the revenue-paying population of Australia. I really believe that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is right. That State is so huge and so important- that it ought never to put in claims for these petty things. It ought rather to let such favours go to the other States which have to live upon what they can get out of the Commonwealth. The previous amendment having failed, if the Trust proposed to be constituted under this Bill be appointed, there is no guarantee that the person who will be elected  president  of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League may not be quite unfit for his office. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> can see great virtues in elections at times. Upon other occasions he can also see great evils in them. From his stand-point, when an election is to he held for the presidency of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, the soldiers are certain to make a bad choice. They are going to elect a man who has no qualifications for the office. But when they are afforded an opportunity of electing members of this Trust they will select men who are Al at Lloyd&#39;s. They will have no misfits, but just the right men. I need say no more upon that aspect of the matter. But if the amendment be carried, shall we not be using a steam hammer to crack a nut? If we are to have an election for the Trust we shall require an electoral roll, and the Government will be obliged to conduct the election. We shall also require polling booths, and the whole matter will cost as much as would a Senate election. All this would need to he done for the purpose of insuring that a portion of the &#163;500,000 at present in the fund should be handed over to those who are entitled to receive it. The amendment is too ridiculous for serious consideration, so I do not propose to waste further time upon it. </para>

                <para class="block">The absence of representation upon this Trust from States other than Victoria is not fair. To place such extensive arbitrary and final powers in the hands of a Trust for the benefit of the whole of the soldiers of Australia without giving reasonable representation to the soldiers and their dependants from the other States is- quite &#34;unreasonable. I do not propose to repeat the arguments which I advanced upon a previous clause of the Bill. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that the tendency of some acts of administration is to make every one of us from the other States smaller Australians than we would be but for the concentration which is constantly going on in Melbourne. I represent a State which has the largest population and the largest trade and commerce of any State in the Commonwealth. It also pays the biggest amount of taxation. It is the State which contains the biggest city in Australia - a city which has suffered, and is suffering, indignities and disabilities in connexion with the administration of Commonwealth affairs which are positively heartbreaking. I am merely asking that that State shall have one representative on the Trust to insure that every deserving dependant of soldiers shall get a share of this fund, and. also to safeguard its effective administration. There can be no objection to my proposal, save that it will necessitate members of the Trust coming from the other States to- Melbourne. But whatever may be their out-of-pocket expenses, their services will be worth infinitely more. They would not only represent their own States but would; also take full responsibility. It is our bounden duty to do what we can to protect everybody, even to the remotest parts of the Common wealth. </para>

                    <para>. - This is nob a question in which the States appear as States; it is an Australian question. The distribution of the money will not be as between State and State, but as between individuals living in the various States. Western Australia, for instance, may have twice as many widows as New South Wales, and, consequently, in the distribution of the fund, a larger sum will be apportioned to the widows of that State. The trustees will be able to get all the necessary information concerning applications that come before them through the State Advisory Committees, which will be appointed to assist them in the discharge of their duties, and this will secure all that the honorable senator is desiring to obtain by his amendment. Let. us. see how his amendment will appear as a working proposition, and for the purpose of argument let us assume that representatives are appointed from each State, including Western Australia. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> say how often the trustees are likely to meet? </para>

                        <para>- Well, there is not a great deal of difference between the two amendments. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> because I agree with all that he ha* said. This Trust will be a very important body; so important, indeed, that if I could rely upon sufficient support I should move to delegate its duties to the Inter-State Commission, which is a representative Australian body, and responsible to the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment seeks to give Australia an interest and responsibility in the administration of- these funds. For a long time there has been altogether too much centralization in Melbourne, and this Bill is another instance of Melbourne influence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> however, now states that, under the regulations to be promulgated, it is intended to establish State Advisory Committees. </para>

                        <para>- I listened to the Minister attentively, because I had to follow him, and I was looking for a ray of hope as regards the trustees; and when he sat down I drew attention to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Trust. The Minister now talks of the narrowness of the Australian outlook suggested in the amendment. That is just what we have  been combating all along, and that is why I am supporting the amendment. The intimation that Advisory Committees are to be created by means of regulation suggests that, after all, the Bill only deals with one-half of the problem. I do not pretend that I have been able to make myself acquainted with all the details of the measure, but I have read it carefully, and I find no reference in it to the appointment of State Advisory Committees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stands up and says that there is a reference in the Bill to such Committees. </para>

                        <para>- I have been here long enough to know something about the principles under which regulations are drafted. No regulation can be drafted to bring into existence something that is not provided for in the measure under which it is framed. There must be something in the Act under which a regulation is framed to warrant it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may draft a regulation to set up State Advisory Committees, but it will have no force if such Committees are not provided for in this Bill. If the Minister can, by regulation, create State Advisory Committees in each of the capital cities there is no reason why he should not as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has suggested, create committees in every hamlet in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, each must be equipped with a staff. The work must be done, and well done. I venture to say that, seeing that there is no provision in the Bill for State Committees, a regulation under this measure pretending to bring them into existence would be at once ruled out of court. The suggestion that such Committees are necessary shows that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Peace)</inline> has realized the injustice he is doing in this Bill to the members of the proposed Trust in not supplying them with necessary avenues for the collection of information to enable them to carry out the duties they are called upon to perform. I know that nothing I may say is likely to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> but I hope the honorable senator will call for a division on his amendment, as I should like to know which honorable senators are anxious that the States they represent should be without representation on this Trust. </para>

                        <para>.- -To-day I asked the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> how many officers from the Duntroon College served at the Front, how many reached the rank of major, and the number promoted above the rank of major. There must be some explanation why these young men - possibly the best-trained young men in the world - were not promoted above the rank of major. I am under the impression that during their period of service an order was issued to prevent  promotion beyond a certain rank. These men had the advantage of being well trained in their profession, and if the position is. as I have stated, it is a gross injustice to them. I believe it was our proud boast that every man who went abroad had the commission of a general in his knapsack, and if I am right in my conjecture, the officers of this particular branch of the service were only allowed to go  so  high and no higher. If that is so it is an injustice that can never be removed. It may be said that they were young men, and were not entitled to high rank, &#39;but merit alone should have been the basis upon which promotion should have been given. It is a remarkable fact that other officers were promoted beyond the rank of major.&#39; </para>

                            <para>- I remember on one occasion, during the absence of the Minister for Defence from the . Defence Department, seeing _ a statement prepared by responsible military officers which was creditable to these young men, and I venture to say that the officers who received their training in Australia were in every way efficient for the important work they had to perform. I introduced this matter because I have heard it stated that they did not reach a higher rank than that of major, because they were prevented, and there must be some substantial reason for this action if that be true. Judging by the reports I have seen, it is remarkable that these excellently trained young men  were  allowed to reach a certain rank, and that not one of them was permitted to go beyond it. If my statements are correct, I would like the Minister for Defence to give an explanation, or submit some information later on, as it is a question that should be settled. </para>

I have been assured by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that at the time he vacated the office of Minister for Defence at the outbreak of war, he was not aware of any such order having been issued, and I am certain that no such order has been issued by any Government since that time. I am astonished to hear that such a rumour is current, and if there was such nil order it was certainly never issued by the Government or wilh their knowledge. I shall have inquiries made to see if the General Officer Commanding has any knowledge of the matter. </para>

There could be only one motive, and that is, that it might inconvenience the Government or military authorities to have junior officers returning to Australia with high rank. But that is disproved by the fact that one sergeant-major returned with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> can probably bear me out in that, as the man in question came from the State ho represents. </para>
