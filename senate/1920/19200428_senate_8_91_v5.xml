This was taken from a prepared list of natural-born subjects interned, but proper account had not been taken of those who had been released at various periods, and whose names were not on this list. The files of all such natural-born internees have now been gone through, and the above figures may be taken as accurate. </para>

                <para class="block">This measure is for practical purposes a continuation of the main regulations under the War Precautions Act with regard to the issue of passports. It provides that any person over sixteen years of age, on leaving the Commonwealth, must have a passport. Because of the action now taken in nearly every other country  in  the world in the detention of people under passport regulations it would he very difficult for any one to travel from this country to any other without a passport. In that regard, therefore, it will be largely a matter of convenience. Persons entering Australia will he dealt with under the Immigration Act. This Bill deals mainly with the issue of passports which will prove a convenience to any Australian travelling abroad. A passport will last for two years,butthereare provisions in the measure which permit of its extension to meet the convenience of the public. Clause 4 deals with arrangements which may be made with foreign countries in regard to transport. It provides that where there is a mutual understanding there shall be freedom of intercourse between different countries, exemptions may be granted. Though the provisions of the Bill are intended to apply only to a few persons there is no doubt that its powers are very far-reaching. It is not likely, however, that they will be used to the full extent. The measure will be administered as sympatheticallyaspossible.Clause 5 provides that any person entering Australia who is required to be in possession of a passport shall, if required, give up his passport to an officer before leaving the vessel by which he has entered the Commonwealth. The passports of British people and of other races who are deemed desirable will be immediately stamped, so that they will be subject to no further disability than that imposed by having a check upon their entry here. Clause 7 makes it a legal offence for the master of a vessel to discharge any , alien seaman who signed on outside the Commonwealth, and who has not lodged his passport with an officer as provided for under this Bill. We have evidence that many undesirables are coming to Australia who have signed on as seamen outside the Commonwealth, and whose entry here it is deemed wise to check. Thus the responsibility is placed upon the master of the vessel by which they travel to protect the Commonwealth. Clause9 provides that any person who, for the purpose of obtaining a passport, makes any false or misleading statement shall be guilty of an offence, the penalty for which is &#163;100, or imprisonment for six months. Probably there will be a difference of opinion in regard to the necessity for the issue of passports to some persons leaving Australia. But it cannot be denied that in the present condition of affairs it will be a distinct advantage for people going abroad to be fully armed with what is practically a credential which will facilitate their progress in any other part of the world. Of course, legislation of this character calls for sympathetic administration. Upon the other hand, where foreign countries debar our own people from entering them without passports, we should stand, at least, upon the same footing. Where, however, no suspicion is involved, full power is conferred by the Bill to practically abolish passports. The desire all the time is to facilitate the movements of the travelling public. This is the second occasion upon which the Bill has been before the Senate, and it is generally recognised that it is largely a measure for considerationinCommittee.If honorable senators are not prepared to proceed with the debate upon its second reading to-day I am quite willing to agree to an adjournment. </para>

                        <para>. -  -This is another old friend upon which we had many long debates last session. It is based upon the recommendations made by theCommitteeappointed during the war period to deal with the registration of aliens.A number of honorable senators were members of that Committee, and this measure will perpetuate very many of the restrictions that have hitherto obtained in regard to the registration of aliens. It provides that no alien shall be permitted to enter this country without registering and without giving full particulars in regard to his movements. Ninety-five per cent. of the persons who come to the Commonwealth, even though they be aliens, will be subjected to no inconvenience beyond that of registration. Those who come here merely for business purposes can obtain an exemption which will enable them to travel round Australia, provided that they do not make Australia their permanent abode. When, however, they become permanently domiciled here we think either that they should become Australians by naturalization, or that we should be apprised of their movements in this country. It will thus be seen that in regard to the majority of aliens, registration will be quite a formal matter. There is abundant power under the Bill to grant exemptions from registration where it is clearly proved that an alien who has lived in the Commonwealth has behaved well. There is no desire whatever to harass him. But it is anticipated that under this measure we shall be able to keep something like an accurate  record of aliens who live in Australia, and who should become Australians. Clauses 7 and 8 deal with the manner of effecting registration. The former provides - </para>

Those who believe in the use of this authority will, no doubt, consider the Bill to  be necessary, but, according to my view, the security of a Government rests upon the liberty enjoyed by its people. Let us consider the person first mentioned in the proposed new paragraph, namely, an anarchist. When I consider all the &#34; ists &#34; there are, I am almost inclined to believe I am an anarchist myself, or at all events I would be if my temperament were as mild as the average educated anarchist, whose belief, I understand, is that the people of every community should bo so good as to require no government at all. </para>

And so also will every other person who advocates the overthrow of the government of any other country. It may be necessary, at times, to deal drastically with certain classes in our own community; those persons, for instance, who favour the overthrow of the Commonwealth or State Governments ; but in view of the fact that more than a half of our population is under Labour Governments in the States,I might well be anxious that any persons in favour of overturning those Governments should b.e excluded. </para>

                        <para>- I know they have, and I remind honorable senators opposite of the developments in Queensland during the past eighteen months. It looks very much as if organized force is being employed there to overthrow the State Labour Government, and it is possible that, if this Bill is passed, we shall place in the hands of the Queensland Government a weapon which may be employed in a manner little dreamed of by those who are supporting the measure. On. more than one occasion of late there has been a demonstration in force against the Government of that State. But the point I wish to make is that even if drastic legislation is necessary to deal with any one who interferes with the established government of this country, surely we are not setting up as the protector of other nations, by declaring that any person who believes in the overthrow of the established government of any country shall be deported from Australia. That is my interpretation of the clause. What on earth have we to do with the opinions of any people concerning the systems of government of other countries? </para>

If, for more than one hundred years, we have got along so well without restrictive legislation of this kind, why should the Commonwealth Government now set itself up as a schoolmaster to inquire into the opinions of all the people who may come here ? We have succeeded admirably with less restrictions than in any other country in the world in developing a Democracy that has become law-abiding. I wish our people were less so. I say that quite candidly. I wish we had, in Australia, a people who, when Governments deliberately use power contrary to law, or who, in the exercise of their powers, strain the law, would deal with them. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that, when associated with my honorable friend opposite, I helped to pass many measures upon which he may now have something to say against me ; but my reply is that, if during the war I helped to pass any restrictive legislation, its purpose was to protect Australia against its enemies, and for that legislation I take full responsibility. Apart from that, I have one particular objection to restrictive legislation, and whatever attempts may be made in this direction I hope to leave this country with more liberties than I found it. .1 am strongly opposed to that type of statesman who aims at setting up his standard as the one that shall be followed by the whole community. When I see the Government and their supporters deliberately taking upon themselves the responsibility of restricting citizens and saying how far a man shall go, it is time we raised our voice in strong objection. </para>

                        <para>- As that was imposed many years ago, and before I was in public life, the honorable senator must know that I did not assist in that direction; but if I had done so I would have been proud of it-. But there was a particular reason for that, and the tax was not imposed to restrain particular individuals, but was done in a wholesale way to prevent a danger to the whole community by a race which we have long since ceased to refer to as an inferior people. The legislation referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was passed about forty years ago to prevent an ill-paid people - I shall not refer to them as the members of an inferior race - coming to Australia. If those restrictive measures had not been provided, the employing class of this country would have filled every available position with the cheap labour of other countries. Because of that grave menace to Australia, very wise statesmen in those days imposed a poll tax to make it unprofitable and difficult to import cheap labour. Their intentions at that time were also supported by a sentimental desire to preserve a White Australia, but this legislation has no distinctive line of that character, but aims, perhaps, at the best feature of our civilization. This legislation has been drafted, not in the interests of the country, but in the interests of those heaven-inspired lawmakers who believe that their particular duties and functions are to restrict the liberties of the people in every possible manner. The Bill provides that the Government shall have the power to deport people who favour overthrowing by force the established government of any civilized country, and I venture to say there are Governments  in other countries that ought to be overthrown by force. How pleasing it would have been if force had been employed in Germany before the Avar, instead of waiting, by a process of evolution, to remove the monarch of that country who was responsible for the terrible slaughter that took place. If there had been a person in Australia who favoured the: application of force to overthrow the German Monarch, and this Bill had become law, he would have been deported. The Turk is not finished with yet, and should there be any one in this country particularly interested in destroying the Turkish system of government, he would be presented - with a deportation order and removed from the country. I have heard it stated - I am somewhat doubtful in quoting the remarks of others - that when a mau is convinced that everything is wrong unless he is there to manage it himself, he will either end his days on a throne or in a lunatic asylum. I do not know in which direction the Minister is leaning. </para>

                        <para>- No; the conjunction &#34; or &#34; appears between the two phrases. The two things are not necessary to bring a man within the law. I could imagine the honorable senator being opposed to the government of a very distinguished personage at Rome. If I were in the Government, and wanted to keep the honorable senator out of this country, I could do it by means of this provision, because I could claim that he was opposed to that form of organized government. The sacredness of organized government depends, not on the fact that it is organized, but on whether it is justifying itself. The only thing worth bothering about with regard to protecting Governments is whether they are worth protecting. </para>

During the 17th century a Government in Great Britain was removed by force. Quite recently, in Russia, a Government was removed by force, and the whole of the press of Australia, including the Nationalist press, congratulated the revolutionaries. In Germany, recently, a Government was removed by force. The removing of Governments by force is one of the safety-valves of the community </para>

                        <para>- It is only different so long as power is kept in the hands of the many, and out of the hands of the few. When I see a Government putting out its hands to take what it can catch here, and grasp &#39;what it <inline font-style="italic">earn</inline> reach there, and when I see behind it followers who imagine that everything is all right with the world and with us, I say that everything is not all right.Theremust be an alertness, an energetic intelligence, to maintain the liberties of the world. When I see the door being shut upon people who would come to this country, I must point out that it would shut out any Russian who participated in the overthrow of theCzar&#39;s Government,and any supporter of the Czar who now wanted to overthrow the present Russian Government. The provision is absurd, unnecessary, and uncalled-for. I do not know why the time of Parliament should be taken up in passing it. How much worse off would we be if it was not passed? Whom will it keep out? Possibly, on some occasion or other, an agitator to whom the press has given some notoriety. The full majesty of the Commonwealth law will come down on that individual, and keep him out of the country. So far as dangerous men are concerned, there can be no danger from those people to a democratic State if it acts intelligently. I was reared as a boy in the belief that where the Britishflag flew, never a slave could breathe, and that Britain was the land that offered a home to the outcast from the rest of the world. Evidently, those sentiments strike a chord of memory and sympathy in the breast ofthecasehardened <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> . Thosewereth e things they fed us on, but the glory of the whole business was that it was part of our make-up. The British people survived all the influence which those outcasts may have brought into their midst. I am one of those sentimentalists who believe that by force alone one can do very little. The cause that rests on force is doomed, whether it is an Australian  democratic Government or the tyrannical Government of another country. </para>

                <para>SenatorGARDINER. - I do not know of any one who would do any harm if he came into this country. If the Czar of Russia were not dead,I should not mind giving him a job to-morrow if he came along. This is a country which has scope and room and wealth, not only for two or three right-thinking people, because I take it that that is all the Government wanthere,but for  all  the revolutionaries that ever lived, if we had them all here at once. With our bright sunshine, and the ease with which a living can be made here, this place opens up quite a new prospect to men from all countries. I move - </para>

They do not want me here, and they would try to keep me out. I am pointing out what might happen under this clause so that honorable senators opposite will not be able to say that they were not informed as to the abuse which might arise under it when, later on if they pass this kind of legislation, the Senate and the Parliament become the laughing stock of the community.I submit my amendment to make it quite sure that the fact that a man is opposed to an organized Government should not be considered an offence in any person desiring to come to this country. </para>

                        <para>- I am discussing a Bill which I am trying to understand, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is interjecting concerning a measure about which he knows absolutely nothing.It is proposed by this clause to make  a person liable  to exclusion from the Commonwealth if he is opposed to the organized government of any country in the world, though it might be uncivilized government. The words to which I take exception are not only absolutely unnecessary, but will tend to much mischief if they are agreed to. The Government, under their Protectionist policy, are proposing to keep the goods of other countries out of the Commonwealth, but under this Bill they propose also to exclude the people of other countries, so that the Commonwealth may be held by William Morris Hughes and Company and those who agree with them. Any one who is opposed to the present Government is not to be allowed to come into this country. </para>

                        <para>- Under this clause the Government might prevent the admission of any person into this country simply on the ground that he is opposed to the organized government of any country. I realize that  thi3  measure is a heritage of the war. The Government have for some time past been exercising practically all power under the War Precautions Act, and in almost every case have misused its provisions. Finding that their powers under that Act are nearly at an end, they have introduced this Bill under the pretence that it is a measure to keep out undesirable people, but in reality because it is a measure under which they can keep out any one with whom they disagree. With the last two years&#39; experience of the Government, I am not in the least disposed to agree to any provision vesting them with power that is not so clearly worded that any step taken beyond the law will be immediately obvious. I ask honorable senators not to treat mv amendment as one submitted by the Opposition. Evidently this Bill was drafted by some one who had a mighty big opinion of himself and a very small opinion of every one else. </para>

                    (South Australia) T3.59&#93;. - I shall certainly support the amendment. I do not think that the Government can have carefully considered the- wording of the clause, or they would see that it is so wide in its present form as to be liable to abuse. It is all very well to tell us that their intentions are good, but the measure will be administered according to the exact wording* of its provisions. If we take the case of Russia, we shall find that some two or three years ago an organized Government there was opposed, and the opposition was not only applauded by press and public, but official congratulations of the Allies were sent to the men who opposed that organized Government. Under this Bill the people who were complimented upon their action by the Allies on that occasion would be prevented from entering the Commonwealth. A year or so later soldiers of the Allies, including Australian soldiers, were sent to upset the organized Government which had then been established in Russia.

                        <para>- They administered the government of the country most successfully, too. Australian soldiers went to assist the Allies in suppressing the organized Bolshevik Government in Russia, and under the strict reading of this clause those men could be prevented from coming, back to Australia. That illustration shows. the abuse to which this clause is liable. I do not accuse the Government of intending anything of that sort, but we should be careful in, passing a measure of this kind to see that no abuse may arise under it. If any one advocated the substitution of a Republican form, of government for the existing form of government, that would be opposing an organized Government. </para>

The first refers to persons advocating the overthrow of established government by force or violence, but the part of the clause to which I am referring refers merely to a person &#34; who is opposed t to organized government.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I admit that if persons &#39;attempted to overthrow a Government by force in order to substitute another for it they would be guilty of treason. I have read the clause carefully and the second part of the paragraph with which we are dealing makes a person liable to exclusion from the Commonwealth merely because he opposes an organized government. If the Minister says that the clause will not apply to such persons he can have no objection to accepting the amendment. </para>

That is the statement which he deliberatelymade.Personally,I am strongly opposed to any section of the community - capitalistic or otherwise - bringing force to bear upon Parliament with,  a  view to unfairly influencing its action. Attempts in that direction have been made here upon several occasions - attempts to which, I am sure, no honorable senator is prepared to submit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardinerwould</inline> beone of the first to resent dictation by any outside body, and to tell its members to goto  a warm  place. But it is not the political opinions of any man to which exception is taken in this measure. An individual is at perfect liberty to advocate  a  republic in preference to  a  monarchy, or a limited monarchy in preference to an autocracy. But he cannot say,&#34;Let us kill the b-King.&#34;Under thisBill,oppositiontogovernmentmeansthe public advocacy of the abolition of all forms of government by means of force. Surely persons who advocate these methods ought not to be welcomed here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would vote for the imposition of a poll-tax upon so-called inferior races for economic reasons, and I would do the same. </para>

                        <para>- I am not seeking to repeat it. I am prepared to welcome to Australia any person who is willing to respect our standards of living, and to assist in maintaining our institutions. NewZealand, America, and indeed, every advanced country has already adopted similar legislative proposals. Here we have a beautiful continent containing only a small population, and if we do not protect it by some such means as are provided in this Bill, it will become the dumping ground for the undesirables of all the nations of the world. It goes without saying that a measure of this character should be administered with common sense. I do not know of any class of legislation which is not liable to be abused. But no Governmentwill desire togo after a mans scalpunnecessarily.Senator Gardiner stated the other day that, under thismeasure,George Washington would have been de barred from entering the Commonwealth. I have yet to learn that George Washington was an advocate of the destruction of all forms of government. As a matter of fact, when trouble arose through the British King ordering troops to America he left his farm for the purpose of defending his country. Nothing in this measure is designed to prevent that sort of conduct. Other cases of a thousand yearsagohavebeenquoted.But none of the weapons used against the British Government is as efficacious as is the referendum with adult suffrage. That is the most effective method by which the will of the people can be expressed . lt is quite idle to attempt to apply the conditions which obtain in Russia to a country like Australia. Of course, if we run people into a dead end, we shall certainly have an explosion.Theclass of people who advocate the overthrow of all forms of government, who do not regard the ballot-box as an effective weapon of reform, and who are prepared to drop a bomb into a public Department, are no good to any country, and neverwillbe. </para>

                        <para>- This measure will deal with them. I know that some members of the Industrial Workers of the World, who were found guilty after what we may fairly assume was a fair trial in this Commonwealth, were men who were &#34;wanted&#34;&#34; in America, and who had been practically dumped here. This Bill is not an attempt to interfere with the liberties of the people. It is designed, rather, to exclude from our midst the off-scourings of nearly every other country; because in the near future they will be unable to enter New Zealand, the United States of America, or Canada. The Commonwealth, therefore, will offer the best field for the accumulation of persons who are obviously undesirable. I admit that, under Acts of Parliament, Governments can practically do anything; but no Government could continue to exist in Australia if it insisted upon twisting our statute law. It is impossible for this country to assimilate men who do not believe in any form of government whatever. We can tolerate advocates of all forms of government - even advocates of Soviet government; but to advocate a particular form of government is a very different thing from saying that because that form of government cannot be obtained peacefully it must be obtained by force - by the use ofbombs. </para>

                        <para>- There is a very old saying that &#34;too many cooks spoil the broth.&#34; I have only one desire, namely, that the Bill shall accomplish the purpose for which it was drafted. I am prepared to consult the drafting officers, and if there be any weakness in it, to have it remedied. I am not one of those who wept when the Czar&#39;s Government was wiped out of existence, though I recognise that it was not the advocates of the use of force who brought about that revolution. It was the result of the wholesale protest of the people who could employ no other weapon. I believe that if the inhabitants of that unhappy country had been able to express themselves through the ballot-box, they would have voted the Czar and his Government clean out of existence ; and that they would have been able to reconstruct their form of government by peaceful means. They have not that weapon ready to their hands, and I am not going to apply the conditions that obtain in Russia to a country like Australia, where the people can do just what they may choose to do without the employment of any force whatever: Of course, I cannot guarantee the manner in which this measure will be administered - it is quite possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gar-</inline> &#39; diner himself may have to administer it - but I do say that it contains nothing that is calculated to bring about the abuses which have been described. </para>

                <para class="block">I should have mentioned Bonaparte, Cromwell, Pym, , . Hampden, and many others who have figured prominently in the history of the world as being responsible for the overturning of organized government by force. Surely it is not contended that they would be undesirables in this country? If I were a Victorian - I am an Australian - I would make a pilgrimage to Ballarat to pay homage at the grave of Peter Lalor, because he dared to stand against constituted authority, and took his life in his hands in so doing. It is extraordinary that in the twentieth century any Government should attempt to exclude as immigrants persons who may hold certain opinions with regard to tyrannies existing in their own country. All that is necessary is already included in the portion of a clause which has been passed. I dislike the whole Bill, because I think it is most objectionable, and I submitted an amendment to place upon the Committee the responsibility for passing the feature of it of which I most strongly disapprove. I remind honorable senators, too, that the British Governmentcommenced the colonization of Australia by sending out a lot of dreadful people. I know we are supposed not to refer to that matter, because it revives unpleasant memories, but under the influence of our sunshine and freedom a very decent race has teen established. It is absurd to think that our people will be contaminated by the introduction of any persons who may, for instance, favour the removal of the Bolshevik Government and setting up in its place a Government appointed by the Czar ; or if the Czar were in power again, of removing his Ministers and placing the Bolshevik Government in their place. All Governments exist by the will of the people. </para>

                        <para>- Whether we appreciate it or not, it is a fact that the ballot has not done all we thought it would do. When questions are submitted for the opinion of the people, and when only one side is heard, the people have no opportunity of coming to a just decision. Under the influence of a corrupt press and a corrupt Government, which insure that only one section of the people shall be heard, the conditions are rapidly becoming favorable to the use of force; not the force employed by those enthusiasts who run up against armed authority, but the force that will remove the evil without personal risks. It is impossible to get that thought out of the minds of the people when restrictive legislation of this nature is introduced. It is not likely that the introduction of the wildest element in the world will corrupt the people of this country. On the contrary, with our undeveloped resources, a wise Government would invite people to come here, instead of passing restrictive legislation to prevent them. One would think that we occupied only a small garden instead of an immense territory, which, as regards its resources, is as yet practically untouched. I am satisfied that if the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will read the clause again he will see that all that is necessary is already provided for. A man may be kept out of Australia simply because he is opposed to organized government. I do not think the Minister wants to do that, nor can I imagine any one wanting to do it; but if the Act ever goes before a Court of law the judicial decision will be, not upon the intention of Parliament, but upon the wording of the Act itself. Possibly some one may be kept out because he is opposed to the British Government. Let us imagine that a Sinn Feiner, who believes that Governments should rest upon the will of the people concerned, and accordingly is opposed to the British Government, seeking to enter Australia after this Bill becomes law. If the Minister is administering the Act and receives reports from his officers that a well-known Sinn Feiner, who, so far as his own country is concerned, deliberately wishes to overthrow any alien Government in favour of government by the people, he must keep that man out, though the would-be immigrant may be imbued with a patriotism so great that it impels him to. suffer exile rather than submit to a form of. government abhorrent to him. The Minister says that such a man must be excluded. </para>

                    <para>. -  When Parliament was dealing with alien immigration it had not the courage to embody in its legislation what it actually desired, but it took a circuitous course of achieving its ends. I take it that this clause is to extend the period in which an examination can be conducted from two to three years; and I shall be glad if the Minister will explain what the clause actually means. </para>
