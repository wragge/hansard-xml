            <para class="block">It amends section 20 of the Papua Act 1905, but does not in any way amend the principles of the existing Constitution of Papua. The object is to get over a  difficulty  'which has been created by a part of the existing Act. The Commonwealth Parliament in 1905 decided when establishing the Constitution of Papua that no further land in that Territory should be alienated. The idea was that all land there should in the future be held on leasehold. The fact was overlooked that a man named Wickham had, previous to 1905, secured from the British Commission, which was then . administering British New Guinea, a twenty -five years' » lease, at a nominal rent, with the option of purchase at about 5s. per acre at any time during the currency of the lease, of some small islands called the Conflict group. Either the Commonwealth had no record of this contract, or ignored its existence  when  passing the Papua Act, with its prohibition against the alienation of further land. Only one case is involved, and, to meet it, it is proposed to insert in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of section 20 of the Papua Act, after the words " disposed of," the words " except in pursuance of rights of purchase acquired under the law of British New Guinea before the commencement of this Act." After the Act was passed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickham</inline> demanded his title, and it was agreed that he should be granted the fee-simple according to his contract; but we found that we had legislated in such a way that it was impossible for us to grant the fee simple without remedying the technical defect in the existing legislation. A dispute arose, not about the granting of the land, because that had been definitely promised, but about the area. The Government were wrongly informed that it comprised 3,000 acres. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickham</inline> would not sign the contract for 3,000 acres, and subsequently, after investigation and survey, the area turned out to be only 1,800 acres. A contract having been deliberately entered into by the British Government, I do not think it was the intention or desire of this Parliament to cancel it. </para>

                    <para>- That might be a  way  out of the difficulty, but he has shown no desire for compensation; he simply wants the contract carried out. A contract made with a Government should be regarded as sacred, and carried out, although I am not enthusiastic about alienating further land in Papua. We feel bound to honour the contract which was deliberately made at the time, and we are introducing no new principle into our legislation. I have been through the whole of the facts, and find that an obvious mistake was made by the officers of the Department of that day. Parliament should not, by a subterfuge or misbake, deprive a man of any rights which he holds under a contract with the British Government. </para>

                <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para class="block">There is no vital principle involved. The object of the measure is largely to correct mistakes made in previous drafting, and, as far as possible, to facilitate the work under the Act of 1905. Under that Act, it is provided that at midnight on a certain day the head of the household is responsible for filling in correctly the details demanded on the Census card. It is also provided that boats, other than Australian coastal boats, if they are at a port, have to supply the Census particulars; but if they are sailing between two Australian ports they have not to do so. This seems to be unfair, because those on board, even if they are not Australians, are for the time being actually living; in Australia, getting their living here, and participating in the general work of the community. We provide, therefore, in order to make the law uniform, that, irrespective of whether the boat is British or otherwise, Census returns have to be made so long as the boat is in Australian waters at the time. I think that is a sound proposition. </para>
                <para>Another difficulty is that under the Act as it stands people assisting in the collection of Census particulars in scattered districts are supposed, in order to insure fealty and secrecy, to make an affidavit before a Commissioner for taking affidavits. There may not be such a Commissioner within hundreds of miles, and as no great responsibility is involved, we believe that the method should be modified and permission given for a declaration to be taken before any responsible witness in such circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, that is so. Another point has arisen, owing to faulty draftsmanship in the original Act. Under this measure authority is given for the collection of certain information, but there is no legal provision for its publication, and, as the information is obtained for this purpose, we desire to authorize the Chief Census Officer to obtain and prepare such information for publication! It would also appear that heavy penalties are to be imposed in respect of several technical offences, whereas the intention was to confine the imposition of this penalty to one particular section of the Act. In this Bill it is proposed to make the limitation definite, because there is no desire to impose heavy penalties for minor breaches. Then, again, there is no obligation upon the licensee of an hotel or keeper of a boarding house to observe secrecy in connexion with the taking of a census, and it is thought to be very desirable to remedy the Actin this particular. Other matters referred to are questions of detail which can be better dealt with in Committee. </para>

                <para class="block">That this Bill be now read a second time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator THOMAS</inline> (N/ew South Wales) [3.25]. - I am very pleased that, at last, the Government have made a beginning with the long promised amendment of the Public Service Act. I am employing no exaggerated language when I say that' there is a great deal of unrest and disorganization throughout the Public Service at the present time. This, of course, is only to be expected, because there is a considerable amount of unrest in the general community as the aftermath of the war, and, of course, the Public Service is likewise affected. But much of this unrest could have been averted by the proper organization of the Department. For many years now we have had an Acting Public Service Commissioner, and most of his officers have been doing administrative work in an acting capacity. I have brought this question before the Senate on several occasions. When last I referred to it, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was good enough to inform the Senate that one of the reasons why wo should have an Acting Commissioner and staff was that the Government were contemplating making some alterations in the Public Service Act, and, as the Public Service "Commissioner's appointment was for seven years, it would be undesirable to make the appointments in view of the pending alterations contemplated. The Acting Commissioner has now been "acting" for over five years, and still we have had no alteration in the Act. I believe that, if a Commissioner had been appointed, instead of an Acting Commissioner, and if he had been assisted by a properly appointed staff, even if we had to compensate the Commissioner and his staff, the money would have been well spent by giving them, if necessary, full pay for the unexpired term of their office. </para>
                <para>The most ungenerous critics of the Government cannot say that there has been any undue haste in the amendment of the Public Service Act. Two Bills have now been circulated. We have to thank the Minister for Defence for his lucid second-reading speeches. I thought at first that these Bills were the measures referred to, but I find that there is still another, and the main Bill, to .be dealt with. These are preliminary measures, no doubt important in their way, but it appears to me that if we pass them before we know definitely what are. the intentions of the Government with regard to their main Bill, we shall be placing- the cart before the horse. The Senate is legitimately entitled to know approximately the number of civil servants and the number of Departments that are to como under the proposed Board of- Management, and those which are to be exempt. The Bill we . are now discussing purports to dispense with the Public Service Commissioner, and appoint in his place a Board; and if that is so, we should be given some information on the lines I have indicated. When, dealing with the other measure relating to the Public Service, the second reading of which has already been moved, we should also be supplied with similar particulars. There are some Departments that cannot be dealt with by the proposed Board of Management unless there is an amendment of the principal Act; and if we hand over to the proposed Board only those Departments that are now under the Act, we can deal only with those Departments now controlled by the Public Service Commissioner, and not those that are exempt. This information should be at our disposal- before we are asked to agree to the appointment of a Board. </para>
                <para>I desire to say, quite frankly, that I stand for the Public Service Act in its fundamentals and essentials, and' honorable senators who have been here for the last three years will admit that on every occasion when I have had the opportunity I have championed its provisions. The principal Act is twenty years old, and we have to remember' that it was framed by a Parliament composed of men representing States where, no Public Service Act was in force, and ' others where there was legislation with differing provisions. During the course of twenty years, many situations have arisen which have necessitated an amendment of the principal measure. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with those Departments that do not come under the Public Service Act; bub, im. the main, I think the measure has. worked fairly well. The fact that the Government propose to appoint a Board, of three in place of a Commissioner shows that there is need of some change. I am strongly in favour of a permanent, staff, because I believe that when men  have  a security of tenure they are more likely to perform their work more efficiently. In the Government Service,/ however, there is more reason why we should provide for continuity of' employment than in other work, because the experience gained in Government Departments, especially in those under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, is of very little use . to a civil servant if he should seek employment, elsewhere. If, for instance, a letter- ' carrier, or sorter, a" telegraphist or a postmaster, was dismissed; or for some other reason had to leave the Service, it would be difficult for him to find suitable employment elsewhere. A miner, an  engi-neer,  or any experienced tradesman, on ' leaving employment in one service can very easily find work elsewhere; but that is not so in the case of Government officials. It therefore behoves us, as a Parliament, to protect our servants by providing that their employment shall be continuous. On the other hand. Parliament has the right to see that the interests of the general public are conserved by maintaining an efficient Service, and it is the duty of Parliament, as far as possible, to see that these two interests are protected. </para>

                    <para>I do not hesitate to say that in the matter of dismissals the rights and interests of those in the Service should be most zealously and rigidly protected. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will permit me to explain. There may be honorable senators present who may not have had the opportunity of closely studying the legislation covering the Public Service that has been passed during recent years. When a person in the Public Service is deemed to be inefficient, he is suspended by the head of his Department; . and in1 this connexion I may quote as an illustration the case of a letter-carrier. He is held to be inefficient. The  Deputy  Postmaster-General may send him before an Appeal Board consisting of three members of the Public Service, one of whom must be a representative of the Division to which the accused officer belongs. This representative is elected to the position by the members of his own Branch once in every three years. Consequently the accused person is practically appealing to a tribunal consisting of three fellow employees, one of whom is the elected representative of his Division. In such circumstances it is obvious that at least one vote will be cast in favour of the alleged inefficient. Experience, too, has shown that it is very difficult indeed to induce one of the other two members constituting the Board, to affirm that he is inefficient. As a result he is restored to the Service, and the Commonwealth has to pay him for the time that he has been under suspension. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely stating what is the law at present. To ray mind, the existing position does not tend to efficiency. Again, .there are quite a number of officers in our Public Service who are deemed to be inefficient by their superior officers, but who are not cited to appear before an Appeal Board for the simple reason that those superior officers know that that -Board would not declare them to be inefficient. I will quote a case which is typical of my argument. ' Some time ago I had the pleasure of being a colleague of the present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in the Government of that day, and I have a very vivid recollection that the secretary of the Department over which I presided used frequently to come to me with a request that a very prominent officer of the general staff should be allowed to visit one of the States for the purpose of dealing with some matter of moment. So pronounced did this practice become that at length I began to wonder whether this particular officer on the general staff did not desire to fill in a weekend somewhere. Accordingly I remarked to the secretary of the Department, " It looks as if this were a sort of week-end business. Cannot the officer in the particular State that is concerned deal with this work? " and I was told " No, he cannot be trusted." Thereupon I remarked, " Then he is not fit for his job," to which the secretary replied, "I admit that. I confess that he is inefficient.'' I then said to the secretary, " That being so, why do you not suspend him?"  His  answer was, " I will suspend him if you like. All that you have to do is to say that he is to be suspended, and I will go before the Appeal Board and testify that in my judgment he is inefficient. The head of his own Branch at the central office will say that in his opinion he is incapable of satisfactorily discharging his duties. But I want you to understand exactly what will happen. He will be tried by the Board appointed for the purpose, and the chances are ninety-nine or a hundred to one that two of the number of that body will say that he is efficient. Consequently he will have to be restored to his office ; and where then will be your position as Minister and my position as secretary of the Department?" In the circumstances it was useless for me to proceed further. </para>

                            <para>- I have already explained that all three members of that body are civil servants. One of those members is elected, bv the officers of the Branch to which the accused belongs. In :  our Public Service there are three Divisions, namely, the Clerical Division, the Professional Division, and the General Division. The Clerical and General Division once in three years elect their own representatives to this Board. Like most representatives he desires to be re-elected, and the result is that instead of acting in a judicial capacity he invariably becomes an advocate. </para>

I know of cases in which the  Deputy  Postmaster-General has sent postmen before the Appeal Board on a charge of inefficiency, but the Board has declared them to be efficient, with the result that they have had to be restored to their employment. I recollect one instance in which an officer had been found guilty of pilfering through the Customs Department </para>

                            <para>- Yes; then after that, he was brought before the Appeal Board, which affirmed that he had done no wrong, and so far as I know, he is still in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Although he had been convicted in . the Courts of the country of pilfering, the Board declared that he was not guilty of that offence, and we had no power to dismiss him. These are matters of very serious moment. It is fair to assume that no Board worthy o£ the name will undertake the management of a big service unless its members know beforehand precisely the powers with which they are to be invested for the purpose of enabling them to satisfactorily discharge their duties. </para>

                    <para>When it was decided to establish the Commonwealth Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the then Prime Minister and Treasurer, had to look about him to discover a man suitable for the position of General Manager of the Bank. He was extremely fortunate in being able to secure the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller. But what did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller say before he accepted the appointment? He said, " I want to know the Act of Parliament under which I am to work." The Act </para>
                    <para>Was  shown to him, and he accepted the position of Governor of the Bank upon the condition that there was to be  no  alteration of the Act without his consent. Of course, Parliament could alter the Act if it pleased, but he would then be in a position, if he did not approve of the alteration, to resign and draw full pay for the remaining years of the seven years' term for which under the Act he was originally to be appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller had a reputation as a banker to maintain, and very naturally be declined to undertake the management of the Commonwealth Bank without knowing exactly what powers he would have to carry out the duties intrusted to him.  </para>
                    <para>It is generally understood that Mr.' Curchin is, for some reason unknown to me, shortly leaving the Federal Service, and the 2Jew South Wales Government  have  been trying to secure his services to supervise shipbuilding on their behalf. Some difficulty has arisen in connexion with his engagement by the !New South Wales Government, and I understand that it is  clue  to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curchin</inline> requires to. know what powers he will have before he accepts the appointment offered to him. It is very reasonable that he should make such a demand, because he has to consider his reputation as a shipbuilder, and he may feel that,  Unless  he is invested with certain powers, he will not be able to successfully perform the duties of his office.  </para>
                    <para>I  have no doubt that it would be possible to find men willing to accept without any conditions positions as members of the proposed Board of Management of the Public Service by offering them  £700  or  £1,000  a year; but if we are to secure men of the type we require they shall need to know definitely the powers which will be given to them to enable them to carry out their work. The Minister may reply that no man will accept appointment as a member of the proposed Board until he knows what its powers are to be;  but,  in my opinion, we, as senators creating the Board, should not pass this Bill until we are informed as to the extent of its duties and powers. A private individual' will object to  take  charge of a big concern unless he knows the scope of his duties, and the' powers he will have, because his personal' reputation may be at stake. We have  our reputation as legislators at stake, and if we pass this measure without knowing exactly what it is intended to effect, we may not only lose the little reputation wo have, hut we may legislate in a way which may involve the squandering of millions and bring unhappiness to a great many people. Before I agree to the appointment of the Board, I want to know exactly what work it will be called upon to perform. Are we or are we not prepared to scrap a good deal of the machinery of the existing Public Service Act? </para>

The Minister for Defence, in dealing with the powers of the proposed Board of Management to secure the efficiency of the public Departments, said- that the Board would be granted powers that are not vested in the present Public Service Commissioner. I should like to know whether these extended powers to be given to the Board of Management are to be exercised in respect of the Departments now under the Public Service Commissioner, or is the Board to have powers of supervision, inspection, or investigation over other Departments such as the Defence Department, which is not, under the existing law, subject to the Public Service Commissioner? </para>

I do not think that it is a report which should be flung on the table one day. and that next day we should be called upon to deal with the measure with which it is concerned.

Until we know what the main Bill will finally contain we shall be unable to say exactly what  duties the Board of Management, provided for in the Bill now under consideration, will be called upon to perform. </para>

                    <para>I have dealt with the subject of dismissals from the Public Service. Another matter of very great importance is the condition' upon which people may enter the Service. Entry into the Public Service under the existing Act is by competitive examination. I stand very strongly for the continuance of that policy. I do not believe in the exercise of personal, social, or political influence to secure admission to the Public Service. When I say that I stand strongly for the policy of examination, I do not mean that I am committed exactly to the present system. It is obvious  that after twenty years' experience it may have been discovered that that system is capable of modification and improvement. To this I do not object, but I want to know whether there is to be any alteration, and,, if so, what, or whether the system of entrance by examination is to continue exactly is it was before. I should rather have liked to discuss more particularly some parts of this Bill, but I have purposely foregone my right to do so, because I feel that, until we see the other Bill of which I spoke, and until that other Bill becomes an Act of Parliament, every senator who discusses this Bill will be doing so in the dark. I wish to say in general terms that I favour the principle of this Bill on three conditions. I cannot say that I support it until I know exactly what is going to happen under the succeeding Bill. If that Bill brings practically all the present civil servants under the Act, and if there is to be an amendment of the section dealing with dismissals - because, while we ought fully and zealously to guard the legitimate rights of the employees, the law ought not to be so rigid as to prevent the dismissal of an inefficient employee - and if, also, entrance to the Public Service is to continue on somewhat similar lines to the present, altheugh it need not necessarily be actually the same word for word, then, granting those three points, I shall be in favour of this Bill. </para>
                    <para>In what I am about to say now I am afraid that I shall stand almost alone so far as the Senate is concerned. I know that the Senate has the same right as the House of Representatives to initiate legislation, except in the case of money Bills. My view is that that right ought not to be used very often. I look upon the Senate, not only as the custodian of the rights of the States - which is an important function in itself - but as a second Chamber charged with the duty of review. It is our duty to deal with Bills calmly, coolly, and dispassionately when the come to us from another place, where they have had to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> through the heat and passion of partyism. If we are  to continue to pass Bills for another Chamber to review, we shall be placing ourselves upon the level of that Chamber. If we carry out our true function of revision of legislation coolly and leisurely, then, when a Bill has passed through our hands and become an Act of Parliament, it will be as nearly perfect as human wisdom and ingenuity can make it. But if we initiate legislation and send it down to another place for revision by them, we not only lower the dignity of this Chamber, but furnish another strong reason for doing away with the Senate altogether. </para>
                    <para>I should, like to know what we are called upon to appoint a Board of Management to do. It will depend upon one or two of the matters which I have pointed out whether the Board is to be a useless and expensive, or  a very useful, body. If we grant to these three men no more power than is granted to the Commissioner, even the payment of salaries of £10,000 a year will not make the Board effective, although its members may be good men personally. I remember quoting some words uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster',</inline> the ex-Postmaster-General. We must all admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> made a very honest effort to obtain efficiency in the Service, although I do not hold with all he did, or with many of his methods. Yet, we must give him credit for the efforts he made towards efficiency. He said on one occasion that " There were a number of inefficients  in the Service holding prominent positions; he knew them, and he intended to dismiss them." When I quoted those words of his, I said, " He will not be able to do it. It is too big a task for him. He has not the power to do what he says." I do not know who those  inefficients  are, but not one of them has been dismissed. Every one of them is still in the Service, and likely to remain there. To show that this is no new matter so far as I am  concerned,  I mav be pardoned' for mentioning that when I was Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the then Prime Minister, .suggested to me on more than one occasion that we should engage the ablest maw we could get at a high salary to act as an organizer of the Post and Telegraph Department. I replied on each occasion that until the Public Service Act was amended to enable such a man to- deal with the inefficients  in the Service I was not prepared to spend the money to secure him, because I felt that under existing conditions, even if we paid the ablest organizer available £10,000 a year, he would be powerless. I take it that we shall have to offer considerable salaries in order to get the type of men1 we want to constitute the proposed Board. Even if .we grant them the power to do what we want them to do, they will not be ordinary men, and cannot be easily found. I have no objection to the payment of good salaries in order to secure men who are able to do the work, because, after all, that is the cheapest way to get things done, but unless we grant them full power to carry out their ideas it will be a waste of money to appoint them. We might just as well allow the old machine to rumble along under medium-paid men as appoint a highly-paid Board to try to do impossibilities. In view of these considerations,- I sincerely trust that this Bill will not be proceeded with and passed before the other Bill is before us. </para>

                        <para>. - With very much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has said about this measure generally, and our proceeding with it, I am in accord; but I entirely dissociate myself from the sentiment underlying one of his objections to. our dealing with it at the present time. I refer to his doubt of the expediency of the Senate originating legislation of this character. He argued that if a certain procedure were followed our legislation might be expected to go forth in the best form possible. I venture to question. that assertion. The history of this Parliament shows that in its earlier days much of the fundamental legislation of the Commonwealth, including the Public Service Act itself, was originated in this Chamber, and if the! records of the Courts be investigated it will be found that legislation which originated in this Chamber has stood the test of time and criticism far better than any other legislation on the statute-book. </para>

                    <para>Now, as to this measure and its narrow scope - I use the word " narrow,"' not as referring to the policy incorporated in the measure, but to indicate that it touches only one feature of the administration of the Public Service - I. am at a loss to understand why the Government, in introducing Public Service legislation confine themselves, as they have done in this case, to one single feature," namely, that of general control. Practically the whole of this measure reserves itself into the simple proposition that, instead of the Public Service in the future being administered as heretofore by a Commissioner, it should be administered by a Board. The different provisions of this measure deal -with the constitution of the Board, the delegation of its authority, and certain functions that it shall exercise. </para>

                            <para>- The functions outlined in this measure are contained in a clause which is not exclusive. That is to say, it does not represent the whole of the functions which the Board will exercise. It is simply supplementary, conferring upon, the Board' new functions which hitherto have not been exercised by the Commissioner. It is to be presumed that when the Board comes into existence it will exercise, not only these additional functions, but also those now and heretofore exercised by the Commissioner. Clause 11, therefore, is not exclusive. It is supplementary, or additional, to the functions of the present administrative authority. </para>

                    <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> indicated, the Public Service Act- covers a large number of subjects, many of which are not touched by this Bill or by the Arbitration Bill which accompanies it. The main provisions of the Public Service Act are not touched, either in this Bill or in the other measure introduced by the Minister last week. Those provisions, we are led to believe, will be touched by another, or several other Bills, to be submitted subsequently. I am at a loss to understand why the Government have adopted this procedure. </para>
                    <para>Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I have endeavoured for some years to get an assurance from the Government as to when legislative attention would be given to conditions in the Public Service. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that for some years past, not because of any inherent defect in legislation, but due rather to the changed conditions under which we all find ourselves, there has been a considerable amount of unrest and apprehension throughout the Public Service. There is a feeling that our legislation has not been kept up to date; that, so to speak, it has become out of step with the changed conditions of recent years; and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I have been endeavouring to ascertain when ameliorative legislation was likely to be introduced. In fact, one of my questions was as to the advisability of introducing such legislation in this Chamber, in view of the' fact that another House would be called upon to deal with the Tariff and other important matters which could not be originated here; but the reply given to me was like so many of those characteristically evasive 'answers furnished by Ministers. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that one of the reasons why the Government did not care to originate such legislation ' here was that it would contain a scheme of monetary provisions, such as those dealing with superannuation, which might possibly prevent its origination in this branch of the Legislature. In the measure now before the Senate there will be monetary provision for members of the proposed Board; but those places in the clause dealing with this particular matter have been left blank, so that the amounts might be filled in elsewhere. </para>
                    <para>Stronger justification than has been given by the Minister should be forthcoming to justify this system of legislation by instalments. We are asked to legislate in piecemeal fashion on a very important matter - important not merely to the officers of the Service, but equally important to the whole of the Commonwealth, and I think there is a great deal of force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas's</inline> argument that before we commit ourselves to changing the present system of administration by a Commissioner to administration by a Board, we should have some information as to the functions exercisable by this proposed </para>
                    <para class="block">Board, and to what extent the general legislation will affect the new Service and the new <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline> We have provisions in the existing measure dealing with suspensions, dismissals, promotions, transfers, furlough, leave of absence, and various other matters of that kind. Around every one of these questions there has been a great deal of discussion at some time or other. Wo matter what authority we create for the Public Service administration to the extent we legislate and lay down principles, rules, and laws for the carrying on of the Service, to that extent will the functions and authority of the Board be limited. For this reason we should have some idea of the limitations that may be imposed on the Board in the exercise of its functions. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I believe it would lead to their more expeditious treatment. It is obvious that in the consideration of this Bill honorable senators will be unable to ramble into all those fields of debate open to them when considering the principal measure; and it will be impossible to introduce amendments that are not relevant to the scope of the Bill, namely, control and control only. For that reason I think the Government might very well circulate the principal Bill, so that in the debate upon the two measures now before the Senate we may know exactly what we are doing. </para>

                        made reference to the Public Service Commissioner's report, which, I believe, has been in the hands of the Government for about two years. I can quite understand that the Government have not had an opportunity of dealing exhaustively with it, because, while nearly two years have elapsed since the signing of the armistice, there has been an immense amount of legislative and administrative work to be cleared up after the war. I do not blame the Government for undue delay, as I know every Minister's hands have been very full of late; but it would be desirable, before we commit ourselves to any important changes in the administration of the Public Service, to have some idea of the general scheme which, we may presume, has been outlined by the late Commissioner.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline>
                        occupied the position of Commissioner since the first Public Service Act was framed. He was a very efficient officer and saw the Commonwealth Public Service grow to its present dimensions, and his reports have always given honorable senators and members of another place food for serious reflection. It may be assumed that his report takes a very broad and comprehensive outlook of the future development of the Service, and, therefore, it would assist us considerably if we had an opportunity of considering
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline>
                        recommendations.
                    </para><para>I am not averse to the constitution of a Board to act in the place of the Public Service Commissioner, though I do not know that the Minister gave any good reason why the office of Commissioner should be abolished. In other words, I do not think the demerits of the present system were pointed out by the. Minister during his second-reading speech. Nor do I think that he indicated the superlative merits of control by a Board; but there seems to be a disposition on the part of the Government and honorable senators to accept the new proposal, and, personally, I know of no good reason why it should not. At all events, we shall not be making a leap in the dark, because I think the Public Service, in more than one of the States, is 'under' the control of Boards, and I believe that the New Zealand Public Service is so controlled.' Therefore the Board system is no new proposal, and perhaps, as the Commonwealth Public Service has grown considerably, there may be some advantage in placing it under the control of a Board of three. </para><para class="block">But, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I would very much like to know whether the Board will have jurisdiction which the present Commissioner does not enjoy, and particularly in relation to such matters as suspension, dismissals, promotions, and transfers. These are all very important subjects upon which we should have some information before we commit ourselves to this important change. I do not know that I can add anything further. This measure is for one purpose only, but I hope the Minister will accept the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> and, before expecting honorable senators to pass this Bill, will make available to us <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McLachlan's  report, so that we may have some indication of general Public Service legislation contemplated for the future. </para></speech>

                    </continue><para>I desire to congratulate the Government on having brought this measure forward, because we are all viewing with alarm the great increase in public expenditure which, at times,- seems almost- uncontrollable. I have already referred to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Storey</inline> to the effect that if the people of New South Wales do not work together, there will be a " Black Wednesday " before very long. By a Black Wednesday, I presume he means a crisis, and a possibility of the civil servants not being paid. I remember a " Black Thursday " in Victoria, which caused a great deal of distress, and I am sure we all earnestly hope that every effort will be made by those in authority to prevent anything of the kind again occurring. </para><para>The Government are to be commended for giving effect to some extent to the report of the Economies Commission. During the election campaign, it was promised that the recommendations of that Commission would be adopted, and that a Board would be appointed to control the Civil Service, with powers similar to those which are now provided, but which need amplification. It is very desirable to' have an outside Board in control of the Civil - Service, as the great difficulty in the past appears to have been that no one was responsible for seeing that the work undertaken was efficiently and economically conducted. It was admitted in evidence before the Economies Commission that the Public Service Commissioner did not consider that he was in charge of the Departments, and that he did not regard himself as a person exercising control over any particular Department. He was asked if the heads of the Departments were responsible for the economical working of their Departments, and ' he replied that they were chiefly occupied in seeing members of Parliament. Ministers have admitted that they have not the time to look into the details of their Departments, and to see whether they are efficiently managed or not. The Bill is, therefore, the outcome of the recommendations of the Economies Commission, which suggested that a Board should be appointed to see that the work was done on business lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said that the Public Service Commissioner has done very well, and he has up to a point. I think it was his duty to examine applicants for positions, and make recommendations; and, so far as I have been able to judge, he was an excellent man for the position.. </para><para>When I was a member of the State Parliament, I was scandalized because of the extraordinary conditions existing in the Lands Office, where practically every officer had a room to himself. The building was a three-storied one, and if an officer on the ground floor required information from one on the top floor, he had, until quite recently, to walk upstairs to obtain what he required, thu9 involving much loss of time. In our large banking institutions and merchants' offices, the work is all undertaken in one large hall, and with the exception of heads of Departments, the officers are in close touch with one another. Some similar arrangement should be made in connexion with our big Departments, as there are too many rooms. </para><interjection>

Honorable senators have today been supplied with a memorandum from the various bodies constituting the Civil Service, setting out that, in their opinion, the third member of the Board - who is to serve for a term of three years - should be an officer nominated by the Civil Service. This is following out the procedure which has been followed in many parts of the world, and also the recommendations of the Whitley Commission, and I earnestly suggest that the Government take this suggestion into consideration. The Public Service could nominate three men and the Minister could then select one from the three names submitted; but I would not like to see it made compulsory, because I do not know whether the system is one that would be beneficial. </para></speech>

                            <para>- No. But I hope the Minister for Defence will obtain further information on that point. I do not want to see such a provision incorporated in the Bill, because it is somewhat of an experiment. Perhaps the Minister for Defence will be prepared to look into the matter, and, if he cannot give good reasons to the contrary, will agree to appoint the third member in the way I have suggested. I understand that the members of the Board are to be appointed for three, four, and five years, to insure continuity of policy, and the appointment of a representative of the Service for a period of three years is, perhaps, an experiment worth trying. </para>

It seems to me that the very foundations of the Service are destroyed if an officer cannot be dismissed, either by the Minister or some other responsible authority. I quite agree with the honorable senator that we must jealously guard the rights and privileges of our public servants; but when an Appeal Board, composed exclusively of members of the Service, condones such grave offences as theft, we must realize how utterly impossible it is to countenance its continuance. Unquestionably, that is the reason why many inefficients  are retained in 'the Service. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I would like to see the power to which I have referred vested in the proposed Board instead of in the Governor-General. Indeed, I think that the Board should consist of two business men and one representative of the Public Service, in order that the rights of our public servants should be adequately safeguarded. Most certainly, the Board should be clothed with the power to dismiss any officer who is inefficient. In the absence of such a power, we shall never get efficiency. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Obviously, the success or otherwise of the scheme will depend upon the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Board. If that body consists of two business men and of a third member who is elected by the Public Service, we shall give the recommendation of the Whitley Commission a really good trial. The Board will be able to introduce into our Departments modern ideas in regard to administration. </para>

                    <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that the appointment of our public servants should, as far as possible, be of a permanent character. Temporary appointments are responsible for a good deal of the discontent which exists at the present time. A man is appointed for six months, at the end of which period he has to retire to make room for somebody else. The Labour party was responsible for the introduction of that provision some years ago, but now I understand that its members desire to see it abolished. I repeat that temporary employees constitute a disturbing element throughout the Commonwealth Service. I hope that the proposed Board will assure permanent employment to the officers actually required, and that it will be able to substantially reduce the number of temporary employees. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware that a great number of temporary hands eventually secure permanent appointments. When we come to examine the Budget which will shortly be presented, we shall doubtless find that hundreds and thousands of men have been appointed, year after year, merely for a tenure of six months. If their services are absolutely required, why not appoint them to permanent positions? If our Public Service were conducted upon lines similar to those which obtain in ordinary businesses, it would be found that a great many men, who could find a better outlet for their energies in other avocations, could be dispensed with. Instead of occupying a precarious position, and being at the beck and call of successive Governments, they would be able to find regular employment, and thus be substantially better off. Under existing conditions, we cannot have a contented Public Service. I hope that we shall introduce a few amendments in the Bill with a view to making it more effective, particularly in the direction I have indicated. I trust that the proposed Board will be constituted on the lines I have laid down, and that it will consist of two business men of proved capacity, and one representative of the Public Service. This Board must be clothed with the power of dismissing incompetent officers, otherwise we shall never get good results. </para>

                        <para>.- After perusing this Bill which was so ably introduced by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> I have arrived at the conclusion that the object of its submission is to enable Parliament to determine whether the time has not arrived when a change should be made in the control of our Public Service. The language used by the Minister in moving the second reading of the measure caused me to look very carefully into the interim report of the Economies Commission with the result that I have been impelled to conclude that there is ample justification for its introduction. The Minister stated that - </para>

                    <para class="block">I maintain that in view of the very heavy obligations with which Australia is confronted, and of the wonderful expansion of our Public Service, it is high time that every effort was made to secure not only the most efficient, but the most economical service. Notwithstanding all the protestations on the part of Commonwealth and State Governments regarding the need for economy, one cannot fail to notice that during the past few years economy in connexion with our Government Departments has not been the order of the day. I welcome a measure of this description, which has for its object the bringing about of a better order of things in our Public Service. I listened very carefully to the speeches which have been delivered this afternoon, and I agree with many of the statements contained therein. I recognise that in the best interests of Australia it is essential that we should have a contented Public Service. If we desire to secure efficient officers we must see that they are assured continuity of service under reasonably favorable terms. But at the same time there has been brought under my notice during the past few years the necessity not only for securing continuity of service to efficient officers, but also of insuring to the taxpayers that where efficient service is not rendered, such service shall cease. Under existing legislation we have not been able to achieve that result. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> stated that in his opinion any officer who is not rendering efficient service for the money he is receiving should be obliged to retire. The principal Act contains no provision of that character, but there is a clause in this Bill which sets out that where a Department is overmanned any officer in excess of the number required, may be transferred to another Department, and if there be no other Department requiring his service, such officer may be called upon to resign. That, I think, is a very good provision, and I certainly approve of the suggestion which has been made that the Public Service of the Commonwealth should be accorded some representation on the proposed Board. That appears to be only a reasonable thing. The suggestion put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> that the Public Service should have the right to nominate three of their number, of whom one should be selected to sit with the other two members of the Board, is an admirable one. </para>
                    <para>Upon page 85 of the report of the Economies Commission reference is made to some very important matters. Amongst other things I find the following statement - </para>

                        <item label="S.">
                            <para>It is somewhat of an anomaly that no authority independent of the Departments concerned has been set up for the purpose of seeing that satisfactory value is obtained for the amounts paid. There is no effective check upon Departments to see that staff is not employed except when really necessary, and, when appointed, is fully employed on useful work, and that material and other property purchased is actually required, and that good value is obtained for the money spent. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">Provided that the report of the Commission is based upon reasonable evidence I submit that that paragraph, in itself, is a sufficient justification for the introduction of this Bill. </para>
                    <para>I do not desire to speak at further length on this Bill, as I understand that the main measure dealing with the Public Service has yet to be introduced. It has been suggested that tie final consideration of this Bill should be delayed until the main measure is in our hands. I think that is a reasonable suggestion, because the two measures are so wrapped up one with the other that they ought to be considered together; The principle of this Bill, which is the appointment of a Board of Management to take the place of the present Public Service Commissioner, has my hearty support. If we can secure the right men to form the proposed Board and to supervise the ramifications of our extensive Public Service we shall serve the interests of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>I express the hope that when the Bill gets into Committee some amendments will be accepted to make it more effective. I may refer to one amendment which, in my opinion, is essential. The Bill provides that if the permanent head of a Department does not approve of or adopt a recommendation, report, or suggestion of the Board he shall within a reasonable time inform the Board of his reasons therefor, and the measure then goes on to provide that the Board may, "if it thinks fit," make the recommendation, report, or suggestion to the Minister administering the Department. My view of the matter is that the Minister should be kept informed' of every recommendation made for the more efficient working of his Department, and it should be the duty of the Board of Management, if a recommendation by them is turned down by a head of a Department, to furnish the Minister with the reasons. We should not, I think, place in the hands of the Board the power to make recommendations, and at the same time make it optional with it to decide whether or not it shall report to the Minister recommendations turned down by the head of a Department. </para>

                        <para>.- My remarks upon this Bill will be very brief. I approve of the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> to defer its final consideration. I am not an ardent believer in the present management of the Public Service. Within the last few 'years, in connexion with the work of the Department so ably controlled by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> we have had a very good opportunity to form judgment as to the advantages of adopting a different method. None of the employees of .that Department are under the existing Public Service Act. Only recently we passed a Bill amending the Repatriation Act and establishing a Commission to deal with that Department, only I venture to say that if that experiment as applied to the Repatriation Department is proved to be successful, it might not be an altogether undesirable thing to appoint a similar Board of Management to control each Government Department. As honorable senators generally appear to favour the proposed substitution of a Board of Management for the existing Public Service Commissioner, I shall not deal further with that aspect of the question beyond saying that the Repatriation Department is carried on in a. business-like way, and has done such eminently satisfactory work in. the last few years that its example might well be followed. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>When the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was moving the second reading of this Bill, I asked him how many of the members of the proposed Board of Management would be appointed by the employees of the Public Service. I think it is not unreasonable to ask that the employees of the Public Service should have the right to appoint one of the members of the Board. Times out of number it has been stressed by members of the present Government, and by many honorable senators, that the problem of industrial unrest in this country may be solved by giving the employees in any industry direct representation on the boards of directors of companies carrying on that industry. After all, the proposed Board of Management will be practically a board of directors of the Public Service, and I. think it would he of advantage to the Service generally if one of its members were appointed by the public servants. </para>
                    <para>If no other member of the Senate does so, I shall be prepared when the Bill is in Committee to move that no member of the proposed Board shall be a person who has previously been connected with the Public Service. I think that the three men appointed should be persons who have never during the course of their lives been associated with the red-tape methods existing in the Service. </para>
                    <para>I think I shall not be prophesying wrongly if I say that the Government have already in mind the persons to be appointed to two of the positions on the proposed Board of Management. I think I could mention the names of two persons whom the Government intend to appoint to these positions when this Bill becomes law. </para>

                    <para>Service, the result would he satisfactory. I had some small experience of the advantage of having upon a Board a representative appointed by the employees themselves. On many occasions I acted as secretary to a Railway Appeal Board in Queensland. That Board was constituted of a police magistrate, the head of the Department concerned, and a representative of the employees of that Department. I am able to say that, in connexion with all matters dealt with by that Board when I was present, the representative of the employees gave an unbiased decision. The practice of having upon an Appeal Board a representative of the employees gave very satisfactory results indeed in Queensland. </para>
                    <para>When the Bill gets into Committee I shall submit the amendments I have now indicated, because I believe that their adoption would be in the interests of the Public Service. If the Public Service of Australia is to be efficient, it must be a satisfied Service. A Public Service seething with discontent is not likely to be efficient. If we have on the Board of Management a man of the type I have suggested, who will be a direct representative of the employees of the Service, I am sure that will give satisfaction to the Service generally. </para>
                    <para>I notice that the salaries to be paid to the members of the Board of Management are not fixed by the Bill. I think that good salaries should be offered, to insure the appointment of the right class of men. I hope that the salaries will not be fixed by the Government, but by Parliament. I indorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> as to the wisdom of deferring the consideration of this Bill. The Government will, I am sure, meet the wishes of many members of the Senate if they will agree to defer its consideration until the other measures dealing with the Public Service are before us. </para>

I should be glad if it were possible for the Government to include in this measure provision for a psychological laboratory and an efficiency engineer. The tendency of these remarks appears to be to bring a smile to the faces of some honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- Probably the honorable senator is not acquainted with what has been done by psychological laboratories in Germany, America, and England. Honorable senators may not realize the results which may be secured by the efforts of an efficiency engineer such as Taylor, as they may not know what he achieved in connexion with some of the great organizations of  America. If the efficiency which he produced could be added to our Public Service, it would materially improve the outlook of the units of that Service. </para>

                    <para>What is the position to-day ? We have a man in the Launceston Post-office who has a record of twenty-two years' service, and is receiving £189 per annum. I say that there is something seriously wrong about that. Where a man receives such a salary, dissatisfaction is inherent in him, because he cannot live upon such an amount. How are we to remedy that state of thing3? It may be done by the application of psychology, a term which seems to amuse some honorable senators, but it is a very important thing. Consider its achievements in the realms of education, law and medicine. </para>
                    <para>When Bice went into the matter of the application of psychology to education, he altered the system of spelling, very much to the betterment of the children. Where memory work is taught by the direct method, their powers of memory are very much increased. Read in Van der Donck's <inline font-style="italic">Application of Psychology to Law,</inline> of a case in Belgium on 21st June, 3930. Three children were out playing. One child disappeared and the two other children came home. When those two were asked what  had became of their playmate, they said that at a certain period in the afternoon she had gone away. The Police Commissioner appeared to the children at three o'clock in the morning, asking for information, with the result that one child said that at the particular moment when the other child disappeared " there was a man there with a black beard who enticed her away." That created a situation which allowed a considerable amount of suspicion to be thrown on the parents of one of the children. An anonymous letter to the Law Department caused the arrest of the man, and it appeared that he was likely to be hanged on the child's evidence. As he was being taken to gaol he was nearly torn to pieces by an infuriated multitude. Van der Donck was employed, by the defence to go into the question from the psychological point of view. This is how he proceeded : He took twenty-two children and asked them to tell him the colour of the beard of one of the teachers of the school, naming a certain teacher. Seventeen children said he had a black beard, two said they did not know, and the other answers are not indicated. As a matter of fact, the teacher had no beard at all. Another twenty children were taken, and the teacher said to them, " Do you remember at d-ill time that a certain man came to. me and said something to me?" Seven said "Yes." The rest were undecided. The teacher then asked, " Do you not remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 80-and-So</inline> came and .spoke, to .me?" Seventeen out of the twenty said " Yes." As a matter of fact no such incident happened. The application of psychology to that case conclusively showed that the child's :"mirid had been acted upon, and that the man who had been arrested was liable to be "hanged on illusory evidence. The Judge found that the original statement of the child made at four o'clock in the. afternoon was correct, and the rest mere imagination. I -could give similar instances in medicine. </para>
                    <para>Now let me deal with industry. Several psychological laboratories were erected in America for the purpose of finding out definitely the dexterity of the employees of some of the big corporations. A board somewhat similar to a cribbage board, but with considerably more holes, arid not of the same pattern, is taken. At the én'd of the- board is 'placed a box for matches -without -heads. The person <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be tested is told that at a given signal he is to pick up the matches and put them into the different holes. At another signal he  is  to stop. The result is that some of those tested could put in only ten matches, some fourteen, and some twenty. The conclusion drawn from this test was that those who could put in only ten would not be efficient under any scheme of work which required dexterity of fingers, that those who could put in fourteen would be only average, while those who could put in twenty were segregated from the others, because they would be extremely efficient. Another way of testing in a psychological laboratory is as follows : A board is provided with certain holes, and above each hole is a number. On the wall in front of the person tested is thrown a figure which is visible for two seconds. He then has to take a match and put it into the hole which the figure indicates. That is a test of both perception and dexterity. Surely that would be a most effective way of finding out whether a telephone 'operator was efficient or not. </para>
                    <para>Further, these laboratories deal with the questions of fatigue and motion study.- Gilbreth was invited' _ by a large corporation of softgoods people to find an efficient scheme for folding handkerchiefs. That does not seem very difficult, but his scheme, .when put into operation, enabled the girls to multiply the number of handkerchiefs folded by three. Some people may object that that was speeding-up. I shall indicate later what my view of speeding-up^ is.  Gilbreth worked in this way: He divided the hour into ten portions of six. minutes each. For the first four portions he made the girl sit down at a table on a chair that brought her arms within easy contact with it. She was to remain seated there for twenty-four minutes, and to. work for five minutes and rest one minute in each period. At the end of the twenty-four minutes she was to stand up fbr eighteen minutes and to work for five minutes and rest one during each six minute period. For the next two periods she could either sit or stand, as she pleased, but she was to 'work five' minutes arid  Test  one. In the last period she was not to. work at all, but to allow the muscles to' be, as" it -were, regenerated after the fatigue. The result was' .that  three times as much work was accomplished as previously. </para>
                    <para class="block">Let me give an example of Taylor's work.  Taylorism  has been given rather a bad name in Australia, but I have learned that Lenin has asked Taylor to go to Russia and inaugurate his schemes there. Taylor was consulted in regard to the Bethlehem Steel. Works - a proposition which has to handle pig iron. The weight of the pig iron is about 95 lbs. After a considerable amount of work in a psychological laboratory, Taylor found that a man could only work efficiently 43 per cent, of his time, and must rest 57 per cent. He selected a man and ordered him to dp exactly what the timekeeper » instructed - " You are to work seven minutes and rest ten." The men up till then had been handling on an"' average <inline font-style="italic">12\</inline> tons per diem. After Taylor instituted his new 'scheme they did on an average 47£ tons per diem, although they were working only 43 per cent, of their time. That is efficiency. People in Australia say, and have said, "Yes, but all this is only done by speeding up." Let me indicate to the Senate what I consider to be speeding-up. I have here a paper on which is certain) printed matter that I want copied. I am not capable of copping it  myself.  The man who can copy it for me can do so only in block type, and it will take him, say, six hours. If I say to him, "I will give you a bonus if you do it in five hours," then I am definitely and clearly speeding him up. But if I educate him to do this work for me in script, and he can do it in an hour, that is not speeding-up, but the application of psychology to  industry. </para>
                    <para>Our Public Service absolutely requires the application of this  system,  and many of the corporations of Australia could well benefit by it also. When the American Federation of Labour mcc early last year, they said they believed that without the application of science to industry labour could not go beyond a certain point, but that, with it, they could look forward to a considerable addition »o their present rate of wages. So far as the Public Service is concerned, there, could be an index card showing each man's efficiency. I do not say that when you find a man's  inefficiency  is low for the work he is doing you should dismiss him. You will  probably  find that he is efficient in another branch. You should not confine this system only to the employees at the bottom. It should bc applied right up to the executive heads, in order to ascertain if they are giving the people efficient service. And you should see that those employed are well paid. I thoroughly believe that, if you adopted the card system and indexed every man after  psycho-logical  observations and under efficiency engineers, you would be able to pick out 98 per cant, of the men and tell definitely and exactly what they could do, in what way they could benefit themselves, and in that way they could benefit the Service. Surely this would be a step in the right direction. If the great steel works of America, which employ considerably more men than our Public . Service, can afford- to adopt a scheme of this description, and if some of the great German corporations found, it absolutely essential to take on something of the kind. Australia might well stand in and decide to try it in connexion with the Public Service of the Commonwealth. ' I want to see some method adopted whereby we can increase the comfort and better the conditions of. living of the men in the Service. I want to see their citizenship raised to the highest possible limit, but not altogether at the expense of the taxpayer. If w© can show that it is possible to produce certain results by adopting a system such as I have described, with efficiency engineers and the application of the results obtained in our psychological laboratories; if we can tell the people of Australia that by this means we can give them a much more efficient Service, which will go a long way towards doing away with the trouble and annoyance that sometimes exist between the Service and the public, surely we shall be conferring a benefit on the whole community. We have a great body of men to deal with, and we have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that absolute inefficiency can exist in the Service without any power to cope with it. This shows that we are confronted by a most serious problem. If we appoint  a Board of three, and they have no index to the efficiency of  the  employees in the Public Service, I cannot see how they can give the public efficiency except by guess-work. If we multiplied the members of the Board by twelve, we should be no better off than, under one Commissioner, unless the thing is worked on a scientific basis. </para>
                    <para>I compliment the Government on having brought forward this Bill. The Service is seething with discontent, and I believe that the measure is an attempt to move in the right direction. I sincerely trust that in Committee we shall be able to induce the Government to add a psychological laboratory to the existing equipment, and efficiency engineers to the staff, so that we may secure the most efficient Public Service possible. </para>

                        <para>.- I also congratulate the Government upon having introduced this measure in pursuance of their pledges, and I believe that .the Government should endeavour to get the best possible men for the proposed Board of Management, irrespective of where they come from. If * they are to be found in the Service, by all means let them be appointed. I disagree entirely with the suggestion that the Board should be constituted by election. The most important consideration is to get the very best men. I believe also that the fullest power should be given to the Board. Its members should not be hampered in any way in their administrative duties, and if for any reason the responsible Minister sets aside their recommendations, there should be an appeal to Parliament. Only in this way may we expect to bring about a rapid change from inefficiency, which is complained of, to efficiency. I also agree with the suggestion that authority to dismiss should be added to the other powers of the Board, whose hands should be strengthened to the uttermost in order to deal with any condition of inefficiency in the Service. With the main provisions of the Bill, I am absolutely in accord. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> mentioned that associations formed within the Service should be on the lines of the Whitley Commission, and in regard to this matter, when the companion Bill is under consideration, I shall undoubtedly favour the inclusion of some provision whereby members of the different organizations-there  may be dozens of them in the Commonwealth Public Service - may be associated with the Arbitrator, but I shall absolutely oppose any suggestion to associate them with the Board of Management, whose duty it will be to see that the Service is carried on efficiently. </para>

                        <para>.- I join with other honorable senators in expressing approval of the  Bill,  and particularly clause 11, which sets out in some detail the duties of the proposed Board. When one takes into consideration the fact that an educational test is required of candidates for the Public Service, one must give them credit for a certain amount of ability to start with, and so I think that some of the inefficiency that has been complained of may be due to the fact that certain officers of the Ser-  vice have not been properly trained "for the jobs which, later in life, they are required to undertake. We have also to remember that, owing to the environment and the circumscribed nature of the work, an officer of the Public Service is not able sometimes to qualify for other duties to the same extent as a man engaged in the outside business world. And so when we, talk about giving the proposed Board power of dismissal, we should not forget that if there is inefficiency, the authorities jure, to some extent, responsible, if they have not made available to these men the opportunity to become efficient for the positions they are called upon to occupy from time to time. Then, as to the constitution of the Board. I hope the Government will see that the men to be appointed are of a calibre similar to that of those associated with the Business Board in the Defence Department. The men required for these positions are not those who are looking for such a job, but men who will have to be chased and to whom a large salary must be offered. It is quite possible that men at the top of the tree, so far as their occupation in the Public Service is concerned, will be quite unsuitable for a position on the proposed Board. Recently in my own State a change was, made from administration by a Public Service Board to administration by a Commissioner, and I know that one gentleman, highly qualified in the Service, had a chance for the position but declined to take it. When I mentioned the matter to him he said - " Well, it's this way. I have been brought up in the Service. I have  been in it for twenty-five or more years, and if I were appointed Commissioner I should have to recommend a lower salary to certain men or else abolish their offices altogether, and they would then be pushed out of the Service. I have been in touch with these men for so many years that I coul'd not do a thing like that. I will not apply for the position." To some extent the Public Service is a close corporation. At all events it is so far as the higher grades are concerned, and it would be extremely difficult for any man, appointed to .the Board from the Public Service to do his duty properly, as he might have to "come down" on somebody who had been in the Service with him for many years. I am rather afraid, also, that the Board will have to work a. good deal of overtime in the matter of reorganizing the Service without performing any of the additional duties to be imposed upon them. Some of the Departments could do with a Business Board to themselves, in order to shake them up. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has told us that this proposed Board will have authority to go into the Defence Department. That is badly wanted, too. </para>

                            <para>- A Business Board was appointed, but I do not know whether it is operating to-day. I know that, during the war, a man in the Defence Department had seven different jobs to perform. He was getting £250 per year, and the Department did not treat him very well after the war. The work which he did in war time is now being done by several men who are costing this country  £1,750  a year. I am not blaming the Minister, because he cannot be expected to know all the details of his Department, but I say, definitely, that we could well afford to have a Business Board attached to each of the big spending Departments of the Commonwealth. It remains to be seen whether the duties laid down will be within the power of the Board to be appointed. There are other matters to which I should like to refer, hut I shall take an opportunity to deal with them in Committee. </para>
