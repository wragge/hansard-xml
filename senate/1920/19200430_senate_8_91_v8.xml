                    <para>.- The new clause inserted by the House of Representatives in this Bill is in accordance with what I told honorable senators on the second reading of the Bill, and subsequently in Committee, was the intention of the trustees of this fund as regards the State machinery to carry out the purposes of the measure. Some honorable senators thought that there should be some specific provision in the Bill to insure that this course would be followed. That did not appear to me to be necessary, because I regarded my statement on the subject as pledging the Government to see that it was given effect. In view of the general expression of opinion in another place, and of honorable senators, the Government have accepted this amendment which makes the obligation to which I pledged the Government a statutory one. The provision made by the amendment for State Advisory Committees to recommend the action to be subsequently taken by the trustees of the Fund will meet the views of honorable senators who expressed themselves as in favour of State representation on the Trust. This proposal will supply the most effective State representation which could be given. The members of the State Advisory Committees will carry out the actual work of investigation of claims upon the Fund, and the trustees as a central body will coordinate their work. The amendment makes provision for the representation of women on the State Advisory Committees, and it is understood that the women representatives will he selected from those who during the war gave a considerable amount of their time to looking after the dependants of soldiers. As it is believed that the appointment of these Committees will supply valuable machinery for giving effect to the purposes of the Bill, I move - </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to know whether the Minister for Defence would consider the insertion of a further clause laying down the basis for the allocation of the Fund. There is nothing in the Bill to show on what basis this money is to be allocated, so far as the States are concerned. I do not know whether I should be in order in submitting an amendment dealing with that matter and providing that the money shall be allocated upon an enlistment basis. </para>

I submit that it would be competent for this Committee to amend the House of Representatives' amendment, or to add to it any matter relevant to the appointment of State Advisory Committees, but the reference to this Committee of the amendment made by the House of Representatives does not bring the whole Bill before us again for review, and it would not be in order now to submit amendments to other portions of the . Bill not relevant to the amendment made 3&gt;y the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- It would be unjust to distribute the funds on the lines indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> because it must be remembered that the money is not to be paid to all soldiers and their dependants, but only to those who are incapacitated, or to soldiers' widows and orphans. It may be said that a high percentage of enlistments would necessarily indicate a high percentage of incapacitated soldiers, but that does not necessarily follow. If the percentage of incapacitated soldiers was low in comparison with the number of enlistments, they would receive a larger share than those in a State where the reverse was the case. They should all be treated on an equal basis, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> after reviewing the matter in this light, will be prepared to withdraw his amendment. </para>

This amendment spreads the administration over all the States, and SenatorFoll has now moved an amendment to provide that the fund shall be disbursed in proportion to the enlistments in the various States. It may be considered a rough-and-ready way of arriving at the proportion, but I think it is a fair basis on which to work. It is unreasonable to assume that one State will have a greater proportion of disabled persons, in comparison with the enlistments, than another. </para>

It appears to me, however, to be a haphazard way of distributing the funds, and the proposal should not have the support of the Committee. I ask the Committee to disagree with the proposed new clause. Honorable senators will remember that when the Bill was before this Chamber a few days ago I endeavoured to dispense with the Trust. </para>

My reasons are largely contained in the arguments put up by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> when the Bill was previously before us. I urged then that the Repatriation Department had all the machinery necessary to deal with the distribution of this money, and another place has made this amendment because its members considered that the arguments put forward in favour of the Bill as it left this Chamber were inadequate. They say, in effect, by their amendment, that the repatriation machinery will not be available for the distribution of the money, and, therefore, they are creating Committees in the various States. It will not be possible for such Committees to be worked without some expense. It was pointed out here that, even if the trustees worked voluntarily, their office expenses would be considerable. Now we are asked to appoint five other Committees- </para>

                        <para>- I thought that possibly the Trust, as it would sit in Mel-  bourne, would deal also with Victorian matters. The amendment, therefore, means that six new Committees will be called into existence, with six separate sets of offices and officers, and six sets of expenses. If that kind of thing is to continue, we might as well select twenty-six persons, and allow them to divide the money amongst themselves straightway, without considering the returned soldiers or their dependants. We are simply creating machinery that will be used to fritter the money away, thus keeping it from those who ought to get it, and to whom this Committee has already decided that it should go. If we agree to such a proposal, we shall be doing something that is decidedly wrong, if not wicked, to the returned soldiers -and their dependants. The proposed Committees may last for years, and whether they are paid or not their office expenses, and the salaries for their staffs, and their own expenses, will have to be paid. It is not to be supposed that all those appointed to the Committees in the different States will be in a position to work voluntarily without any remuneration for the time they lose in this business. At least, I hope they will not be. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think they will do it, nor is it fair to ask people to give up their time, because, if they are going to be truly representative of the class from which the soldiers have come, they will not be able to afford the time to devote to this work voluntarily. I foresee the possibility of a large proportion of this money being frittered away in salaries and expenses. The Repatriation Department has the whole of the machinery for the distribution of the money. There is the Commission in Victoria with head-quarters here; there are in every State a Deputy Commissioner and his staff, with offices in which to work, and this central organization has the control of country Committees throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. What more is required for the purpose of this Bill than the machinery already at the disposal of Parliament? I am confident that the Committee made a mistake in agreeing to the appointment of a Trust, as pro posed by the Government in the Bill as it first came to us. I hope they will not accentuate that mistake by increasing the staff required to distribute the money. I trust that the amendment will be rejected, and that the Committee will allow the Repatriation Department to deal with the fund, as it is most capable of doing. </para>

                    <para>. - After advocating State rights in a State House, and being defeated, I think the next best thing I can do is to support the course advocated' by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> as being the most practicable way of dealing with the fund. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> during the second-reading debate, and in the early, stages of the Committee discussion, stressed the point that the soldiers had written to the Government to ask whether the money that had been left in trust was to be used in lieu of Government money for repatriation purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I was trying to point out that the amendment should be rejected in order that the whole matter might be re-opened, and the Repatriation Department allowed to administer the fund. The returned soldiers have not said that they have any objection to the Repatriation Department dealing with the fund. What they did object to was to trust money being used in lieu of Government money for repatriation purposes. The Minister rightly replied to their letters to the effect that trust money was not being so used, and that there was no intention of so using it. The Committee will do the right thing if it rejects  the amendment, in order to open the way for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland's</inline> amendment. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Minister assured the Committee that it would be the policy of the trustees to appoint a Local Committee in each State to investigate cases, and advise as to the distribution of the fund. I understood all along that when the Bill was passed, and the trustees were appointed, the first thing they would do would be to bring into existence a sub-committee in each State, through, the Red Cross or some other organization, to investigate applications for assistance, and that the recommendations of the sub-committees would come back to the central Trust, who would pay the amount recommended if they thought that proper inquiries had been made, and a reasonable case made out. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the honorable senator and those who support him are saving any expense. The amendment merely gives the Local Committees statutory authority. I am sure that every honorable senator has devoted days and nights of his time gratuitously to the welfare of different sections of the community. I worked for years on honorary committees. It has been my duty night after night to attend honorary committees dealing with different affairs affecting the people in my district, and to give services for which I never received a sixpence. Are there not men and women in every State who are imbued with the same patriotic spirit? I venture to say that there are plenty of persons who will only be too glad to assist in the administration of this fund by offering their services in an honorary capacity. I do not fear the effect of the amendment; and, as the other branch of the Legislature has seen fit to insert it, I shall support it. </para>

                        <para>- And I am preparing for the end of June. I wish to enter my protest against this most objectionable Bill. It provides for a method of dealing with late enemy subjects with which I entirely disagree. The war is over, and peace has been not merely signed, but ratified. Yet we find the Government exhibiting so much hostility to late enemy subjects that even a youth who may be desirous of leaving Germany during the next five years will be denied admission to the Commonwealth. Whilst the war was in progress, there were a very large number of enemy subjects in this country, and I challenge the Government to point to any acts by these people which caused them very much uneasiness. It would be wise for us to enter wholeheartedly into the peace which is now with us. I take it that the German soldier who fought for his country occupies precisely the same position as does the soldlier who fought with the Allies. There is nothing discreditable about the action of a man who joins the colours and fights for his country. On the contrary, there is something exceedingly creditable to him. Under this Bill, late enemy subjects are to be penalized by being refused admission to the Commonwealth for a period of five years. Yet I know of whole towns in Australia which have been established by German colonists. If we possessed only a little scrap of territory in which there was only room for ourselves, there might be some reason for wishing to exclude desirable settlers from abroad. We all know that Britain and Germany were ancient allies, and that on many a battlefield their soldiers have fought together. In the late war, the position was otherwise. That, however, was not due to the will of the people of Germany, but to that of a dominant military caste there. The record of Australia during the war is such that it ought not to be marred by petty legislation of this character. The measure appeals to the lowest passions of humanity. The war being over, the sooner we get back to normal conditions the better. To seek to impose such a prohibition upon the admission to the Commonwealth of late enemy subjects is altogether derogatory to our national dignity. I quite recognise that it will be futile for me to call for a division on this matter, because only a few minutes ago we witnessed the humiliating spectacle of a majority of the Nationalist party supporting an amendment made by another place which they were not prepared to accept when the measure to which it related was under consideration in this Chamber. </para>

                    <para>. - With a good deal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said I am in entire agreement. He has pointed out that the war was largely caused by an autocratic military caste in Germany. Whilst I quite recognise that, it cannot be denied that the people of any country must collectively accept full responsibility for the particular form of government which obtains there. There was a time in England when that country was ruled by a despotic class. But Britons altered those conditions long ago. Though the entire responsibility for the late war does not rest upon every individual in Germany, it must be acknowledged that all German citizens humbly acquiesced in the action of their ruling military caste. People may not be guilty of an offence by direct action, but if by acquiescence in a policy that enables a certain class to take possession and direct the policy of the Government, then they cannot be altogether excused. It has been contended that there has been a revolution in Germany in favour of constitutional government. I hope this is true, and I feel quite satisfied that as soon as Germany furnishes proof that she has abandoned for ever a desire for military authority, and has embraced the principles of Democracy, she will receive the privileges of citizenship in the Commonwealth. Nobody would then be more willing than I to lift the embargo which this Bill places upon the introduction to Australia of people of that country. But I remind honorable senators that there have been rumours of revolutions and counter-revolutions in Germany, and that an outstanding feature of this upheaval is the fact that the military party appears to be again making an attempt to secure control. In view of what the Empire has gone through, we have every right now to be careful. During my administration of the Defence Department I had no occasion to intern any person, but I investigated, I should say, very nearly 1,000 cases which came before me, and though sometimes I had wondered whether we were not a little bit panicky in regard to these people, my investigation of hundreds of cases showed that the evidence was very much stronger than I believed it to be. Possibly this may have been due to the German system of education, but, at all events, it appears that they have not yet reached that stage of civilization which justifies our lifting the embargo. I admire the fight which certain sections of </para>

                <para class="block">Germany are putting up for constitutional government, but, after all, this fight is only being waged by a certain section of the people. An equally strong section appears to be fighting for the retention of military domination. But, as I have already said, when Germany gives evidence that she is under a democratic and constitutional government responsible to the people, there will be no further objection to receiving them whole-heartedly as citizens of the Commonwealth. I trust, therefore, that the Bill will not be further delayed. It is essential that it should be on our statute-book temporarily if not permanently. </para>

                        <para>. - It is strange that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> who is always so ready to oppose Bills which, in the opinion of honorable senators on this side are essential to the welfare of the State, should be acquiescent concerning this measure, the passage of which, I think, should be opposed. It is undoubtedly the outcome of our experiences during the five or six black years of war, when, no doubt, it would have been convenient for the Government to exercise such drastic power in order to ascertain the movements of every non-British citizen in the Commonwealth. But now that the time of stress has ended, we ought to avoid passing legislation which might, in a very serous degree, harass those who may wish to come to Australia, and who, in all probability, would develop into very good citizens. The definition clause states that every person who is not of British nationality is an alien. And so Americans, Frenchmen, Belgians, Danes, Swedes, or Norwegians, all of whom would make excellent citizens, will be regarded as aliens, and subject to all the disabilities sought to be imposed' upon aliens by this measure. The definition clause also states that an officer means - </para>

                            <para>- But suppose the registrar does not go on a boat on its arrival at an Australian port, and an alien who may be on board sets out to find him ? If by any chance an officious policeman or an ambitious officer from some Department meets that man he will have power to arrest him, and the alien will be liable to the penalties I have mentioned. I admit, of course, that this is rather an extravagant view of the possibilities, but the fact that any officer of the Commonwealth may have power to arrest a man in these circumstances  is sufficient reason for objecting .to this class of legislation. </para>

There can be no justification for taking the power by statutory law to harass any person desiring to enter the Commonwealth, but who does not happen to be of British nationality. </para>

                    <para>Clause 11 contains further harassing provisions. It requires any alien who changes his place of abode to notify the registrar, so that a tourist coming from, say, America to Melbourne, and putting up at Menzies' Hotel, would have to register, and then, if he went to the Hotel Australia, in Sydney, he would have to re-register, otherwise he would be liable to a penalty. </para>
                    <para>Clause 13 sets out that every hotelkeeper must question strangers who seek accommodation. In the language of the clause, the hotelkeeper would be called upon to ask a stranger his name, nationality, date of arrival, previous place of abode, if arrived by a vessel, the name of vessel, date of departure, destination on departure, and, if departing by a vessel, the name of the vessel. Fancy every hotelkeeper having to put these questions to strangers who apply for accommodation, and entering the replies in a register for the information of the authorities? I am afraid some will get into serious trouble if they have not got it all ready for an officer, who, as I have already shown, may be almost any member of the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- I believe, that the measure to which the honorable senator refers was discussed in the Senate while  the war was continuing. I had to do many things which I did not like whilst the nation was at war. I do not like war, but I admit that stringent and drastic action may be necessary to preserve the country in such a crisis. Therefore, to say that I supported such a measure during war time is no argument against my opposition to this Bill at the present time. </para>

One of the many " officers " who might be appointed under this Bill would be in a position under this clause to demand all this information from a man who desired to peacefully settle in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Clause 19 provides that an officer may arrest an alien without warrant. In the circumstances in which the Common  wealth  is now placed, we desire men from many nations to come to this country and become citizens. We have ample power under existing legislation to safeguard the Commonwealth against undesirable immigrants. If the Government desire immigration, I think they will be well advised if they withdraw this Bill. </para>

Germany used to send out so-called immigrants who were really emissaries of the  German  Government to settle in the Commonwealth, in order that they might gradually undermine our institutions. We know, as a matter of fact, that many of these persons were actually spies while in this country. </para>

                                mentioned with abhorrence the possibility of the provisions of this Bill applying to immigrants from France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and other countries with which we have friendly relations. Up to a certain point there is force in the honorable senator's objection ; but he should remember that the districts of Alsace and Lorraine are now parts of France, and there are many people in those districts who have strong German sympathies. How could we differentiate between the splendid Frenchmen whom we should be glad to welcome here, and people who might really be sent by the German Government from the districts to which I have referred to carry out their former policy of peaceful penetration in Australia ?

                    <para>If we consider the Belgians, who suffered so much and fought so gallantly on. the side of the Allies during the war, honorable senators who have spoken to our returned soldiers must know that there were a very great many Belgian spies who were men of no principle, and prepared to serve any side for their own advantage. How could we differentiate between men who might be sent here by our late enemies, and who would be a positive danger to the country in the event of another war, and immigrants intending to peacefully settle in Australia, and become citizens of this country? </para>
                    <para>With regard to the immigration of Danes, we should remember that Denmark recently had a considerable accession to her territory, and we saw by the voting at the plebiscite which took place, that a considerable number of the people  of the districts concerned were persons of strong German sympathies. With respect to Norwegians and Swedes, we know that during the wai1 the people of Sweden were hand in glove with the Germans, and we do not want as immigrants to this country people of Sweden who have strong German sympathies. If they were admitted to this country, they would probably be prepared to carry on the iniquitous campaign of peaceful penetration with which we have been made so familiar. </para>

                    <para>As the war is now over, and as there is a certain amount of disgrace attached to the- taking of finger prints, which is nearly always associated with a ('suspicion pf crime, the provision dealing with that matter might be modified when we get into Committee. I think that a measure of this sort is absolutely necessary. We want to know who are Australians and who are aliens, and the Government must be given every facility to obtain that information, so that we may not run the risk of admitting enemy spies to the country. I knew one or two of them, but, fortunately for themselves, they knew when war was to be declared, and they left Australia before it was declared. We must be in a position to have such people under control. We should remember further that, gallant as the French proved themselves to be, there are bad Frenchmen. We know that men who were in high places in France have actually been shot as traitors to their country. </para>
                    <para>We need immigrants badly, but we must have the right sort.

                        <para>.- I should like to know what is our position in relation to the people of other countries who have adopted legislation similar to the Passports Bill, with which we were dealing yesterday. Some very drastic provisions have been included in the Passports Bill which might be applied to persons visiting this country, possibly with the intention to settle here. I realize that it is necessary to have some power of supervision of people coming to Australia, but this Bill carries the precautions a little too far. A case was brought under my notice recently of a gentleman who came here from America. He came to Australia with his wife on what was practically a pleasure trip, but while here he was considering the advisability of investing in a certain primary industry in Australia. When this gentleman arrived in Sydney by one of the American boats, it was necessary for him to undergo the cross-examination provided for under this Bill, and at present provided for under the War Precautions Act. He had to carry about with him in his pocket a certificate with his finger-prints on it describing him as an alien. And, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> pointed out in his able speech, thi3 man could not leave one hotel or one place to go to another without first notifying the local police station as to where he was going. </para>

                                has made the statement, and further inquiries should be made, as the position is most extraordinary. During the war period I have known of American citizens visiting this country, but I have never heard of one having to submit to the restrictions mentioned. There must be something more than

                                has stated, because surely an individual would not have to report his arrival and departure at every place he visited unless he was a criminal or a suspect? We should not have cases of that kind submitted without the fullest possible particulars being given, because I do not think an average tourist has to report in the manner suggested.

                        <para>. -  I was very much surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> complaining because it was not my intention to speak on the second reading of this Bill. The honorable senator must remember that in June or July of last year a similar measure was before the Senate, and on that occasion I discussed its provisions at some length, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> opposed every suggestion I brought forward. I am glad to see that his mind is now working, as he has not used one argument against this Bill that I did not bring forward nine months ago. I am so disgusted with its provisions that I did not intend discussing it, as it seems futile to be continually putting my objections to legislation of this character before the Senate, when, sitting alone, I am unable to get a division. If I had opposed the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> loyalty to the Government would have been such, that notwithstanding the arguments I brought  forward,  he would have supported his  col- leagues. That is my experience of the honorable senator since he has been a member of the Chamber. </para>

The hotelkeepers or persons in charge of boarding establishments of any kind are under a penalty of £100 if they fail to record the particulars outlined in this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> stated that he was in favour of legislation of this kind during the war period, but when we were discussing a similar measure last year the war was over. I am glad, however, that he now realizes that the Bill contains many objectionable features. Perhaps the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> in reply, will give some reasons for submitting such a proposal.

                    <para class="block">Imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, for instance, endeavouring to secure accommodation at an hotel. The proprietor would probably say, "Hullo! here is a foreigner." Although the honorable senator possesses a distinctly French name, it is more than probable his ancestors were taken across to Scotland by some worthy immigrants. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, under such circumstances, would have to submit to a severe cross-examination, lasting, perhaps, twenty minutes, at a time when he might be anxious to proceed with urgent business. Imagine the annoyance and inconvenience to which travellers will be put when they have to submit to a severe cross-examination by an inquisitive hotelkeeper. The clause continues - and if the keeper of an hotel, inn, boardinghouse, or lodging-house fails to provide himself with a register, or to ascertain, or enter therein the foregoing particulars in respect of any alien staying at his premises, </para>
                    <para class="block">I wish to direct honorable senators' attention particularly to the concluding portion of the clause - or if he makes any entry in any register which he knows, or could by the exercise of reasonable diligence have ascertained, to be false, shall be guilty of an offence. </para>

' A woman of foreign birth may be the wife of an Australian citizen, and because she desires to temporarily reside at an hotel full particulars will have to be recorded. It will mean that a staff of clerks will be required to perform the necessary  work. In many of our leading residential establishments it is difficult enough at present for the proprietors to conduct their businesses, without being compelled to undertake work on behalf of the Government. This legislation is absolutely unnecessary now the war is over, and I hope the Senate will defeat the second reading. Under the pretence of doing something in the interests of the community, the Government are re-enacting certain of the War Precautions Regulations.  Some of the regulations are mentioned, but I do not know whether they are incorporated in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but this is additional, and altogether unnecessary. Legislation of this kind does nothing effective, and will not bring us any nearer having reliable records. What it really means is that a piece of war-time legislation that was deemed to be necessary during the war ig to be continued now that peace has returned. This Bill, prepared during the war, now comes to the Senate, which, I suppose, will pass it, or it may be left, as on the last occasion, partly considered, and then we shall wait another nine months for it. I hope the Minister, in reply, will be able to tell us if there is any real reason why the whole of the community should be put to all this trouble by provisions which, even if they are carried out, will be of very little importance so far as the people of Australia are concerned. </para>

                            overlook one phase of this matter. While in theory their arguments might be very good if the people they have in their minds were to come here, at the present time Australia has every right to protect  the citizens she already has and to safeguard their liberties in every possible way. During the present unrest, and the moving about of individuals, the Bill is very necessary.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline>
                            Largie has handed rae a card which he, although an Australian senator, had to sign when -entering Canada. He had to report himself, although he was practically the guest of the Canadian Government. Every one who enters Canada has to sign such a card and produce it for three years after he lands there. The regulations of the United States of America, are even more strict. Necessity and experience have evidently taught the United States of America and Canada, which in the past were open to immigrants, that they must enforce restrictions. The United States of America is one of the most glaring examples of the misuse of the liberty which that great country offered to European immigrants. One of the most serious troubles that the American people have to face now is to pick out a number of these immigrants and send them away again. Registration helps in that way. No doubt it is an inconvenience to some visitors, .and will b&amp; some trouble to hotelkeepers and others, but it is a very necessary precaution, and will be of great use if carried out properly. I am sure that no one in Australia is desirous of having a class of immigrants entering this country who  are likely to become a danger to the liberties we enjoy under our present free Constitution. We have had very little experience, except our war experience, in this matter, and the best guide for us is the example of the United States of America and Canada, which, are going, not by their war experience, but. by their ordinary civil experience cf those undesirables who have entered their countries and become a nuisance to them. The card which
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline>
                            Largie has shown me is not merely a war precaution. It. is a precaution dictated by experience in dealing with those undesirable persons whom the Canadian authorities find it necessary to keep under supervision for three years. Any one acquainted with affairs in the United States at present must know the very serious conditions obtaining there. In some of the districts they ..practically amount to civil war. Class consciousness is carried to such an extent as to create a war between those who wish to preserve the rights of the citizens and those who wish to destroy all organized government. Therefore, although I am personally in favour of allowing every one to come to Australia and enjoy its liberties, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that it is our duty to protect those liberties, not only for our own sake, but for the sake of those who are growing up around us. I have no hesitation in supporting the Bill, which is a very necessary precaution.

                        <para>. - It will be better to deal with the points raised in Committee, because most of them seem to consist of misunderstandings regarding the probable operation of various provisions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said the Bill would not add anything new to our records, or improve them. The very object of the Bill is to add to and improve our records. There are over 71,000 aliens registered in Australia today under the War Precautions Act. - It is not the intention of the Government to continue that Act, and if this Bill is not put through all those records will be lost. If they are kept, all that will be necessary is to keep them up to date. It is very desirable to know as much as possible about the alien population of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said the Bill would necessitate the employment of a new clerk in every hotel. If so many foreigners are coming to this country, it is a fair thing for us to ask who they are and what they are doing here. The honorable senator argued that hotelkeepers would be subjected to all sorts of regulations and restrictions. If I go to Sydney, the first thing the hotelkeeper does is to ask me my name, address, and occupation. Under this Bill, as soon as a man gives a foreign name, the hotelkeeper will ask him a few simple questions. When I asked the honorable senator if he could tell me of any case where a new clerk had to be specially put on to this work in any hotel in Australia, he could not name one. Registration went on under the War Precautions Act during the war. </para>

A registration officer will board every vessel at its first port of call in Australia. The passengers will be mustered, and the officer will register them. One honorable senator expressed the fear that a passenger might miss the officer. If the officer was not there, the passenger could not be convicted for not finding him when he was wanted. Tourists will not have to register again, except that at the hotel the publican will register their names and other ordinary particulars. If publicans ask half-a-dozen intelligent questions as prescribed, they will be no more responsible than any other man in Australia. There is another class of person, not a tourist, who lands in Australia, establishes an abode, but does not become' naturalized. We have a right to say, " Here is a German coming into our midst who shows no desire to become a citizen of Australia." </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is speaking of a temporary war period, but take any alien other than an enemy alien, and suppose that he does not become naturalized. If a man enters our country and wants to live in it and to exploit it commercially or otherwise, and shows no desire to become a naturalized citizen, it is at least fair that we should know who and what he is. Had we taken that precaution prior to, the war we should have had better information during wartime about aliens. This Bill has one weakness, and that is that the man we really want to get hold of - and especially the woman, because that has been our experience - is clever enough to beat the lot of us, and can get over or through all the Acts we like to pass. Whatever may be the permanent fate of legislation of this character, the Government feel that it is necessary to have it until the world settles down to normal conditions once more. </para>

                        </para>
                        <para>Parliament House, Melbourne</para>
                        <para>Dear Senator Gardiner, -</para>
                        <para>My attention has been drawn to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> reply to your question of the 16th inst. I do not mind the Minister's reflection upon my motives, for one is accustomed to small things from that gentleman. But I am concerned with his misstatement  of  fact as to General Bridges. </para>
                        <para>That officer, who,  as  Inspector-General, was marked out for command  in  time of war, told me in Lennan's Hotel, Brisbane, on the Saturday before the outbreak of war, that he was under orders to proceed to Port Darwin to report upon the militia detentions of that port. His ship was to sail that morning. Suspecting a trick to side-tracking, I then asked him if he would accept an order from me (I was not a Minister in his Department) to return to Melbourne. He agreed to do  so,  and 1 immediately wired to senator Millen informing him of my action. My colleague replied asking me to ask the General to remain in Brisbane pending instructions. My colleague then recalled him to Melbourne. </para>
                        <para>I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will deny these facts, but should his memory not he  as  clear as mine, the wires  (unless placed  upon  his  private file) should  be on record. At  any rate  his  wire recalling the General should certainly be on record, and that was despatched after the vessel which the General was instructed to catch had left Brisbane. If evidence were required of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> subservience to-day to  a  military clique (shall I call it the seniority brigade?) which is determined to prevent the utilization of the  best  brains brought out by the war, you will find it in the studied insult to General  Monash  in the Governor-General's speech opening Parliament, and in the  fact  that no citizen officer, however brilliant,  has  been deemed worthy of permanent military employment as are permanent officers whose war records were far  from  successful. </para>
