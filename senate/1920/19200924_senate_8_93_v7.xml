            <para>.   -  I raised this question yesterday, not on clause 14, which is the provision dealing with Ordinances, but on a prior clause, in which some reference is made to the power of this Parliament to legislate indirectly by vetoing Ordinances submitted in connexion with the administration of these Territories. I see that, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has pointed out, clause 14 provides that either House of Parliament may , pass a resolution, of which notice has been given, for the disallowance of any regulation or Ordinance within ' ' fifteen sitting days ' ' after such regulation or Ordinance has been tabled. That would ordinarily mean, as the Minister has pointed out, a longer period than forty-two days, which I suggested should be the time allowed from the time that any Ordinance was tabled within which action might be taken. I think that all honorable senators are of opinion that fifteen consecutive days would not give members of this Parliament a proper opportunity to take action when considered necessary for the annulment of an Ordinance, but fifteen sitting days will cover a much longer period. </para>

            <para>. -  I wish, first of all, to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> upon the very far-reaching address which he delivered in the Senate yesterday on this Bill. At the same time, I am sure that honorable senators will agree with me that it would have been far better if that speech had been delivered two or three years ago, prior to the Mother State undertaking such an enormous proposition as that to which she is committed . in connexion with the wheat-handling scheme. It is astonishing that before one bushel of wheat has been put into the silos erected in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should come forward to explain in detail that the bulk handling of wheat is doomed to" failure. Since the scheme was put into operation in New South Wales, we may assume, after reasonable inquiry, honorable senators have received no new light to guide them in this matter. At that time we had the benefit of reports of Royal Commissions in different States on the subject of the bulk handling of wheat, and we know that people who had travelled in various parts of the world  cam  e back to tell us that the producer must put his produce in a marketable form, and handle it economically, if he is to compete successfully with producers in other parts of the world. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have been informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that this scheme is doomed to failure. The honorable senator went exhaustively into figures, which I am not going to attempt to dispute. The Bill now before the Senate embodies the principle of cooperation, which the farmers of Western Australia ardently prefer to State- control. I am glad to see "that they, have  adopted this attitude, because past experience has shown that neither Federal nor State Governments are able to handle huge business propositions in' a thoroughly satisfactory and economical manner. Extensive commercial undertakings of this character cannot be effectively controlled by the Federal Government or by State ''Governments, because the personal interest and oversight which is so necessary is lacking. Many of  the farmers in Western Australia, which is a wonderful State, are young men who are prepared to put their money into this undertaking, because they realize that it is in their interests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in dealing with this question in an exhaustive manner, relies very largely upon the statements made by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> in another place. We all realize that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is a financial genius, and we are under a debt of gratitude to him for the information he has given concerning certain contracts. It is amazing, however, to realize that the representatives of the firm mentioned have, been able to travel from one State to tha other, and sell their plans and specifications to the tune of £20,000. In a federated Australia, such a position 'is absolutely  absurd, and if we were federated' in the truest sense, it would have been sufficient for one Government to have made the purchase. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps so; but it is ridiculous to think that different States are paying £20,000 for similar sets of plans. A few years ago the South Australian Government purchased plans from the same firm, and they have been pigeon-holed. When the question is thoroughly investigated, I think it will be found that the plans which have been recently sold are similar to those which were submitted to the South Australian.

              <para>- Yes; and we are going to learn from New South Wales. If we enter into a loose contract, the onus will be on Western Australia, and not on the "Federal Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Prowse  has gone very carefully into the system, and, knowing the' wishes and requirements of the farmers in Western Australia, he believes that the action they are taking is a. wise one. He is satisfied that the proposition is sound, because he is investing £1,150 in the scheme. I am sure that the honorable senator who criticised this proposal so severely is not prepared to invest a similar sum in the New South Wales scheme. The Western Australian farmers are desirous of working on a co-operative basis, and it is the desire of the Federal Government to assist them in every way. We have been informed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> from time to time that if our financial position is to improve we must produce to a greater extent. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Your Commissioners are impressed with the advantages that voluntary co-operation presents as a means for the successful marketing of produce, and are of the opinion that the adoption of this principle by the farmers, coupled with the command of the best skill obtainable, would secure to them the maximum return for their produce. Your Commissioners believe that  the further extension of the principle of  co-operation  to ..the marketing of- wheat would materially assist- 'to render the&gt;. farmers more independent of the honorable understanding than they are at present. </para>

              <para>- Yes; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Badcock</inline> approves of bulk handling in a modified form. He does not condemn the system. I, too, am prepared to support bulk handling i in "a* modified way, because it is impracticable to handle the whole of -the wheat produced in Australia under this system," and any one who suggests that that should be done is speaking utter nonsense. In- .many of our newly settled districts railway sidings are placed 2, 3, or 4 miles apart to save the farmers' time in carting, and it would be absolutely impossible to have silos and elevators at every railway siding. There- is, however, no reason why they should not be constructed at terminal points, so that the bags could be used over and over again. </para>

              <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will kindly give me his attention for a few moments, these commercial transactions may be completed outside. Let us see how the bag system works out on the basis of 100,000 bags of wheat being stacked at a good country siding. Of course, the prices which I am about to quote are those which obtained under normal pre-war conditions. The cost, honorable senators will understand, would be very considerably more to-day. Now, 100,000 bags at 6d. each would represent £2,500; sewing, at1d. per bag, would mean £417 ; the cost of the twine is set down at l0d. per ball'; the handling charge at 2d. per bag would amount to £834; so that, if we deduct from these costs the value of the bags sold as wheat, namely £625, we get a total cost of £3,136. I do -not know whether bags are still being handled for 2d. each - out of the stack into the truck, and out of the truck into the ship. I think that I would be well within bounds if I said that that work to-day costs 4d. per bag. </para>

          <para>The figures which I have quoted convince me that co-operation is the correct principle for our producers to apply to the handling of their wheat In South Australia we have one of the finest cooperative societies to he found in the Southern Hemisphere, but it is not ready, nor is it in a financial position, to buy the wheat for the coming year.. However, the time must come when co-operative societies will handle the wheat crops of Australia, . and they must have Commonwealth backing to enable them to compete successfully with private enterprise, and to prevent the middleman coming in between the producer and the consumer to the extent that he does now. Here is Western Australia setting an example for the whole of the Commonwealth. I hope that that example will be followed by New South Wales. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in his quiet moments will admit that if the wheathand'ling scheme in his own State had been in the hands of keen business men "who had a personal interest in the industry, it would have been to the advantage of the 'producers there. The question of whether the money which it is proposed to provide under this Bill should go through the State of Western Australia to the co-operative society, or whether it should go direct to that society, with the help of the Western Australian Government,, which will have to -provide several hundred thousand pounds, is not of very great importance. After all, we are merely asked to do what is in the best interests of the producers. It is incumbent that the Commonwealth should live up to the ideal it proclaimed when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> urged that the paramount duty of our people was to "Produce, produce, produce," in order to enable this country to carry the heavy burdens which have, been placed upon it during the past few years. </para>

            <para>. -  I do not remember any question 'which has come before the Senate upon which I have experienced so much difficulty in making up my mind as I have experienced in connexion with this Bill. Hitherto, I confess, I have not gone into the question of the bulk handling of wheat. It is a most intricate question, and honorable senators have scarcely been able to sufficiently delve into it at such short notice. I feel that we ought to help this co-operative society in Western Australia. It is a plucky venture, but before committing ourselves to it we ought to inform . our minds precisely as to what this business proposition means. I gather from the agreement which is embodied in the schedule to the Bill that a company is to be formed on. the basis of 300,000 shares. The capital to be called up is £150,000. Are we quite clear in our minds that the other £150,000 will be provided? I would like to view the matter as a business proposition. We owe that duty to the farmers of Western Australia as much as to the Commonwealth.. </para>

Having loaned the co-operative society to be formed in Western Australia the sum of £500,000, we may in the future have the- silos handed over to us, and the entire venture thrown upon our- hands. We ought to have some evidence that the farmers of the Western State are going to entirely change their method of harvesting their crops. Under the present system, I understand that they use the complete harvester for taking off those crops. These machines will have to be scrapped, and the farmers will have to revert to the old reaper and binder, and to the system of putting their wheat sheaves into a stack. </para>

              <para>- The point I wish to have elucidated is whether this is a good business transaction for the farmers of Western Australia as well as for the Government. I do not suppose that it would cost a great deal for the former to fit up waggons so as to enable them to cart their wheat in bulk to the railway stations. I should like to know whether there is any binding agreement with the Government of Western Australia under which the latter undertake to provide the requisite number of trucks for the carriage' of the wheat ? </para>

              <para>- I hope that it is not a mere verbal promise, but a properly drawn up legal agreement. These are points which we should thoroughly look into. I would like to ascertain what will be the entire cost of the scheme, because probably as soon as the silos have been built, and the farmers have the Commonwealth " in the bag," so to speak, we shall be faced with another demand for financial assistance. It may then be urged, " The Commonwealth has put £500,000 into the venture, and now it has to get that money out of it." Faced with such an alternative, we should either have to close down upon the whole thing, or to find an additional sum of money. </para>

              <para>- If the Commonwealth had either to accept useless silos or to spend a considerable sum of-  money to make the scheme effective, I think that it would choose the latter course. I have known of many instances in which private individuals have been obliged to act in that way. I well remember how anxious certain people were to get the survey of the so-called desert railway to "Western Australia carried out. But immediately that survey was completed they said, " Oh, everything is all right now. The Commonwealth has spent a considerable sum of money upon the survey of the line, and will now have to proceed with its construction." I am afraid that the same thing might occur here, and that, after we had spent a lot of money, we might have to go on with it. The figures brought up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> are now some years old, and I should like to see the matter gone right over again to show what the bulk handling scheme is going to save the farmers of Western Australia as against the cost of the present system. </para>

              <para>- I should certainly like to see them gone into again. After all, is there any great hurry for this Bill ? The silos cannot be completed until next year. The Senate is not thoroughly <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with the question. Could not the Government agree to adjourn the debate on the second reading for one month, and, in the meantime, appoint a Committee, consisting of -the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Senator Pratten</inline> as the representative of the Opposition, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain,</inline> who has been through this matter from its inception, as the representative of the Ministerial party ? That Committee could bring over one or two representatives from the Westralian Farmers Cooperative Society, go into the whole business, and report to the Senate. If I can be assured that it is a proper business transaction, that we are not likely to be called on to provide a lot more money after advancing this £550,000, and that it is a good thing for .the ' Westralian farmers, my feeling will be to support the Bill strongly, because I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that co-operation is the coming method of dealing with all these business affairs. </para>

              <para>- I quite understand that, but we are not in any great hurry to deal with this matter. The silos are not required until the next crop is harvested. They cannot deal with this crop. We have at least thirteen months before they will need to be completed. Cannot we take one month to satisfy the business instincts of the Senate before we launch out into this scheme ? I can quite understand the reasons of .the Western Australian Parliament for declining it. Their finances are not in as good a state as we should like, but, after all, is the Commonwealth in such a flourishing financial position? Where are we to get another £550,000 ? </para>

              <para>- When that Act was passed, we did not owe anything like the money ' that we owe now. The war was on then, and .we passed these things in the most reckless fashion. We were spending millions then, but now we have to take a much more economical view of our position. Still, I feel that we ought to support the farmers of Western Australia. . I do not like to turn them down in any way. I think they are on the right lines, but before going right through with the Bill I hope the Minister will see his way to adopt ' my suggestion for a final look at the whole proposition. It is not a matter of the greatest urgency. I do not know how long it takes to complete a silo, but -they cannot be required for another thirteen months. If all these things were gone into thoroughly the' Senate would be doing its absolute duty and might save money to the farmers of Western Australia in respect of many points which possibly they have overlooked. They cannot all have looked into the proposition. I do not know whom they are trusting to do the business for them. I urge the Minister to adopt my suggestion before we part with this money. If we were putting our own money in we would look closely into the business, and endeavour to thoroughly understand every one of these points. I confess that at present I do not understand many of them. I should be prepared to trust a Committee such as I have suggested, with their experience, to go fully into tie question. When they reported I should hope that we could see our way confidently to indorse the Government's scheme and to help the farmers of Western Australia, who have behaved in such a plucky manner. </para>

            <para>. - I may, perhaps, be able to answer one or two of the rather pertinent questions put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn. His</inline> principal concern is to know what are the chances of these silos coming back on to the hands of the Federal Government. It would, perhaps, relieve his anxiety a little if I told him something about the growth of this cooperative movement in Western Australia. It was started a considerable time ago by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Harper, and carried on by his son, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Harper, who has since been associated with practically all the principal farmers in Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Basil</inline> Murray is now the managing director of the concern. I had a little to do 'with it before the war. It was very small then, and had only a small number of employees. When I returned and began ' to . look into it about twelve months ago I was amazed to discover that it had grown into an immense concern. It had acquired a very big warehouse, one of the largest buildings in Perth, for the accommodation of its staffs. Large as that building is, it is evident that the company will soon need further accommodation. It is run on the following lines : - There is a separate cooperative concern called the Westralian Farmers Limited. That is the great wholesale body of the farmers of Western </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australia, and is carried on in the city. Attached or subordinate to it there are already eighty-six affiliated companies throughout the country districts of the State, and ten in the bigger centres of population. Thus we have the main wholesale company and no less than ninety-six subordinate retail concerns all run on a co-operative basis for- the benefit of the primary producers of the West. The business men who have created this gigantic concern out of nothing - and they are very keen business men, especially <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Basil</inline> Murray - are the same men that are contemplating the running of this particular business. If their past success is any guide, it is a pretty considerable guarantee of the success of this venture. </para>
          <para>What is it that the farmers undertake to do ? The company has a capital of £1.500,000. Practically the whole of the farmers . of Western Australia are coming into it, just as practically all of them are already in those other cooperative concerns which have been so successful. The farmers are taking shares on the basis of their wheat production last year and this year. We hope to have a 20,000,000-bushel crop this year in Western Australia. It will be at least somewhere in that vicinity. If that expectation is fulfilled, 20,000,000 bushels of wheat will pass into the Pool, and if every farmer comes in, as I believe he will, an amount of 20,000,000 shillings, or ls. per bushel, will be contributed by them. From that source £1,000,000, or, at a conservative estimate, £800,000, will be available. </para>

              <para>asked what risks the Federal Government were running of losing the money if they advanced it. There is practically no chance of losing it. The farmers of Western Australia, who are practically the only wealth producers of the State, apart from the miners, are almost to a man behind the concern. Before the Federal Government . are to be asked to put up one penny the farmers will spend £100,000 of their own money as an earnest of their intentions. That is number one guarantee. After that the Federal Government are going to supply £550,000. In other words, they are supplying £2 for every £l put in by the farmers. </para>

              <para>- Very well. The South Australian requirements are similar to those of Western Australia, and while I am not in a position to verify very many of the investigations, I believe they are more or less correct. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> is now satisfied that we are not running any particular risk concerning the money to be advanced, in view of the fact that the farmers are putting their own money into it, and are going to spend £100,000 before one penny of the Commonwealth money is touched. </para>

          <para>Another question asked, and I think it was rather pertinent, was, " Why did not the farmers of Western Australia . approach the State Government for assistance?" Well, the farmers of my State have had a good deal of. experience of State controlled industries. They have seen many experiments carried out over there, as well as in other parts of Australia. They know, as well as we do, that what is everybody's business is nobody's business, and. this particular proposal is very much their business. This, I am informed, is the reason why the scheme was thrown out in the Upper House of Western Australia by the people who represented their views in that Chamber. The farmers preferred to handle this scheme themselves rather than have it controlled by the State or Federal Governments. </para>

The only State that applied for some portion of this money was New South Wales, but if the other States had made application they would, of course, have participated in the arrangement. </para>

              <para>- Western Australia, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has just indicated, could have got some of this money, but for the reasons already indicated the Government did not apply for it. Had they made application the Commonwealth would have been advancing, not £500,000, as in this scheme, but. the whole amount required for the construction of silos. Therefore, we, who are the custodians of the Commonwealth purse, are now in a much more advantageous position, because, under this scheme, we shall be advancing hundreds of thousands of pounds less than would have been required under the earlier proposal of the Commonwealth Government. And, further, we have an additional security in the fact that the farmers of Western Australia are putting their own money into the venture. This will be their particular concern, and, of course, they will see to it that they do not lose money over it. If the Western Australian farmers do not lose their money we shall not lose the Commonwealth's money in the transaction. I think, therefore, that there is everything to recommend the scheme as against that approved by this Parliament three years ago. </para>

          <para>I want now to remind honorable senators that last year the Western Australian farmers- paid £260,000 for bags for the handling of their crop. This year's harvest is going to be very much greater, and, of course, the farmers will pay a proportionally larger amount for their bags. We all know, too, that jute goods have gone up in price, and that values are still rising. In this connexion I -wish to furnish honorable senators with same information that appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the 21st inst., and I may add that I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> missed it, because,, generally, he manages to get hold of everything.. The paragraph was to this effect - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is officially estimated that the Indian jute crop will total 6,500,000bales.This would be the smallest crop since 1.003, and 40 per cent, below the highest recorded in 1914. It is- anticipated that no raw material' will he available for export. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Western Australian farmers, as I have said, last year paid £260,000 for their bags. I believe- they have already in hand enough bags for the coming season, but unless they have a bulk handling scheme in operation before next harvest, what are they likely to be called upon to pay for bags? Not only is the jute crop a partial failure this year, but the cost of producing jute, like the cost of every other commodity, has gone up considerably. Consequently, if for no other reason than that the Western Australian farmers, by instituting the bulk-handling system, will save this £260,000 a year, or a greater portion of it, for bags, this scheme is, I contend, fully justified. </para>

            <para>- BROCKMAN. - Quite true. And if the farmers of Western Australia fail, this scheme fails; and, seeing that the primary producers are responsible for 85½ per cent, of the wealth, if. they fail, then "Western Australia goes bankrupt. This is the position in a nutshell. The success of the scheme is bound up with the success of the farmers. </para>

              <para>-I shall deal with that aspect of the- matter. My honorable friend is afraid, apparently, that the farmers of Western Australia are not sufficiently astute to determine whether this is a good business deal or otherwise; but I have already indicated, that they are advised and controlled' in all their co-operative concerns by first-class business men. This bulk handling scheme was mooted about ten years ago, and since then the most exhaustive inquiries into the whole system as applied to Western Australia have been made, not merely in Australia, hut also in America and other countries where wheat is handled in bulk. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> also raised the question of shipping accommodation as applied to the bulk-handling system. The farmers of Western Australia have made very careful investigations into that particular matter. They addressed inquiries to thirty-five wheat shippers in Western Australia, and of the replies received twenty-three shippers declared themselves in favour of the bulk-handling system, four were non-committal, five were not interested, and three were opposed to it. It will be seen, therefore, that the great majority of the shippers interested in Western Australian wheat production favour the system of bulk handling. </para>

The basis of the appeal made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> for the support of the electors of Australia was the promise to assist the primary producers. Western Australia, as honorable senators are aware, has given a practical undertaking to the Commonwealth to take all the immigrants that may be shipped to that State. We expect to put those people on the land, and hope that they will become Western Australian farmers in due course. It is the duty of the Federal Parliament to support Western Australia in this regard, in order that the Government of that State may be in a position to fulfil their undertaking to receive immigrants from the Old Country. If for no other reason, it is the duty of this Parliament to support a measure which has' that end in view. </para>

I realize as fully as I hope other honorable senators do, the tremendous importance to Australia of its wheat production. It is the duty, not so much of the Federal Parliament as of the State Parliaments, to give every possible assistance to wheat producers, not only that those who are at present engaged in the industry may be induced to increase the areas they put under cultivation, and so increase production, but also in order that the number of wheat producers in the CommonWealth may be increased. </para>

There is to-day a demand, and a growing demand, for wheat throughout the world. Peoples who. hitherto have not been wheat consumers are rapidly developing the habit, and, as the East becomes more civilized, shall we say, so will the demand for wheat continue to grow, and so also will the future success of the wheat-growers of Australia be assured. </para>

              <para>- That may be:so, but in view of the population of Eastern countries, and in view' of the growing needs of humanity, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the Eastern peoples will' hot be able' to produce all that they require for themselves. There is Australia's great opportunity. So I say that the future of this Commonwealth must depend very largely on the welfare of the primary producers, more particularly those engaged in the production of foodstuffs, the most important section of whom are our wheat-growers. </para>

          <para>In view of the very conflicting statements that have been made by some honorable senators, the present position of the wheat-growers in Australia seems to to be lather a hazy one. I do not think that we can do too much for our primary producers. Any encouragement and protection we can give them will be fully warranted, but we need to be quite sure that we are giving them encouragement and protection, and are not increasing the difficulties with which they have to contend. This point was particularly elaborated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> in the very fine speech he delivered. Honorable senators who listened to that speech must have been filled with doubt as to the wisdom and advisability of the course now proposed by the Government. I feel that it is a deplorable thing that in Australia we should, in any degree at all, be dependent upon the nigger labour of the East for so large a factor in the welfare of our wheat producers as we are. I realize that the wheat industry of Australia is very largely dependent upon the jute position, and jute is produced by people who are not living under our conditions, and who receive the beggarly wages which we know are paid to those employed in its production. It is deplorable that we should be dependent upon them in any degree at all for our future prosperity. I should be prepared to do almost anything to get out of that difficulty in which we find ourselves, and make Australia absolutely independent of the coolies of India or anywhere else for the marketing of this great primary product of ours. </para>
          <para>I want to be sure that we are taking the right steps. When I consider the degree of prosperity that to-day obtains amongst our primary producers and remember the very fine prices, take them by and large, which they have received for their products during the last few years, I think that they have very little to complain of. After listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie drawing the harrowing pictures he did draw of the awful conditions under which wheat-growers are labouring in Western Australia. I began to wonder what degree of civilization the people have reached over there, and what kind of government they can possibly have had in the past. </para>

Surely when such a State, which has six representatives in this Chamber, lays it down that it is better to wait and see before it is involved in a huge public expenditure, those representatives should protect Western Australia in the same way. </para>

It must be remembered that these men who are living under, such conditions of poverty and misery are those who are going to invest their money in this undertaking. The producers have to provide, under this agreement, one-third of the cost, estimated at £800,000, which  represents a sum of approximately £270,000. This down-trodden and poverty-stricken section of the community in Western Australia, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, is going to invest, £270,000 in the. bulk-handling scheme.

          <para>There are many objections to the scheme embodied in the Bill; but, after listening to the admirable speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> it would appear . that it has much to recommend it. This is a question which has two sides, either of which, if heard alone, would be sufficient to justify an honorable senator in supporting or opposing it. The case put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and that submitted on the other hand by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> would appear to the mere observer so complete in every detail that the average man might be forgiven for not being able to make up his mind as to how to vote. The great objection to this scheme is one that has already been voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> and several other honorable senators. The point is this: This measure proposes that the Commonwealth Parliament shall indorse the intrusion of the Commonwealth Parliament between the Parliament of a State and the producers of that State, who are subject to State laws. </para>

          <para>My second objection is that the Commonwealth Government will be committed to the expenditure of over half-a-million pounds sterling without adequate cover. There has been some discussion as to whether the security provided in this measure is sufficient. I do not think it is. No Government in Australia would dar© to foreclose upon any considerable number of farmers in any State of tha Union. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has assured us that such a contingency ie not likely to arise - and I hope that he is right - but suppose that this limited liability company, which is to be subsidized by the Commonwealth, should fail. In what position will the Government be in regard to recovering the money which it has advanced ? Would it foreclose upon the security which it holds? Would it take over these grain elevators and silos in Western Australia? Suppose that the farmers of that State said, " We will hand over the whole thing to you." What could the Commonwealth do with it? . It could only manage it in the interests of the very men who had repudiated their contract. Is it any part of the functions of the Commonwealth Parliament to carry on operations of this character either in the interests of the farmers, or of the manufacturers, or any other section of the community ? These are dangers which we have to consider. The Government have attempted to obtain adequate cover in connexion with this scheme; but in the very nature of things their efforts cannot be successful. </para>
          <para>My next objection to the Bill is a very serious one, and one which must appeal to every honorable senator when he recollects the obligations into which the Commonwealth has already entered. I know that the expression which I am about to use is a time-worn one; but,* nevertheless, it is applicable here, and I therefore make no apology for urging as an objection to this scheme that ' ' the time is not opportune." I ask honorable senators to recall the very high cost of building materials at the present time. In every State of the Union building operations have been considerably hampered by reason of high prices of materials. In certain States it is almost impossible to get a sufficient supply of cement to enable the erection of soldiers' homes to be proceeded with. At Canberra it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall manufacture its own cement. </para>

              <para>- That is practically what he does admit. The one silo in New South Wales to which I have alluded has cost £800,000. It contains 60,000 yards of concrete, and at one stage of its construction 500 men were employed upon it. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has stated that the whole scheme has not yet 'been completed. I . believe that even the main terminal silo of which I have spoken has not yet been completed. Yet the sum which this one silo has cost is now put forward as the estimated cost of the entire scheme to which it is proposed to give effect- in Western Australia. </para>

We have been assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> that it will, hut I am exceedingly doubtful on that point, 'because I submit that the wheat yield of Western Australia is not sufficiently large to afford a safe margin for the success of the scheme. I have here the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> issued in Bulletin No. 80, which cover a period up till June of the present year. In it he sets out the average wheat yields for the various States for the ten-year period from 1910-1911 to 1920. They are as follows:- Victoria 30,632,513 bushels, New South Wales 30,003,645 bushels, South Australia 23,311,459 bushels, and Western Australia 10,013,988 bushels. So that 10,000,000 bushels has been the average annual yield in Western Australia during the past ten years. </para>

              <para>- I do not. I hope that it will not. But I would point out that there are immense fluctuations, in the wheat yields from year to year. In 1915-16, for example, the yield in New South Wales was 66,000,000 bushels, the largest yield ever obtained by any State in Australia. Yet in succeeding years the wheat yield of "that State fell away almost to nothing. Of course, I have been assured that Western Australia is a State in which droughts are unknown, and in which production is bound to continually increase. I am told that she is never likely to experience a set-back. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator knows who I mean. I believe that Western Australia will suffer the same reverses as have been experienced in the other States. I submit that an average yield of 10,000,000 bushels is not sufficient to warrant us in assuming that this scheme for bulk handling of wheat in Western Australia will pay. When it has been proved that the bulk-handling system can be made a success in- New South Wales, it will be time enough for us to consider whether the Commonwealth should not bear a certain loss for a number of years in order that the system may be established in Western Australia, and that the farmers of that State may be given what they are now -asking. But if this system should prove to be a failure in New South Wales we should always have cause to reproach ourselves if we prematurely saddled Western Australia with a similar scheme. If the bulk-handling system cannot succeed in New South Wales, there is no chance of it succeeding in Western Australia. Honorable senators must recognise that. </para>

              <para>- I was about to show that the project under consideration could not be expected to pay in Western Australia because the number of shareholders likely to come in under the provisions of the articles of the company would not he large enough to give us a reasonable expectation that it would pay. From the number of 'holdings in Western Australia, as given by <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> in the quarterly summary issued in June, 1920, we can arrive at some conclusion as to the probable number of farmers in Western Australia who would be likely to come in under the terms of the agreement. I shall show that Western Australia has not anything like the same number of producers as the other States have, and if I can prove that the number of farmers in Western Australia is insufficient, from a financial point of view, to make this a success, it will be a very strong argument against the passage of the measure. </para>

          <para>The number of holdings in New South Wales from 501 acres to 1,000 acres is 17,297, and in all the States a man wants at least 500 acres to make wheat-farming pay, even in favoured districts, although it is carried on on smaller areas in Victoria, but not very successfully. That total includes not only wheat-farmers, but all others. </para>

              <para>- I submit that they are not. I am giving the honorable senator something, and it is evident from his speech that he needs all the assistance he can possibly get. In New South Wales the number of holdings from 5,001 to 10,000 acres is 942; and there are not many wheat-farmers holding over 10,000 acres. There are also not too many wheat-farmers holding from 101 to 500 acres. The total number of those small holdings in New South Wales is 26,405. The holdings that really matter, so far as New South Wales is concerned, that is, those between 501 and 10,000 acres, number only somewhere in the region of 1S,000, or, giving some of the others in, say, 20,000 in all. </para>

          <para>SenatorDUNCAN. - I am taking the whole of the holdings in Western Australia as being wheat holdings. The position is not so good in South Australia as in New South Wales. The number, of holdings there from -501 to 5,000 acres is 4,057.; and from 5,001 acres to' 10,000, 4,00'6; or a total of just over 8,000 possible holdings in that State, so far as wheat-farming is concerned. Even with 8.000 holdings, the probabilities of making this scheme a financial success would be small enough; but in Western Australia there are 7,000 holdings from 501 to 5,000 acres, and 200 holdings from 5.001 to 10,000 acres, or only a little over 7,000 possible wheat holdings in that State. To give the exact figures, there are 7,791 holdings in Western Australia held by farmers who could be wheatgrowers. I am including the whole lot of them, whether they are engaged in wheat-farming or not. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator ought to know that most farmers engaged in wheat-growing on small holdings, particularly in new country, put their money back into the land, or into plant or stock or "improvements, as fast as they make it. They have no ready capital in the bank or anywhere else which they can apply for the purposes of this Bill. My calculation gives a total of about 6,000 farmers in 'Western Australia who would be likely to come under this scheme. That is 80 per cent, of the total holders of between 501 and 10,000 acres. That 'is all that may be expected under the very best of circumstances to come in as shareholders under this agreement... J submit that 6,000 shareholders in this concern- </para>

              <para>- All the Minister has shown us is that they have put up a certain amount of capital. The honorable senator and others should know that the initial capital put up in a concern of this sort may not be one quarter of the total capital required to make it a financial success before it - is finished. They may want a great deal more,, and I fully expect that they will. I do not believe, from the figures and experience in New South Wales, that the £800,000 which it is expected will be sufficient to launch this scheme will be anything like enough. I am confident that as the scheme develops it will be shown that a great deal more money in the aggregate will be required. </para>

We have to look to the interests of the people who put us here.

He occupies rather an extraordinary position for a Scotchman. I appeal to him and others to exercise a little of that canniness which is an inherent characteristic of the Scottish race.

            <para>.- As one who has taken some part in the pioneering stages of Victoria in particular, I can claim in some degree to speak of the hardships endured by the early settlers. I thought the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie were extremely tame compared with some of the experiences of my friends and myself in the- early days. No matter at what time the pioneering stages take place in any State, those hardships have to be faced, and, unfortunately, they have to be faced by men with big hearts and little money. I take it that the conditions in Western Australia are similar to those originally met with in Victoria, New South Wales, and other States where wheat is grown. To some extent, the producers of Western Australia are in the pioneering stages, and are encountering the difficulties to which I have referred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> mentioned that a crop of about 10,000,000 bushels was the average harvest in Western Australia. That certainly seems a very small quantity, but I remind honorable senators that in 189-2 Canada's total wheat production was only about 10,000,000 bushels per annum, whereas to-day it is in the neighbourhood of 180,000,000 bushels; and I claim that </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australia is more suitable for wheat cultivation than Canada. I congratulate the wheat farmers- of Western Australia upon the fine spirit  shown in meeting their peculiar difficulties in order that they may be in a position, in the matter of wheat production, to compete with other producers in the world's markets in the near future. Prior to the war, Australian producers were under peculiar difficulties in this respect, and were never able to secure a fair remuneration for their labour. If those men who pioneered the wheat areas of the different States had received adequate compensation for their labour, they would, I am sure, have been more than satisfied ; but in the case of most of them, their days are- numbered, and they will probably die comparatively poor men. We must bear in mind that for the pioneer wheat farmers there is no eight hours a day. I have seen them, during one of the worst droughts ever experienced in this country, and when the temperature ranged from 112 to 114 degrees in the shade, working from 5 o'clock in the morning until 9 o'clock at night, not in the expectation of getting a handsome financial return, but in order to make ends meet. These men have left their mark upon the history of production in this country. Only a few years ago, I, with a number of other fellow Commissioners appointed by the Government of Victoria, had an opportunity of visiting the remoter wheat -areas of this State, where the pioneers were struggling and facing extraordinary hardships in the circumstances I have mentioned. They had approached the Government with a request for financial assistance to carry them on for another year; but the Government had gone to the length of their tether in that respect, and were doubtful about the wisdom of acceding to the requests that had come to them. Accordingly, I, with the other gentlemen to whom I have referred, w.as commissioned to make an inquiry. We travelled over the area from Ouyen to Murrayville, and from Murrayville <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Pinnaroo, over the border in South Australia, and had an opportunity of getting first-hand information as to the conditions under which the men and women were struggling. I was in a position to guide my fellow Commissioners how best to act so as not to hurt  the feelings of these settlers, and in many cases we did not visit the houses, which were houses only in name, consisting of wattle and daub structures, and after three years of severe drought they were, not infrequently, filled with sand. In many cases, the children had no clothes, and the womenfolk had not had a new dress since they went there. These were the conditions that existed in that country only a few years ago. To-day, happily, some of these farmers are over their difficulties; but,, nevertheless, many, even after six years of hard work, are now only in a position to meet their accounts. </para>
          <para class="block">The farmers in Western Australia, it appears, are now determined, if possible, to adopt some up-to-date method for the handling of their wheat. I was over in Kew South Wales the other day, and heard a lecture on wheat handling in bulk, delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> one of the finest engineers in the States, now an inspector of silos for the Commonwealth Government. The lecturer described the terrible ravages from the mice pest throughout the Commonwealth a few years ago, and pictures, showing the awful condition of stacks in New South Wales and Victoria, proved most effective as a demonstration of the wisdom of handling wheat in bulk. One stack was shown to have tumbled completely down, the iron was twisted in all directions, and round about the stack were heaps of mice, estimated to be from 6 to 10 tons in weight. Now, these conditions existed only a year or two ago, and I think they might have been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who presented a mass of figures to the Senate yesterday. Figures, we are told, can be made to prove anything, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> I think, is a pretty good manipulator. </para>

              <para>- In order to give honorable senators some idea as- to the losses sustained during the last few years, I may point out that' for the season 1915-16 the quantity of wheat received in Victoria was 59,177.000 bushels. The quantity sold was 52,379,121 bushels, and the quantity in hand was 591.526 bushels. This gives a total of 52,970,647 bushels, and shows a deficit of 6,200,000 bushels, representing in value £1,581,806. To make up the deficiency on this' crop, 5,500,000 bushels were transferred from the 1916-17 crop and 750,000 bushels from the 1917-18 crop. The 1916-17 crop suffered abnormal ravages from the mouse .plague and weather conditions, and the actual expenditure on that crop for re-bagging and re-building stacks, apart altogether from expenditure in reconditioning and loss due to depreciation, was £3S0,000. </para>

              <para>- Yes; but the weather conditions were very bad, also. As the result of the mice plague, stacks tumbled down, and tons of mice were piled all around them. The pictures to which I refer have never yet been shown to the people, but they may be in the course of a year or two, and the general public will then realize the conditions which faced us' during a mice plague under the present system of bag handling of wheat. In order to give honorable senators some idea .of the cost, I may point out that prior to 1914 the highest price paid for cornsacks was 7s. 6d. per dozen, and quotations for the coming season are in the neighbourhood of 17s., representing an increase of 130 per cent. In other words, the farmer must provide bags for his new crop at 3d. per bushel more than pre-war rates. At least 25 per cent, of those crops required reconditioning, at a cost of 3d. per bag. </para>

The extra cost of bags works out at about 3d. per bushel and reconditioning, as I have said, at £d. per bushel. The depreciation in the value of the crop, due to damage by weather, vermin, and weevils, was 3d. per bushel, showing the total loss on the 1915-16 crop to be ls. per bushel. </para>

              <para>- I wish again to congratulate the Western Australian senators on having such a fine lot of enterprising farmers in their State. If we desire wheat production to continue to increase in the Commonwealth we must assist wheat-growers in the different States to adopt some improved methods of handling their crops, which will relieve them of the enormous burden they are obliged to carry at the present time owing to the obsolete system of handling wheat which we now have. I claim as one who has grown wheat under all circumstances that if honorable senators adopt such a course as to compel the continuance of the present system of handling wheat, they will be knocking the bottom out of wheat production in Australia. </para>

              <para>- That is true, because the State Minister of Agriculture advised them that, as the cost of silo construction would be so high at the present time, they had better wait a little until it became cheaper. Honorable senators will have learned that after the Napoleonic wars and other great wars, high prices due to war conditions did not fall for from five to ten years, and I question very much whether after the last great war prices will fall within that period. In connexion with this matter, I feel that the State </para>

          <para class="block">Minister of Agriculture in Victoria has shown some timidity. He is a wheat grower ; but he has been growing wheat in one . of the most prosperous districts of the State, and does not realize the hardships to . which wheat-growers pioneering the northern districts of the State have been subjected. I feel sure that if he could witness the awful conditions through which they have had to struggle, and knew that he might relieve them by establishing a better and more up-to-date method for the handling of their crops, he would take steps -in that direction immediately. The farmers of this State are, I think, somewhat timid about the adoption of bulk handling; but the men who have endeavoured to guide the destinies of the wheat-growing industry here have passed through the pioneering stage, have become to some extent prosperous, and of late years have been concerned to a greater extent with growing lambs than with growing wheat. They have been gradually giving up wheat-growing for sheep-growing, and are not now greatly affected by the difficulties which confront others in the handling of the wheat crop. In Western Australia there are very few farmers who can more profitably use their land for the growing of lambs than for the growth of wheat. The conditions in Western Australia are not so favorable as they are here for the growth of lambs. Fences are lacking, there is a scarcity of water, and the cost of materials is so high that settlers in Western Australia prefer to grow wheat until such time as the cost of materials is reduced, and that may not be for the next five or ten years. </para>
          <para>If we are to exist as a people, and pay our way, we can expect to do so chiefly by the production of wheat, wool, and lambs. These productions are essential to the existence of the country,, and if we, as members of the Senate, can do anything to encourage the farmers to help themselves, as the Western Australian farmers propose to do, to bring about a better system for the handling of their crops, we should do so. It is our duty to give them all the assistance we can. This Bill is intended to forward a very worthy object, and, in my view, contains one of the finest proposals that could be submitted to the Senate. If the farmers of Victoria were prepared to-morrow to give £2,000,000 on the condition that the Commonwealth would advance them £1,000,000 for the purpose of erecting silos, I do not think that honorable senators would hesitate for a moment to accept their proposal. </para>

            <para>. - I confess to being somewhat disappointed with the debate which has taken place on this Bill. I say, quite candidly, that I do not think that honorable senators on this occasion have made the most of the opportunity which has been presented to them. I wish to briefly review the establishment of the Wheat Pool and to refer to some of the difficulties which have had to be surmounted and which are not known to many honorable senators who were overseas when the Wheat Pool was established. It was never the conception of any one man, and it may be said to have come about as inevitable on the outbreak of the war and the development of war conditions throughout the world. There was a practical stoppage of freight to Australia to the extent of .600,000 tons, and, following the drought of 1914, we had the greatest year for production that Australia has ever known.. We were confronted in the midst of war conditions and the strenuous life which people were leading in those days with the problem of evolving a scheme for the disposal of our wheat, and I claim to-day that the establishment of the Wheat Pool, in the circumstances, was one of our greatest achievements during the war. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When we took possession of the bountiful harvest of wheat there was not one man in Australia who was able to advise me to whom I did not appeal for advice as  chairman  of the Wheat Pool when I became responsible for its administration. There was not one person who could advise me as to how long wheat would keep, and what diseases were likely to develop in it. I went into the matter, as a lay- man, with no previous experience of wheat,' and I can claim that no man worked harder than I did to acquire the knowledge of the subject in the possession of some of the best citizens of Australia. Shipping was daily decreasing, we had no iron and no steel, and the Railway Departments were slackening off in the building of trucks. We required thousands of yards of tarpaulin, and we could not buy a yard, not because we did not try, but because it was not possible to purchase it in any part of the world. We would have two days of hail and rain together, and we had to bring wheat to the seaboard. The impossibility of obtaining tarpaulins or canvas in this country cost Australia £300,000 or £400,000, and all we could do: was to sit down and look at the position. We have learned some lessons since then, and have established the flax industry in Australia. I had conference after conference with Railway Commissioners, appealing to them to supply tarpaulins for the protection of the wheat. The cleaning costs' 2d. per bushel. Many of the calculations that have been submitted to-day have been based on normal seasons, but if conditions were always normal 'we probably would not need silos. The losses incurred in connexion with one mice or weevil plague, or in consequence of damage by weather, would cover the cost of erecting silos within a period of ten years. We have already lost, owing to the unusual conditions which have prevailed, the cost of a complete silo system. I do not desire to attach the blame to any one, but we have had enormous  surpluses with which to deal, and considering all these circumstances, the losses in Australia have been exceptionally small. It is easy for some honorable senators to quote figures concerning losses, but from the official information which has been submitted to me it would appear that the actual loss has been 2.38 per cent. Even if the conditions had bean normal, and we had the most perfect machinery available for carrying out this great undertaking, it would have been a wonderful achievement; but when we consider the circumstances I do not think it can be said that a loss of only 2.38 per cent, is anything but miraculous. The honorable senator, who dealt rather exhaustively with this phase of the question - I am not blaming him for his limited knowledge, as he is to some extent a layman in wheat matters - made a somewhat bold assertion concerning the increase in weight. It is impossible to state definitely what the increase is likely to be, as it depends largely upon the conditions in which the wheat is received. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have, however, been informed on reliable authority that in some instances farmers have actually waited for rain to fall on their wheat before delivering it, with the natural result that the Australian Wheat Board was called upon to pay foi- water as well as wheat. How were we to control that? Some of the wheat received in the early days contained a good deal of moisture, but it had to be stored for so long that by the time it was ready for shipment it had not only lost its moisture, but had decreased in weight, and we were called upon to compensate the purchasers in consequence. On the other hand, we sometimes under -estimated the increase, and were fortunate enough to receive a cheque representing the difference. Nowadays we have to compensate the purchasers for the decrease ' which has occurred. </para>

              <para>- The actual loss is 2.38 per cent. I am submitting information that has been supplied to me by the Australian Wheat Board, and I am prepared to say that every individual in Australia whom we approached, and who had any knowledge of the matter, gave us the best advice available: The Australian Wheat Board sought the assistance of Governments, scientists, shippers, and wheat-handlers generally, and there was a strong desire on the part of every one to do his best in the interests of the scheme. When wheat was damaged, it was necessary to treat it, and in protecting the grain we had to purchase galvanized iron, which at one time was unprocurable in any part -of the Commonwealth. The Government, having control of shipping, became the sole importers of iron from America, and when it was being quoted .at £90 per ton, we were successful iu obtaining supplies at £65 per ton, which meant a saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the producers of this country. The whole work. had to be thoroughly organized in a manner that has never been before attempted by any Government, and it is very easy to pick out the faults and sneer at those who were doing their best to make the scheme a success. It must be remembered that the prices ruling at the time were not what they are to-day, and on one occasion I can remember being called upon to complete a midnight contract which had been made between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when abroad and M. Clementel. The agreement was drawn up on the basis of 4s. per bushel, and the Board had to provide the shipping. The agreement was submitted to the members of the Board, and every one was afraid to sign it, but I informed the Board that Ave would have to sign it, as we could not shirk our responsibility. It is easy for some honorable senators to make sneering references to the work of the Australian Wheat Board now wheat is. 15s. per bushel, but in those days we had received offers from various parts of the world ranging from 3s. to 3s. 6d. per bushel, including an offer from the British Government. Now, of course, every one can sell wheat at a good price, and I regret that we have not more at our disposal. </para>

              <para>- It may be; but such remarks are generally followed by in- <inline font-style="italic">1sinuations</inline> which reflect to some extent on the management of the Wheat Pool. No member of the Wheat Board receives a penny, or even a tram ticket, from the funds of the Pool for services rendered. Et has been a labour of love, and I think we should at least be given some 'credit for the work which we have performed under difficult circumstances. I admit that mistakes have been made - perhaps hundreds - but a mistake once made was never repeated. We had to endeavour to procure canvas to provide covering for the wheat, and had also to arrange for the proper storage. We had to contend with many difficulties, and had all the bad luck in the world, because in the " boom " year wheat was about 4s. per bushel in Chicago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has said that there was a loss of 18,000,000 bushels, and, although I am not a professional accountant, I have sufficient knowledge of accountancy to know that the figures I have submitted are reliable. The secretary of the Australian Wheat Board is a highly competent officer, and on two occasions at least he has refused promotion' to the position of auditor and head of the permanent staff in the Victorian Treasury, to enable him to complete his work. We can, therefore, accept the figures he has submitted with safety. I have been informed to-day by the secretary of the Board that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has over-estimated the losses by at least 6,000,000 bushels, and I am not quoting my opinion against that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> I am giving the figures of one of the most competent accountants in Australia. It may eventually be proved that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> figures are not altogether incorrect; but unless that honorable senator is perfectly sure that they are reliable, he has no right to make loose statements which may affect the position. </para>

              <para>- We are not able to ascertain the increase in weight;1' but the figures for 1915-16 in Victoria represent 750,000 bushels, and in Western Australia, 50,000 bushels. For 1917-18 the Victorian figures cannot be ascertained, because the whole of the wheat has not been handled. For 1918-19 Western Australia shows a gain of 99,000 bushels. Much of the matter that has been introduced during the debate would have been better left unsaid, because it necessitates me replying in defence of the officers who have been associated with the Australian Wheat Board. </para>

It is one of the grandest works ever accomplished by Australian tradesmen, and I am glad to say that there has never been an .industrial dispute in connexion with it. Although if has been in progress for some eighteen months, I have never received a complaint from any engineer as to the defective character of the work upon it. In regard to the field silos I have received complaints, but seeing that the works involve an expenditure of £1,500,000, and. that the amount in dispute for the remedying of defects in them represents only £11,000, it will be seen that there is not much cause for complaint. I have asked engineers to make an analysis of the position, and they are of opinion that the State of New South Wales is responsible for £5,000 out of the £11,000 which I have mentioned. We have ordered the contractors to remedy the defects covered by the balance, and until they do so they will not get their certificates in regard to the completion of the work. To-day it was stated that certificates had been issued. I deny that any certificate has been issued.. </para>

          <para>At ; the last [election every Nationalist candidate . urged upon, the electors the necessity for increased production. I know there is a little doubt in the minds of some honorable senators as to whether Western Australia desires to ,proceed with this scheme. Personally, I believe that the Government of that State intend to co-operate fully with the Commonwealth and with the farmers who are interested in the success of the venture. I have communications which make that fact very clear, although they do not bear the signature of the Western Australian Premier. The fact, however, that they have been forwarded to a representative of Western Australia in this Parliament is a sufficient guarantee to me of their accuracy. But even if the Government of Western Australia did not desire that this scheme should be carried out, would that be a reason why we should hold our hands and defer taking the requisite action ? ls this an inferior Parliament, or the Parliament which should lead Australia? In nine cases out of ten, during the progress of the war, there was constant cooperation between the Commonwealth and the </para>
          <para class="block">States. In most cases, I admit that that was rendered imperative, because the States had to come to the Commonwealth for financial assistance. To-day, I do not believe it possible for Western Australia to accept responsibility for the scheme which is embodied in this Bill. She can escape from her financial troubles only by production and development. This scheme will prove as big an' assistance to the Government of Western Australia as it will to the farmers of that State. .Seeing that w.e have stressed the necessity for increased production, are we now going to sit back and assume that we have not the power to do this or that? To-day this country ought to be teeming with machinery for our industries, our lands should be opening up, and our production should be based on the most scientific methods. The farmer should no longer be messing about the purchase of bags at 15s. per dozen when, by adopting the bulk system of handling, be can effect a saving of 4d. a bushel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has asked if this scheme will pay. We shall have full inquiries made into the matter, and if Western Australia is building bigger silos than she requires to accommodate her wheat, the necessary steps will be taken to safeguard our interests. We have perfect control over the matter, because, unless we vote the money required for the scheme, it cannot be proceeded with. I consider that the way in which the wheat of Australia was handled during the war period was a remarkable performance, seeing that the losses sustained were so slight. </para>
          <para>I ask honorable senators to take the big Australian view of this matter. We certainly ought to endeavour to develop wheat-growing as a national industry. During the next forty or fifty years there will be practically no limit to its development in this country; but we must recognise that our own farmers are at a disadvantage as compared with the  farmers of Argentine, Great Britain, and Canada. They must always' bo handicapped to the extent of 2d. or 3d. per bushel, owing to our geographical position. W'hen normal times re-assert themselves, a matter of 3d. per bushel may mean keeping our wheat out of the world's markets. At the recent election, we told the people of Australia that we were not in favour of continuing the compulsory Wheat Pool, but if the States deemed it necessary to establish a Pool, we would co-operate with them by every means in our power. The States have decided to establish a Pool; they have placed the conditions relating to it before us, and we have promised to co-operate with them. Of course, the Commonwealth will not requisition the wheat, but the States will acquire it, and when they have done that we shall deal direct with the States, and not with the farmers. In other words, we propose to leave all the local organization to the States, and that, I think, is a sound policy. Honorable senators stood up to this programme during the recent election campaign. I know that making promises upon public platforms is one thing, and keeping them is another; but it is our obligation to respect the pledges which we have given. Even if men disagree with us, they will, at least, honour us if we attempt to redeem our promises. </para>

              <para>- We are irretrievably committed to help industries in every possible way. I defy any member of the Nationalist party to say otherwise. I do not suggest that we are committed to every detail of the Bill, which requires to be analyzed in a secluded spot to obtain a thorough grip of its details, but to the general principle which is embodied in it I unhesitatingly say that we are committed. This will not be the first Bill of. the same character that will be submitted for our consideration. </para>

              <para>- Evidently the honorable senator thought it was good business if he could get the cash from  the Commonwealth. I hope we shall not hear a repetition of the cry, ' ' Why . do not tha States do this work for themselves? " If we are going to adopt that line of argument, it is a case of God help Australia. I hope that the Bill will be carried, and that in operation it will prove to be an undoubted success. </para>

              <para>- That is so. We are not responsible for the control of the wheat at all. The Central Wheat Board never lost a bushel or a single grain  of  wheat, because its control only started when the wheat was shipped. But, having said  bo  much, I do not think that I ought to sit down and leave the other poor, devils, who worked in the way thai I have previously stated, without saying a single word in their defence. The great majority of them worked extremely hard to make a success of the scheme. There were one or two little  incidents connected with the undertaking which  proved  the exception to that rule. Those who made mistakes have had their trial, and I am willing, as a Britisher, to accept the verdict of the Court. </para>

          <para>I hope the Bill will be a forerunner of a much-needed line of development in Australia. We have splendid possibilities, but if we wait for private enterprise bo put big undertakings of this kind on a firm basis we are likely to wait for a very long time. Every care that prudence dictates should be taken, but we have to make a bigger collective and national effort,  not  to restrict, but to help private enterprise to expand . and develop this country industrially and otherwise. I did  nob  intend to say anything offensive or hot, bub there was a good deal of a  sorb  of half-insinuation that some things were not as right' as they ought to be. I do not say they are perfect, but we have made no more mistakes than the average man, and, having got through our jobs, we want to retire when our time comes without any unpleasantness. I wish bo make a special appeal bo honorable senators generally. We have all to be a bit bigger than we were before the war, and we must take some little. risks. I believe that this is a sporting chance to help men who, in the industrial sense, have shown the best sporting spirit in Australia. They are the first body of men who have come together to help themselves in this way, and I am prepared, as I hope other honorable senators will be, to give them a chance to do work which will be a credit to themselves and to Australia'. </para>
