The bill is essentially one for consideration in committee, and I shall not, therefore, enter into a lengthy discussion of it at this stage. </para>

The Sydney City Council has incurred expense in widening the whole  of  the street, and made it one of the most  up-to-date thoroughfares in the Commonwealth, equal almost in parts to St. Kildaroad, Melbourne. This building really stultifies the work done by the Sydney City Council. From information I gathered some time ago, it appeal&#39;s that the Government have decided to remove the building, and a sum should, therefore, be provided for this purpose. There are also a number of other eyesores in Sydney, one in particular being the lamps outside the Sydney General Post Office. </para>

It is obvious why the Treasurer has departed from the practice followed last year, when provision was made for an expenditure of &#163;220,000 out of. revenue. I know that the Minister will say that, as special provision has since been made in regard to sinking fund arrangements there is no necessity to pay for any of these new works out of revenue. I join issue definitely with the Minister on that point. There is a reason why some of these works should be paid for out of revenue. I am not referring to the extension of telephone services, the undergrounding of wires, the building of post offices, or works of that description. Honorable senators who have had experience in these matters know that it does not matter how small a new work may be, whether it is simply a telephone box within or outside a post office, or even the erection of a new letter box, the expenditure will not be met out of revenue. That is going to the other extreme. It is carrying the loan policy in respect to this department too far to pay for small works of this character out of loan money. Last year the Treasurer found &#163;220,000 for minor works. If he had acted similarly this year, the department would have shown a deficit, so everything has been placed under the Loan Estimates. I merely wish to utter a definite protest against the proposal. The principle is wrong in respect of the minor operations of this great business department, as works of a minor character should be paid for out of current revenue, and not charged to loan account. </para>

                    <para>. - Yesterday I asked a question in connexion with a promise made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that a postal institute would be established at the Perth General Post Office. The secretary to the&#39; postal assistants&#39; organization in Western Australia stated that he had been informed that &#163;3,000 would be placed on the Estimates for the purpose of establishing such an institute. The answer I received was that no such promise had been made, and that funds were not available for the purpose. I should like to know if the Acting Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> can recommend that sufficient money be provided to at least make a start with the establishment of such an institute. As there is a postal institute in Melbourne, and I believe one in Sydney, there does not appear to be any reason why a start should not be made in establishing one in Perth. Such institutes are of great assistance to the officers, as they provide facilities of a recreational as well as an educational character. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has pointed out, the cost of all new works of a minor character will in future have to be paid out of loan money instead of out of revenue. .

Honorable senators knew that that was to be the policy, because, when the amending National Debt Sinking Fund Bill was recently before the Senate, it was explained that postal works of a capital nature were in future to be financed from loan funds.

                        <para>- No; for the first time, the Post and Telegraph Department is being placed upon a business basis, and is paying for its own works. Prior to this year, the balance-sheet could be regarded as fictitious, as we did not know whether the department was paying or not. It has to pay working expenses, interest on capital, and also contribute towards the sinking fund. It is a perfectly justifiable policy to pursue, and its non-adoption would lead to a restriction of postal extensions. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not. I am taking the logical outcome of the honorable senator&#39;s contention that this blank should not appear in the revenue expenditure opposite the items of postal expenditure for which &#163;220,000 was voted last year. It would mean that the progress of postal work would slow down, and would depend upon the amount of revenue available. The view of the Government is that postal services should be extended to meet the legitimate demands of the community, and that at the same time they should be required to return working expenses, interest, and sinking fund on the capital outlay. That is a better policy, and a more business-like one than would be the policy of construction according to the amount of revenue available. I have no apologies to make for the course we have adopted. It is perfectly legitimate, and is distinctly in the interests of the community, who will greatly benefit by the more rapid extension of postal services. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to make a personal explanation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has declared that the desire I expressed that minor postal works should be charged to revenue necessarily involved that all postal works essential to the development of Australia . should be charged to revenue. I did not intend to suggest that. I have always been a firm advocate of charging all postal extension works to loan funds, and 1 merely rose to point out that I did not think it right that minor postal works - small matters which did not affect the progress of Australia - should be charged to loan funds. I regret that the Minister should have gone out of his way to misrepresent entirely what I said. </para>

                    <para>. - As this clause covers the appropriation for the whole of the works included in the schedule, I take it that honorable senators are more or less free to discuss any proposal for expenditure upon new works and buildings. I avail myself, therefore, of the opportunity to lay before the Government the position in regard to the erection of Commonwealth offices &#39; in Brisbane, a work which has been contemplated for a considerable time. &#34;When I was a member of the Public Works Committee a proposal to build Commonwealth offices in Brisbane was considered by that committee. Brisbane was visited and exhaustive evidence was taken. The committee was unanimous that the offices now occupied by the Commonwealth in Brisbane were not worthy of being used for Commonwealth activities. In many cases they are badly lighted and ventilated. They are overcrowded, and are spread all over the city. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> two departments are housed in the same building. One of the worst sufferers was the taxation department, but because of the recent amalgamation with the state taxation department that position has been relieved. I understand, however, that the electoral department and the Treasury offices are housed in buildings badly lighted, badly ventilated, and sadly overcrowded. I think I am right in saying that one of the buildings occupied by the Commonwealth has recently been sold, and that it will be necessary for a new lease to be arranged or fresh premises secured, which will be a difficult matter because of the great progress of Brisbane and Queensland generally. In its report, the Public Works Committee emphasized the fact that it was desirable that the Commonwealth should have its own offices in Brisbane, and that the work of building those offices should be undertaken at the earliest possible moment. I know that the Minister, in reply, will&#39; tell me that the agitation which has taken place in Brisbane in regard to the erection of buildings on either side of what is known as Anzac Square has to a degree been responsible for the delay, but a considerable time has elapsed since arrangements were made to make a site available for the Commonwealth, and I see no reason why the work of construction should not be proceeded with at once. In view of the scattered nature of the Commonwealth departments in Brisbane, and of the desirability of having our officers housed under decent conditions, I urge the Government to expedite this work. The other day I drew the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> to the fact that the post office at Laidley, one of the oldest and most solid towns in Queensland, had been burnt down, and that the postmaster who -receives a rent allowance of &#163;20 had been obliged to find other premises, for which he was required to pay &#163;60 a year. &#34;Unfortunately the building destroyed, by fire had only been taken over from the contractor three days previously, and the whole of the loss fell on the Government; but it is now six months since the fire occurred, and it is only reasonable to ask that the building should be replaced. </para>

The result of the negotiations which then took place demonstrated how wise the Government were in not proceeding with the erection of Commonwealth offices as recommended by the Public Works Committee. In saying this, I have no desire to blame the Public Works Committee for their report. They could not be aware of what was subsequently to come about. The Government will be in a very much better position under the new agreement. It will enable us to save at least &#163;100,000 on the building to be erected. However., as the matter had already been referred to the Public Works Committee, we thought it only right, and, as a matter of fact, it was in accordance with the requirements of the Public Works Committee Act that, when the fresh negotiations had reached finality, the work should be again referred to the committee. That has been done, and the Government are now awaiting a report from the committee. If the honorable senator has any complaints  about  the delay, I suggest that he should have a few words with some of the members of the Public Works Committee. </para>

                <para class="block">I might mention, in reference to the item of &#163;2,500 for Breardon&#39;s Dam, that it is intended to give a practical test to a suggestion that in the country in the vicinity of the Macdonnell Ranges, where there is a rainfall of about 10 or 12 inches per annum, it would be possible to conserve water fairly cheaply by means of surface dams. The ex-Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> who has a practical knowledge of the Mallee country, is quite confident that that can be done, and will be cheaper than the present practice of providing wells and bores. This year, therefore, it is proposed to make an experiment on a site . selected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline> Ward, !the Government Geologist of South Australia. </para>

It is well supplied with bores every 20 or 30 miles, but there is no similar provision on the stock route from Wave Hill towards Wyndham. Since a considerable number of cattle are sent to Wyndham for treatment, the Government now proposes to tackle the problem that that stock route presents. </para>

                        <para>- The work is progressing. A contractor is now engaged on the Wave Hill route, and the work is also proceeding at the Charlotte Waters bore. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stefansson</inline> told me yesterday that he saw the men at work at Charlotte Waters, and they hoped that when the bore had been sunk another 100 feet it would be finished. I desire to correct a false impression that has been created by a criticism in another place. In one of his articles in the Melbourne press, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stefansson</inline> related the tragedy of a drover proceeding with cattle in the direction of Adelaide. He got on well until he reached Charlotte Waters, but on going further south he found, to his dismay, that the machinery . at the next well had broken down. Since there was another well 20 miles further on, he continued his journey with the cattle, hoping that water would be obtainable there. On arrival, however, he found that this machinery, too, . was out of order, af act which he had no means of ascertaining beforehand. . Although his stock had already travelled 40 or 50 miles without water, he then had to take them another 30 miles. On this account the Home and Territories Department came in for some very severe criticism in the other branch of the legislature. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stefansson</inline> explained to me yesterday that the well to which he &#39;referred was not in the Northern Territory, but was under the control of &#39;the South Australian Government. I trust, therefore, that that criticism will not be repeated. </para>

                        <para>- He will submit a report to the Government. He is now engaged in preparing it, and when it is completed&#39; I shall have much pleasure in presenting it to Parliament. The vote includes &#163;1,400 for additions to buildings, and &#163;7,961 for roads, culverts, and bridges. The Government is not attempting to make roads in the Northern Territory ; that would be far too vast a problem to tackle at the present time, but it is intended to make some provision to enable motor and other traffic to cross the numerous creeks which are periodically flooded. As a matter of fact, a great deal of the Northern Territory country is ideal for motor traffic. Tussocks are troublesome, but I have travelled up to 40 miles an hour over virgin country in a Ford car. The creeks, in which great quantities of silt are deposited, need to have temporary crossings, and, therefore, the Government has decided to make provision for them at the most difficult points. For the police station at Pine Creek &#163;282 is provided. The present home for half-castes at Alice Springs is quite unsuitable, and is close to an hotel. A good building is required, and the Government has asked for a preliminary vote of &#163;2,500. Money is required for police stations in various parts of the Territory, for the present buildings are in a disgraceful condition. The sum set down for this purpose represents a continuation of the vote made last year. There is also &#163;500 for the -erection of a magazine for the storage of explosives at Port Darwin. The total expenditure on works now contemplated in the Northern Territory will, it is estimated, amount to &#163;62,626. The amount provided this year towards the cost of that programme is &#163;20,000. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> on the fact that money is to be provided for the necessary works which he has indicated. When certain members of the Public Works Committee visited the Territory over two years ago, practically all the works now contemplated were recommended as urgently necessary. I regret that it has taken two and a half years since members of the Public Works Committee reported on the matter for the Government to decide to establish a bungalow for half-castes in a suitable locality. The present building is certainly in a disgraceful condition. Why was &#163;9,000 brought forward from last year&#39;s vote for the improvement of wells and bores? </para>

I hope that the Minister will push on with all possible speed with the work of placing these wells in a proper state of repair. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stefansson</inline> every credit for the good work that he has done in drawing attention to this matter, but it strikes one as rather peculiar that although the Public Works Committee and the party from the Department of Home and Territories have reported the lack of adequate watering facilities and recommended improvements, publicity was not given to the matter until attention was pointedly directed to it by a stranger from, another land. </para>

The Territory swallows up a considerable amount of the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. It is proposed to expend this year &#163;96,610. That sum, together with the interest bill of &#163;79,700, will make a total expenditure on the Territory for the current financial- year of &#163;176,310. I listened with a good deal of attention to the statement of the Minister, because I am interested in the development of the Northern Territory. I have not yet had time to visit it, but I hope to do bo. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the Northern Territory comprises something like 500,000 square miles, yet it has a population of less than 3,000 persons. I am not at all satisfied with its development. Every effort that so far has been made to settle it has been thwarted in some way, and apparently the present conditions will continue for an indefinite period. The provision of a water supply for stock  is a very valuable and permanent work, which must have excellent results. It is somewhat strange that it should be necessary to construct a stock route, and provide a water supply on that route, across to Wyndham, when there is a route to the Queensland railhead. </para>

                        <para>- If the Northern Territory had conferred upon it some form of local government it might be able to dispense with a large amount of Commonwealth expenditure that is now found to be necessary. Apparently the belief is that the Northern Territory will require for a long time to be supported by the other states. I do not agree with those who look upon the interior of Australia as a desert. From articles I have read in various journals,- that is a misnomer, and it is well to have such an erroneous idea dispelled by visits similar to those that were made by the Public Works Committee and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Stefansson  The Northern Territory is large enough and wealthy enough to depend upon its own resources.

                    <para>.- I am very glad that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has had this amount placed upon the Estimates for the provision of wells along stock routes in the Northern Territory. I urge him to have the- existing wells inspected, to see if they are in a proper state of repair. A great deal of trouble and expense can be saved if repairs are undertaken before the wells become completely blocked up. One must have had the experience of droving a mob of cattle along a dry track to realize the sufferings through which they pass, and the anxieties that beset those who are in charge of them It is extremely difficult to hold in check cattle that are nearly mad with thirst; especially when a well is reached thai is out of order, and the animals smell the water at the mouth of the bore. Apart from the anxiety of the men in charge of the herd, there is the loss sustained by the owner, because the condition of the beasts depreciates very rapidly when long dry stretches have to be negotiated, and when they reach their destination their quality is so poor that they are of very little use. I know what it is to be thirsty, and to Be compelled to go without water&#39; &#34;for fairly lengthy periods. Therefore, my sympathies are always with the men who are battling against drought conditions. The only way to ensure the prosperity of the Northern Territory is to stock it with cattle, and the stock-owners t who are doing their best to improve the conditions, should not have their difficulties increased by neglect- on the part of the Government to do its duty  in sinking wells along stock routes, and keeping them in a proper state of repair. </para>

                    <para>. - The work of constructing tine railway is being proceeded with, but, as the honorable member knows, the difficulty that has to be faced is the Katherine River, which it is impossible to cross in the wet season. Realizing that, the railway authorities came to the conclusion that before they could push on with the railway on the opposite side of the- river it was necessary to have a bridge constructed across the  river.  Contracts have been let for the supply of bridge material, and.- the piers are being erected. I should say that in the early part of the coming year the bridge will be completed, and it will then be possible to take material across it, and continue the construction of the railway to Daly Waters, which has been approved by Parliament. A survey of that portion of the line is now being made, and&#39; as soon as the bridge has been constructed we shall be able to go right ahead with the work as far as Daly Waters. </para>

It would be well worth the time of any honorable senator to go there and see the work that is being, done by the young officer in charge.

                    <para>, - I. think I should not be acting fairly to the committee&#39; if I did not give some information as to what is proposed in regard to munitions supply. Towards the cost of machinery and plant for the manufacture of munitions not now produced in Australia, there - is in this proposed vote a sum of &#163;51,523. This vote is for the purchase of machinery for the manufacture of tools and gauges for shop equipment, cranes,, boilers, furnaces, and electrical&#39; plant, for the following factories, namely, high explosives and filling, cartridge cases and fuses, gun carriages and shells, and machine guns and pistol. The total estimated cost. of this programme is &#163;452,350; of which amount &#163;117,672 was spent to the 30th June, 1924. Item No. 2, &#163;20,000, deals with preliminary and&#39; experimental work, raw material, and stores, wages* and other expenses in connexion with the initiation and&#39; maintenance of munitions production. This vote is to meet the cost of labour in the new factories, reserves of stores for the existing factories, and stores and supplies generally for the new factories. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; out of the special vote for munitions supply, to which I referred when dealing with the budget statement. That part of the expenditure is being met out of revenue only. In connexion with item 2, the expenditure last year was devoted to the overhaul and repair of the munitions plant purchased from the British Government, experimental work on the new types of munitions not previously made here, such as fuses, machine guns, pistol ammunition, &#38;c, purchases of reserves of stores for the existing factories, and the materials required for starting the new factories, temporary assistance to staff engaged in developing the programme, as well as a number of .minor items, largely liabilities in connexion with work which was commenced during the previous year. That, together with the special vote to which I referred just now, has brought us within appreciable distance of the time when we shall be able to make shells for field and machine guns; as well as revolvers and fuses; and thus become independent so far as those most important munitions are concerned. </para>

                    <para>.- The sum of &#163;747 is set down for the  Institute of Science and Industry. In view of the great interest that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> have always taken in this institute, I consider that this is an appropriate occasion for &#39; you to leave the Chair in order that you may once again express your views. A severe handicap is placed upon you by your occupancy of the Chair when an item . of this nature is under discussion. Were I as conversant with this subject as you yourself are, I should endeavour to act as your  deputy  until a transfer of  Chairman  could be made, but I have not made such a study of the subject as you have done. I feel that you will be aggrieved if this item goes through without your having had an opportunity to express your dissatisfaction at the small sum of money made available for the establishment and equipment of the Institute of Science and Industry. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that this matter was discussed recently. Not very long ago, as the result of a motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> to lay on the table of the Senate the papers in connexion with the Forests Products Laboratory, a free discussion took place in this chamber. The Senate then showed itself to be dissatisfied with the existing position. Yet we find that the small sum of &#163;747 only is to be provided. What is that amount for? Is it to help the work of the Institute of Science and Industry? Is it an indication that the Government seriously intends to continue this department, or does it mean that it is to be dispensed with? </para>

                    <para>. - For the establishment and equipment of the Institute of Science and Industry the sum of &#163;3,342 was voted by Parliament for 1923-24, but at the end  of the year only &#163;923 had been expended. If, when those Estimates were framed, it was considered by the Government that the sum of &#163;3,342 was necessary to meet the demands of the position, why was so small a sum expended. It is impossible for the Institute of Science and Industry to function as it should unless it is properly equipped. Last year the Government evidently recognized that fact, and provided a sum of money sufficient to enable the Institute to procure a great deal of equipment necessary to its investigation of a number of matters then engaging its attention. For some unknown reason the Treasurer, after securing from Parliament the authority to vote this money for the institute, has failed to make it available. As only &#163;923 of the &#163;3,342 voted last year has been expended, it is not surprising that the director, in his annual report, has complained most bitterly of the Government keeping the institute painfully short of funds; indeed, to such an extent that it was almost impossible for it to perform any useful work. Although it was estimated that &#163;3,342 was necessary last year, and only &#163;923 was expended, it is now proposed to vote only &#163;747. Is it seriously suggested that it is possible for the institute to carry on useful work with such limited funds? </para>

                        <para>- That seems to be the case. Some explanation is necessary as to why the &#163;3,342 voted was not expended. The director must have re ported that equipment to that value was necessary, otherwise the Government would not have made the money available. The Minister suggests that the institute can get all the equipment it desires. The statements are conflicting, and the Minister should give some information as to why the department is being starved. When the institute was created we had the highest hopes that it would be of great value to Australia in overcoming many of the pressing and important problems that confronted it, but as the amount voted has been whittled down from &#163;3,342 last&#39; year to &#163;747- heaven only knows what it will be next year - how can we expect beneficial results? Probably the department, will succumb to anaemia, or some similar malady. If the institute is of any value its operations should be allowed to extend, and if it is not performing a useful service for the  community, the Government should have the courage to ask Parliament to repeal the act under which it was constituted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The institute is one of the most important of our governmental activities, and has taken in hand the solution of problems which, up to the present, have defied the skill of the most expert scientists in the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding the work of the institute, the activities of the permanent board recently established by the Queensland Government, and the efforts of private enterprise in Queensland and New South Wales, the prickly pear pest is extending at the rate of 1,000,000 acres a year. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the item refers to equipment for dealing with such pests as prickly pear, blow fly, and bunchy top. I believe that better results would be achieved in the destruction of prickly pear if the staff of the institute were to abandon their scientific methods and go into the country to assist to -eradicate the pest by using ordinary implements. The institute has not been responsible for the destruction of one prickly pear plant. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not know if the proposed vote is sufficient to meet the requirements of the institute, but I am. satisfied, from the liberal manner in which it has been treated by Parliament, that if it required more it would be granted. I am looking forward to the time when, with the assistance of other organizations, it will be able to do something to eradicate the prickly pear,, which is unquestionably one of the greatest land monopolists -of the Commonwealth. I have no objection to the expenditure of &#163;747 on new equipment if it will be a means of assisting in the destruction of pests which are prevalent throughout the Common wealth. </para>

Our standing orders and -sessional orders are for  a  specific purpose and in this instance, no valid reason has been given for their suspension. I trust that in future the business of the Senate will be conducted without adopting this course. If it is found that our standing and sessional orders are not sufficiently elastic to render it unnecessary to move (for their suspension, they should be amended. </para>

                        <para>I say, candidly, the Government did not want to interfere. They did so only at the urgent call of the industry.

It is true that the amount of bounty paid on meat exports does not exceed &#163;4,307, but to 16th April, 1924, the total amount of bounties paid- by the Commonwealth on different goods amounted to &#163;4,096,963.

The figures I have given indicate that three large companies exported 14,904 . head of cattle and received &#163;7,452 in bounty; while small individuals exported 1,404 head of cattle and received &#163;702 in bounty. Some other means* must be discovered to put life into the meat industry, which some of our greatest exporters declare is not worth keeping going. I do not propose to discuss that aspect of the question, but Australia should certainly produce sufficient meat for home consumption. If the working classes of Australia could get meat at a reasonable price, the producers would get . better prices and be more satisfied than they can be through the payment of a miserable bounty which may not last for more than , a year. Where . 1 live, I am obliged to pay ls. 6d. a lb. for rump steak. It is absolutely impossible for the working classes to pay that price. A man who does hard work needs a meat diet. The soft foods he is obliged to substitute for meat in order to keep him alive will not build up a virile nation, and will not impart that strength to the body or give to. the mind those ennobling sentiments that permit on&#169; to soar high above his fellows. I know that the Government are not anxious to continue this policy of paying small bounties from one year to another. I have already shown that when the first Meat Export Bounty Bill was passed, the Minister in charge of the measure declared that the principle was obnoxious, and that the Government would not continue the payment of the bounty after the first year. </para>

                            <para>- The consumption of meat in Australia has fallen off by almost 50 per cent, owing to the inability of the poorer classes to purchase it. The high retail price of meat has resulted in many families having to be reared on inferior food. The bounty to be paid under the bill will assist a few capitalistic firms, but it will be of no benefit to the people generally. The overseas market for Australian meat seems to decrease every year. London importers declare that Australia will never be able to compete with the Argentine, for the simple reason that four weeks after a beast has been killed in the Argentine, the meat is placed upon the consumer&#39;s table in Great Britain. I ask whether it is worth while bothering about the Australian cattle industry. Let us look to other industries for the purpose of developing this country. The large tracts now held as cattle runs could be more profitably utilized- for the production of wool and cotton. These industries would certainly result in increased employment in Australia. Generally speaking.&#39; the vast areas held by the pastoralists in northern Australia are badly cared for, and insufficiently fenced. By systematic effort the Government, could make artesian water supplies available for sheep-raising and cotton-growing in most of the areas now devoted to cattle. The large lessees are gradually abandoning the cattle industry, and it seems to me that it will eventually be necessary to use the land for the production of wool and cotton. Australian wool has already achieved a wonderful reputation, and this country is capable of producing the finest cotton in the world. Scarcely any benefit will be derived from the palliative of paying a bonus of 10s. per head on the export of live cattle. The real remedy is to be found in a substantial increase of the home consumption of beef. An effective system of&#34; land tenure should be put into operation in the areas now devoted to cattle-raising. The present lessees do not trouble whether the land is productive or not. They merely hold it for the purpose of profit. If there were a good system of marketing the cattle, so that the consumers in Australia could obtain meat at a reasonable figure, the growers would receive a better price than they are likely to get even with the assistance of a government bounty. I should feal inclined to let the export cattle industry peter out. </para>

                        <para>. - I disagree entirely with the last speaker, that the beef industry should be allowed to die. It will not be long before Australia will consume all the beef she is now producing. The percentage of our beef that is exported to-day is comparatively small, and since the population of Australia is on the increase - it is rapidly growing when compared with the rate of increase in some countries - we should not permit this great industry of the north to pass out of existence. Nor should we allow our cattle country to be utilized for sheep-raising and cotton -growing: This generation may not live to see the day, but the next will certainly see it, when the southern part of Australia will depend almost entirely for its supplies of beef on our great northern lands, and it would be a thousand pities if that industry were allowed to disappear. I heartily support the bill, but I particularly rose to ask how the Government proposed to meet the expenditure incurred under the bill. As far as I am able to see, no provision for it is made on the Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- In my own state the people have to pay ls. 3d. and ls. 6d. per lb. for rump steak, and. in many parts of Australia the working classes cannot afford to purchase an adequate supply of meat. Some of the small owners in the north-west country have no chance of exporting their cattle because the whole of the space in the ships is secured by the large exporters. Consequently the owner of a small herd generally has to sell his cattle to a large owner rather than drive them back to his run. Thus it will be impossible foi: the small man to obtain a fair deal under the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - The export of cattle on the hoof from Western Australia to overseas markets is practically confined to the Dutch East Indies and Singapore. That is a very useful export trade, because it is a peculiar fact that the natives in the Dutch East Indies will not buy prime beef. Therefore, the cattle that are designated by stockmen &#34; forward stores &#34; - and sometimes they are not very forward - are sent there. I should like to be informed of the number of cattle that is exported annually on the hoof from Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia exports the greatest proportion of that number from the port of Broome to Sourabaya, Batavia, and Singapore. I can support this proposal with a clear conscience, in the first place, because it will not cost very much, and in the second place because it will confer a distinct benefit upon the people of Western Australia. It will also induce the export of cattle which would never become fat if they spent the whole of their lives in the richest pastures. Such animals, as a rule, are called &#34; pikers.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Those regulations provide- that the beasts exported shall be free from- disease, but they do not set a standard of quality. A- beast may be very poor in quality and yet be free from a disease which would prevent its exportation. We- should&#34; make sure that the cattle exported are of good quality, because nothing damages the reputation of Australia abroad so much as the statements that are made from- time- to time that our exports are of poor grade or quality. Other exporting countries have gained- at our- expense, because there has not been rigid supervision of the goods that we have sent abroad. </para>

                            <para>- This is a bill to assist the Australian Investment Agency Company Limited. Surely that company is in a position to help, itself . Why should the people of the Commonwealth be compelled to come to its assistance ? . No information has been supplied to the Senate as to . the- constitution of this company . If we were supplied with the names of the shareholders, we should probably find that they are men who, both individually and collectively, would Be ashamed to plead for 10s. per head&#39; for each animal exported by them.. I do not know McGlew, Monger., and Company, but they received &#163;1,371 for 2,742 cattle which they exr ported. In the absence of further information, the Senate should not pass the bill. Its. purpose is to hand over to these companies: a. portion of the revenue obtained from income and. land, taxation, Customs duties, and other sources. In view, of the number of years in which these companies have been engaged in this industry, they should be able to rely upon their own resources. I agree with previous speakers that, if we desire to assist the cattle producers of the Commonwealth, there are more effective ways of doing it than this bill proposes. An. effort should be - made by these companies to supply the local market. We do not exist only for the purpose of providing food and raiment for people abroad. The requirements of the Commonwealth should be our first consideration. But the Government is more concerned about assisting companies like the Australian&#34; Investment Agency Company Limited than in securing an adequate supply of cheap and good meat for its people. On these grounds, and for other reasons which I could advance, I cannot see my way to support this bill. While bounties of all descriptions are of very doubtful&#39; value, this bill is particularly objectionable1. Only a small amount was. paid as bounty last year, but that i&#38; no. guarantee that the sum will not- be larger this year. This is one of those measures which propose to subsidize, from the national revenue, people who are well able to look after their own interests. Imagine taxing the people who attend picture shows to pay men like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman, who received in bounty the sum. of &#163;143 8s. 9d. ! </para>

The owner of the Roper Valley station, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> W.

With the exception of the last mentioned station, all those stations are north of the Katherine River. That represents a total of 2,534 live cattle in respect of which &#163;1,267 was paid in bounty direct to the growers. In addition, bounty was paid to a number of exporters who satisfied the Collector of Customs that they had purchased the cattle from bona fide pastoralists, at a price which included the amount of the bounty, as provided for in section 6 (3) of the Meat Exports Bounty Act 1923, or that they were the agents of the pastoralists. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> C. Sleigh, of Melbourne, who exported the cattle for Thonemann and Sons, owners of the Elsey and Hodgeson stations, received in bounty &#163;240 10s. in respect of 481 cattle. The Australian Investment Agency Company Limited, of Perth - this mysterious company referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> - exported 1,508 cattle, for which the sum of &#163;754 was paid. This company acted as agents for the Ord River and Waterloo stations in Western Australia. McGlew, Monger and Company, of Derby, exported 2,742 cattle, and were paid &#163;1,371. They are stock agents, and collected the bounty under the written authority of the pastoralists for whom they acted. There can be no doubt about their bona &#34;fides, seeing that the pastoralists themselves satisfied the Customs Department that they had actually received from the firm the amount of the bounty. </para>

                            <para>- The figures I have given represent a total bounty of &#163;1,267 paid on 2,534 live cattle exported by the growers of the cattle, and, in the case of agents, the sum of &#163;2,365 10s. was paid for 4,731 cattle. The grand total is &#163;3,632 10s. for 7,265 live cattle exported. Before paying the bounty to the exporters who purchased the cattle from the pastoralists, the Collector of Customs satisfied himself, from an examination of the books and documents, of the exporters, that the growers of the cattle had received a price not lower than the ordinary market price prevailing at the time of sale, plus the bounty. This course has been followed for two years, and has not led to any complaint from the owners or the exporters of cattle. If it can be shown that more rigid control is necessary in connexion with the payment of the bounty this year, steps will be taken to that end in the regulations which will be framed when the bill becomes law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> seems to be under the impression that the payment of a bounty on live cattle for export will be a means of assisting to keep up the price of meat, but as I stated by interjection, the cattle on which a bounty is to be paid would not, in any case, come to, say, Perth, or Melbourne, as they are in the Northern Territory or the extreme north-west of Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No, and unless they are handled in this way, they will have to remain on the runs. Owing to the closing of the meat-works at Darwin, a number of cattle have had to remain on the runs so long that they are now too old to be slaughtered except for boiling down purposes, and to secure the hides. </para>

                            <para>- No. There is no market for them. Vestey Bros, are proposing next year to open up their works for boiling-down purposes in order to clear off the present surplus, and if this is done, the carcasses can be boiled down and the hides marketed. There is no market in Australia for live cattle from the areas mentioned. Even if the price of meat were to be increased threefold, not a single head of these cattle would come south. Apart from that, there is the question of tick and the quarantine regulations in force in- Victoria and Western Australia, which would not allow cattle to come south. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> pointed out that  Australia is going, out of the export cattle trade, and said that the time will undoubtedly arrive when we shall not be able to do more than supply the local demand. In speaking to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stefansson,</inline> who has studied the food supplies of the world - he is one of our best authorities on this&#39; subject - he drew my attention to the interesting fact that that has been the experience of the United States of America. He pointed out that in the United States of America, up to the time the population reached 60,000,000, the number of cattle equalled the population. When the population was 60,000,000 there were 60,000,000 cattle in the country, and up to that time meat was being exported to Europe. Prom that period, the number of cattle remained stationary, whilst the population in- creased. and, to-day, he informed me that the approximate population is 110,000,000 and the number of cattle 60,000,000. The United States of America has, therefore, ceased to be a factor in the  European . meat market. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stefansson</inline> also informed me that his investigations had convinced him that a similar position was shaping itself in the Argentine, but from a somewhat different cause. The situation in the Argentine is due not merely to increased population, but to an increase in the production of cereals, as much land that . was previously used for cattle-raising is now under cultivation. </para>

It is true- that there is no special provisions in the Estimates. It has either to be taken from the Treasurer&#39;s advance or from the &#163;500,000 provided in the Estimates for the marketing of products. I point out that when the Estimates were brought down, this bill had not been passed, and there was, therefore, no statutory authority to find the money. That is why it has not been included.
