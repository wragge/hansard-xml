                        <para>- I may explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> and to other honorable senators that the rule which governs the submission of questions is that they must be asked only for the purpose of obtaining information, and must not contain any argument, inference, or imputation. The Standing Orders confer upon me the right to revise every question submitted, so that it shall strictly conform to this requirement. As a matter of fact, however, it would be impossible i for me to supervise every question, and they are placed before me only when the officers of the Senate are doubtful regarding the terms in which they are worded. When they are so submitted I endeavour to make them conform as nearly as possible to the Standing Orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Kingsmill's  question as it now appears on the notice-paper complies with the rule that questions may be asked only for the purpose of obtaining information. All the information originally sought can be obtained by asking the question in its present form.. The only part that has been c-ut out is what might be termed an unintentional insinuation that the Government may supply unauthentic information to honorable senators. I do not think that the honorable senator intended to make that insinuation. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Government cannot accept the amendment because it would lay down a form of procedure quite foreign to that which is set out in the rest of the clause. The clause provides that a transfer or promotion to fill a vacancy in a department shall be made by the permanent head of that department, and that if an officer concerned feels he has been overlooked or wrongly treated, he may appeal to the board which so far has not appeared in the matter. It is upon the appellant's representations that the board comes to a decision. The amendment proposes that the permanent head who has made the promotion and has therefore committed himself, shall sit in conference with the appellant, but as a matter of fact, there are two persons concerned, the officer promoted as well as the appellant. The honorable senator would permit the appellant to take part in the proposed conference, but not the officer who had been promoted, and who would have  ju3t  as much right as the appellant to take part in the conference. If the appellant succeeded the other officer would lose his position without having had the opportunity to say a word in his own defence. As that obviously would be most, unfair to the officer promoted, I ask the committee to reject the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I know that section 27 of the act says clearly that the board must classify the Public Service, and that when that classification is completed it must be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> so that all members of the' service may see it, and if dissatisfied may appeal against it. This work, however, has not yet been done. The Minister says that, the reason for the delay is that the act is defective, and that the board is possibly submerged by work - work which, I remind the committee., was formerly undertaken by one commissioner. There are three members on the board, and we are told that additional inspectors have been appointed, yet the task of classifying the service cannot be completed . I think the board has set about, its work in I he wrong way. The Government,  instead of introducing an amending bill, should compel the board to complete the classification so that all members of the service may have the opportunity to appeal as they had the right to do before the act of 1922 was passed. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment will inflict no injustice on an officer who has been provisionally promoted; nor will it prevent him from being heard if he chooses to be represented at the conference for which the amendment provides. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> reads my amendment carefully he will see that the representative of the permanent head of the department in which the vacancy occurs and a representative of the organization to which the appellant belongs will sit in conference. The appellant need not be there in person. He will possibly be represented by the general secretary of the Public Service Association. The adoption of the amendment will prevent a recurrence of the old system, of an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. The men who sit in conference will have a particular knowledge of the work performed by both the appellant and the officer who has been promoted, a knowledge which the board cannot be expected to have. The claim of an officer who feels that he has been unjustly treated in the matter of promotion should be determined only by those who have an intimate knowledge of his qualifications. The board cannot be expected to have that intimate knowledge which is necessary to determine such a case. </para>

                <para class="block">This clause embodies the obnoxious system that public servants shall take recreation leave in lieu of being paid for overtime. The universal practice of the Arbitration Court is to award that work performed on holidays shall be paid for, and that is the principle which I am sure appeals to honorable senators. The practice that overtime worked shall be taken out as recreation leave at some other time means that when a public servant is absent the other members on the staff have to do his work, which is not in the interests of the Department, neither is it a proper procedure. The practice of granting leave at some other time is not desired by public servants, neither is it a good one, as a holiday on some other occasion is not equivalent to absence from duty on a public holiday. On a public holiday it is the custom of members of a family, or of officers in a particular department, to arrange picnics or other outings, and it is of greater benefit to have a holiday on such days when provision lias been made for the people's enjoyment. </para>

Under this clause the paid holidays will number nine, but there are four other holidays for which public servants may get time off, making a total of thirteen as against twelve The only difference is that the four days for which they get time off may be added to the annual recreation leave, in respect of which they receive full pay. On the whole, therefore, the Public Service will gel a little benefit under the amending bill. The money paid for holiday service is excessive; it amounts to £37,000 per annum. This is a fair compromise. There are nine statutory holidays for which public servants are paid, but they may be given four other holidays, which can be arranged according to the- requirements in a particular state. . In Melbourne, for instance, there is a holiday on Cup Day, and in Perth and Sydney a holiday for the Royal Agricultural Show. If a holiday is granted on those days it is added to an officer's annual leave. To grant nine statutory paid holidays is a fairly generous proposal, and I trust the committee will agree to the clause in its present form. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a good deal to be said in favour of the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin.</inline> In all awards made by the Arbitration Court and by wages boards operating under the Factories Act, provision is made for extra pay for holidays. If it were suggested that the acts I have mentioned should be amended so that workers should be given time off instead of payment for work done on holidays, there would be such a strong agitation against the proposal that there would be little prospect of its acceptance. We hope that the Government will treat public servants in the matter of holidays in the same way as employees outside ate treated. The average man, whether in the Public Service- or outside, wishes to be free on a holiday when thousands are on pleasure bent. It does not seem in accordance with the fitness of things that some should be working when thousands of their friends and relations are enjoying themselves. But, when necessity compels the Government to work their employees on holidays, extra payment should be made, instead of time off being given at a later period. The proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> As a reasonable one, and if the Government will not accept it at this juncture, perhaps they will consider it. If there is anything the Government should desire it is uniformity in regard to payments made to those engaged in the work-a-day world. Public servants are citizens of the Commonwealth, and are entitled to the same consideration as other citizens. To differentiate merely because public servants are working under an act of Parliament, whilst others are working under Arbitration Court or wages board awards, is wrong in principle. </para>

                    <para>. - The memorandum read by the honorable senator does not touch the question of recreation leave, for the obvious reason that it referred to officers who were resigning from the service. Recreation leave is given to an officer in order that he may fit himself for his work during the ensuing twelve months. Officers who are about to retire do not get recreation leave, as they are about to leave the service. </para>

                        <para>- An officer will be entitled to that leave. Actually, it will be no concession at all, because fellow officers will do the work of officers on holiday leave, and assuming that the service is not overmanned, I do not think it ie in the interests of the administration that fellow servants should be called on to do extra work on those days. There is, as I have said, an important principle involved. It has been established by the Arbitration Court, and is recognized universally outside the service. I trust the committee will vote for my amendment. </para>

Such power did not rest with the administration authorities under the two previous acts, and it is urged that the wide discretionary power proposed to be given to the board in the proposed new subsection 7a is altogether too drastic. This is a new and very drastic provision, and unless the Minister can show strong reasons for its inclusion in the bill, the committee should strike it out. </para>

It is obvious that an officer holding a responsible position should not be permitted to decide for himself whether, on certain occasions, he should draw holiday pay; and it is wise that the board should have the power to regulate the granting of this pay, otherwise the officer may grant himself holiday pay to which he is really not entitled. Under certain circumstances, the board will have the power to grant holiday pay to officers receiving not less than .£450 per annum. </para>

                    <para>. - As promised, I have reconsidered this clause. Its object is to settle definitely the question of entry to the service by competitive examination of persons previously in the public, railway, or other service of a state, or some  other  service of the Commonwealth. Section 48 of the principal act meets the case of an officer whose service is continuous, but not that of an officer who enters the Commonwealth Public Service as a result of a competitive examination. Persons who may be in the naval, railway, or some other service of the Commonwealth or the states decide for themselves whether they shall enter for the competitive examination. The man who decides to go up for a competitive examination, and, if successful, to leave the service in which ho is employed and enter another service, is in quite a different position from these who are transferred. He may have had ten years' service in the naval service or in the railway service of a state. Supposing there are five vacancies, and he and four others from outside pass the examination and are appointed. Why should he  have  ten years' seniority over the other four? This is the main entrance door to the Commonwealth Public Service. Because this man elects to come from, some state or other service it is proposed that he shall start off in the Commonwealth Public Service with ten years' seniority. That would be obviously wrong. There is provision whereby if an  officer  is transferred from one of those other departments to the Commonwealth Public Service, his service is regarded as continuous. The Government feels that a man who submits himself to a competitive examination should not be given an advantage over others who are, perhaps, equally as well qualified, who  pass  a similar examination just as meritoriously. The adoption of the clause will not prejudice any officer now in the Public Service, as any claims for the recognition of state or other service by entrants to the Commonwealth Public Service as the  result  of competitive examinations have invariably been refused first by the Commissioner and later by the board. The clause definitely clears the matter up, and removes any doubt that may previously have existed. In order that state service shall count as Commonwealth service the Commonwealth appointment must flow from the state service. If, however, a person enters for a competitive examination, he stands on the same footing as other competitors from outside the Public Service, and enters the Commonwealth Public Service without credit on account of previous service in a state. Section 44 of the principal act provides - </para>

                    <para>Any officer of the public, railway, or other service of a state employed in a permanent capacity, whether appointed thereto before or after the commencement of this act, may be appointed to the Commonwealth service by  the  board, without examination, and, if the board think fit, without probation. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Persons appointed to the Commonwealth service under that section are entitled to carry their state service with them. The clause does not affect the operation of those provisions or of the provisions of section 45 of the principal act. The object aimed at is to place the matter on a definite legal basis, and to establish on that legal basis what has hitherto been the invariable practice. I hope that, with this explanation, the committee will allow the clause to pass. </para>

The Minister has laid stress upon the fact that these men of their own volition elect to submit themselves to a competitive examination. He says that that examination is open to all citizens of the Commonwealth. It is, then, open to every member of the Commonwealth Public Service as well as to every member of the State Public Service. If a certain number of these citizens have the ambition, the initiative, and the energy to study and to compete for positions at a competitive examination in order to assist the Commonwealth Public Service, why should they, after having won their spurs, lose the advantage of the period they have spent in another employment ? </para>
