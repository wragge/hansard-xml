I like a luncheon as well as anybody else, and the less I pay for it the better I like it - that is human nature; but when a newspaper goes out of its way to express itself in these terms, it is a disgrace to itself and an insult to any public man. Therefore, I resent it, and I feel confident that every honorable senator will resent it as much  as  I do. </para>

                    <para>. - In a friendly way, I suggest that the Government should allow the Bill to be defeated on the third reading so that they may re-introduce a properly considered measure.  It  is the first occasion on which such a huge joke has been perpetrated on the Senate. After a Bill has been carefully dealt with during the second-reading and Committee stages, we are asked to recommit it for the purpose of recasting it and making it an absolutely new measure. It is quite evident that the Government were not prepared when they brought down their first Bill, because they now propose to have almost every clause reconsidered. It is not a new measure suddenly sprung upon the Senate. Ten years ago, when I was Minister, the Bankruptcy Bill was before the Chamber. In these circumstances I ask the Government to conduct the business of the Senate in a way that will be a credit to it. It is certainly not creditable to us to pass a measure and then immediately declare that it is unsuitable for present-day requirements, and therefore a large number of clauses must have further consideration. Such procedure does not meet with my approval. I ask the Government to withdraw the Bill and introduce a measure that has had proper consideration, and not one that is, as it were, flung in pieces at honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bankruptcy Bill is of a highly technical character, and as it is an attempt to consolidate the bankruptcy legislation of Australia, it is quite natural that many public bodies are interested in it. As a matter of fact, the Government invited them to offer any suggestions or criticisms they cared to submit, but as these public bodies have other matters to attend to, many of their suggestions for amending the Government </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Bill have been belated in arriving. The Government felt that it was their duty to give every consideration to the representations made from various quarters, and that accounts for the delay in drafting several amendments which have been found necessary at this late stage. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> overlooks the fact that some honorable senators who have taken a deep interest in this measure felt that many clauses needed further consideration, and during the progress of the Bill through Committee they frequently made applications for the postponement of clauses, and extracted from the Minister promises of recommittal. Many of the clauses are being recommitted, at the desire, not of the Government, but of honorable senators who wish to further consider them. They, in many cases, suggested to the Government amendments that have, during the interval, been considered and adopted. This procedure is quite in accord with parliamentary procedure. It is very seldom that we have a Bill like this, with over 200 clauses. The majority of Bills have from 40 to 50 clauses, and, therefore, although recommittals are frequent, we do not have many subsequent amendments. The Navigation Bill was similar to this measure, and necessitated practically the same treatment. I fail to see that any honorable senator is now to be deprived of an opportunity to exercise his right. This recommittal is rather an extension of the right of criticism. </para>

The amendments have been circulated amongst honorable senators, and no doubt those who have been following the Bill have already compared them with the original clauses. If honorable senators feel that they have not had sufficient time to consider the proposed amendments, the Government, having no desire to rush the Bill through, will consider its postponement. Many questions that are dealt with in these amendments were actually discussed in Committee. Several are being introduced to meet certain criticism levelled at the Bill by honorable senators. </para>

                <para class="block">My amendment, if agreed to, will mean the recommittal of the whole Bill. The Government, in submitting the motion now before the Senate, are adopting a farcical attitude, tending to make people believe - as I have believed for a long time - that this Chamber is absolutely unnecessary as far as practical politics are concerned. The Bill passed through Committee without a quorum. Directly an important measure - such as is this or the Lands Acquisition Bill  - is  introduced, honorable senators, who have no interest in it, rush outside into a more congenial atmosphere. After the Committee stage, they ask the Minister to recommit the Bill for the amendment of certain clauses. Had they remained in their places when the Bill was in Committee, this procedure would not have been necessary. The motion by the Minister precludes an honorable senator from attempting to amend clauses that are not mentioned in the motion. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, the proper procedure is to withdraw the Bill and to introduce a new measure. It is proposed, in Committee, to reconsider about 60 clauses,  which  will, undoubtedly, be disposed of in the absence of a quorum. </para>

I was a member of the Senate at that time, and I know that about seven or ten years elapsed before it was finally passed. The Minister omitted to state that the Navigation Bill had an international aspect, and that, before becoming law, it had to be reserved for the Royal assent. That was the reason for the delay.

                <para class="block">Australia alone, so that there is no analogy between it and the Navigation Bill. We might, with credit, copy the system adopted by the Imperial Parliament when a measure of a highly technical nature is before it, namely, to refer the matter to a Committee of the Parliament. Many honorable senators, possessing a knowledge of bankruptcy, took great pains in the consideration of this measure, and instead of recommitting the Bill, the Government might appoint a Committee of the Senate to consider the Bill in its amended form, and to report to the Senate. I agree with my Leader that the motion is preposterous. It is farcical that, after ten years&#39; consideration and consultation with public bodies in Australia, the Government should now ask us to recommit so many clauses. The Government should have completed their inquiries among the different public bodies, and have placed in the hands of the draftsman the suggestions so obtained before asking the Senate to deal with the Bill. </para>

Many of them are members of Royal Commissions and Committees. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> is taking this opportunity- to lecture his colleagues on their lack of interest in the affairs of the Senate. I draw his attention to the large attendance of honorable senators on this side compared with the numbers occupying the Opposition benches, from which party half of the honorable senators are absent. </para>

                    <para>-  Before the question is put I wish to refer to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> that honorable senators were absent at times from the Senate because they had to attend to other duties. In order that a false impression may not be created in the public mind, I would point out that it was laid down by the first  President  of the Senate, and has been maintained, I think, by every subsequent occupant of the Chair, that no duty of an honorable senator is superior to his duty in this Chamber. The attendance at Royal Commissions is a matter over which this Senate has no control, and members who choose to absent themselves must do so at their own will and pleasure. The Senate imposes no duty on its members to attend meetings of Royal Commissions or any other body while it is sitting, and no duty other than that which he has to discharge in this Chamber can be taken as an excuse for the non-attendance of a member. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Government will act on the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition. Both Ministers have stated, and we are in agreement with them, that this is a highly technical measure, and as such deserves the serious consideration of the members of this Chamber. It may or may not be true that the attendance was small during the consideration of the Bill. I am not concerned for the moment about that. When we have a new Bill submitted to us it is invariably in print many days before it comes up for consideration, and honorable senators have the fullest opportunity of perusing it clause by clause. This will be practically a new measure if we proceed on the lines suggested by the Minister in charge of it. The work of the Chamber should be done in a businesslike way. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the Minister&#39;s idea. Assuming for the moment that it is more or less a Bill for consideration in Committee, if it were taken in the ordinary way copies would be circulated many days before it came on for consideration. By its recommittal, however, the suggested alterations will be circulated hurriedly, and we shall not be able to grasp their full meaning. It is wrong even to hint at such a procedure. The Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that one reason for its recommittal was that certain honorable senators desire this course to be followed, to enable them to submit amendments. I do not know that when the Bill was previously before us there were many senators who were so disposed. The Minister also stated that copies of the measure had been circulated outside, and people associated with various public bodies had been invited to peruse the Bill and make suggestions for its improvement. How long ago were those people so notified? </para>

It is wrong for the Government now to delay the passage of the Bill because those people did not offer their comments when they were invited to make them. The Government would do well to withdraw the present measure, and introduce a new one. That course would be more satisfactory to the Government itself, to the party with which I am associated, and to the community generally than the present proposal. </para>

                    <para>. -  Those of us who were particularly interested in the measure had an opportunity afforded us by the Government to reconsider some portions of it, and the object of the recommittal is to enable the Committee to deal with the re- presentations that we have made. Some of my own representations are incorporated in the amendments to be submitted by the Government. The Minister, with great courtesy, freely promised us that a further opportunity would be given, so far as the Government was concerned, for the reconsideration of particular clauses. Why any honorable senator should complain because in this instance the Government has been more generous than it sometimes is I fail to understand. I am sure that my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> will acquit me of any neglect of this particular Bill. I have given it most careful consideration, and have done much work in connexion with it outside the Chamber. The result of my investigations into certain phases of the bankruptcy law, and the consultations I have had with people outside has been placed at the disposal of the Ministry. Thus much time has been saved in this Chamber. I regret to say that I did not observe very great enthusiasm, when the Bill was actually in Committee, on the part of some honorable senators who now complain.. Consequently the measure went through Committee at a greater rate than the outside organizations had reason to expect, having regard to previous experience of a similar Bill. When it was first under the consideration of the Committee of the Senate, some seven months elapsed before any real progress was made. I think it was only last week that representatives of the most important outside organization, so far as this Bill is concerned, really got together and considered the various clauses as they affect the business community. I refer to the Federated Chambers of Commerce, which met in Melbourne, I believe, last week, at the request of the Government. This body has now submitted many criticisms and views on the Bill, and a great many of them deserve the close attention of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- Several months ago. Any Government that ignored such representations as this body has made, would certainly be foolish . In the circumstances, we should give due consideration to the fresh views that will be placed before us. I have made a number of recommendations, particularly on behalf of the banking institutions, not the least of them being the Commonwealth Bank. Some of my suggestions have been accepted in principle, and in other cases the Government have not gone as far as the banks desire, and as I think correct. In due course, I shall ask the assistance of my honorable friends opposite, and I have no doubt I shall get it, to improve on the Government&#39;s recommendations. Considering that there are 222 clauses, the reconsideration of 49 of them would not be an outrageous procedure. </para>

The real mouthpiece of the Government now appears to be the Whip <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman).</inline> We are told that certain people outside have informed the Government that they desire a number of amendments made. Is it not likely that Labour supporters, as well, desire to make certain amendments? It would be advisable to reconsider the whole Bill, otherwise, it might be found desirable to amend clauses that had not been recommitted. It is the business of honorable senators opposite to keep a quorum for the Government ; members on this side are always in their places. If the position is, as the legal representative of the Governments outlined it, and the Chambers of Commerce and banking institutions requested  that  the Bill be recommitted, it is highly probable that Labour supporters may require the same privilege as the &#34;masters&#34; of honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> says that clauses 1 to 222 ought to be recommitted. That would be a simple method of dealing with the matter. Out opportunities for discussing measures in Committee have been so circumscribed that our speeches are limited to a period of fifteen minutes, which is not sufficient for dealing with a difficult, technical matter. It has been stated that 49 clauses require amending. That practically amounts to a new Bill. I have seen these amendments in the newspapers, but in my simplicity I thought that the Government, having disposed of the Committee stages of the measure, would not take steps to have them inserted. Now the Minister practically proposes to place before us a new Bill. I am not able to consider amendments without comparing them with the provisions of the principal Act to which they relate and seeing the effect which is thereby caused. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> proposal is accepted the recommittal can be adjourned until such a time as the masters of honorable senators opposite can peruse the amendments,  and  tell them what to do. </para>

                    <para>. - If the average reader of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reads carefully the discussion on this motion,  he  will be mystified, and will have difficulty in understanding the reason underlying the opposition to the course proposed by the Minister. If any Government not composed of men holding the views of honorable senators opposite were to complete the passage of a Bill without embodying in it valuable provisions which have been shown to be necessary, honorable senators opposite would be the first to charge it with having forfeited the confidence of the people. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> has been placed in possession of certain information proving the necessity for material amendments. If he did not give the Senate the opportunity of discussing those amendments, he would be failing in his duty. No more important Bill than this has ever been brought before an Australian legislature. It affects, more or less, the whole of the community. If a further three months&#39; work is required to make the Bill comprehensive and satisfactory, we ought not to begrudge the time. I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition, because I know very well that, if the Ministry had been careless enough to disregard suggestions that are worthy of consideration, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McDougall)</inline> would have been the first to criticize the Ministry for its negligence, and would have stressed the point later for political purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Queensland was not represented on that conference. Lacking that representation, the conference resembled the play of &#34; Hamlet &#34; without the Prince of Denmark. I have pointed out at various times that Queensland has the benefit of a particularly good measure that was drafted by that master, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. Quite a number of provisions which have been rejected by the Senate, Queensland would like to see inserted in this Bill; and, if the whole Bill were recommitted., a further attempt would be made to have them embodied in it. Before making that attempt, however, I should like to secure the imprimatur of the Chambers of Commerce of Australia, representatives of which will assemble in Adelaide next week. Bankruptcy has been placed on the agenda-paper, and the Senate would thus have the last word from the mercantile community. I understand there is a prospect of a period when we shall have no work to do, and it will be proposed to go into recess for some little time. That is no good to me. I would sooner occupy the time in so framing this measure that it will be acceptable to the whole community, rather than one which is acceptable only to the southern States. That is what we are up against at the present time. The southern parts of Australia have not experienced the benefit that is conferred by the Queensland Act. They say that because it operates in Queensland it is no good. I want to have the opportunity of including those beneficial provisions in this Bill. I intend to support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it will go through this session. If it does, I feel quite certain that it will require amending in the very near future. By this Bill the attempt is being made to consolidate in one measure the whole of the Australian bankruptcy laws, and to incorporate in it some of the more recent decisions of the British Courts. It is not a measure that can be satisfactorily discussed by the average member of the Senate . </para>

                        <para>- I regard this as a very important Bill, and one that ought to engage the attention of the Senate from every possible stand-point. It affects not only the mercantile community, but the whole population of (the Commonwealth. The time already devoted to it has been well spent, but we have not, so far, succeeded in producing a measure which is satisfactory to a large number of honorable senators. I am not at all surprised at the Government bringing forward many additional amendments. I venture to say that very few honorable senators, apart from those who have asked the. Government to insert these amendments, are capable of successfully dovetailing those amendments with the provisions now in the Bill, and understand what they are doing.Honorable senators on this side also have considered the matter, and they desire to propose further amendments. </para>

                        <para>- Surely that is a most reasonable request. It may be contended by the Government that this would greatly delay the passage of the Bill. I do not accept that view of the matter. The recommittal of the whole Bill or its withdrawal, and the introduction of a new measure incorporating the proposed amendments, would be much more satisfactory than this piece-meal proposal that is now made to us.I thought the Bill had been finally disposed of. It is a measure that I do not profess to understand. </para>

                    <para>. - There seems to me to be a very easy way out of the difficulty if the Senate is prepared to take it. The usual procedure in such cases, if honorable senators feel as keenly as some honorable senators in opposition profess to feel, is to nominate the clauses on which amendments are desired, and ask that those clauses be added to the list - a somewhat long list, I admit - which has been prepared. That will provide them with the opportunity to ventilate their feelings on the matter. I recognize that the fervency and acuteness of the desire of the Opposition to make amendments is equalled only by the suddenness of the attack. </para>

                        <para>- Why did not the Leader of the Opposition submit his amendments when the Bill was in Committee? As I have said, the fervency and acuteness of the desire of honorable members opposite to make amendments is equalled only by the suddenness of the attack. The Leader of the Opposition would possibly have had some amendments ready had he known this procedure was to be followed. I cannot see that there is any occasion to recommit the whole of the Bill, but the obvious and reasonable course for those honorable senators who wish to submit amendments is to signify their intention in the usual manner by adding clauses to the motion already submitted. </para>

This is a very technical measure,  and  if  we were  to ask some of  the  legal senators to give, on the spur of the moment, the meaning of some of the amendments, they would probably ask  for time  for consideration.Honorable  senators  are handicapped in considering theBill,and I hope that the Minister will do as suggested by SenatorDuncan. </para>
