            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s question, which suggests thatso far nothing has been done on the land side, reveals the state of mind into which some people have got in regard to this matter. As a matter of fact, whatever search has been conducted for the last month, has been made from the land side by a party landed from the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Huddersfield,</inline> and so far no trace of the womenhas been found. The schooner <inline font-style="italic">John Alce,</inline> which recently left Darwin for </para>

          <para class="block">Elcho Island, should have reached the island yesterday. She had a wireless operator on board, but so far no wireless message has reached Darwin. However, the schooner should return to Darwin by Tuesday or Wednesday next, when it will, no doubt, bring a report as to the success or otherwise of the search, which is being conducted by the land party. This party consists of twenty police and trained bushmen, and is accompanied by a number of black trackers. They are all thoroughly acquainted with the territory, and for the last fifteen or twenty years have been dealing with blacks. They are probably more competent to conduct this search than -would be any other twenty men in the Commonwealth whose services could be secured. </para>

              <para>- As I announced in the Senate on a previous occasion, the <inline font-style="italic">Douglas Mawson,</inline> which was trading, not on the Northern Territory coast, but between certain Queensland ports, including Burketown, on the Queensland shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, disappeared during a storm. The Queensland Government immediately sent out small auxiliary schooners of the same type as the <inline font-style="italic">John Alce</inline> andHuddersfield to search for the missing vessel, but they were unsuccessful in locating her in any part of the Gulf.Steamers trading along the coast were also asked to keep a lookout for her, but notone of them reported having seen any sign of the <inline font-style="italic">DouglasMawson.</inline> Twelve months after the disappearance of the vessel, it was announced that some wreckage had been seen on the north-east comer of the Northern Territory. Upon that announcement being made I instructed the Administrator of the Territory to arrange that when the regular trading schooner from Darwin passed that portion of the coast on her way to Borroloola she was to land two police troopers, accompanied by black trackers, who were to search the coast for any trace of wreckage. Those instructions were carried out. Some wreckage was found - some staves ofbeer  barrels and some boards from deck combings - but there was absolutely nothing to identify it as wreckage from the <inline font-style="italic">Douglas Mawson.</inline> That vessel had some barrels of beer among her cargo, but vessels trading along that coast usually have. During that search no trace was found of any survivors from the wreck, and although the party came into contact with the natives by whom white women are now said to be held, those natives made no statement whatever to any member of the party, either troopers or blacktrackers, of having seen any survivors from the wreck. One of the troopers was Constable Green. It is now asserted in the press that this constable reported to the Administrator that he had heard that survivors had landed, but the Administrator denies having received such a report from Constable Green. The result of the investigations of the party was communicated to the Queensland Government, and there is in the Department of Home and Territories a letter from the Premier of Queensland thanking the Administrator of the Northern Territory for the careful search made. Later on, when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> was pursuing his investigations into the possibilities of the occurrence of oil, and was proceeding down the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, a native in his employ came into touch with the natives by whom the white women are supposed to be held in captivity. From them he heard the story of the landing of survivors from the wreck, of the murder of the men, and of the capture of the women. That was the first time the story had ever been conveyed to white men, when it was told by the blacks with whom these white women are said to be held in captivity to a black boy in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade&#39;s</inline> party, and conveyed by him to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> and by the latter to the Administrator at Darwin. </para>

            <para>- At a recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in relation to the utilization of the Hume Reservoir for hydro-electric development and the desirability of increasing the capacity of the reservoir as at present designed, it was resolved to proceed with the construction of the Hume dam of sufficient dimensions to provide for a reservoir of 2,000,000 acrefeet, instead of 1,100,000 acre-feet as originally intended. The decisions arrived at by the conference were subject to confirmation by the four contracting Governments. Correspondence is now proceeding between the four contracting Governments in this connexion, and it is anticipated that finality will be arrived at in the near future. </para>

          <para>. - If this amendment is agreed to a different system will apply in South Australia, and the whole principle of representation as contained in the bill will be altered. At present it is provided that there shall be two representatives of proprietary factories. The Minister has stated that there are more proprietary factories than co-operative concerns in South Australia. If the amendment is carried the proprietary factories will have three instead of two representatives as originally intended. My sympathies are entirely with co-operative factories. </para>

            <para>- A proprietary company distributes its profits between certain individuals, whereas a cooperative company divides its profits between those who supply the factory. The board of control has been introduced mainly because the proprietary companies particularly those with London houses, have - been exploiting the dairy business, with the result that producers have not had fair treatment. The Minister&#39;s proposal will have the effect of increasing the representation of proprietary factories. I am entirely opposed to that principle. The interests of the co-operative factories, which distribute the profits to their suppliers, should be safeguarded. </para>

          <para>.- I agree with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin.</inline> I understand that there is discussion at the present time between the directors of the proprietary butter factories and co-operative concerns with regard to representation on the proposed board. In South Australia the majority of butter factories are on the proprietary basis, and if the amendment be adopted, there will be an increase in the representation of those interests at the expense of the co-operative factories. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> that we should not be particularly concerned about that so long as by this legislation we benefit the producers of butter. About 75 per cent, or 80 per cent, of the butter factories in Australia are on the co-operative basis. If they are to have representation on the board in proportion to their numbers, the Minister should not now ask the committee to provide for another representative of the proprietary companies. As the amendment will materially alter the personnel of the board, I intend to vote against it. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment is in order. The figures disclose that in Australia there are about 370 co-operative and 123 proprietary butter factories. This really makes a case for another representative of the latter, and if the Minister moved to increase the representation of the proprietary butter factories, under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> I should support him. I do not feel disposed to vote for the amendment in its present form since it might result in depriving South Australia of representation. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HOARE</inline>(South Australia) son) failed to furnish an adequate reason why South Australia should not have a representative of co-operative factories on the board, although he has suggested that it is because the majority of the factories in that state are proprietary concerns, and he intends in a subsequent amendment to provide for them. If his reasoning with regard to South Australia holds good, why not apply the same argument to Tasmania and Western Australia? South Australia exports more butter than is sent overseas from Western Australia. I am inclined to think that the representatives of the proprietary concerns like Sandford and Company and Wilcox and Company, who are exporters of butter in South Australia, have brought influence to bear upon the Minister. They waited upon the Labour representatives from that state with the same object, but were not successful. </para>

            <para>- In South Australia, 80 per cent, of the factories are proprietary concerns. If, as has been suggested, the representation of the proprietary factories were increased under paragraph e from two to three, South Australia would lose its direct representation on the board, and that is what we should avoid if possible.

          <para>. - I fail to see that any great harm will be done to South Australia if we strike out the proposal to give the co-operative factories in that state representation on the board. Actually, only three states - Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales - are seriously concerned in the bill. South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia do not engage in the export business to any extent. I am prepared to help the Minister to strike out the words &#34; South Australia.&#34; That can be followed up by striking out the words &#34; Western Australia &#34; and &#34; Tasmania.&#34; I think that those states are asking for too much. The Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> says that there are more proprietary than co-operative companies in South Australia, and it might be as well to postpone the consideration of this clause to obtain confirmation of that statement. The proprietary companies should not have a prior claim over the co-operative companies to representation on the board. Although fewer in number, the cooperative companies may be representative of a much greater number of persons. I think- that our first consideration should be for the co-operative companies, and that we should give every encouragement we can to the co-operative movement. Co-operation has done, and will do, an immense amount of good for the dairying industry. </para>

The purport of the amendment is to increase the representation of the proprietary companies  at  the expense of the co-operative companies. Being larger in number, it is natural  to  expect that they will dominate the poll and secure the appointment of their&#39; nominee. The difference between proprietary and co-operative companies is that the latter represent the producers, who live by the industry, whilst the former live on what they can make out of the industry. The bill is presumably in the interests of the primary producers, and they are represented directly by the cooperative companies. I oppose the amendment. </para>

          <para>. -  It would be far better if the board were -elected directly by the primary producers. An unseemly struggle is taking place between the proprietary and the co-operative companies. We appear to be losing sight of the fact that we are discussing what is best for the primary producers of butter. The object of the bill is said to be to ensure that the men who are engaged in primary production shall get a better return for their labour than they are getting at the present time. I was surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> should endeavour to foist upon the committeethe exploded idea that there is anything advantageous in cooperation. The co-operative societies in the butter industry to-day are almost innumerable, yet they are unable to conduct their businesses, and are forced to seek the support of the Commonwealth. That fact is sufficient to prove the inefficacy ofco-operation. </para>

        <para>SenatorGRANT.- I should not mind if those words were left out, but I do not see why they should be. We should wipe out imaginary state divisions. Why do we not approach this matter from a purely Australian stand-point? For how. long are these miserablestate divisions to be allowed to rear their ugly heads in this Chamber ? The matter should be considered, not as it is likely to affect the proprietary companies or the co-operative companies, but in the light of what is best for butter production. I should like to place upon record an opinion regarding co-operation which would effectively silence senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and prevent attempts in future to foist upon this chamber such views as he holds  on the subject. I remind him that cooperation has been a failure all the world over, and that it will never prove successful. I think that the whole position should be reviewed regardless of state boundaries, and the board be constituted on Australian lines. </para>

The difference between us is that I speak the truth in such a way that the honorable senator thinks that it is fiction, while he speaks fiction &#34;that he desires us to regard as the truth. I am not always disposed to do that. But I should like to know from the Minister what is behind this change. Is he prepared to inform us that the proprietary companies have interviewed the Government since the bill was introduced, and have expressed a desire to have this alteration made? The Government must do what its masters outside tell it to do. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> in another place, amended the bill in a certain way. I understand that it is proposed, in this chamber, to wipe out that amendment. Am I wrong in drawing from that fact the conclusion that there is some influence, about which I know nothing, that is causing the Government to move first this way and then that? It appears to me that the proprietary companies have said, &#34; It will be better for us to make sure of having another representative,&#34; and then have asked the Government to make that alteration. To meet their wishes the Minister has decided to leave out South Australia, chiefly on the ground that it is not a very large butter-  exporting state. I have long since passed the stage when state boundaries would affect my judgment. I foresee on the Lower Murray one of the most prosperous butter-producing districts in  Australia.  When the South Australian farmers have an unlimited supply of water at their command so that they can go in for dairying on a larger scale, the butter industry in that state will make considerable advances. I believe, that this contemplated change is more in the interests of the proprietary companies than in the interests of South Australia. The Government appears to have introduced this bill because certain people outside have pulled strings. I hope that the Minister will give us some better reason for the change than he has yet voiced. I presume that# the bill was drafted after mature consideration. No doubt the draftsmen were informed of the desire of the Government. After the bill was drafted it must have been considered by the Minister to see if it contained what he desired. I suppose that it was then agreed to by Cabinet.- This principle should, have been in the bill before it reached the second-reading stage. Whether the companies are styled &#34;cooperative &#34; or &#34; proprietary &#34; does not matter a great deal, as most of the socalled co-operative companies are really proprietary concerns. In the first place, probably, the shares were subscribed by dairy farmers, but gradually they disposed of them to others. There may be places where ideal co-operation exists, but I do not know of them. I admit that I am not closely in touch with this industry. The Minister would be well advised to allow the bill to pass in its present form. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> who spoke against the bill, will, no doubt, vote for it on that account. </para>

          <para>. -  I again stress the position of South Australia. I have carefully considered the proposal to give to the proprietary companies three representatives, and to strike out South Australia from paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> The proprietary companies in South Australia manufacture 80 per cent, of the butter produced in that state. Why should the companies which produce 20 per cent, only of South Australian butter be given representation while those which manufacture four times that quantity are to be-  left without representation? In this matter I take the all-Australian view, and not the view of any one state. If we give to the proprietary companies, under paragraph c, three representatives instead of two, South Australia will be left without representation ; and if wc leave the bill as it is we shall disfranchise 80 per cent, of-, the producers of that state. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister would be well advised not to continue with his effort to delete the words &#34; South Australia&#34; from sub-clause 2, paragraph 6, otherwise that state might have less representation than it has in the bill as it stands. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid.</inline> I view this question from an Australian standpoint rather than from the standpoint of South Australia alone. An error has been made in the distribution of the representatives on the board, but that can be rectified easily at this juncture. The co-operative companies in Australia number 370, and the proprietary companies 123. Their representation can be properly apportioned by giving to the proprietary factories three representatives instead of two, inasmuch as South Australia is second on the list. So far as the proprietary factories are concerned she should easily secure representation on the board. She would be in a better position if given one representative for her co-operative factories, as now provided for in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> and paragraph c was altered to give three representatives instead of two to the proprietary companies. In that direction I propose to vote. </para>

          <para>. -  I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> not to press his amendment. The position has had serious consideration from the Government. To prepare a list of persons engaged as sellers of dairy produce out of the Commonwealth and take a poll of them would be a most cumbersome business. The honorable senator can rest assured that the Government, in their choice of a man to represent the selling agents on the board, will be guided by the advice of those who are best able to give it. It is necessary to secure: the services of a man of great experience and outstanding ability. How can all the selling agents distributed over the whole of Australia be expected to know the man who possesses those qualifications to the greatest degree? The Government must take a certain amount of responsibility in the matter, and having given the question every consideration, it has decided that no better method than that provided in the bill could be devised for the selection of the representative of the agents on the board. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator FINDLEY</inline>(Victoria) &#91;12.17}. I support the proposal to delete the paragraph, but not with a view to inserting in ite place the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I cannot see how a representative of the persons engaged as sellers of dairy produce out of the Commonwealth can be of any material assistance to the dairymen of Australia. As a matter of fact, the interests of such persons are diametrically opposed to those represented by other members of the board..  His  chief concern will probably be to promote the interests of the Tooley-street sellers, to eliminate whom this board is mainly to be called into existence. The Tooleystreet sellers cannot have anything in common with the producers in Australia. Nothing the Minister has said convinces me that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> is necessary. He declares that it is essential to have a man of outstanding ability and the highest commercial training, but I should sav that the other members of the board should possess all those qualifications. They should understand the whole of the business from the stand-point of those they represent. If honorable senators are anxious to assist the dairying industry, they will strike out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> but not insert the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> What real purpose can a representative of the sellers serve on the board? Will he be wholly and solely concerned in. getting the best price for Australian produce? </para>

          <para>- That may be so ; but that is not the point. When I gave the matter further consideration, and compared the paragraph with other provisions of the bill, it seemed to me that the London end of the business would,, as a matter of course, fall almost entirely into- the- hands of- the= board&#39;s agency- in London. But I also recognize that those persons who are sellers of- d&#39;airy produce outside .the Commonwealth., have long established agencies in London1,, to- which they forward their consignments&#39; of butter for disposal on the London market, and that these agencies on1 the- other side of tine world know exactly from the Australian firms what supplies they can obtain. A large business has been built up in this way, and by striking out this paragraph we shall run the danger of dislocating that channel for the distribution of our butter. If the purchasers of our butter find the ordinary channel of securing it closed to them, and are compelled to open up fresh, negotiations with a board, there is a danger that our keen competitors in London may be able to secure the business Australia has already enjoyed. It is a risk we should not run. Eventually the whole business of the disposal of butter in London may come into the hands of the board, but in the meantime we should not run the risk of dislocating the channel that now exists for its distribution there. We should give the board time to function and get a grip of the position, and later on it may be possible for it to take control of the whole means of distribution. It is a fact, as pointed out earlier in the debate, that a comparatively large and growing trade in butter is being done with the East, where the board, in the initial stages, at any rate, will have no representatives. This trade is now carried on by the persons referred to in the paragraph as those engaged as sellers of dairy produce out of the Commonwealth. If we want to retain- it, and see- ib grow, it- is absolutely essential that persons engaged in this trade with the East should have representation on the board. In looking after their own interests they will also be doing something for the Commonwealth by ensuring, that that trade is not dislocated. It is possible that, having entire control and with- no representation of the interests of the sellers- of dairy produce overseas, the board may on occasions overlook the Eastern trade. In any case, the representative of the sellers will be only one amongst many. He may put his case before the board in the best possible manner, and yet the board may not see eye to eye with him and meet, his wishes, but at least we shall ensure to those persons engaged in the exporting, of butter the chance to have their representations made to and considered by the board. In the circum- stances, at this stage of the development of the new system of dealing with the export of our dairy produce^ I think the clause should not&#39; be1 altered. </para>

          <para>. -  There are one or two valid reasons why this paragraph should be deleted, one of which is that the personnel of the board would then be reduced from thirteen to twelve members. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> believes that, as different sections should have representation, the number should not be reduced. Representation of different sections is quite unnecessary. It is desirable to have a board consisting of a smaller number of practical men able to effectively handle the business, regardless of sectional interests. We appear to overlook the fact that, notwithstanding our lack of effort, the dairying industry is rapidly extending. The member to be appointed by the Governor-General, as the representative of the persons engaged as sellers, will doubtless represent the proprietary factories, and have little regard for the interests of the co-operative concerns. He will be a representative of those making profits out of the business, and not those actually engaged in the production of butter. </para>

            <para>- That may be the honorable senator&#39;s opinion. Are we likely to obtain the services of a man who will assist the industry? The sellers&#39; representative on the board will protect their interests, and disregard those of the co-operative companies, which will be <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the detriment of the producers. As the Commonwealth Bank, which is a great financial institution, dealing with commerce in all its ramifications, is controlled by a board of eight, surely a board of twelve should be sufficient to conduct the marketing of our dairy produce. Cannot the producers&#39; and sellers&#39; interests be protected by one capable man? The sellers of butter, cheese, or any other dairy produce will always be on the alert to beat the producers in any deal they make, and their representative will do as directed. </para>

            <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> that a man of the capacity of the person to be appointed will sometimes have information which the other members of the board will not possess. If he represents the people who are making profits in selling butter he will have little regard for the producers.

          <para>. -  If I had my way, I would strike out the whole of the clause. If there is to be control of the butter export trade, it should be by the Government, and not by a board. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that this fetish of control by a board should not be tolerated. If paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> stands, it is quite possible, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has suggested, that a seller of dairy produce in London may be appointed to the board, and as such he will not necessarily have inside knowledge of the position in Australia. </para>

Since they know the avenues and tricks of the trade; surely they ought to be of very material assistance to the board.

          <para>.- I am sorry that the Minister has accepted the amendment, as it makes the position more complicated than ever. We shall have to trust largely to the genius of its members for the board to be a success. If we are striving after perfection, it is of no use for us to tie up the board. I consider that what we now propose to do by legislation should be left to the board to do when it is appointed. We should not unnecessarily hamper the board in its operations. While we should be most careful to provide proper safeguards as to the constitution of the executive, we should not surround it with provisions that will injure the usefulness of the board altogether. The idea of a board delegating its powers to an executive is distasteful to me. </para>

            <para>- I know that the Minister is acquainted with the whole bill, and is aware of what took place when it was debated in another place. There are two distinct interests concerned in this bill. It is like two evenly-matched teams in a tug-of-war, when the rope is pulled first to one side and then to the other. I have obtained information from the industry itself, and understand that there are two chief buyers of butter in the market at present, namely, those who pay cash, where the price to the purchaser is f.o.b., and those who buy from the Butter Pool, and, perhaps, pay a higher price. One of those interests has the ear of the Government, and its influence pervades the whole question, even to the extent of shutting out, by legislation, the other interests. The new system is to kill the old. I do not look upon the wholesale buyers of butter as the friends of the producers. They are the medium by which the produce is taken to the market. The buyers are the middlemen, who, while they serve a very useful purpose, have as their chief object the making of money. There are two sections of middlemen now, but itlooks as if one will be crushed out of existence by the other. Neither of those interests is any particular friend of the Labour party, but we should be particularly careful that we pass no legislation which would give an advantage to any one section of the community. I think that the clause should pass as it stands. We cannot expect to get boards which will in every respect conform to our own individual ideas of what they should be. I have my own views regarding the constitution of this board, but however constituted, its future will depend largely on itself. If its members display ability, capacity and intelligence, the butter industry will continue, and may thrive, butotherwise it will die quickly. </para>

          <para>. -  Australia House cannot undertake the work that this London agency will be called upon to do. It has not the necessary equipment. Furthermore, the London agency will not be carrying out a public function. The bill is not intended to set up a departmental activity. It is simply a measure to assist the dairying industry to organize itself and carry on its own marketing. </para>

            <para>- Yes, to the east, the south, the north, and west. If I am correctly informed by those who are competent to express an opinion, Australia&#39;s butter trade in the East wild be of great importance to Australia in the future. There is no other part of the world where there is so much abuse of privileges as there is in the East. It is, therefore, essential that the board shall control the standardization and marketing of our butter there. There will be no interference with any one who is participating in the trade to the East as long as he does nothing to the detriment of Australia. </para>

As it is a question of adequately protecting Australian trade, it is equally important that consumers of our dairy produce in the East should receive produce of as good a quality as consumers in Europe, particularly as the Eastern trade is very valuable <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Australia. </para>

            <para>- I understand that that is the position. It was provided that contracts entered into on and after the 1st September, 1924, should come within the scope of the bill, but information has been received to the effect that a number of contracts have been antedated in order to defeat the object of the bill. That is one of the reasons why it is proposed to leave out these words. The intention of Parliament should not be ignored by any small section conducting a trade in a way that is not advantageous to Australia. </para>

          <para>. - If my memory serves me aright, the words which it is now proposed to delete were inserted at the request of the Prime Minister, but  I  do not think it my function to protect the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in relation to any amendment which he may have- considered it necessary to submit. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> has not given any reason why the words inserted by the Prime. Minister should be omitted, and as it is customary for me to draw conr elusions on. flimsy evidence, I am led in this instance to believe that there has been a division in the ministerial ranks. The probability is that the the Prime Minister submitted this amendment without considering the Country party, the representatives of which have since said,  &#39; It was all very well for you to insert this amendment, but we wish it to be deleted.&#34; Has the Minister submitted the proposal with the intention of cleaning up the Eastern trade? The Prime Minister has undoubtedly been overruled by caucus, or by the members of the Country party, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> represents in this chamber. I think we might accept the clause as passed in another place, instead of sending it back and asking the members of that chamber to reverse their decision. Before the debate closes the Minister should give some reason as to why these words are to be deleted. </para>

          <para>. - I trust the committee will reject the amendment. Under clause 12, which we have just passed, a London agency is to be appointed and provision is made for dealing generally with the handling and marketing of butter there. There is no such provision in regard to the East. Considerable expense has been incurred by the Government in developing trade with the East, in face of competition from Canada, New Zealand, and other countries. Certain interests in Sydney have now established a footing and are exporting about 20,000 boxes of butter per an-  num. If this amendment is agreed to, that trade will be interfered with. </para>

As we are endeavouring to make the measure as perfect as possible we should allow exportations in this direction to continue without any interference by the board. I cannot imagine the Prime Minister moving to insert these words without giving the matter the most careful attention. Our Eastern trade is of material value to Australia, and should not be hampered. </para>

If the words, &#34;to Europe&#34; are allowed to remain the objects ofthe measure may be defeated by butter being exported to, say, Colombo, and re-shipped to any European port.

For the purpose of enabling the Board effectively to control the export and the sale and distribution after export of Australian dairy produce, the Governor-General may by proclamation prohibit the export from the Commonwealth to Europe of any dairy produce except in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Board approves. </para>

Why should we seek to limit the authority of the board? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> appears to be greatly concerned about the interests of a Sydney export company which has built up a certain amount of trade with the East. That firm is not in a different position from other firms which have established profitable agencies in London, but which, according to this bill, are to be swept unceremoniously aside. </para>

            <para>- That assurance is altogether too indefinite. The bill is quite a different measure from what it was twenty minutes ago. The amendment to strike out the words referred to will seriously affect Sydney business interests. I protest against any interference with trade that has been built up as the result of years of effort and thought. If the proprietary interests get a majority on the board there will certainly be a temptation to interfere with other business interests. </para>

            <para>- I venture to say it is because certain sections of the butter trade have a representative in the Country party. Although Sydney business interests do not, as a rule, look upon me as their representative, nevertheless I am concerned about their position.

          <para>. - I disagree with my leader. I fail to see how the amendment will interfere in any way with Sydney business interests. If the firms referred to are doing a bona fide trade and are exporting good-quality butter they have nothing to fear. Indeed, it may be an advantage to export butter that carries the imprimatur of the board. I am glad that the amendment has been submitted and that the clause will be restored to its original form, so that the board will have complete control of the export trade. </para>

          <para>. - This is a most extraordinary proposal. Tinned butter goes only to Java It is sent in 1-lb. tins. On the one hand, the Government refused to restrict the operations of the board in relation to Eastern trading when suggested by me, and on the other hand, it proposes itself to exempt this particular class of trade with the. East. It can readily be imagined that butter which is sent in 1-lb. tins amongst general cargo may leave Australia in an excellent condition and yet arrive in the East in an inferior condition. </para>

          <para>. - I am not convinced by the Minister&#39;s statement. This is a proposal to legislate specially for a particular section of the trade. I intend to watch the interests of the dairying industry. Only the best brands of butter should be exported, whether they come from the east, the west, the north, or the south of Australia. What will happen if the size of these tins is enlarged ? The persons who engage in the trade may make the tins the size of a butter-box. The Minister does not propose to impose a limit of 1 lb. I shall certainly vote against the amendment, and I trust that the committee will reject it. </para>

        <para>  Realizing the hour of the day, and the strenuous debate which has already taken place, I shall give my reasons briefly. The bill as it stands is to vest control in a board dominated by representatives who stand for direct consignments. The Prime Minister promised that he would not interfere with the ordinary trade channels, but he is doing so. That isthe burden of this bill and the story that it tells. It is a violation of the promise made by the Prime Minister and his supporters, and robs the producer of his right to sell for cash and take the risk of consignment. </para>

While the board should control the butter and its sale, the carriage of the produce to the market might well be left open, so that the most advantageous terms could be obtained in the interests of the industry. I hope that the clause will not be permitted to stand, as such a monopolistic power should not be given to the board. </para>

          <para>. - I understood that if a licence were granted to the owners of the dairy produce no restriction would be placed on its disposal. It appears now that, after obtaining their licences, they will have to go to the board to make a contract for their butter to be shipped. If that is the case, I can see that the board will be very much overworked. </para>

            <para>- That might be the case. if the board were properly active; but it is asking the board to undertake a very great deal to require it to make contracts for the shipment of all the butter exported from the various ports of Australia. If others are granted licences, they should be free to make their own shipping arrangements. At any rate they could, if they chose, in their own interests get the board to make contracts for them, but to compel them to do so is to my mind absolutely unnecessary. </para>

Most honorable senators support the measure because they think it will mean that only the beet butter will be exported; but now they are beginning to realize that although a factory may produce the highest grade butter, and may not be refused a licence to export it, nevertheless it will be compelled to enter into a contract through the board for the shipment of its product. </para>

          <para>That the Senate do now adjourn, </para>
          <para>I desire to make a statement concerning the negotiations which have been proceeding between the Commonwealth and Canada in respect to preferential trade. As honorable senators are aware the Government has been negotiating for some time with Canada with a view to concluding a reciprocal tariff agreement, and I have pleasure in being able to announce that the negotiations have been successful, An agreement has been arranged, which it is believed will be of very substantial benefit to the trade of both countries, and will tend towards closer relations between the two dominions. It was found necessary to restrict the agreement to a limited range of goods in order that a reasonable balance of reciprocal advantages might be arrived at. This method of procedure arises from the fact that Canada&#39;s trade with Australia is much  more extensive and much more valuable than Australian trade with Canada. This fact practically determined the limitation of the agreement to a specified number of articles. The agreement &#34;will, however, include those goods in which each country is vitally interested, and it is anticipated that satisfactory results will accrue to both countries, and form the basis for a more extensive application of preferences in the future. The initial difficulties of concluding a treaty having been surmounted, we shall have the opportunity of testing the possibility of achieving better balanced conditions than at present exist in the trade relations of the two dominions. We believe that in arranging this treaty we are taking a step towards a more general application within the Empire of a policy of tariff preferences which will tend to develop the resources of the Empire. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> will submit a motion next week setting out the details of the agreement which the Senate will be asked to adopt.
