              <para>Officers were transferred to the State Services in the various States at the salary appertaining to their permanent position in the Commonwealth Service as at the date of transfer. In these States, several officers who, prior to transfer, were receiving allowances for performing the duties of a position higher than their permanent one, lost the allowance upon transfer. The positions held, and which entitled officers to these allowances, were, of course, recognized as being only temporary, and as such did not entitle the officers to carry such right over to the State. Had they remained Federal officers, they were liable to lose the allowance at any moment, in which case they would have had no grounds for complaint. Under arbitration determinations, the assessing section officers received increases to their salaries, but such increases were treated by the Public Service Board as allowances whilst performing assessing duties. Upon transfer, these allowances lapsed in the case of certain officers - </para>

          <para>.- Those responsible for drafting the Bill no doubt knew what they intended by the word &#34; shall.&#34; The word &#39;&#39; shall &#34; is mandatory, but in this clause &#34; may &#34; does not necessarily mean &#34; shall.&#34; If the amendment is made, it will be optional for the official receiver to take part in the examination of the bankrupt. Will that be in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Acts&#39; of the different States? If so, there cannot be much objection to it, but, if not, I would like to be assured that it will be in- the interests of all concerned. </para>

          <para>.. - When bankruptcy proceedings reach a certain stage the trustee comes in and, in most case&#39;s, takes part in the examination of the bankrupt. Unnecessary and&#39; costly duplication would result if the clause were passed in its present form. The official receiver, even if th&#39;e amendment is agreed to, will have authority to take part in the proceedings, but if it is not necessary, he need not do so. </para>

          <para>. -  The amendment serves to bring the Bankruptcy Court practice into line with the actual practice in all other courts. If the honorable senator is anxious to inspect any document . filed in a case in the Supreme Court, he can do so. If a member of the press wishes to ascertain the position of any case, he can pay a fee and see for himself what has been done. Once documents are lodged in a court, they become public  property, and are available to the public for investigation, and no reason can be advanced for putting bankruptcy proceedings on a different footing from all other matters that come before the courts. </para>

A person who is not directly interested in any proceedings can, on payment of a fee, inspect any document, and now it is proposed that if he goes to the custodian of the document and makes an untruthful statement in order to dodge the payment of a nominal fee, he shall be liable to a penalty.

          <para>. - I must confess that I cannot see the object of the proposed amendment. I prefer the original paragraph rather than that now proposed. It will be noted that the amendment excludes from the property of a bankrupt life assurance policies, which, I think, is correct, but it includes the amount paid by way of premiums during the preceding two years. What is to happen to the policy ? It may lapse. We should retain the original paragraph, which limits to &#163;2,000 in the aggregate the total amount upon which a person may have paid premiums, otherwise the policy is to go to the creditors. It seems a much better provision than the one proposed, which apparently places in jeopardy the policy which it is the intention of the Government to protect. Apparently any amounts paid by way of premiums within two years of sequestration are to be recovered from the insurance company. If so, what is to happen to the policy ? I intend to oppose the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> I should like to know what the Government have in mind in this regard, and what is to become of the payments. The practice in bankruptcy administration is to protect life assurance policies; they are to be in a particularly favored position. Under this amendment it seems that a life assurance policy will be a less valuable security than it would be if the original paragraph were retained. This deals with the surrender value. </para>

            <para>- No. If an act of bankruptcy has been committed,, .and the man does not become bankrupt for some months - up to six months under this Bill - the Act relates back to the time when he committed the act of bankruptcy, and consequently any funds at his disposal at that time may be seized by the trustee. Let me give an illustration : A debtor, in a country place in . New South Wales, recently committed an act of bankruptcy in respect to his business, which was carried on in Sydney. He had at the time money to his credit in a country bank. The head office of the bank &#39;knew of the act of bankruptcy, but the branch bank was not aware of it. In order to proceed to Sydney to settle his affairs he drew money from the country bank, and when he reached Sydney he was made bankrupt. Although he had credit at his country bank, the trustee insisted that the money he had drawn from it should be paid again by the bank to the trustee, because of the doctrine of relation back, which would sti&#39;l -obtain under the clause as now before the Committee. I desire to amend the . clause to prevent such an occurrence. All the- banks are interested in the matter, and the institution mostly concerned is the Commonwealth Bank,  which has some 3,000 branches. What ia meant by &#34;notice&#34; to a bank? If it were held that notice to the head office of&#39; the bank in Sydney was notice to the whole of its branches, then payment by  a  branch, say, in Wyndham, under such circumstances as I have related, would place the bank in the unfortunate position I have indicated. T do not intend to insist on the substitution of the word &#34; debtor &#34; for the word &#34; bankrupt &#34;, but I do say that it is the better term. I also desire to insert after the words &#34; in good faith &#34; the words &#34; before the making or &#34;, the word  &#34; and &#34; immediately following to be left out. These amendments, from the point  of  view of the banks, are very important. At present the banker is protected after sequestration is made, but he is not protected before it. </para>

            <para>- But the cheque may be passed on to some one else. Clause 94 refers to the bankrupt only, and does not protect the banker. I certainly need more evidence than the Minister has produced to convince me that my view is incorrect. The new clause, in the form I suggest, was settled on behalf of the bankers by senior counsel in Melbourne, who took into consideration clause 94. The advice given by a leading King&#39;s Counsel in this city to the bankers was that unless the amendments I now suggest were inserted, they would not be protected under clause 94. I personally prefer to accept the advice of this senior King&#39;s Counsel, who has considered this matter most carefully, rather than the statement made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> without much consideration. </para>

I can see that a banker in the ordinary transactions of business would, under clause 94, be very seriously handicapped. &#39; It would necessarily lead to undesirable restrictions on business. To facilitate business a banker should, as long as there is money lying to the customer&#39;s credit, be able to pay it out without fear or question. If, before money can be paid out, he has to satisfy himself as to whether it is possible that the customer may have committed an act of bankruptcy, it will make it difficult for business to be conducted. </para>

            <para>- The Minister has been informed by his legal advisers that the banks are fully protected under clause 94. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> says that the lawyers advising the bankers are satisfied that they are not. We should make certain that the banker is fully and reasonably protected, not because he is entitled to any greater consideration than anybody else, but because he does an entirely different class of business. As the holder of money on behalf of his client he is in a position entirely different from that of any other person doing business with the same individual. For that reason it is highly desirable that this point should be satisfactorily and definitely settled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> asked what was meant by &#34; notice to a banker.&#34; The head office of a bank may know that a particular individual has become bankrupt, but it may not know that he has an account with any one of its branches. The head office of a bank has not a record of the individual accounts held by its branches. Take, for instance, the case of &#39;the Commonwealth Bank. Is it suggested that if the management is satisfied that a person has become insolvent, it shall immediately notify the 3,000 odd branches in any one of which an account may possibly be held by the bankrupt? Such a thing would be impracticable, and would give rise to all sorts of trouble. If there is any doubt on the point, as apparently there is, we should definitely settle it, and make perfectly certain that a bank, so long as it has money lying to the credit of a customer, shall be able to pay it out without fear or question, and that &#34; notice &#34; shall be notice to the branch of the bank at which the account is kept, and not necessarily to the bank simply as a corporate body. </para>

          <para>. - I take it that we do not want to put a bank in a position of privilege as against any other business, except in so far as it is necessary to make allowance for the difference between a banking business and that carried on by others. To do anything more may cause an injustice to other creditors. To clear the position, we have first to look at the two terms &#34; debtor &#34; and &#34; bankrupt.&#34; The definition clause states that &#34; bankrupt &#34; means any person in respect  of  whose estate a sequestration order has been made, and that &#34; debtor &#34; includes any person, whether a British subject or not, who, at the time when any act  df  bankruptcy was done or suffered by him, was personally present in Australia, or ordinarily resided or had a place of residence in Australia, &#38;c. The words &#34; at the time when any act of bankruptcy was done &#34; apply before the order  of  sequestration is made. There is an important difference between those definitions and the amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> wishes to introduce. As a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockman&#39;s</inline> representation, clause 95 in the Bill as introduced was struck out, because it did not go far enough. The Crown Law authorities,  to  meet the representations, have drafted the proposed  new  clause, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> admits is better than the original one, and which, therefore, affords a greater measure of protection to the banker than does the State bankruptcy laws. </para>

            <para>- The Government does not admit that the suggested amendment would . be an improvement. If it were accepted, the banker would be placed  in  a position of privilege which is not enjoyed by any other business of a like character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> raised a pertinent point about the question of notice. He asked whether notice to the head office was notice to al&#93; its branches. Luckily, the law on that point has been distinctly laid down both in England and in Australia. The doctrine of notice, however inconvenient and impracticable it may be for the bank, is that notice to a bank is notice to  all  its branches, allowing time for the course of post. This was laid down in the case  of <inline font-style="italic">Willis</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Bank of England,</inline> 1835; <inline font-style="italic">Morris</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">National Bank of Australasia,</inline> N.S.W., L.R. 93. I am hiding nothing from honorable senators. The banks of Australia are not the only institutions that have  head  offices in capital cities and various branches throughout the Commonwealth. Such firms as Dalgety and Company and the New Zealand Loan and  Mercantile  Agency Company  carry  on business similar, to a certain extent, to that of a bank. </para>

        <para>They make advances, such as those on produce, and are naturally liable, in the ordinary course of their business, to make advances like in character to those made by a bank when cashing cheques-. That being so, would the Committee be justified in putting the banks in an advantageous position by bringing the acts of debtors within the province of the clause, while protecting other firms in regard only to the acts of bankruptcy? I suggest to the Committee that to go to the length proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockman</inline> would be dangerous. It would be putting the banks in a position of privilege. I have no doubt that they would wish this amendment to be made. It would save them from the necessity of informing all their branches when an act of bankruptcy had been committed. It. would save them from an onerous duty which, in the Bill, is placed upon creditors as well as them. The duty would be quite as onerous for other firms as for banks. While we might please the banks by making the alteration proposed, there would soon be an outcry from many other traders, who would want to know why they could not have the same privileges extended to them. </para>

Time is allowed for the notices sent out by the head office to reach the branches through the post. Anything done before there had been sufficient time for the notices to reach the branch banks would be a bona fide transaction, and would be recognized. </para>

          <para>. -  The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has. advanced a strong argument in favour of the abolition of the doctrine of relation back. We have not abolished it, but have accepted it, and it is in this Bill. Banks are different from Dalgety and Company and other trading companies, in that they carry on the business of banking. Suppose a branch of a bank had knowledge that a man had committed an act of bankruptcy, but was not bankrupt. Suppose that, knowing what he had done, it refused to cash a cheque for him, although there was money to his credit. If he did not subsequently become bankrupt, what would be the position of the bank? There would be, I should imagine, an excellent ground for an action for damages. But if the individual, knowing that he had committed an act of bankruptcy, cashed a cheque and subsequently went bankrupt, he would have to hand the money back to the trustee. </para>

            <para>- English very often does not mean what the layman thinks it means. Counsel says that under the conditions I hav-s outlined, clause 94 does not protect the banks. Messrs. Dalgety and Company and similar firms do not carry on the business of banking. Banking is carried on exclusively by bankers. Curiously enough, there is no definition at the present moment of a banker. It is a term that is used in this Bill, but there is no definition of it in the Bill or in the Acts Interpretation Act. </para>

            <para>- If the amendment is agreed to there will be no need for the head office to send notice to the branches. They will be protected. As the Bill stands, notice of bankruptcy must be sent out and the law allows sufficient time for a notification to reach each branch through the post. </para>

          <para>.- First of all we have a definite statement by a legal gentleman who is supporting the Government as to the purport of his amendment, and then we have an explanation from the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford),</inline> stating clearly that that amendment will not place those who are interested in bankruptcy proceedings in the position in which the Bill intends them to be placed. This is not a party measure. Honorable senators of the Opposition are just as anxious as the Government to protect the community against persons who commit fraud, and if the amendment, as opposed to the provisions submitted by the Minister, will not afford sufficient protection to the community in this direction, I cannot, without further explanation of its object, support it. </para>

          <para>. - I have already stated one of the reasons for inserting in the Bill a definition of the term &#34; banker,&#34; which is used in the proposed new clause. It has been found necessary in other legislation containing references to bankers, and particularly in the Bills of Exchange Act, to have such a definition. But this Bill contains none. Neither is any definition of &#34; banker &#34; to be found in the Acts Interpretation Act. What is a banker ? A corporation acting under charter to carry on banking in the British Empire, or an individual, may be so described. In view of the vagueness of the term, this Bill should contain a proper definition. </para>

            <para>- I am asking the Committee to provide that for the purpose of this clause a banker shall be deemed to be a banker at his office where the payment or delivery is made, and since that stupid doctrine of relation back has been retained in this Bill - I have not been able to shift the Government in that regard - it is absolutely essential that the banks should be afforded some protection. They do not ask for any special privilege which this Parliament should not give, but as they are public institutions they ask to be afforded a certain amount of protection, to enable them to carry on the business of banking, which is a very necessary function in the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has just pointed out many disabilities which the banks will suffer under this legislation. Take, for example, the Commonwealth Bank, with its 3,000 branches. If notice is given to the head office in Sydney, none of the branches outside Sydney, except perhaps the head &#34;offices in each State, will hear anything about the several acts of bankruptcy that may occur in Perth, Fremantle, Brisbane, </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Sydney, or Darwin, but if all of the 3,000 branches do not get notice of these acts nf bankruptcy and certain money is paid out by any of them, the bank will be called upon to make refunds to the several trustees. </para>

          <para>. -  The Government cannot accept the amendment because it would impose upon persons who  may become bankrupt an obligation which, would be very difficult to carry out. As the paragraph at present stands, such books of account as are usual and proper have to be kept, but, if the amendment were carried K it would be necessary for a record to be kept of every transaction, however small. </para>

Under another clause drastic action can be taken in the case of persons who have been bankrupt before ; but this paragraph covers those who have not previously been before a Bankruptcy Court.

        <para class="block">It is frequently found necessary and desirable for a trustee to carry on a business for some time as a going concern, with a view to better ultimate realizationin the interests of both creditors and&#39; debtor alike, in which case it is highly desirable to fix the  trustee&#39;s  remuneration;  or commission on the turnover. It would obviously be wrong to allow him the same rate on the turnover as on the amount of assets realized. This method has been put into practice with good results in Queensland, and the rate usually allowed is 1 per cent. on the turnover. </para>

          <para>. -  I cannot accept the honorable senator&#39;s proposal. It would introduce an undesirable principle. If it is necessary to carry on a business, the trustees may appoint a manager on salary, and it is considered that this would be more in the interests of the creditors, and more in conformity with the general principles of the Bill, than to allow the trustee to carry on the business and receive a commission on the turnover. If the latter course were adopted, the trustee would be interested only in obtaining a large turnover. Under the Bill, the trustee will receive remuneration in the form of a commission on the assets realized and the book debts collected. </para>

            <para>- I have endeavoured to find those provisions, but have failed. The absence of- them is causing anxiety to a number of people in the State of Victoria. A clause which lays -down the duties of a trustee should at least impress upon him the necessity of registering as early as possible any land which is under the Act, and in respect of which the State -law purports to protect innocent persons. The provision in the Bill is new, and it may upset the whole legal system. </para>
