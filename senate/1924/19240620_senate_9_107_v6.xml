                    <para>. - I support the amendment, since on a previous division we failed to secure the elimination of the Commission altogether. Judging by the speeches of several honorable senators opposite on the second reading of the Bill, we on this side shall have considerable support for this amendment. Some of them supported the Government&#39;s proposal in part, but expressed the opinion that one Commissioner would be quite sufficient to control the Federal Territory. The Minister, in reply, enumerated the various duties which the Commissioners, if appointed, would have to perform. If his argument were valid we should require at least half a dozen Commissioners to cope with the various duties that would come, under their jurisdiction. Included in those duties were the control and management of Crown lands, the levying and collection of taxes, construction and maintenance of tramways, works and buildings, roads, &#39; and  bridges  the destruction of weeds and vermin, and, generally, municipal government of the Territory. It would be impossible for any three Commissioners to carry out those duties. We should at least require an expert on land legislation and taxation, and on financial matters ; an engineer would be necessary for the construction of roads and bridges and other works. The destruction of vermin and weeds would require special attention, and health and sanitation would come under the supervision of a medical officer. For municipal and local government we should require the services of an expert on local administration. On the argument advanced by the Minister we should require at least half a dozen instead of three Commissioners. What does the Minister himself do when he is dealing with the various branches of- the Department under his control? He cannot possibly be expected to be conversant with all the details of those various branches. He, consequently, calls in to his assistance the services of the heads of those branches, and, if necessary, of other Departments to assist him in his deliberations. If one Commissioner were appointed he would have at his disposal the experts in the various Government Departments. A legal matter would be attended to by the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, and an engineering matter concerning roads and bridges, by the Works and Railways Department. When the new system of administration operates at Canberra, the various Departments will gradually be located there, and, therefore, the opportunity to obtain  technical  advice will be very much facilitated. The experts will reside within the Federal Territory, and can be easily consulted by the Commission. It seems extraordinary, now that practically most of the spade work in laying out the new capital has been accomplished, that the Government should require to appoint an expensive Department, which will eventually become very -extensive, when the wheels- of progress are to a great extent in working order, and can be kept going without undue friction with a little lubrication. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not sure that the amendment proposed by my colleague will be agreed to by the Committee, and I give notice that if it is rejected I shall move a further amendment. In the meantime, in the hope that it may be agreed to, I wish to point out some of the advantages that would accrue from its adoption. The Commissioner would have the right to call to his aid, not necessarily the services of the two Commissioners, who, the Minister suggests, would have experience of a valuable character, but  those  . of men experienced in other directions. Just as I believe that it is improbable that the Chief Commissioner himself would have an all-embracing knowledge of the subjects set out in &#39;clause 14, so to some extent do I believe that the additional two Commissioners would also be lacking in a complete knowledge of those subjects. I disagree with the view of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and believe that we cannot, reasonably expect any man, no matter how closely he may devote himself to these  matters, to possess an expert and valuable knowledge of &#169;very one of them. Sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 14 proposes to confer upon, the Commission the right to construct, maintain, and operate tramways. , If Canberra is to make the progress that we expect it to make, it will be necessary for one man to devote the whole of his time to looking after that utility. I presume that he will .also have, to deal with motor traffic and other means of transport. In Sydney one man has been appointed as manager or general superintendent to control the tramway undertaking, but he is not expected to be expert in local government matters. His whole time is occupied with the working of the tramway system, and he is aided by the heads of various sub-departments. Sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> confers on the Commission power to construct, maintain, and control roads, bridges&#39; culverts, levees, sewers, drains, and watercourses. A man who is expert in the  management of a tramway system may not know anything about the construction i of a culvert or a sew.er. If one commissioner 6&#39;niy is appointed he will have to be in a position to call in specialists to assist him. This is. the age of specialization. The man who today is expert in a variety of matters finds it difficult to secure any employment. To excel, a man must devote him- , self almost exclusively to one subject. It is true that some men launch out in a business which involves the handling and distribution of a number of different articles, but such a. concern generally develops into a limited liability company, in which the principal delegates the control of sub-departments to a number of persons. No matter how well informed the Commissioner may be, he will not have a knowledge of all the matters that will come before him. Provision will nave to be made for gas, electricity, water, and sewerage. In Sydney an expert engineer devotes the whole of his time to controlling the generation and distribution of electricity. Is it expected that the Commissioner at Canberra will be any better equipped than, say, the Lord Mayor of Sydney ? I do not suppose that he will. He will have to be advised on a variety of matters, in addition to the municipal government of the territory. I believe that mention has not been made in the Bill of a number of duties that he will be required to perform. I should like the Minister to state who is going to take charge of education at Canberra. At present it is under, the direction of the New South Wales Department of Education. </para>

                        <para>- That will require to be added to the many duties to be controlled by the Commissioner. I have no desire to recite the full list of duties detailed in clause 14, because  I think that I have referred to a sufficient number to show that the appointment of two additional advisers will be totally inadequate to meet the requirements. . An unsatisfactory feature of the Bill is that the remuneration of the two proposed additional Commissioners is not clearly set out.  If they work in harmony with the Commissioner, and he pays close attention to his business, these gentlemen may draw up to ?10,000 or ?20,000 per annum. </para>

In a later clause, to which the Minister yesterday  was allowed to refer, provision is made for the remuneration of the two additional commissioners by way of fees. It would be better if the remuneration were clearly stated; then the public would know what the cost was likely to be. It would be an advantage to the Commissioner if he could call to his aid experts, of which there is an innumerable supply in the Commonwealth. The clause might, therefore, be amended to provide for the appointment of only one commissioner, and in a later clause provision could be made to enable the Commissioner to call to his aid men expert in the matters detailed in clause 14.  </para>

                    <para>. - Of course the Government cannot accept this amendment. I can well imagine that if it had brought down a Bill providing for the appointment of one Commissioner, the Opposition would have said that it was proposed to appoint an autocrat. As the Bill provides for the appointment of three commissioners, only one is favoured by them. An instance of a Commission constituted on practically the same lines as this is to be is the Electricity Commission, which is charged with the responsibility of the big electrical distribution scheme at Yallourn. That Commission consists of a full-time salaried chairman and two other members, who are paid by fees. As every one knows, it has carried out a very big engineering work with satisfactory results, and it is a good illustration of the value of enlisting the services of persons who are experts in a particular line to assist -a permanent chairman. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. My objection is based upon the fact that the Government has in its service at present officers who for ten years have been regarded as competent to carry on this work. I, therefore, do not favour the appointments of three other persons to take control. There has not been any charge of inefficiency or of mismanagement. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that the powers of the officials are at present curtailed, and that they are subject to the will of this Parliament - exercised, of course, through the Government. That is an excellent position in which to place them, and they should be kept there. I have always been taught that the lesser of two evils is to be preferred, and I, therefore, favour the appointment of one Commissioner instead of three, particularly as the Bill provides for the payment of fees to&#39; two of them. Men who are worthy to hold these offices will not accept employment tinder such conditions. The existing administration at Canberra, with a few alterations, can carry out all the constructional work as efficiently as it has been carried out in the past. When Parliament is sitting at Canberra or it will exercise a moral effect on the officials, because members will move about with an eye to the prevention of waste and extravagance and the expeditious carrying on of the work. The number of practical men who find their way into Parliament is remarkable. We shall then be able to establish a local governing body from the ranks of the residents. If I am not supported sufficiently to enable me to destroy the whole provision, I shall certainly join <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> in his efforts to prevent the appointment of more than one Commissioner, on the ground that a Commission as a form of government is not understood in Australia, has not been asked for - and, of course, has emanated from this Government. I can safely say that no good. thing can cornel from the party opposite, and I gladly support the amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline></para>

                    <para>. -  I have supported the idea of a Commission because I feel that its appointment will ensure continuity of policy. To have this continuity it is essential that the Commission should &#39; be clothed with powers to borrow. T am not in favour of giving officers of the Public Service such wide powers in that connexion as are proposed in the Bill. I do not favour the appointment of a single Commissioner. I recall the initial experience in regard to the construction of Canberra under a single head-. Under the auspices of the Labour Government then in power the work was started with a fanfare of trumpets, the laying of many foundation stones, and numerous ceremonies. The Government of that day selected a gentleman who should have been in every way qualified for the work of supervision, seeing that he was the designer of the Capital, and was specially brought to Australia for the purpose. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin,</inline> who was appointed the sole constructional authority, and began operations with a very elaborate staff. I have not the slightest feeling against that gentleman; but the fact remains that all the mistakes for which the work at Canberra has been criticized, occurred while the control was under &#187; single: head. </para>

                        <para>- The cutting is an eyesore, and the mistakes made when there was one-man control furnish an answer to the argument of those honorable senators who say that the work should be  done  under a sole director in co-operation with the officers of the Department. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin&#39;s</inline> regime there was continual clashing between him and the officers of the various Departments employed at Canberra. The position was unsatisfactory from beginning to end. That is why the Government of the day put an end to the arrangement, and almost everybody in Parliament agreed that the farce should be stopped. I have not heard any honorable senator - no matter  to  what party he belongs - attempting  to  justify the administration as it existed in those days under a single head. Statements have been made that the position has been everything that could be desired since the one-man regime was ended, and I quite agree that the work of remedying the earlier errors has been and is still being  well  done. If it were  only  a matter of carrying out the programme of works set down by this Parliament it would be quite a good plan to continue the present administration, leaving the officers of the Departments at Canberra to carry out the developmental policy as directed by Parliament. I am not in favor of one-man control in any circumstances where it is possible to have three Commissioners. There is a good deal of truth in the Biblical saying, that &#34;in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.&#34; It  will  not be necessary to have an expert in every department that  will  come under the purview of the proposed Commission. It is quite sufficient that the three  Commissioners  should have a general working knowledge of the whole scheme, and should act on  the  reports of their officers. It would be foolish to dissociate, say,  the  Engineering Branch from  the  Construction Branch, and  it  is, therefore, necessary that there should be some authority to hold  the  balance between  the  contentions of  the  different Departments  operating at the Capital, in order to arrive at the best policy in the general interests of its development. If we had one Commissioner, and he made a mistake, it would be much less likely to be admitted and rectified than if we had a Board of three. I know that the present officers are now doing their work well, and would be capable of giving equally satisfactory service in future were it not for the allimportant point that it is desired to give the Commission the power to borrow money, to do its own work in its own way, and at its own speed, which I feel sure will be at an accelerated rate. I would not give to any public servant the power to raise loans for such works as are to be carried out at Canberra. That power should only be given to a Board of Commissioners who would be responsible to a Minister, and through him to the Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - There could be no stronger argument in favour of the amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> than that advanced by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> He said that the officers now engaged in the work at Canberra were doing it well. He told us that they were efficient officers, with whose services he had not the slightest fault to find ; but he would not trust public servants with the duty of floating loans and doing the work that the proposed Commission would have to undertake. Nobody outside a lunatic asylum would ever suggest that these public servants should have the power to float loans for public purposes. No one in this Chamber has suggested such a foolish idea. What we on this side said yesterday, what we say now, and what we shall continue to say, is that there are Ministers in the Cabinet who have not yet been given portfolios, and that there are still some members of the National party who would appreciate being included in the Ministry. The present Government is in a precarious state of health, and it is calling for all sorts of prescriptions for tonics. It is weak and anaemic. One can see from the expressions on the faces of Ministers that they are far from healthy. The chief physician of the Cabinet has told the people plainly that it is in a very precarious condition, and requires a stimulant. Apparently there are not sufficient members in the Cabinet to do the work necessary at Canberra. If that is so, why not appoint  an additional Minister, who could, with the approval of Cabinet and Parliament, float the necessary loans and instruct the present officers to carry on the work ? Yesterday I made the statement that it would prove very expensive to have three Commissioners. I remarked, incidentally, that there was no limit in the Bill to the amount that could be paid by way of fees to two of them;- .but the &#39;guide, philosopher, and friend of the Bruce-Page combination, who advises Ministers in the Senate on all matters - I refer to the Government Whip - said that I had not read the Bill. As a matter of fact, I had, and I was not in error in saying that one Commissioner would be paid &#163;3,000 per annum, and the other two could receive any sum prescribed by regulation. When I looked at the Bill again, at the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> and still maintained my point of view, I was advised to &#34; read on.&#34; I have &#34; read on.&#34; My contention is substantiated. The honorable senator and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> who followed him, now discover that they made a mistake. Evidently they had not read the Bill, and did not understand it. Coming back to the question of three Commissioners, I reiterate that even one is not necessary. I do not believe in government by Commissioners at all. Apparently, we shall not be able to defeat the Government on this issue, but if there is anything in what honorable senators supporting the Ministry have been saying in their second-reading speeches, the Government ought to accept the amendment, even if it does come from this side. Some of their strongest supporters share our views on this question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> may be cited as one. If there is anything I admire in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> it is his consistency. Unlike other honorable senators opposite who speak in disapproval of the provisions in a Bill, but vote in opposition to their expressed views, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> may be depended upon to stand up to his convictions. I have watched the honorable senator very carefully. It is true that although he is opposed to my party, and at times makes statements which are not altogether accurate, he is not like other honorable senators of his party - consistent only. in their inconsistency. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> I am sure, will support us in our endeavour to make this a more workable measure.  His  was one of the best speeches made by Ministerial supporters in their demand for economy in administration and continuity of policy. He told the Committee that for a long time he had been a strong, opponent of the Federal Capital proposal. Unlike certain go-slow members of the Bruce-Page combination, he was not afflicted with &#34; Canberraitis.&#34;  He informed us that at one time he did not wish to see any expenditure of public money at the Capital City site. - On the occasion of his first visit to Canberra, so we are told, he was prejudiced in regard, .both to its climate and situation, but he came back convinced that the site had been well chosen and that, in the course of time, we should have a -very important and beautiful city there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> also pointed out that nearly all the big works had been practically completed. We may presume, therefore, that his view is that if there was ever any justification for the appointment of these three Commissioners, the appointments should have been made .before all this pioneering work had been done, and that the Government, is putting forward this proposal rather late in the day. If;. at the commencement of their career, Ministers had outlined it, perhaps it would have been taken more seriously. </para>

I understand that the proposed Commission is to be a local authority responsible for the control of operations at Canberra, and that it will have little to do with constructional work. It will not be expected to give effect to the proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline> Its main function will, I understand, be to deal with the construction of streets, and other works of a similar character, such as are usually undertaken by local governing bodies </para>

                        <para>- The Advisory Committee is directing operations, and every one who has visited Canberra will admit that they are proceeding very satisfactorily. Prior to the appointment of the Advisory Committee some costly mistakes were made, and quite a lot of useless work was undertaken. With three Commissioners there would be continuity of policy and less likelihood of unnecessary expenditure. The responsibility should not rest upon Ministers, because, at present, they have more important duties to perform, and their time should not be taken Up in administering what are purely local affairs. Parliament will have control over the Commission, as it will have to submit reports and make recommendations on important issues. Parliament should not be reduced to the level of a municipal council and waste its time in dealing with details which could more effectively be settled by a Commission established at the Capital City. Too much time is now wasted, not only in the National Parliament, but in the State Legislatures, in dealing with questions which should be settled by local governing bodies. With your permission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I should like to briefly comment upon a statement I made yesterday, that mechanics at Canberra were being paid 23s. per day. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but we have in the Senate to-day a man as small in stature and as great in knowledge. The difficulties which existed during the period <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griflin</inline> was in control were caused because public officers felt that they were placed in a false position in consequence of the conditions under which they had to work, and they almost challenged his authority. This Bill does not leave any doubt as to who shall be the controlling authority, and the measure gives the proposed Commission powers which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin:</inline> never possessed. I say, unhesitatingly, that if this Bill is passed, and a Commission is appointed, the next Parliament will repeal the Act. </para>

                    <para>. - Surely the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> does not accuse me of moving &#34; this amendment &#34;with the object of harassing the Government. He said, that if the Government had proposed one Commissioner we on this side of the Chamber would have offered opposition on the ground that the person appointed would become an autocrat and dictator; but that is not so. A Board of three appointed by the Government to control an important branch of the Service was absolutely powerless in consequence of a misunderstanding which existed between two of its members, and any recommendation made was overruled by two men. </para>

                        <para>- The Naval Board. In consequence of the dispute which existed, the position became so acute that the  chairman  resigned; and similar trouble will probably arise if a Commission consisting of three members is appointed. I am strongly of the opinion that the work at Canberra can be more effectively controlled by one Commissioner than by a Board of three, and I trust the Committee will support my amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish, as briefly as possible, to give my reasons for supporting the appointment of three&#39; Commissioners to control the work at the Federal Capital. I do so because of the opinion I have formed, after three visits to Canberra, during which I had ample opportunity to study the whole question at issue, that the work, as it is at present, naturally divides itself into two portions - the administration of the land and the. administration of works. To those duties may presently be added the administration of the city. It would be impossible for one man to combine the necessary knowledge, or to have the necessary time, even if he worked twenty-four hours a day, to carry out satisfactorily all the duties relating to those three branches. That being so, the Commissioners should number three. I have no doubt that the system which has worked so well - as honorable senators have admitted during the debate - respecting the two activities which at present exist at the Federal, site, will still work well when the municipal duties that must be attended to as soon as Canberra. becomes a city, come into being. I therefore intend to support the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the clause as printed will not be agreed to. The Minister yesterday stated that the approximate amount would not exceed &#163;7,000, which amount was embodied in the Bill. The Bill, however, contains nothing at all respecting the amount by way of fees that may be paid to the two part-time members of the Commission. As originally introduced in another place, it did state a specific amount, but that provision was eliminated. I feel sure- that the Committee, notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DrakeBrockrnan</inline> said yesterday, does not desire that the part-time Commissioners shall receive other than a reasonable reward for their services; hut it should not be left to the Minister to so frame regulations as to permit these Commissioners to receive more than was originally intended. In another place, exception was taken to the original clause by members supporting the Government, and objection was also raised by the press of the Commonwealth, because the amount specified for the remuneration of the Commissioners would have to be obtained by placing additional taxation on the people of Australia. Three Commissioners were considered to be unnecessary, and the total salaries of &#163;7,000 to he excessive. After conferring, the Government supporters concluded, that it would be better to have one permanent Commissioner and two part-time Commissioners. The belief was entertained by those who entered their protest against the appointment of three Commissioners that if this were done the salaries and fees would not in any way approximate &#163;7,000. &#34;What guarantee have we of that? There. is no limitation to the fees that may be paid to these gentlemen. As a representative!  of the people of Victoria, I protest against the payment of excessive fees to the part-time Commissioners for any services that they may render. I am not opposed to the payment of reasonable or proper salaii.es, but I do not intend to vote blindly for this clause. It is too ambiguous, and gives too much power- to the Minister to frame regulations respecting salaries. We should lay down definitely the salary we think ought to be paid. I move - </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays drew attention to the fact that no limitation was imposed on the amount of fees that could be paid. That is a fact for which the Government is not responsible, excepting in so far1 as it accepted an amendment that was moved in another place. ,When the Bill was introduced it provided a limitation of &#163;2,000 in respect to each of the two part-time Commissioners. I cannot accept the destructive amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> it is clearly intended to accomplish, in another way, the limitation desired on the number of Commissioners. If , <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays desires to pursue the matter,, I am prepared to accept an amendment to add to the clause the words &#34;the total amount of remuneration paid, by way of fees shall not exceed the sum of &#163;4,000: per annum.&#34; It is desirable that the Government shall he able to prescribe the amount of fees and the manner in. which they are to be paid. It may be found desirable and necessary to pay a retaining fee. The Commissioners must obviously make inspections to see the manner in which the work is being carried out. Therefore, some portion of the &#163;2,000&#39; may have to be paid as a retaining fee, the balance to bo drawn by the two Commissioners as fees for sittings. That is the reason why we wish the clause to contain the words &#34; as prescribed.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. -  Did I understand the Minister to say that he would agree to an amendment providing that the fees shall not exceed &#163;2,000 per annum each, a portion of that sum to be paid as a retaining fee; in other words, that one or both of the two part-time Commissioners shall be paid a straightout salary of &#163;1,000 per annum, the other &#163;1,000 per annum in each case to be drawn as fees? If these gentlemen met only once a week the payment per sitting would considerably exceed that made to honorable senators. I do not for a moment consider that the services of these gentlemen will be more valuable to the country than are those of honorable senators. They will certainly be not nearly so valuable as the services of Ministers. If it is intended to pay them at the rate of &#163;40 per sitting, that ought to be made clear. I realize that the cost of living has considerably advanced and that, at a remuneration of less than &#163;40 or &#163;50 per sitting, these mythical gentlemen would not be able to make available any of the vast store of information that they have gathered ! </para>

                    <para>. -  I am in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> amendment. I understand that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> now suggests, as a compromise, that the total fees paid shall not exceed &#163;4,000 per annum. I&#34; should prefer the Minister to state definitely the amount which is to be received by the two part-time Commissioners. Subclause 3 of clause 6 states that the  Chairman  of the Commission shall devote the whole of his time to the duties of his office, and it is proposed to pay him a salary of &#163;3,000 per annum. I have opposed the appointment of this Commission from the time it was proposed. Yesterday I. stated that I would vote for any amendment which would destroy the Bill. But if the  Chairman  of the Commission is to bo required to devote the whole of his time to the duties of his office, and there ..are to be three Commissioners in all, let&#39; the other two be continuously on the job and be paid at least &#163;2,000 a year each. </para>

                    that the Labour party is an economy party, in the sense that it is anxious to see that full value is received for any expenditure incurred. Under the suggested amendment, which I have no doubt
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline>
                    Hays will&#39; move, it is not apparent how many sittings will be held or how much per sitting the two part-time Commissioners will receive. I am inclined to the same belief as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline>
                    that those gentlemen should give the whole of their time to this work. If they are merely given a retainer they will attend meetings without a knowledge of facts that are in the possession of the Chief Commissioner. That gentleman, being on the job all the time, will thoroughly understand it, and the others will have to be guided by him. They may be drawing &#163;3,000 a year from some other source, and will devote only a small portion of their time to this work. They may attend a meeting once a month, and the Government may fix their fee at 50 guineas, 60 guineas, or 70 guineas per sitting. We should be more careful in expending the people&#39;s money than we are with our own. Persons who are paid &#163;2,000 a year ought to be full-time officers. There are not in the Commonwealth Public Service many men who are receiving &#163;2,000 a year. The duties of these men will be of an intermittent character. For &#163;2,000 a year it should be possible to obtain the services of men who are prepared to place at the disposal of the Government the whole of their time. The majority of the public servants to-day are giving the whole of their time to the Commonwealth for less than &#163;500 a year. Seeing that many capable public servants do not receive more than &#163;500 per annum, surely we can get good Commissioners at &#163;2,000 per annum, . who will give the whole of their time to the work.

                    <para>. -  Now we have something definite, and we are invited to return to the proposal in the Bill when it was introduced in another place. The intention then was that two Commissioners should receive &#163;2,000 per annum each, and the  chairman  &#163;3, 000per annum. An alteration was made in another place as the result of a caucus meeting held on account of the hostility of certain honorable members on the Government side. I feel inclined to support the amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays if he consents to add the words &#34; and the Commissioners shall devote the whole of their time to the work of their office.&#34; I object to paying any citizen of this country&#163;2,000 per annum for intermittent work, seeing that for half that sum members of Parliament devote practically the whole of their time to their parliamentary duties. </para>

                    <para>. - Theamendment suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is outrageous. The Bill originally provided for three Commissioners. When the press and honorable members supporting the Government in another place opposed the appointment of three full-time men, a compromise was arrived at, with the result that we now have a worse Bill, so far as the expenditure is concerned, than the measure as it was originally introduced. The amendment is mere camouflage. The total expenditure under the first proposition would have been &#163;7,000 per annum. It is now proposed to have a permanent head at&#163;3,000 per annum,  and two part-time Commissioners who may be engaged only a third of the year, but will be in a more favorable position financially than the permanent man himself. From such an arrangement we cannot expect to obtain satisfactory results. Personal feeling will be engendered from the very commencement of the Commission&#39;s operations. The part-time Commissioners will attend only when they think it necessary. Honorable senators from Tasmania have told us that the island State is in a very precarious condition financially. Appeals have been made for help, and yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays, and those who share his views, are prepared to vote for the payment of a higher salary to part-time Commissioners than to the permanent head. </para>

                        <para>- We know, as a matter of fact, that the work which the Commissioners may be called upon to perform will be small compared with what would have been required of them had they been appointed when first this Government came into office. Ministers at first said that, owing to the amount of work ahead, it was necessary to appoint three Commissioners, and that, in their opinion, those officers should devote the whole of their time to their duties. In the next breath almost we have been told that it will not be necessary to have three full-time Commissioners; that the  chairman  will be the only permanent employee, and that the other two will be employed at casual intervals. I cannot understand these contradictory statements. If the two assistant Commissioners are to be only partly employed, as evidently is now the intention, the objections which honorable senators on this side have been urging against the Bill in this respect are-confirmed. The clause provides that the fees for the two assistant Commissioners shall be as prescribed. This means that regulations will be drafted in accordance with the provisions of the Act; those regulations will be placed upon the table of the Senate; and, if Parliament be in session, we shall have an opportunity of saying whether or not we approve of the fees to be paid. But Parliament may not be in session, and the Minister for the time being may draft regulations and prescribe such fees that the assistant commissioners, who, be it remembered, will be employed for only part of their time, may get as much by way of remuneration as was originally intended to be paid to them as permanent and full-time officers. No one can justify that position.. The working of the Commission will not be so satisfactory. It will not be as responsible for work that may be carried out in those circumstances as it would have been had the original proposal been carried into effect. I cannot support the amendment. In all other business activities or Government Boards, assistants or members do not get the same remuneration as the  chairman.  For this reason &#163;2,000 ought to be sufficient for the assistant Commissioners, who devote the whole of their time to the work. It seems now that, if we agree to this amendment, exorbitant fees may be paid to the assistant Commissioners. Can honorable senators vote for an amendment that is so indefinite in its terms? The Minister has not given the least hint as to the fees that will be paid to the assistant Commissioners. Canberra is in a somewhat isolated position. In all probability, one or two of the gentlemen to be appointed will be resident in a. distant State, with the result that considerable expenses will be incurred in travelling. Suppose, for example, that one of the Commissioners is a resident of Western Australia. Is it likely that he would consider himself well paid if he got less than &#163;2,000 a year? There will, I presume, be a certain number of sittings. Assistant Commissioners, like members of Parliament living in distant States, will occasionally desire to return to their respective homes. Therefore, from a business point of view it would be better to say here and now - not that I support the proposal - that there shall be three Commissioners, who shall devote the whole of their time to the control of the Federal Capital area; and, further, that the sum of their remuneration shall not exceed &#163;7,000. On the contrary, the Government now say that one of the Commissioners shall be a permanent official, and that the other two shall be called upon to assist the  chairman  whenever he thinks it necessary for them to attend. That is not my view of a business-like proposition. The Government cannot justify it. </para>

If the honorable senator will look at clause 10, he will find the provision that, if a Commissioner is wilfully absent from duty for a period of fourteen consecutive days, or, where his remuneration is by way of fees only, if he is wilfully absent from three consecutive meetings of the Commission, except when on leave, he shall cease to occupy his seat on the Commission. </para>

                    <para>   What we have in mind is this: Suppose a Commissioner is appointed to deal with finance. Obviously what will be wanted will be, not a bookkeeper, but some one having a sound knowledge and wide experience of finance; a man competent to advise the Commission in all financial matters.  I  should say he would probably be the head of an accountancy firm. As such, he will be paid a retaining fee and receive remuneration for attending meetings, inspecting properties and works, and advising the Commission.  It  is obvious that &#163;2,000 would be more than ample in such circumstances. Some latitude is necessary. We do not want to be tied down to a specific amount for an individual Commissioner. The Commission will require the services of a man experienced in local government problems&#39;. Probably he will be required for the whole of his time in the Capital city. He, too, would receive a retaining fee, and, in addition, such fees as would practically give us the right to the whole of his services. Therefore we ask for a certain amount of latitude, so that the many contingencies may be provided for by regulations. When we constitute the Commission, all these questions will have to be faced and dealt with. The regulations will prescribe the way in which the fees are to: be paid. Those regulations will come before Parliament, and, if Parliament disapproves of the prescribed fees, the regulations may be disallowed. I- ask the Senate not to tie the hands of the Government in regard to the fees to be paid to the two assistant Commissioners. It does not follow that each man will receive &#163;2,000 a year. The work may be distributed in such a way that one man may be required to give more of his time to the work of the Commission than another. As regards the meetings of the Commission, I remind honorable senators that the Minister will be able to exercise authority. If he thinks that meetings are being held simply for the purpose of enabling the Commissioners to draw fees, or if, on the other hand, he thinks the Commission is not meeting often enough to do the work required of it, he will have power to intervene. That is the spirit in which the Act will be administered. In the circumstances, I ask the Committee to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  Each time the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> replies to questions he furnishes stronger reasons for our opposition to the proposal. He has just told us that the  chairman  of the Commission should; be a man with a sound knowledge of- land and kindred problems, and that another member should have wide financial knowledge. Admitting that gentlemen possessing this special- knowledge should be appointed, it makes it all the more imperative that they should be permanent members of the Commission and required to devote the whole of their time to the work. Let us consider the position in connexion with the railways of Australia. In  New  South Wales and in Victoria there are three Railways Commissioners, who devote the whole of their time to the administration of their respective railway systems. If the Commission is to consist of three members, they should not be allowed to engage in any work other than that for which they are paid by the Commonwealth. Whenever the Minister rises to give reasons - to my mind they are excuses - why the. amendment should be supported, the position becomes worse. I trust that the amendment will be rejected, but if it is accepted I shall test the feeling of the Committee later by moving to add certain words to provide that the assistant Commissioners shall devote the whole of their time to their work. </para>

That clause presupposes that there will be three members of the Commission, and in another portion of the Bill provision is made for a quorum.

Can it be expected that a gentleman holding such a responsible position will wilfully absent himself when his position carries such a substantial remuneration ? It would be possible, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has pointed out, for one of the assistant Commissioners to receive more than &#163;3,000 a year. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)&#39;</inline> stated that if the matter is left in the hands of the Government, regulations will be drafted, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> circumstances arise, which he believes will be acceptable to Parliament. What guarantee have we of that <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> He also said that it might be found necessary to pay a retaining fee. To whom? The Bill does not provide for the payment of a retaining fee to specially skilled men. If that is in the mind of the Government, possibly some one who, in their opinion, is specially fitted for some particular class of work will be appointed. It would be preferable to postpone further consideration of the Bill to give the Government time to ascertain the type of man they require. When inquiries are made, they may find that it is  unnecessary to appoint two additional Commissioners. This is the first occasion on which retaining fees have been mentioned. It might be possible to secure the assistance of men in certain spheres of activity for which assistance the Government could pay. We do not want to be running here, there, and everywhere in search of men to deal with, say, engineering and accountancy problems. We wish men to be appointed who are best qualified to perform the duties they are to undertake, and who will render continuous service. The Government realize that they are in a hopeless fix in regard to this Bill. Its handling has been muddled from the time it was first introduced until its present stage. The measure as introduced in another place contained provisions entirely different from those now before us. Can the members of _ the. Government tell us exactly what&#39; is in their minds? Each Minister seems to have a different opinion. I am sure that if this amendment is agreed to, and it is returned to another place for its concurrence, the Minister in charge of the Bill in that Chamber will express a different opinion from that voiced by the Minister for Home and Territories this afternoon. If a member of the Government were conducting a private business, and found that it was &#39; growing to such an extent that it was necessary to obtain assistance, he would probably form a company. Would he say that the members of the board of directors should be business men&#39; who must devote the whole of their time to their work,  or would he suggest that it would be preferable to appoint a  chairman  who should have the assistance of two other directors who, if living in different parts of the Commonwealth should, when their services were required, he summoned by urgent telegram? That is what is proposed in this instance. I cannot see any justification for the appointment of two- assistant Commissioners unless they are to devote the whole of their time to the work upon which they are to be engaged. If the services of skilled men can be secured by paying retaining fees, the appointment of additional Commissioners is unnecessary. </para>

                <para>A period of three years for the appointment of each of the Commissioners is quite long enough. We should thus be able to better understand how the work at the Capital was being carried out, and at the expiration of that period we could ascertain whether the expenditure incidental to the appointment of the Commission was justified. That body might then be found to be almost superfluous:&#34;  If the Federal Parliament assembles at Canberra within the next two years, as- is anticipated by some of the Government supporters, nearly all the work now in course of construction will have then been completed, so that whatever justification there is now for the appointment of a Commission to control works that are not completed would not exist at the end of three years. I cannot see why there should be any difference between the terms of appointment of any of these Commissioners. The permanent Commissioner under the Bill is to be appointed for five years, one assistant Commissioner for four years, and the other for three years. My amendment should be acceptable to the Committee, because if, as is anticipated&#39; by the Government, the Commissioners appointed are highly efficient men, they should be able to prove their capabilities within three years. A member of Parliament is appointed for three years. </para>

Why should the members of the Commission be appointed for a longer&#39; period than are members of Parliament ? If, at the end of three years, there is no real necessity for the further appointment  of the Commissioners, Parliament will then be free to make other arrangements. For the good government of the Federal Territory, and on the score of economy, and because these- Commissioners should not be placed in a better position than that of members of Parliament, I ask the committee to support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendment. It is desirable that we should be able to attract to the position of  Chairman  of the Commission a man of high capabilities, and that position would be made less attractive if the period of appointment were shortened. Surely five years is short enough if we are to attract a really first class man, who. will of necessity relinquish any business other than that pertaining to his appointment. Then, again, it is not desirable that the appointment of the three Commissioners should terminate at the same time. There must be some continuity, and- some members of the Commission with previous experience remaining to advise any new member that may be appointed. I would remind the Committee that when dealing with the Public Service Bill we provided exactly the same terms of appointment for the Public Service Commission as are proposed under this Bill - five, four, and three years.. Therefore, if this clause is passed, it will be consistent with what the Committee has previously done. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems to see a likeness between this proposed Commission and the Public Service Commission, but there is nothing of the kind. From experience, we know that the Public Service Board is vitally necessary. In this case it is an experiment in a new form of government, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> properly considers will not continue for any length of time. Whoever accepts appointment as Commissioners will know &#39;that their services will not be required when a change of Government takes place at the next elections. The elector&#39;s are not educated to the standard of government by an individual, and will not stand for it. I favour an appointment for three years, because it is the lesser evil. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> would remind honorable senators of what happened in New South Wales. A Tory* Government wanted to remove a Railway Commissioner .who had been appointed under an Act of Parliament for seven years. That Parliament therefore passed a Bill, taking his office from him, and also his right of appeal to the Law Courts. At that time I did not think the Government acted rightly, and I am still of that opinion. I am merely showing that a Liberal Government created a precedent which can easily be followed by another Government if these appointments are made. This Government, has never had the approval of the people. It was formed by. extraordinary means, and is now trying, behind the backs, of the electors of the Commonwealth, to foist upon Canberra a new system of government. &#39; The Commissioners should not be appointed for a period longer thaw three years. </para>

                    <para>. - Not many years ago, in New South Wales, when a decision was arrived at by an anti-Labour Government to appoint a certain gentleman as Agent-General, it was publicly stated by the party to which I have the honour to belong that if they secured the reins of office they would recall him at the earliest possible moment. Labour did come into power, and despite the fiction that these men once appointed have the right, if recalled, to proceed &#39; against the Government for the amount of salary for the full term, this&#39; Agent-General was recalled before he reached London. That should be an intimation to the prospective appointees to the positions of Commissioners at Canberra that there is perhaps more than a possibility that on the return of the Labour Government after the next election, the necessary steps will be immediately taken to terminate what is regarded outside this Chamber as an unnecessary and unjustifiable expenditure. </para>

Owing to the exceptional abilities displayed by the working communities in Australia and to the vast production that they, with the aid of modern machinery, are able to bring about, the Government thinks it necessary to create a very large number of highly-paid positions to dispose of the surplus production and to keep a number of men in employment. This is another step in that direction, but it is worse than usual on account of the five years&#39; period. The amendment is the lesser of two evils. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing prophetic in that statement. The idea is in the minds of the electors, and it is their intention to make sure that this Government shall not have a further lease of power. As the next general election must take place in the early part of 1926 at the latest, these appointments ought to he limited to two -years. I feel quite confident that . the services of this Commission will be dispensed with by the next Labour Government. There have been occasions when opponents of legislation passed by a Labour Government have threatened to repeal it immediately they attained office. The difference between them and us is that when we make a promise we keep it. We have said that this legislation is iniquitous, and because the proposed expenditure is unnecessary the burden of taxation will be made heavier than it should be. </para>

                        <para>- I appreciate the fact that if the term remains at five years the incoming Government will find it difficult to repeal the legislation without compensating those who are appointed. T want the chief Commissioner and the other Commissioners to realize that this. is experimental legislation, and that two years is a sufficient period in which to test it. My opinion, is that it is foredoomed to failure. The word &#34; recall &#34; has been mentioned. The action which will be taken by a Labour Government will not constitute a recall; it will be a complete dismissal . by the repeal of the Act. I shall support the amendment. If carried, those appointed will realize that they will have a year of grace in which to prepare to occupy some other position for which they may be better suited. </para>

                    <para>. - I a- somewhat new to the ways of the Federal Parliament, but in my comparatively long experience elsewhere) I have not heard a line of argument so insidious as that which has been adopted during the discussion of this measure. It appears to . me that the Opposition, despairing of achieving their object in the Senate, are endeavouring to make lit impossible for the Governmentwhich at present, at all events, enjoys the confidence of the people- to secure for these positions persons of the calibre which the importance of the office justifies. I protest against this Americanization of the Public Service, commissions, and boards of management. It is distinctly unfair to endeavour to terrorize probable applicants. The tone of the debate has been such that it is only parliamentary privilege that prevents certain honorable senators from being prosecuted as foretellers of the future. </para>

                        <para>- I am; this is a very serious matter. I invite those honorable senators who claim to. know so. much regarding the future to enter a profession which is recognized by the sporting papers. If th&#39;ey have valuable information to impart, if they can see as. far into the future as they claim they are able to see, they are wasting, not only our time, but theirs. Because I think that the terms proposed are fair, because they are calculated to attract good men. and to ensure continuity, I intend to support the clause as it stands.  I extremely deprecate this attempt - premeditated, I suppose, though I. hope it is not, - to induce possible applicants 1o refrain from applying for these positions. </para>

One of the Commissioners might die within six months of the expiration of his appointment, and a suitable man for the position would probably decline to accept it for a term of six months only.

                <para>That disqualification applies, not only to members of Parliament, but is also to be found in all legislation that the Commonwealth has passed on similar lines, and, so far as I know, there have been no abuses in connexion with it up to the present time.

                    <para>. - I do not think the honorable senator has quite considered where his argument might lead him. He would prohibit a Commissioner  from  holding shares in, say, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which has issued some millions of shares, and that company might very conceivably supply a good deal of the steel work required at Canberra. If a Commissioner held a few shares in that company, his interest in it would be so remote that it would practically amount to nothing. The limitation that the Bill proposes to make is that a Commissioner shall not be a shareholder in a private company when his interest amounts, in effect, to  a  partnership, if that company is associated with the constructional work at Canberra. That, of course, would be highly improper, because in such circumstances the Commissioner might derive considerable personal benefit as a result of his position by pushing the business of his own company. </para>
