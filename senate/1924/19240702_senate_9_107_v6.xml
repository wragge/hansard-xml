                        <para>. - In view of the provisions of this bill it would appear that we are to have a continuation of the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I do not altogether agree with the policy of the Government of linking up its fortunes or misfortunes with those of outside companies. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company is an enormously wealthy concern, and the Commonwealth of Australia Unlimited is also fairly strong financially, but I do not think that the Government can afford, not only in regard to agreements of this nature, but in connexion with any others, to link up its reputation with companies. Personally, I think that all agreements with companies are distasteful and objectionable, and it is not the function of the Australian National Parliament to meddle in such matters. I would much prefer to see the Government make a determined effort in the direction of oil development by paying a substantial reward to those who discover oil in payable quantities. I would not even limit the payment to the first discovery, but favour the payment of rewards to persons who discovered oil in- different parts of Australia. The Government could very well1 give handsome rewards because, in view of the way in which oil is being used and is likely to be used. there is no direction in which encouragement is more desirable. </para>

                        <para>- I&#39; realize that; but we can go much further. It should be the policy of the Government to organize experts to direct&#39; the operations of prospectors all over the Commonwealth. If a few thousand of the unemployed, particularly those with a knowledge of mining, were scattered&#39; all over Australia to search for oil in those parts where expert authorities1 believe there is a possibility of supplies being found in payable quantities, much good might result. In  Tamworth, <inline font-style="italic">Mew-</inline> South Wales, I have seen samples of very excellent oil. In some instances where the indications seem favorable the reports of experts appear to be most discouraging. It may be that a layman- is- not competent to determine&#39;, either by the appearance or by the smell,, whether what he has discovered is oil, and&#39; that consequently it is only reasonable to expect discouraging report&#39;s concerning&#39; discoveries made by prospectors who have very little knowledge of the .subject. It may be that Australia has no&#39; really profitable  oil-bearing  strata, although, on- the word! of Queensland Ministers, which I accept, there have- been; most promising, developments in their State. This agreement with the Anglo-Persian&#39; Oil Company is not a farm of business in which the Australian Government, should participate, but it is one out of which it may be most- difficult to emerge. It may, perhaps,, be profitable for the Commonwealth to remain in it. I cannot claim that the directors- of this oil company do not know how to manage their business, because if I did put forward such a claim the figures of their successful operations would easily prove that they know how to manage their affairs to some purpose and profit. After deducting administrative expenses, debenture interest, royalties, and depreciation, they have shown during the undermentioned years, ending the 31st March,, the following- results.: - 1913, no trading account available;. 191:4r &#163;26,711 loss?;. 1915,, &#163;90,431 profit; 1910, &#163;85.708 profit; 1917,. &#163;344,050 profit; 1918, &#163;l,308..5o8 profit;. 1919, &#163;2;.010,805 profit;, 1920, &#163;2,611,165 profit. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I  can  imagine many people saying that surely the directors of smh a company are the very type of business men we want to help to run .&#34;&#39;Australia Unlimited.&#34; Strange as it may seem, I do not hold that view. I think, that the interests of these&#39; people in world oil- are too great to permit them to participate in the development of. oil in Australia. The time is certainly ripe for a&#62; more active policy in regard to the possible development of oil in Australia. 1 know that something has been don&#38; in. recent years-,, and that, a little Commonwealth money has been spent. in Papua and New Guinea, with very meagre results; but in the early stages of oil development there are always many disappointments.,, and the&#39; hopes, of those who believe that oil- will be discovered&#39; <inline font-style="italic">w</inline> Australia may eventually be fulfilled. I shall have very little to say about the oil agreement itself, because the figures I have read&#39; indicate that a big corporation like the&#62; Anglo-Persian Oil Company must have some purpose to serve by linking itself in an. agreement with the Australian Government- I may be accused of entertaining unwise suspicions against big corporations.. I admit freely and. candidly that I am always afraid that when they are proposing something to help the Commonwealth they generally anticipate hel&#39;ping. themselves to something. </para>

                            <para>- We may hold a majority of the shares, but. because of their experience <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> profit making the Anglo-Persian Oil Company may hold&#39; the position of advisers and controllers, and so be able to see that any development in oil in Australia suits their own interests and not. those of the Commonwealth. That is,, at any rate, a possibility. I would rather have the development of oil in Australia absolutely free- from the possibility of interference on the part of any of the1 established oil companies,, and,, to my mind, our agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company  will not lend, itself to that end. I would give these people every encouragement to pursue* the search for oil in Australia, but I would not bind the Commonwealth to take 250,001 shares in a company in which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company holds 249,996 shares and the nominees of the oil company three shares between them. It is a very small majority of shares. </para>

                            <para>- With huge letters on them announcing to the general public that the company is doing something ? It may be on my part the suspicion which is due to ignorance, but I look upon everything in connexion with oil development in Australia with great suspicion. Suspicion is bred in the minds of those who realize that wealthy companies in other parts of the world will benefit by the prevention of oil development in Australia, and their profits will be greater so long as they can retard that development. The profits of a company, which can afford to incur expense  merely  to display big oil tanks outside Melbourne, are so huge that it can prevent the real development of Australia&#39;s oil resources. Oil may be discovered in Papua in payable quantities. There are high hopes that discoveries will be made  in  Queensland. If those hopes are fulfilled, Australia will be fortunate in having in power, in Queensland, a Labour Government that will protect the interests of the public. If oil is discovered in Queensland, particularly in the Roma district, there is no limit to the possibilities of development, because it will extend right across to the western coast of Australia. The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> has informed me that there are excellent prospects of discovering oil in the Territory. I understand that an officer has been sent there to make an inspection and to furnish a report. I view with very grave suspicion the proposal that the Commonwealth shall enter into an agreement with * wealthy company for the development of oil. Maybe this company possesses correct estimates of the future possibilities in regard to oil discoveries in Australia, and is taking an early&#39; opportunity to arrive at an agreement that will be most suitable to it, and most profitable to its shareholders. I am not in a position to Say that that is so. I merely discuss the measure- from the point of view of one who feels inclined to await developments. But, at the same time, I protest against  the Commonwealth entering into contracts .with any company for carrying on developmental work of this kind. If such work is to be done, the Commonwealth is big enough, it is strong enough, it is wealthy enough to do it. If there are opportunities for  development  by companies, the Government has the power  not only to allow those companies to avail themselves of those opportunities, but to&#39; ,encourage them in their development. No one would take exception to encouragement being given to any company, the efforts of which might lead to the discovery of oil in payable quantities for the use of the people of Australia. There I Heave the matter. Possibly, I may have some further remarks to make in committee. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear it. I rose merely to refer to the precarious position in which Australia is placed through having to depend upon external sources for oil - one of the foremost necessities of our industrial life. Those external sources are controlled, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has well said, by two or three combines with world-wide ramifications. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, with which it is proposed to enter into an agreement  is setting itself in opposition to those huge concerns. It is worth while recalling what, is the financial strength of those other  companies, and the profits that they have been making. One concern against which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company proposes to do battle is so powerfully entrenched that it seems almost hopeless for us, with the small capital of &#163;250,000, to set ourselves up against it. I refer particularly to the Dutch company, which is operating in the islands north of Australia, and in other parts of the world. I have here some figures which indicate the strength of that company, and show what its profits have been up to date. I quote from  the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian,</inline> which has taken the figures from a paper that represents the automobile interests in the United Kingdom. The Shell Transport Company, which is known as the Dutch Company, in 1915 had a capital of &#163;6,000,000, and its profits for that year were &#163;1,600,000. It declared a dividend of 35 per cent., and carried to reserves the sum of &#163;400,000. In subsequent years its capital was further increased until in 1922 it had reached a total of &#163;26,000,000. What I wish to direct the attention of honorable senators to is the folly, if not the hopelessness of the Commonwea.lth Government, in conjunction with any company with a capital of less than &#163;1,000,000, setting up in opposition to a concern which has a capital of &#163;26,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that it has a large capital, but it is handicapped in that it has only Persia upon which to draw for its supplies; whereas the Shell Transport Company and the Standard Oil Company have the wide world upon which to draw. My complaint is that, if we are in earnest in supporting this company in its search for oil and in its endeavour to make the other two combines do their duty as it should be done, the investment of only &#163;250,000 on behalf of the Commonwealth is only playing with the matter. </para>

It is now proposed to advance a further &#163;250,000, and to still retain that controlling interest. The capital of this subsidiary company is, therefore; only &#163;750,000. </para>

                            <para>- I take it then that this is a subsidiary company of one of the three great oil companies, that it will be dependent for its raw material upon one of them, and that it is to have no right to prospect within the Commonwealth. I say at once that this limits to an unwarranted degree oil prospecting in the Commonwealth, and should not be permitted, especially in view of the fact that we are paying for petrol three times the price that is paid in the United States of America. Immense fortunes are being made by these combines. According to its report, the Standard Oil Company, within the last fifteen years, has made a profit of something like  $5500,000,000.  Taking into consideration the huge financial strength of the two combines against which this fledgling, so to speak, will have to contend, I ask once again what hope is there of its success <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> It certainly may attempt to do something, but it is idle to suppose that it can do any effective work against the two powerful concerns which, with huge capital, are entrenched throughout the world. I support the bill, at the same time, in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition, directing attention to the necessity for encouraging prospecting for oil in Australia. Such a discovery would relieve Australia of a heavy burden. Until oil is discovered here in payable quantities, we shall continue to be at a great disadvantage respecting motor transport, and shall certainly fall behind in the race to establish ourselves as a great producing country. If the Government sees the necessity to come to Australia&#39;s &#39; rescue in the matter of oil prospecting, with even more money than is now asked for, it will have my support, because I believe that we cannot successfully and effectively compete against the two strongly entrenched combines unless we have sufficient money behind us. I support the bill in the belief that it will do some good. </para>

                        <para>.- I ask the Minister what is the necessity for authorizing the borrowing of money to pay the Commonwealth&#39;s share of increased capital, especially as the revenue is so buoyant, and we have for the financial year , just closed a surplus approximating practically  &#163;11,000,000.  I am against borrowing altogether unless it is for some work that in the near or distant future will pay interest upon the capital expended. It is wrong, and unfair and unjust to the. taxpayers .of this country to borrow money to bolster up this company. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable senator knows that it is quite unusual to apply revenue to a purpose such as that proposed in this bill. In any case, it would not be a legitimate charge upon revenue. A great deal of our accumulated surplus has already been allocated to purposes, approved of by Parliament. There is no attempt on the part of the Government to bolster up the company. The bill only provides the additional capital required to carry on the business of distributing the refined products, which the company is turning out at its works. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to know exactly what this new sub-clause means. I admit that the language is clear, but it is proposed to give to the  chairman  of the commission, who may not be a member of the Public Service, all the powers that are to-day vested in a permanent member of the service. I think this is a new departure. If it is I should like the Minister to say so. No other man, so far as I am aware, is clothed with such powers as it is proposed to give to the  chairman  of the commission. &#39;The other members of the commission may &#39;be mere ciphers, so that the  chairman  -will be the only man wholly responsible to the people of Australia for the work done at Canberra. He will have authority to suspend an officer. Actually he will be in the position of a Czar in the Federal Territory, and if there is anything that the Labour party is opposed to, it is despotism in any shape or form. Up to the present the Minister has advanced no reason why the  chairman  of the commission should be vested with such powers as are proposed. In all probability he will not be drawn from the Public Service. If so, I can understand the feelings of officers trained over a long period of years in a certain atmosphere, when suddenly they find themselves up against a new &#34; boss &#34; who, lacking experience of the Public Service, may think it about time that a change came over the scene. </para>

                        <para>- He might, but if there is anything in current rumours, the  chairman  of the commission has already been selected. Of course I do not take notice of all such rumours, but J know that many supporters of thisGovernment are very anxious to get the position. Many of them at the present time are out of jobs, and probably there will be many more in the same unhappy position after the next elections. </para>

                        <para>- Not much. We shall want good service from good men. For the reasons I have stated, I intend to vote against the amendment. I want reasons advanced to convince me that there is no other course. As a matter of fact, there are other courses open. Earlier in the debate, I pointed out that the bill was superfluous in that a commission was unnecessary, and that if we had not a commission we would not need a chairman, but would input the whole business on a different footing altogether. I am satisfied that if the chairman is to be vested with the powers proposed, it will I not be in the best interests of the Territory or of the Public Service. </para>

                    <para>. - I am wondering if the honorable senator&#39;s criticism of the proposed new sub-clause is due to the fact that he is opposed to the appointment of a commission altogether. I have explained why this amendment is necessary. If the commission is to be a success, it must be vested with authority giving it fairly untrammelled control of the officers who are to carry out its policy. If this provision is not inserted the officers in the Federal Territory will be under the control of the permanent head of the Home and Territories Department. He is an excellent officer, and one of the finest types of public servants in the Commonwealth; but as responsibility for carrying out the work at Canberra will rest upon the commission, it is essential that the  chairman  shall be the head of all public servants in the Federal Capital. They should look to him for their instructions. Otherwise the  chairman  of the commission might direct that certain work be done, and the officers - if they were not- responsible to him, but to the Secretary of the Home and Territories Department - might feel disposed to ascertain if the latter approved of the instructions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLaren</inline> is too well trained a public servant to allow that kind of  thing to be done, but it is conceivable that, in the course of time, we might have as permanent head of the Home and Territories Department an officer with a disposition to interfere with the commission and its work. It is clear that if the commission has not control of its staff, it cannot be held responsible for the carrying out of the work. The bill has passed its second reading, and the clause which constitutes the commission has been agreed to. We may therefore assume that the Senate is in favour of the appointment of the commission. This being so, it is logical that the  chairman  should have control of its staff. That is what this clause proposes to do. If is absolutely necessary, for the efficient working of .the staff, that the  chairman  should have&#39; the powers proposed to be vested in him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> indulged in all sorts of dismal prophecies as to the way in which the  chairman  might use his powers. If he were such a fool as to misuse his authority, clearly he would not be fit for <inline font-weight="bold">Ms position1,</inline> and he- would probably be equally foolish&#39; even if he were a permanent head in any other department... We must assume, of course, that he will use his powers- wisely, if he wants to get the best results from the 40 or 50 public servants who .will be under his direction. The Government can be trusted, to select a man. who will exercise his authority with discretion. I ask the committee to pass the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite- possible that two or three&#34; Government departments may be involved&#39; in connexion with the work to be* carried out by the commission, as&#39; the- operations now proceeding are under the1 control of the Horn&#169; and. Territories Department and the Department of. Works and Railways. When the  commission  has been, appointed, it- is1 reasonable to&#62; assume that certain officers- now employed, by these, two departments will come under the control of the commission. Surely the Minister does not suggest- that certain departmental heads at present engaged there will not be transferred to the control of the commission. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but we are told that it is probable that a gentleman with executive ability and driving power will be appointed as  chairman.  I am not at all satisfied with the clause, and I believe that it would be better for the people, and the public servants in particular, if the  chairman  of the commission were not clothed with such extensive powers as is proposed. </para>

                    <para>. -  I opposed the appointment of a commission, but even although a commission has been approved by the committee, I still believe that the clause as it stands is, without- improvement, quite inadequate. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> can submit an amendment better than that moved by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> I will support it. It appears that under clause 13 and other clauses to which the committee has agreed the commission will not be subject to the Public Service Board. </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause postulates that no one outside the Public Service will  be  employed  by  the commission.  During the  debate on the second  reading I  directed attention to the extra expense of the Commonwealth m appointing the commission, and mentioned that that body would collect a staff from outside the Public Service. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> scouted such an idea.. Does clause 13 mean that the commission will not engage any one at all outside the Public Service ? If if does employ outside persons, will those persons so engaged at once come under the provisions of the Public Service Act and receive the emoluments and benefits for which it provides? If that position does arise, will not the question of temporary employment have to be considered? There are men engaged in the Public Service to-day as temporary hands, .who &#39; may be dismissed at any time. Will the commission, in carrying out its work, always select officers at present in the Public Service, or will it be able to employ outsiders, and if so, will they obtain all the benefits enjoyed by those working under the Public Service Act? </para>

If it wishes lo employ casual labour on, say, sanitary work or the construction of roads and footpaths, it will deal with employees in the same manner as they are dealt with in other departments, such as the Post and Telegraph Department, where casual employees are engaged for a few days or a few weeks. Such men will be appointed, not by the Public Service Board, but by the commission. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think this clause goes far enough. A number of honorable senators have displayed a good deal of concern in regard to the welfare of highly paid officers who are to be permanently appointed, but such gentlemen can most effectively look after their own interests. It is time the committee gave attention to the welfare of the army of men employed in doing the actual work in connexion with the development of Canberra. Clerical members of the staff and others who are holding down good jobs are continually being catered for, but the men doing the actual hard work are as usual being ignored. </para>

Clerical work is not comparable with hard manual work, but, apparently, the men engaged in excavating the site of the provisional Parliament House, or in constructing sewers, are to be taken on and put off at the will of the commission.

If it is good that this should be done in the case of clerical workers, it is also a very excellent principle to apply to everybody. I remember the time when a man would be ridiculed if he suggested that a worker should have a holiday on full pay. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government wish to vest in the  chairman  of the commission all the powers of a departmental head in the Commonwealth Public Service, which presupposes that officers working under the Public Service Act will be employed by the commission. TheMinister(Senator Pearce), however, has also admitted that the  chairman  of the commission will have power to employ temporary officers. I want to be on safe ground. If there are to be at the Federal Capital good positions carrying good salaries they should be made available for the permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is anything in the bill to prevent the  chairman  of the commission from employing his own friends for a period of three years. He could say to his brother commissioners, &#34;There is no certainty about the continuance of this commission. There is a whisper abroad that our period is for three years only. We, therefore, would not be justified in taking from the Commonwealth Public Service men who are now well placed when we know that there are suitable men outside the service who would give satisfaction to us and would be glad to fill all the vacant positions.&#34; I do not want the commission to have that power. It is true, as the Minister has said, that the outside labour is working under arbitration awards or wages boards decisions, and is, in a measure, protected. But there is no protection afforded to the officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. There is nothing to prevent the commission from employing temporary officers for three years to fill all the posts available. Any one who wishes to enter the service of the commission on a permanent basis must pass the examinations required by the Public Service Board; but no such examination is required in the case of a temporary officer, and no one ran tell me that the provisions of acts of Parliament are rigidly observed. During the period of the war, and immediately afterwards, it was found necessary to employ a good deal of temporary assistance in the different Commonwealth departments, but when our men returned from overseas an agitation, for which there was every justification, started, and the claim was made that whatever casual work was available in the different departments should be given to returned soldiers. Accordingly, an instruction was issued to the departmental heads that all temporary hands other than men who had been overseas and had taken part in the world war should be dismissed and their places filled by returned soldiers. I am correctly informed that this instruction was not rigidly carried into effect, and that temporary hands who had not been on active service were kept in employment while returned soldiers remained out of work. The same thing may be done at Canberra. If the Minister can satisfy me that the commissioner will not have the power to employ officers from the ranks of those who are not in the Public Service, I shall not strongly oppose the provision. It would be a dangerous power to place in the hands of any one man, especially when positions carrying high salaries are frequently being filled. The  chairman  may think that some one outside the service would perform the duties as satisfactorily as a man who is already in the service. When positions are being filled those who are in the service of the Commonwealth should be chosen, because in the service there are highly qualified and efficient officers. </para>

                <para class="block">There is a vagueness about the powers which it is proposed to give the commission, and I think it ought to be rectified. It is very doubtful whether the commission will not be obliged to regard as the value of the building sites .that which is fixed by auction, and will not be able to adjust these values until the termination of the first period of appraisement. In the local government areas throughout the Commonwealth, so far as I am acquainted with them, it is provided that the local autherities shall value the land for taxation purposes at periods of approximately three years. In New South Wales a ValuerGeneral was appointed and, adopting a uniform method, he has valued large areas in that state, very much to the annoyance of some ratepayers who for a number &#39; of years were allowed to escape with a nominal valuation. I do not for a moment contend that the ValuerGeneral in New South Wales is free from all blame. I daresay he has made mistakes, but I submit that, notwithstanding any such mistakes, he is likely to ascertain the true value of the land and to act in a fearless manner. I think it is altogether wrong that people who are directly concerned should have the right to appoint the valuator. One so appointed would be liable to hesitate to increase values when the ratepayers had the right to discharge him. They have not the right to&#39; discharge the Valuer-General, although, as part of the compact entered into between the different anti-labour forces, it is now proposed to circumscribe his powers in certain directions. No provision has been made for the appointment of a Valuer-General at Canberra, and there does not appear to .me to be any  provision for the valuation of those lands for rating purposes at the existing value. Let us assume that some of those building sites are leased at  a  capital value of  &#163;400  at the auction sale of leases to be held on  1st  October next. It appears to me that the values then fixed will have to be accepted by the commission, and on those values the rate will nave to be levied for the full period of  20  years. I referred some time ago to what took place near Coolangatta, in Queensland. I showed conclusively that land sold on the leasehold principle only two years ago had increased in value so rapidly that, when submitted to auction recently the advance was at least  400  per cent. Now the Coolangatta&#39; shire is able, under the Act, to levy its local rates on- the values so ascertained. It is, I believe, empowered by the Act to value these blocks every three years. It is not definitely stated  that the commission will have- the right to value the land at Can- &#39; berra within  a&#39;  specified time. The rent, and the local rate which the commission  will  have the right to levy, will be expended largely at Canberra. The surplus  may  have to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue, but that is not n matter of. very great importance. What concerns me is that, in all probability, the rateable value of these building sites will substantially increase in a limited number of years. . They may decrease in value, but that is not likely. The commission will not have the option to levy on any value other than that fixed  at  the auction sale. I find, on looking through the provisions of sub-section  2  of -section  3  of Ordinance No.  3  of  1911,  that the following paragraph appears -  . The unimproved capital value of Crown lands held under a louse under which there is no right of conversion to a freehold, or under licence from the Crown, under the laws in force in a territory relating to the occupation and use of Crown lands, is a sum equal to 20 times the yearly amount of the rent payable to the Crown under the lease or licence at the time when the assessment is made. </para>
                <para class="block">That conveys to my mind, and I think correctly, that the commission will have  no  right  to  value the land up to its valuation at the time of assessment, and that  it  will be obliged to accept the value placed on building sites at the time  of  their disposal. If  bo,  the principle is altogether wrong. The lessees, whoever they are, should pay local rates in accordance, not with the value ascertained at the auction sale, bat with that ascertained, say, at three years&#39; periods. It is fairly difficult to keep in touch with the provisions of the ordinances and the regulations that have already been issued for the control of Canberra, and, therefore, it would be wise to include in the clause the words &#34; notwithstanding the provisions of any ordinance or regulation.&#34; If that is agreed to, it may be possible at a later stage to amend any conflicting ordinances or regulations so &#39;as to make it dear- that the commission shall have the right, and shall be obliged when it makes an assessment, to assess the land at the then value. As far as I know, it is. the universal practice of local or other autherities throughout the Commonwealth to value -land about every three years. Notwithstanding that we have decided to re-appraise at the end of  20  years for rental purposes&#39;,  I contend that fo? local purposes the commission should  be  clothed with this power. Under the clause as it now stands, it is quite possible that the value of some of the blocks leased at the first sale may be very much under the price brought  by  the other blocks leased at a later date. It would  be  very unfair if the lessees at the later auction sale were required to pay in local rates perhaps two or three times more than the first lessees. </para>

                        <para>- There was no objection on the part- of honorable members supporting the Government to clothing the commission with extensive powers in other directions,, but apparently the Government is not prepared, to do so with regard to education. There are now two schools in the Federal Capital area, and their accommodation will soon be taxed to its utmost There  i3  no particular reason why was should not,, at this, stage, make provision for the commission to take over control of education. I am not conversant with the details of the present arrangement, but I am under the impression that the Commonwealth paid for the erection of the schools. </para>

                        <para>. -  If the proposed new paragraph be not added, it does not follow that the. Commonwealth, will not have full power to legislate in respect <inline font-style="italic">o$</inline> education. The Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate in respect of any matter affecting  the Federal Territory. The amendment will&#39; not add to that power. I am not quite sure that, when- the time arrives, Parliament will approve of education being under the control of the commission. I think it probable that Parliament will legislate directly in regard to education in the Territory. It is not wise at this juncture, when there are only two or three small schools in the Federal Capital area, to place education under the control of the commission. Certainly there is not sufficient population to warrant legislation for secondary and technical education. In the circumstances,, I ask Sena-tor Grant to withdraw his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  It appears to me that the amendment is not only unnecessary, but also inadvisable. I think that when the&#39; time comes for the Commonwealth Parliament to- legislate in regard to education at Canberra, it will, do so in a general bill governing all Commonwealth Territories. It is-- inadvisable- at. this- juncture to place education) under- a commission already somewhat- overburdened with regard to the diversity of subjects for which it will be responsible. Although I have said that the commission is somewhat overloaded, as soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s-</inline> amendment is disposed of I intend, to call the Minister&#39;s attention to an omission in another direction, and will seek to place another duty upon the commission. </para>

Any one who has visited the Territory and noticed how widely the residential areas are scattered&#39; must recognize the necessity of a motor transport service. The commission may decide to negotiate with private firms or to conduct its own motor service. </para>

                        <para>- It is so broad that I think the clause would be better without the word &#34;municipal.&#34; I was rather in sympathy with the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> which seems to me to bo desirable, and I trust that I shall not be informed -that what I desire is covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">k,</inline> because, if all these powers are included in that paragraph, I do not see why the other paragraphs should stand. It seems to me that the regulations which can be made are governed by this clause, and that any regulation made outside this clause would be liable to be considered <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the act. .As is usual, the clause dealing with regulations provides that any regulations may be made &#34; not &#34; inconsistent with this act. It appears to m.c that, in the words of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, there are &#34; too many injurious differentiations&#34; in this clause. The commission should not neglect this most important feature of governmental activity. </para>

                <para class="block">In many of the older cities of the world such as Glasgow and Belfast, and other out-of-date places run :by conservatives, a practice has grown up which is approved even by a limited number of people in Australia. One would hare thought that when the Glasgow tramway services were taken over by the municipality some years ago, the council would have run them at the lowest possible cost to the users, but &#39; nothing of the kind occurred. It is true that the fares were substantially reduced, and that the .conditions of employment and the wages of the employees were improved, but the fares charged are still so high that a considerable amount of profit is made each year, which means that the  user3  of the tramways not only find all .the money required to pay all charges in connexion with the tramway service, &#39;but also pay an annual contribution to the relief of the property owners of the city. The same objectionable system has been in operation in Belfast .and also various cities in Great Britain for many years, and it has made its appearance to some extent in Australia. Until Richard Denis .Meagher became mayor of Sydney, and with the aid of labour councillors imposed taxation on unimproved values, it was the practice of the .municipality to levy rates upon the rental value of property. </para>

                        <para>- I shall connect my remarks with the paragraph. Largely owing to the agitation of Alexander Gordon Huie, secretary of the Single Tax League, and another organization, the offshoot of that body, the system of rating on la-nd values was adopted in Sydney, but since then, unfortunately, the Labour party in the Sydney Council has lost its majority, and the old .conservative aldermen have decided to divert some of the profits derived from the sale of electricity to the relief of the city laud-owners. This, to my mind, is an entirely objectionable method of adding to the municipal revenue. Unless we provide that services which may be conducted by the commission at Canberra shall be run for use and not for profit we shall find out presently that instead of the fare charged being just sufficient to pay the expenses of the tramway services, it will be high enough to allow of a substantial profit being paid into the revenue of the city, just as is now being done in Sydney from the sale of electricity. One would have thought that with land values in Sydney as high as ?44,000,000, a sufficient revenue would be secured from the rates: but, following the practice adopted by many cities of Europe, the users of electricity are compelled to pay, riot only sufficient to meet all expenses in connexion with the proper conduct of the supply of light and power, but also a substantial profit for the relief of the city land-owners. I take it that when an intelligent Labour party gets control again in Sydney it will make a refund from the general revenue to the users of current, but in order to prevent what has been done elsewhere from being done at Canberra, we should amend the clause in the direction I have indicated . There is a widespread opinion that rating at Canberra should be on the unimproved values of land, in accordance with the principles laid down by Henry George.. </para>

                    <para>. - There  is  &#39;very amuck to be said in favour of the amendment. &#39;The Melbourne tramway service  is  fairly up-to-date, but people are .called upon &#39;to pay extra fares on holidays or Sundays, when they may be disposed to enjoy themselves and <inline font-style="italic">get</inline> .a little fresh air. Public services should be run for use and mot for profit. If -we did .nob carry out ,that principle  in  connexion with .our public department, little or no progress would be &#187;ade  in  many parts .of the Commonwealth. The community at largo pay* .the large sums of money spent on the construction of new roads. Many services for which considerable .suras of money .are expended by Parliament are not .expected to pay expenses for .some years. Parliament does not ask itself whether a service to &#39;be provided is &#39;likely to -show an immediate profit. Why should not Canberra .&#39;be a model city? Why .should we not be the first to lay down &#34;the principle that -as the land in the Territory is community owned, public services in the Territory should fee run in the interests of the .community in &#39;general, and the fares charged should be less than those charged  in  -any other part of .the -world? No  &#60;9m.e  asks that the services should bp absolutely hee. but it is not a new proposal bo make railway and, incidentally, tramway travelling free. I remember reading, .in my youthful days, a most interesting pamphlet published in Great Britain by a body called &#34; The Free Travel League.&#34; The members of that league were .composed &#39;-of scholarly, cultured gentlemen, whose one idea was that the health of the people was paramount, and whose object was .to buy up all the privately-owned railways im Great Britain and to run them absolutely free to the community. Some .honorable senators may regard this .as an impossible proposal. Nothing .nowadays is impossible if we set .about it in the right way. What objection can the Minister have to providing that these services shall be run, not for profit, but in the interests  of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> residents of the Territory ? It is not desired that they should be run at a loss, but we consider that the commission should not have the power  to do  what the management of (She Melbourne tramway system does - change extra,  fares on  holidays and Sundays. The &#39;fares that are charged  in  Melbourne .enable the Tram ways Board to -show fairly bag surpluses. We ..ought -not to concern ourselves with&#39; surpluses, although &#39;this Government seems to -be a. &#34; whale &#34; on them, and  Acts as  though  it  considers that big surpluses are  an  indication  of  good government. </para>

                        <para>-  A &#34;big surplus  is  as bad as a !big deficit. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator FINDLEY.</inline> - I think so, too. For that reason, I do mot want the commissioners to be able to show big surpluses  at  the expense of the community. I hope that the committee will  .see  the wisdom of protecting the future residents of the Territory against excess fares and freights. That can be done by voting  for  the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator REID</inline> (Queensland) &#91;5..3S&#93;.- I  am (Surprised  that  an  amendment Od .this nature should be moved and supported by honorable senators opposite. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Grant</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has .used a .convincing argument. It lias been proved conclusively that the profits derived from ma.unici.pal ventures  in  different pants  ,of  the world have been devoted to the making  of all  kinds of improvements which .otherwise would not have been undertaken. Sometimes that  is  the best rand moat reasonable way  of  providing a municipality with revenue  to  carry out such work. I  do  not expect  that the commission, will make handsome profits, but I do believe that any profit that may be made will be devoted to the improvement of the Territory. &#34;Why prevent the commission from making any profit? Many services are made exceedingly cheap to the community because the profits derived from them are utilized in conferring other benefits on the people in improving the streets, in planting trees, and in making better footpaths. Canberra, it is hoped, will be a model city; yet honorable senators opposite expect those who will be charged with its administration to run these services merely at cost price. It cannot be done. This commission will be different from the Tramways Board in Melbourne, or the Railways Commissioners in Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- The only alternative is to tax the people. A service may be rendered too cheaply. Full value may be given, even though profits are made, because those profits are utilized in conferring other benefits upon the people. In <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> climate like Canberra, to what better use could a surplus from a service be put than in subsidizing bands to entertain the people in the public parks? To. restrict the powers of the board and prevent it from making profits would be a. most conservative, retrograde step. Honorable senators opposite call themselves socialists. They do not know the meaning of municipal socialism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> referred to Glasgow as being out of date. No city has done more than Glasgow in effecting improvements for the benefit of its people, and those improvements have been made possible by the profits derived from its public services.  The trams are in the hands of the people, and one may ride long distances for a halfpenny. Workmen&#39;s tickets are available during certain hours. The improvements which the municipality has been able to carry out because of the profits that have accrued from its undertakings are too numerous to mention. Had that municipality been restricted,- it would have been necessary to increase the rates to provide revenue with which to carry out improvements. Therefore, the profits made did not impose any hardship on the users of the trams, but, on the contrary, they conferred a great benefit upon the city. I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> should support this amendment. </para>

It embodies many fine principles, but I am very much afraid that it . would not give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> what he desires. He is under the impression that, on a holiday, passengers using the services at Canberra will have to pay an extra charge. To arrive at his ideal he should amend subclause <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> in such a way as to limit the charges which the commission can make for any service. There would then be no chance of extra expense being passed on. Mention has been made of other cities, such as Glasgow. I worked in Glasgow when it was necessary to pay  1 1/2 d.  to travel 2 miles on a horse tram. At that time the tramways were run by a private company. The municipality of Glasgow bought out the company and built electric trams. Within twelve months passengers were, able to travel 2 .miles for  1/2 d. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. As a matter of fact, it cost &#163;165,000 to buy out the private company. That sum was paid in twelve months, and the whole of the profits went to what in Glasgow is known as the &#34; common good.&#34; The passenger was not asked to pay more because the employees received a little higher wages than were given them by the private company. We have been a long time waking up to the fact that the Postal Department and other departments . are being run for profit, and, sometimes,  not for &#39;use. It  i3  necessary to pay a greater sum to send a telegram after 8 o&#39;clock at night than at five .minutes to 8, because the employees are paid  a higher rate for working after that hour. In every service of the Commonwealth and the states, when the employees are given better conditions or higher wages, the increased cost is passed on to the public. The. cost of the services at Canberra ought not to b.e passed on, and, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> wishes to prevent this, he should insert his amendment not in the way suggested, but after the word &#34; charges.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Who is to pay for the wear and tear? Why does not the honorable senator talk sense rather than howl :md whine like a child in his endeavour t&#62; waste the time of the committee? I deplore his arguments. He knows perfectly well that a sinking fund must be provided for depreciation of services. For days both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> have been acting childishly. It is a waste of time and public money. </para>

                    <para>. -  I agree with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox.</inline> There is nothing very serious in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> mind when he makes the suggestion that services should be run for use and not for profit. I listened with a great deal of interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid&#39;s</inline> remarks .and appreciated his glowing picture of future band performances at Canberra. When at Canberra F hope that I shall have the pleasure of hearing such a band, but I do not think that there will be the profits that he hoped for to provide funds for this purpose. I am quite certain that there will be no profits from the services in that city. As a rule sufficient rates are levied to cover expenditure on such services, and that will be the objective of the commission at Canberra. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> need not worry about his amendment, since its inclusion would not improve the clause. He will find that in actual practice in years to come there will be no profit from these services, and that the revenue will be sufficient to cover the expenditure. I shall oppose the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad indeed that we have had small contributions to this debate by Senator-General Cox and Senator-General Thompson. It is to be regretted that both these gentlemen gave such exhibitions of mental obtuseness, that they conveyed in the clearest possible manner their complete ignorance of the subject they attempted to discuss. I have no objection to either of them making personal remarks about honorable senators on this side, but when we make similar remarks about them  I  hope that they will receive them in the spirit displayed by us. </para>

                        <para>- It is a matter of personal opinion. An adequate transport service at Canberra will be of first importance to the people who ultimately reside there. I attempted in a few words, and in the clearest manner possible, to illustrate what I meant by referring to happenings which, to my &#34;certain knowledge, took place in Glasgow and Belfast, and in the city of Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> suggested that the people who use the tramway or any other service that is provided by the commission at Canberra should pay sufficient not only to cover the cost of its establishment and operation, but to provide for other services. That is what was done for many years in the cities of Glasgow and Belfast. The people who should have paid the rates passed them on to the people who used the tramway services. I do not argue that these services are not well conducted, but  I  do say that the fares charged on them could be a great deal cheaper, and that certain circumlocutory  methods of imposing taxation to make tramway users pay for the provision of music in public parks should be discontinued. The expense should be met by those who patronize the bands. Coming nearer home, is it not ridiculous that in Sydney, the land values of which amount to &#163;44,000,000, the people who use electric current generated by the city council are required to pay more than the cost? </para>

                        <para>- I said so in the clearest and most unmistakable manner, but evidently the honorable senator was not paying very much attention to me. I am not in favour of conducting these services for profit. Last year the Sydney City Council, in supplying electricity, made  a  profit of&#163;75,000. Why should that sum, or any portion of it be used to reduce the rates payable  by  the landlords of Sydney? It is  a  direct contribution to them from the users  of  electricity in Sydney.. I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Redd</inline> advocating the adoption of asimilar procedure  at  Canberra, as it is his business to do so, but I wish  to  prevent it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator fully understands the position. The land-owners of Sydney can easily afford to pay the local rate imposed. People using municipal services should be charged only sufficient to make ends meet. I am not against  making  a nominal profit but the local authorities should not be permitted to charge high rates so as to exempt land-owners from taxation. The principle is entirely wrong. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know, and probably, with the exception of the officials concerned, very few other persons know how many ordinances and regulations have already been passed in connexion with the Federal Capital. At all events they are sufficiently numerous to make it exceedingly difficult for one to ascertain the alterations that have been made from time to time. Of late they have been making their appearance with a fair degree of regularity and at an increasing rate. If this goes on much longer it will be almost impossible for honorable senators to keep in touch with all that is being done at the Capital city. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should give an undertaking that the ordinances and regulations be brought up to date and consolidated. The same course might be followed in connexion with the ordinances and regulations dealing with New Guinea, the Northern Territory, Papua, and other Territories. I have taken the trouble to compile a complete list for my own purposes. I believe it is the only one in existence. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not prepared off-hand to give an undertaking of such a sweeping character. All these regulations have been tabulated, and a very complete index of them has also been prepared. If honorable senators will look at the shelves at each end of the chamber, they will see the volumes containing the statutory rules and regulations, and will find, also, that the index gives a complete reference to all the amendments that have been made. This arrangement is, in effect, the same as a consolidation of the regulations. Obviously there would not be much advantage in consolidating the regulations now, because within six months there would be a further list, and we should have to consolidate again. If the present practice is continued, honorable senators, and any others interested, will be able to keep in touch with them. I may add that no State Government keeps, in this way, such a complete record of its regulations. </para>

                <para class="block">I have said that those answers arc, in my opinion, evasive. I wish to repeat the charge. I asked plainly enough: &#34;What was the delivered cost to the Federal Government?&#34; There is- no answer to that question. Whoever supplied the answers - the management of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, I presume - stated that the &#34;estimated&#34; cost was &#163;821,000. I did not want to know the estimated cost. I asked for the actual cost. If this cost is not shown on the books, it should be. Then, again, I asked: &#34;Was this cost above or below departmental estimates?&#34; In reply I was told that &#34; after making necessary allowance for market advances in material values, advance of wages, reduction of working week from 48 hours to 44 hours, &#38;c, the cost is below the departmental estimate.&#34; What are those allowances ? The answer on this point is absolutely nebulous and is of no use at all. The only conclusion I can gather from the replies furnished to me is that the ship, a vessel of 12,800 tons, cost &#163;85S,500, plus the little item of &#163;8,500, caused by industrial troubles. Of course, that is enough for my purpose, but it is not enough to satisfy the just demands of members of Parliament when asking to be supplied with accurate information on any subject on which they require information.

                <para class="block">I asked these questions because they deal with a very important matter, namely, whether this country is justified in paying about three times as much for ship construction in Australia as would be paid for vessels built in Great Britain. I wish to get at the cost of the vessels in order to ascertain whether the Government is justified in so doing, and I refuse to be hampered in this way by any board. As a matter of fact, the answers have materially influenced me in questioning the wisdom of creating so many of these boards, and placing so much power in&#39; their hands. I accepted the answer to the first question . with the humility which, after all, perhaps a mere senator should exhibit towards such a potent, puissant body as the Commonwealth Shipping Board ; but when I asked the second question, and was informed that the board did not think it desirable to reveal to its competitors the cost at which the ships stand on its books, that humility reached breaking point. I had to revolt. I strongly object to the Shipping Board placing information of the character quoted in the hands of the Minister, and to the Minister, passing it on to honorable senators. I do not think it fair. I dare say it was somewhat  presumptuous  to ask these questions; but I have always been accustomed to having fair questions answered correctly and clearly. The apparent inference that the Commonwealth Shipping Board does not think it advisable to make known to the competitors of the line the figure at which the individual ships stand on its books is unreasonable. Am I a competitor? Are other honorable senators competitors of the line? Has not Parliament, which created the board, the right to know what it is doing? If we have not, it is time we secured that right. I strongly object to the methods adopted by the board in this respect. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Approximately &#163;600,000 has been written off each ship. I do not know if that amount is correct, but I was so informed by a gentleman who should know. If my information is incorrect the Minister can contradict me; if it is correct, it is clear that the business of the board is not being conducted on proper principles.We should not expend &#163;858,000 on a vessel and hand it over to the board at &#163;260,000. It is not fair. It is ridiculous. From what I know of government control of state industries, the competitors of the Commonwealth Shipping Line probably know more about its operations than perhaps do members of Parliament. If I have spoken with a little heat on this subject, I hope, sir, you will pardon me, and I trust that the Minister will realize I am only doing so because I think I am being denied by the Commonwealth Shipping Board, not by the Minister, information to which I and other honorable senators are entitled. I trust it will not occur again. It is my intention to again give notice of these questions on the next day of sitting. </para>

                        <para>. -  I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> in the complaint he has made concerning the manner in which questions are answered in the Senate. My complaint is of long standing, as for a considerable time the Government have failed to treat questions asked by honorable senators with the respect to which they are entitled. Early in the session last year I submitted a question - I was anxious to inform my own mind - as to the manner in which bank notes were issued to the private banks. I endeavoured on two occasions to obtain the information, but with as little success in the last instance as I had in the first. There is nothing in the questions submitted by honorable senators which cannot be answered by a Minister, but if there is a reason why the information should not be disclosed it should be given. The latest evasive answer I received was from the Acting Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford),</inline> when I asked if the Government had calculated the cost of the letter-boxes - which have now to be supplied by householders - to the whole of the people of Australia. The Acting Postmaster-General did not give the information sought, but stated that suitable boxes were obtainable from a certain firm at1s. 6d. each. I wished to know if the Government had calculated the cost of these boxes to the community, and the saving to the department by their introduction. I am joining in the complaint - I hold the Minister responsible - submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> and repeat that when information on public questions is sought honorable senators are entitled to a straightforward reply, or failing that, a reason why an answer is not forthcoming. </para>
