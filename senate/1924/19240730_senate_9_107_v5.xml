I shall give it in definite terms. The Labour party, whether in power or in opposition, in this Parliament, or in any State Parliament, has always aimed at assisting the farmers and the men on the land generally. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that during the trying times of 1911-12, when Western Australia was passing through a period of drought, the Labour Government that was then in power did everything that it could do to alleviate the distress of the people in the country. Numerous water trains were sent to every dry part of the state. </para>

                        <para>- I am not afraid of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Lynch&#39;s threats. I submit that this amendment is proposed for the purpose of assisting the men ou the land by the establishment of a rural credits system, and I suggest, sir, that by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that, in replying to the strictures on Labour made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I am not discussing the matter before the Chair. I remind that honorable senator also that the Industries Assistance Board of Western Australia does a work which may well be compared with that which would fall to the lot of an administrative body in charge of a rural credits system. The object of the amendment is -to enable the Commonwealth Bank to assist farmers. Honorable senators opposite have contended that the Commonwealth Bank already has the power to do so. It was chiefly because such help was not forthcoming that the Western Australian Labour Government came to the assistance of the men on the land through the instrumentality of the Industries Assistance Board. But there is another reason why the amendment should be accepted. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> as Leader of the Country party, stumped Australia during the election campaign of 1922 and promised that a rural credits system on the lines proposed in the amendment should be provided. Why, then, should provision for it not be made in this bill? </para>

I said during the election campaign that the provision of a rural credits system was part of the policy of the Labour party, and I desire to provide it through the Commonwealth Bank. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page and those who follow him do not desire to fulfil their election promises, I- assure them that I desire to fulfil mine.

                <para class="block">Despite all the praise lavished upon the founders of the Commonwealth Bank and those who have been in control since its inception, the bank has steadfastly refused to establish a homes building department. &#39;The Commonwealth Bank, through its savings bank branches, has collected approximately &#163;40,000,000, not one penny of which has been used for the purpose of erecting homes. To-day, and for a long time past, the erection of suitable homes for the people of this country is and has been a question of great importance. The scarcity of dwellings is apparent, not only in the Commonwealth, but throughout the world, and our present position is probably due in a large measure to the fact that during the great war home-builders and others were engaged on other work. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say that I do. It does not concern me in the least if the Bank of New South Wales, the Commerical Bank, or the Union Bank is not undertaking this work; but it is the practice of the savings banks to transact this class of business. The state savings bank of New South Wales has, I understand, a homes building department, towards the funds of which a certain sum is voted every year exclusively . for the purpose of homes construction. That would be a legitimate field for the investment of the money received from small depositors. The Commonwealth Bank has established at almost every post office throughout Australia a savings bank branch for the receipt of deposits, mainly from small depositors. Not one penny of the amount so received has been utilized in the erection of homes. </para>

                        <para>- The state savings banks, the much despised private enterprise concerns, the War Service Homes Department, and a number of other organizations, have from time to time interested themselves in the question of home building, but despite all their efforts they have so far failed to cope with the growing demand for housing accommodation. I think I am quite safe in saying that houses were never so scarce as they are to-day; that notwithstanding the operation of a Fair Rents Court in some of the states, and various other devices that from time to time have been employed, rents were never higher, and over-crowding never more prevalent than is the case to-day. Yet we find that the national bank, which ought to be the bank of the people, is doing absolutely nothing towards the erection of homes. That is not the only direction in which the bank could very advantageously invest at least a few of the millions that are at its disposal. It must be remembered that the bank collects, not one or two, but many millions of pounds from the people. Nothing would assist more to promote the health of the people than the provision of well-constructed homes. Individual effort in thousands of cases is not possible. That has been recognized even by this Parliament, to the extent that it has approved of the erection of war service homes. It was realized that the returned men frequently could not be expected to provide homes for themselves, and this Parliament came to their assistance by establishing a. War Service Homes Commission, which up to date has erected in the Commonwealth about 25,000 new houses. That number, however, is inconsiderable compared with the demand that exists. I may be told that this work is not properly a .function of the Commonwealth Bank. That is a matter of opinion. I do not disguise my belief that there is not a very keen desire exhibited by Ministerial supporters to increase the usefulness or enhance the popularity of the Commonwealth Bank. I believe that many honorable senators opposite would experience pleasure if the Commonwealth Bank were a thing of the past, and the whole of the financial undertakings were handled by the fifteen private banks that now operate in Australia. The Commonwealth Bank should transact trading business, and, through its savings bank branch, engage in home building and any other work that is conducted by a private or a state bank. The time is opportune to test the feeling of the committee as to the desirability of directing the management of the Commonwealth Bank to devote a certain portion of the funds in the savings bank branch to the erection of new homes. T am quite satisfied that unless the directors are instructed to proceed along those lines such action will not be taken by them. I do not join with those who are never tired of praising the work of the Commonwealth Bank. I believe that that bank has been systematically and persistently crucified, and I shall welcome the advent of a government which will so amend the act that the bank will be placed in the position that it should occupy. </para>

If its funds are used in such a way that speculators will be enabled to make food supplies more costly, the bank will fail to achieve the object at which its founders aimed. The directors should be given a clear intimation that to retain their positions they must establish and conduct a home-building department. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the committee will not accept the amendment. If it is the considered view of Parliament that the Commonwealth Bank should commence to&#62; operate as a home-building bank, I suggest that well considered legislation is essential. That legislation could not be confined to a simple paragraph. In the State of Western Australia there is &#38; Workers&#39; Homes Department working under a Workers&#39; Home Act. That act is quite an extensive piece of legislation. It provides the manner in which applications must be made, and the order in. which they shall be dealt with ; it sets up the authorities for dealing with applications, and provides all the complicated machinery necessary for the department to carry out its functions. One has only to consider what is involved in making such a scheme effective to realize that a well considered piece of legislative machinery must be passed to deal with :t. Honorable senators opposite are always foremost in denouncing government by regulation. If the amendment were passed the whole scheme would have to be carried out by regulation. Every principle would have to be laid down by regulation. There is none in this amendment at all. It is merely a placard. I can imagine the righteous indignation of honorable senators opposite if the Government had brought in such an amendment, and had proposed that all the machinery to give effect to it should be  provided for by regulation. I may point . out, moreover, that practically every : state has legislated in regard to this matter. The housing of the people is primarily the duty of the state legislatures. The Government has already indicated that it proposes to utilize the funds in the savings banks for the establishment of rural credits, but that it will be necessary, first of all, to set up well-considered legislative machinery to provide for the amount of money to be made available, and the way in which it may be used. The amendment is premature, ill considered, and provides no machinery by which effect may be given to it. Therefore, I advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> to withdraw it. If he declines to do so, I shall certainly ask the committee to reject it. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will not withdraw the amendment. I hope, also, that honorable senators opposite who think with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> and others in this chamber, on the subject will not be influenced by the remarks of the Minister. One reason advanced by him why the amendment should be rejected was that the states were practically doing the work which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> desires the Commonwealth Bank to undertake. If that is a good reason why honorable senators should vote against the amendment it may also be urged as a good reason why no assistance at all should be given by the Commonwealth Bank to the man on the land. Notwithstanding that state governments are doing a good deal in this direction already, they are not doing as much as the people would like them to do. In Victoria the state savings bank cannot meet the demands of the people. As honorable senators are well aware there is an acute shortage of houses in all the states, and to me there is no subject of greater importance to the people than the housing question. If there is shortage of houses, if the people are overcrowded, we cannot have a contented or healthy community. Overcrowding of the worst description is taking place in the different capital cities of the Commonwealth. There are, we are .reliably informed, many cases where two or three families are living in a five roomed house, and we have heard, too, of families being housed in one or .two rooms. We know what that means. Is it any  wonder that there is sickness ? The Minister has said that we want well considered legislation to give effect to this amendment. I disagree with him. So far as I am aware, no special legislation was necessary to enable the Commonwealth Bank to engage in the work of building homes for returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- Assuming the Minister&#39;s statement to be correct - I was not in the Senate when the bill was passed - the fact that the legislative machinery is available should make it comparatively easy for the Commonwealth Bank to undertake the kind of business referred to in the amendment. Certain members of this Parliament look upon the Commonwealth Bank as an institution which should mainly concern itself with the financial position generally of Australia, and the position of the associated banks. That is a matter of great importance, I admit, but the housing question overshadows everything. Governments all over the world are making efforts to overcome this shortage. If we carried this amendment it would be an instruction to those entrusted with the management of the bank that the business of housing the people should be gone on with by the bank not in  a  small way, but in  a  very extensive way. We know what mass production means. We have had evidence recently in South Australia of how economies may be effected by mass production. The Labour candidates knew, anterior to the elections in South Australia, how the people were handicapped by -this housing difficulty, and they promised that, if they were returned with a majority, and were entrusted with the reins of government, they would tackle it in a businesslike way. The South Australian Labour Government has done so. Recently, tenders were accepted for 1,000 houses at  a  cost of a little over &#163;600 per house. I have been amazed at the illustrations of the houses, the dimensions of the rooms, and the class of building to be erected for the money. </para>

                        <para>- I am not, for the moment, concerned about whether the work is to be done by day labour or contract. I am pointing out the advantages of mass production in house building, and suggesting that it should be considered in connexion with this amendment. Suppose we decided that the Commonwealth Bank should be empowered to proceed at once with a housing scheme, and to deal with it in a practical businesslike way. If it called for tenders on lines similar to those adopted in South Australia, and if the people were assured that it was the intention of the Commonwealth Bank to go in for mass production which would provide houses at a little over  &#163;600  each, as against the present cost of  &#163;1,000,  what a splendid advertisement it would be for the Bruce-Page combination f The people would thoroughly appreciate any effort made in this direction. The housing problem is a people&#39;s matter, and in no circumstances should it be made a party question. We ask those who are interested in the welfare of the people and who are concerned about their health, to aid us in inducing the Government to do something in the direction outlined in the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I approve of the amendment. Honorable senators seem to lose sight of the fact that we are dealing now with a principle and not with details. When the Commonwealth Bank was established, it was intended to set up an institution that would look after the interests of the working classes of Australia and in which they would have every confidence. The Commonwealth Bank has been successful in providing splendid homes for- returned soldiers, and if its operations were extended to enable it to provide homes for the people generally, it would give the people further confidence in it. The people cannot have the same confidence in private banks. We all know that the exchange difficulty has brought about such a condition of affairs that he who runs may read the signs. These institutions which admit having amassed huge sums of money, are now asking the Commonwealth Government to come to their assistance in a great financial crisis. When we see these things happening it is our duty to make the Commonwealth Bank a model of stability upon which the poorer classes can rely when they seek to borrow money for the purpose of building homes. Theglorious work done by the bank in building homes for the soldiers is a monument to the ability of the men who carried out the work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> tells us that we must leave this matter to some other form of legislation, but I contend that ii is our duty to tell the proposed board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank to. do certain things and try to make good. Of course if they do not make good they can be shifted and some one else can be told to carry - ou the work. If this amendment is carried it will give the board an opportunity to make good in one direction. If the Commonwealth Bank makes good in the direction of building homes for the people it will be a monument to this Parliament for all time. I am afraid that, because of- the proposed legislation, the people are beginning to lose a certain amount of confidence in the bank. However, when this bill is passed I hope that something will be done to give the people. some idea of the stability of this great concern. Its creators intended that it should be a people&#39;s bank, and it will only succeed in becoming a people&#39;s bank by following on the lines indicated in the amendment. </para>

                    <para>, - The object sought by the amendment is praiseworthy, but the same cannot be said of the means <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has taken to accomplish it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has rightly said that the housing problem is essentially a non-party question, but when he was making that wise utterance I was rather wishful  that he would address himself to his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> who went out of his way Jo say that Ministers and honorable senators on the other side were rather stony-hearted in regard to a proposition of this kind. There is no need to apply such a remark to any honorable senator. Quite apart from political aspects, governments elsewhere have embarked on this great reform with marked success. New Zealand has done so. The Imperial Government did so 25 years ago. Various Australian governments, without regard to political affinities, have gone in for some instalment of the reform. But, while we all acknowledge that it is a problem that has to be tackled, we have all to ask ourselves what  is the best way to tackle it. . If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> succeeds in persuading the committee that the best way to do it is by overloading the Commonwealth Bank - and it will be overloaded, even if- it is confined exclusively to its own functions of handling the main problems affecting the finances of the country - he will defeat the end he has in view. Instead of doing something to ease the housing problem, he will only succeed in rendering the Commonwealth Bank less effective in fulfilling the purpose for which it is designed. It is clear to every honorable senator that it should be the object of both the Commonwealth and the states to cut out at every turn and opportunity the practice of duplicating activities. Efforts are now being made by state governments, in co-operation with the Commonwealth Government, to unify the collection of taxes, and to hare uniformity in the construction of roads. The avowed purpose of these efforts is to save the taxpayers&#39; money. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> proposal, however, is a fresh effort to get back to the point from which we are already making desperate efforts to get away. Instead of being successful in reducing rents, and bringing homes within the reach of those who require houses at a reasonable value, we would only succeed in increasing costs over and above what they would be if the matter were left in the hands of the state authorities who now control it. I realize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> the insufficiency of housing accommodation in Australia. In this connexion, I must sound a personal note, in order to show that honorable senators who support the Government are not so indifferent as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> suggests. I recently had occasion to discuss the housing problem with a prominent member of the present Ministry. He agreed with me that something ought to be done, but he was faced with the position to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has already referred - whether the Commonwealth would be justified in embarking on a policy which would necessarily mean wedding itself to duplication, just at a time when desperate efforts are being made to get away from a system which leads to a waste of the taxpayers&#39; money. I have not the slightest doubt as to the necessity for more <inline font-weight="bold">Senator houses</inline> in the urban areas of Australia, because, following upon the chat I had with a prominent member of the Ministry, I came in contact with the activities of the Victorian state savings bank in the direction of building houses. The Public Works Committee was informed that houses were being built by the state savings bank on a capitalized basis of something like 17s. 6d. a week, which would mean that, in 30 years, the purchasers would be the owners of their houses. The committee was informed on undoubted authority that those homes commanding a capitalized rent of 17s. 6d. a week were commanding in other instances a rental of something in the neighbourhood of 30s. a week. It is clear that in Victoria, as elsewhere, there is ample room for the adoption of a thoroughgoing policy of building houses. Of course, the evidence on the point is conflicting. For instance, I recently read  the  report  of the Fair Rents Court of New South Wales, which showed that over a long period not more than 500 applications had been dealt with. Apparently the Fair Rents Court has not succeeded to the extent its originators anticipated) that is to say, it has not succeeded in bringing houses within the reach of people who want them at a reasonable cost. However, the fact remains that in the congested urban districts of Australia, there is a margin sufficiently wide for the extension of our endeavours in the direction of seeing that more houses are provided for the people. Although the state governments have embarked upon housing policies, there is almost unlimited room for state and Commonwealth Governments to step in and meet the demand which has not yet been overtaken. In my opinion there should be a conference between the Commonwealth Government and the state governments, rather than that we should get back to the system of duplication, and then have to make a  desperate  struggle to get away from it. There should be progress in this direction. Other countries, with infinitely less resources than Australia, are embarking on housing schemes. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Sulman  the  chairman  of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, is now on the continent of Europe, and, according to a cable report, he says that Holland is spending &#163;24,000,000 in town planning. projects and housing schemes. It is true that Holland made a lot of money out of the war, in which it did not participate, hut it is quite clear that despite its necessarily more limited resources it is more active than Australia is in this branch of social reform. And this despite our professed ideals, and our desire to see them carried out. I merely rose to commend, in part, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> had said, and to say that this problem should be tackled in earnest by every citizen, so that we may rid ourselves of those shanties which now disfigure the landscape in every Australian suburb. These shanties and the lanes in which they are built are a disgrace to civilization. It is impossible to rear a wholesome healthy race in them. Even if this proposal does no more than arouse the public to a sense of our responsibility in this direction, some good will be achieved. Although I am not prepared to support the amendment, I commend it in the hope that it will advance this neglected problem by at least one stage. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> however, to keep off party lines, and follow the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who says that this is a question in which the people are interested, quite irrespective of party considerations. </para>

                    <para>. - I always listen with a good deal of attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> remarks. I understood him to say in the speech he has just delivered that although he realizes that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> proposal is good and sound, that the housing problem is forcing itself upon the consideration of even the most conservative countries, and that the ramshackle buildings which now exist must give way, in the near future, to more comfortable homes for the people, he does not propose to keep pace with the spirit of the times, because the rate of progress is too fast for him. He feels that he can commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> proposal, but cannot vote for it. I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not accept the amendment. He could have done so without interfering in any way with the bill or the functions of the bank. The bank now advances money in every capital city of the Commonwealth for the purposes of home building.  I  believe that if the people generally knew that by depositing their money in the savings bank branch of the bank they would be providing a fund which would be available for the purposes of house building, they would be much more ready to give their money to the bank than they are now. They might even do so with the hope that at a later period they would be able to obtain an advance to build a home for themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said something about the results which had followed the operations of the Fair Rents Courtin New South Wales. I assure him that that court has done an immense amount of good, but it is not powerful enough to keep rents down. Circumstances over which neither the Fair Rents Court, nor any other court, has control, have caused the increased rents in Sydney. One of the principal reasons is that during the years of the war, many builders were not engaged in their ordinary occupation, so the usual number of new houses was not built. Consequently, it has been necessary to overtake that leeway. Another cause of the housing shortage in Sydney, and, in fact, in the other capital cities of Australia, is that the legislation of this Parliamentary others is compelling the people to gravitate towards centres of population. That may not be the intention of our legislation, but it is the effect of it. I venture to say that Sydney in particular is growing at a rate which no one contemplated, and which could not possibly be kept pace with. Although Sydney is extending so rapidly, it is an unfortunate fact that the development in the rural areas of New South Wales is only going on slowly. On the one hand, very little development is noticeable in our rich agricultural and pastoral areas, and on the other, the metropolitan area is increasing by leaps and bounds. That is an inevitable result of the class of legislation that this Parliament is passing. Our factory system is being developed under such conditions that if a labourer remained in the country for long, he would need to have his brains brushed on removing to a city before he could get work there. We should make some attempt to ensure that the wages and living conditions in country districts are such that working people will not be tempted to live in the cities. The enormous growth and extraordinary development of Sydney, and other capital cities in Australia, merit the closest attention of the Commonwealth and state governments, which should be devoting much  attention to devising ways and means to house the people properly. Even if the gentlemen who are appointed to the proposed board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank were house-building enthusiasts, they would not be able, adequately, to meet the position. If a provision such as that desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is incorporated in the bill, people will be more ready to deposit their money in the bank. Even those people in the community who, during the war years, refrained from banking their money with a view to having it handy in case of need, would be willing to become customers of the bank if a home building orE. aapartment  were attached to it. I ci.___ understand why any one should desire to prevent the establishment of such a department. Almost as many honorable senators on the Government side of the Senate as on this side are favorable to the proposal, which makes the opposition to the amendment still more inexplicable. Giving effect to the views which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has in mind will not in any way overload the proposed board, for its members will take care that they do not carry one ounce more of responsibility than they  can properly discharge. The inclusion of the amendment in the bill will be taken by the board as a polite instruction from Parliament that attention must be given to the important work of building hemes. That the bank is a most efficient financial concern for financing home building was proved by our repatriation experience. Two or three years ago, when people generally were clamouring for the building of homes for returned soldiers, the bank came to the Government&#39;s assistance, and in consequence of its splendid handling of the situation, many more homes were made available than would have been the case had it withheld its help. So far as I know it assists in building homes even now.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> - It advances money on mortgage, in the ordinary way, for home building. </para>

                        <para>- Not only should it have that power, but it should also be equipped with power to build houses to meet the shortage. The carrying of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> amendment would give it the necessary extra power. Parliament in agreeing to the amendment would be saying in effect, &#34; Please take notice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Directors,</inline> that this is a polite  intimation that you must exercise all the power you have to provide homes for the people.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> told us of the large amount that is being spent in Holland for home building. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the enormous scheme which the MacDonald Government in Great Britain has under consideration. It is proposed to spend &#163;9,000,000 a year for the next 40 years to provide reasonably comfortable homes for the people in Great Britain. No one can say that the re-housing of the people is a more pressing problem here than it Is in Great Britain, but that is no reason why we should lag behind. We should step right out in front, and set an example to the world. It is of no use for honorable senators to commend the amendment, and then vote against it. If they agree with the. views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> they should vote for his amendment. I know of no more important work that the Government could engage in at present than this. We are all aware that the private banks advance money for home building. As a matter of fact, they are much more ready to lend money on mortgage to erect dwelling houses in the cities than they are to lend it for agricultural and pastoral development. That is certainly the case in New South Wales. No great difficulty is experienced in obtaining money to build a house in Sydney, but there is trouble in obtaining an advance for agricultural and pastoral purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, that is true. That condition of things is inseparable from private banking practice. When one contemplates the extraordinary growth and progress of Sydney, and the rapid advance in land values, and remembers also that the private banking institutions are operated for the benefit of their shareholders, one can scarcely complain if the directors of those institutions are more ready to advance money on the security of city property than they are on that of broad acres. I do not blame them for so doing. That is one of the harmful effects of the disastrous attacks that this Parliament is continually making upon our primary producers. I can hardly cavil at the private banks being more ready to advance money on  metropolitan  than on country securities. It is only ordinary business practice. The prevalence of that custom is all the more reason why honorable senators should support the amendment, and so practically instruct the Commonwealth Bank management to do all that is possible to expedite the building of homes for the people. </para>

                    <para>. - I entirely agree with a good deal that has been said on this subject on both sides of the committee. It is desirable that we should do all that we can to assist the people to obtain comfortable homes. I feel that there is very little difference of opinion in the Senate on that matter. The question is whether the inclusion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> amendment in the bill would bring any nearer to realization the desirable state of affairs that he has in mind. I think I can show in a few words that that would not follow. The amendment will not do all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> claims that it will, and therefore I cannot see my way clear to support it. Section 7 of the act, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> desires to amend, confers upon the bank all-embracing powers to engage in ordinary banking business, and there is no doubt whatever that it is authorized to advance&#39; money to assist people to buy their own homes. As a matter of fact, many of the bank&#39;s customers have obtained advances from it to buy their homes. The bank is doing that class of business to-day, and there is nothing whatever in this bill to prevent it from continuing to do so. I very much doubt whether the inclusion of the amendment would equip it with any larger powers in that regard than it is now exercising. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> intention is, I believe, that it shall be clothed with power to build dwelling houses on an extensive scale in order that they may be sold more cheaply than otherwise would be the case. It cannot be denied that if a comprehensive mass house-building scheme were carried out by the bank, houses would be available at less than they now cost. But I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> amendment would give the bank such power. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that it would be necessary for us to pass a comprehensive bill to enable the&#39; bank to begin house building on a comprehensive scale. It would require a comprehensive act similar to the War Service Homes Act. It was quite competent for the Commonwealth Bank, acting under the War Service Homes Act, to build a large number of homes, and this it did on the whole fairly well. It was, however, acting under a statute which gave it power and provided the necessary machinery. It would in this instance be necessary to pass a special act to enable the Commonwealth Bank to undertake mass construction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> directed attention to the difficulties which would arise in connexion with duplication, but this is an activity in regard to which it is quite possible to have a duplication of effort without loss of efficiency. The state governments, the Commonwealth Bank or the savings banks cannot advance the whole of the capital required. It is quite competent for the Government, in the legislation they contemplate introducing a little later in connexion with rural credits, if they so desire, to clothe the savings bank branch with power to take up housing on a comprehensive scale. That is a suggestion which I hope the Government will consider. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly), but I am hoping that the quantity of skilled labour in Australia will increase. The depositors&#39; money at present held by the savings bank department of the Commonwealth hank, which amounts to a very large sum, could be usefully employed in this way. I wish to again point out what is of course abundantly clear, that if the Commonwealth Bank is to be a central bank, as the Government desire, its operations should not be linked up with the business of the savings bank. It is another strong argument in favour of  entirely separating the general business of the Commonwealth Bank from the savings bank branch, and placing it under different management. That is the legitimate and right thing to do. It is obvious to any one who studies the question that if the Government is successful in converting the Commonwealth Bank into a central bank - though I am not opposed to the attempt to make the Commonwealth Bank a central bank, I am of the opinion that it will not be - it cannot use the funds of the central bank in this way, because its assets must be kept in a perfectly liquid form. Under this proposal the assets of the bank would be locked up for a long period of years, and that is one strong reason why I believe that special legislation should be introduced to do what the mover of the amendment desires. </para>

                    <para>. - It is well known that in&#39; a number of the states the housing accommodation is entirely inadequate. When in Adelaide a day or two ago I was surprised at the scarcity of houses in that city, but the Government of that state has entered into a very comprehensive scheme in order to overcome the shortage. The scarcity of material and the high price at which it is being sold is largely responsible for the present position. I am in favour of some of the schemes at present in hand for the construction of homes, and although I believe that every effort should be made to expedite building, I do not think that any advantage would be derived by adopting the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> So far as I can see, the construction of homes should not be undertaken by the Commonwealth Bank, and therefore the amendment is not justified. In Queensland the savings bank business which was formerly controlled by the state authorities is now handled by the Commonwealth Bank. &#39;There is not a great scarcity of houses in Queensland, as past administrations, as well as the present Government, have always been very generous in making money available for the erection of homes under the Workers Dwellings Act. In many respects the work undertaken by the War Service Homes Department has been creditable. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The state departments have .at their disposal the necessary plant, plans, and specifications, and efficient staffs with which to carry on. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> I do not think that a provision covering the construction of homes should be embodied in the Commonwealth Bank Bill, but that arrangements should be made for the work to be done through the savings bank branch. If a new department were established under the control of the Commonwealth Bank it would be some time before it would be in a position to efficiently carry out the work. Honorable senators are aware that under the present arrangement a purchaser of a home is allowed from 35 to 40 years in which to complete his payments, and in most instances this becomes such a burden upon the purchaser that he disposes of the property. Years ago it was customary for purchasers to complete payments within ten to fourteen years, but now owing to the increased cost of building and . the demand for a better type of dwelling they require 35 to 40 years if the weekly contributions are at all reasonable. </para>

                        <para>-  In that case, the owner has to pay. Queensland&#39;s experience has proved that, up to a certain point, the tax can be passed on. The fair rents courts have been shown to be weak, because of the inexperience of the adjudicating&#39; magistrates, who, lacking the practical knowledge, but possessing certain theories, fix rents at such a figure that building is made unprofitable. In Sydney and in other cities where these courts operate, people will not invest money in house property. The cheapest way to provide homes for the people would be for the savings bank branch of the Commonwealth Bank to make advances to the state authorities, who possess efficient staffs, and are capable of having houses erected at a minimum cost. I favour the principle that underlies the amendment, but I think that the object aimed at can be achieved much more cheaply and efficiently by allowing the work to be done by the states. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> may he induced to withdraw his amendment when I inform -him that the Government realizes the necessity of giving consideration to the functions of the savings bank branch of the Commonwealth Bank. As has been pointed OUt, it holds a large sum of money, the savings of the people. I have already indicated that the Government contemplates the utilization of a portion of those saving&#39;s in connexion with rural credits, and it is proposed to set up the necessary &#39; machinery to deal with that matter. Home building is another matter which must be considered by the Government. So far, however, the Government has not made up its mind as to the best means to adopt. Two courses are open to it. One is that the Commonwealth Bank itself should establish- a home-building department; and the other is to utilize the machinery now operating in the different states. The experience gained in the erection of war service homes showed that it was more .economical, both for the Government and for the soldiers to utilize the state machinery. Whilst agreeing that a certain amount of the money deposited in the savings bank branch of the&#34; Commonwealth Bank should be devoted to the erection, of homes, .the Government may conclude that the wiser course is to make advances to the state organizations. The; different aspects of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> matter are being- explored, but I cannot give a definite assurance regarding the course that iff likely to- be adopted. The Government recognizes that the matter in list he thoroughly investigated, and a well-considered proposal brought before Parliament at a later date. </para>

                        <para>- My information on the point leads me to think differently. An examination of its last balance-sheet, I contend, would not disclose an asset in that direction. If such advances have been made the total is so small that a microscope would need to be used to discover it in the accounts of the bank. I am not prepared to deny the accuracy of the Minister&#39;s statement, but if it is a fact, what objection can there be to inserting in the bill a clause directing the management to conduct this class of business? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> contended that the insertion of such a provision in the bill would lead to a duplication of work that is now being done by the .state savings banks.

                <para class="block">Adelaide, can obtain an advance from the Commonwealth Bank to enable him to build a home on that block <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not think the Commonwealth Bank will make an advance to the owner of a vacant block of land. A great deal has been said regarding the work of the War Service Homes Department. That department at present advances up to &#163;800 for the erection of a home. It takes a purchaser 37 years to complete his repayments at the rate of &#163;1 per week, and the amount paid by him in that period is &#163;1,924. That is what a returned soldier is required to pay to-day for the services rendered to him by the War Service Homes Department, and, in my opinion, it is too large a sum. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> was doubtful if the amendment would have the effect I anticipate. He said that if he could be sure it would, he would vote for it. T suggest that at least he might give it a trial. I disagree with his contention that a comprehensive measure is necessary to enable the Commonwealth Bank to lend money to a person who owns a ( vacant block of land on- &#39;which he is willing to erect a home. The machinery is in existence if the bank will put it into operation. That is what the bank will not do. Unless the directors are told pointedly and plainly that they will have to make way for others if they do not, in my opinion they will not advance money for the erection of homes. I do not mind whether the funds of the savings bank branch only are used, or whether those of the general bank also are drawn upon. On 1st December, 1923, the general bank had funds totalling &#163;29,560,115, while deposits in the savings bank amounted to &#163;40,330,455, a total of &#163;69,890,570. So far as I know, practically none of that money has been lent for this purpose. The time is long overdue for informing the management that they must engage in this class of business, whether it be in competition with the state banks or with private institutions. I do not suggest that the whole of the &#163;69,890,570 should be used for this purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the new clause proposed by me, which is now before the committee, is to prevent the bank from being a land-owner longer  than  is absolutely necessary. I saw a return furnished not long ago of the condition of affairs in New South Wales. There are in that state the western, central, and eastern divisions. The eastern division is the most thickly populated. The central division is populated to a less extent. In the far west the population is sparse, and consists chiefly of leaseholds. The return showed conclusively that very many of the leases were in the hands of large financial institutions, including certain banks. I have the impression that the banking authorities do not fully utilize land that comes into their possession by foreclosure on their victims, and in asking the committee to insert this proviso my desire is to limit the term for which the bank may hold properties. I am not- submitting the amendment with a view to preventing the bank from lending money. If the security is good enough banks will advance money against any property, but a bank should not lend money merely on the off chance that a drought will force the holder of a leasehold to surrender, and that at some future date the bank will be able to recoup itself for the advance and interest charges. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly it does. It is absolutely wrong, in my opinion, that a bank should be permitted by any act of Parliament to hold on to land as mortgagee in possession for an indefinite number of years. It may be the opinion of certain honorable senators that my amendment will prevent a bank from lending money as freely as it has in the past. That may be quite true, and perhaps it would be as well if a bank did not lend money so freely to its customers. If the bank is satisfied as to its security, and if it has money available, I do not for a moment imagine it will be prevented from lending money even when confronted with this provision. As, in my opinion, a bank does not make the fullest possible use of pastoral, farming, and other properties that fall into its possession, the amendment would have a salutary effect. It would compel the bank to dispose of a property as soon as possible, and enable the land to be held by the real owner, who would make the best use of it. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the committee will not accept the amendment. I am rather astonished that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> should have moved&#39; it. I was always under the impression that the honorable senator was a believer in the nationalization of land. The Commonwealth Bank is a Government institution. If it became the owner of any land, that land would virtually be the property of the Commonwealth Government, through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Bank. The honorable senator&#39;s amendment insists that land which comes into the hands of the bank shall be re-sold within two years, and pass again into private ownership. What is the reason for this sudden conversion on the part of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> honorable senator <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the principle of private &#39; ownership in land ? I am  astonished that, as an advocate of land nationalization, he should refuse to allow the state to remain in possession of land for more than two years. I suggest that he again read <inline font-style="italic">Progress and Poverty,</inline> or consult with his friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Huie,</inline> and get back to the right track. Apart from the honorable senator&#39;s strange falling from his high ideals, the amendment is a very serious one, and, if carried, would seriously damage the business of the Commonwealth Bank. If the bank were required, within two years of land coming into its possession, to re-sell the land at public auction, whether the market was good or bad, its business in the making of advances would be seriously interfered with. </para>

                    desire is to make the Commonwealth Bank stable. The Minister is not so old as I am, and probably has not had the painful experience of having been robbed by the private banks. 1 say, advisedly, that one of the reasons for the reconstruction of the banks many years ago was because they had advanced the full value against certain properties. They had no right to do that. If banking institutions were obliged, within two years of foreclosure, to dispose of the land in respect of which an advance had been made, they would not overload properties.

                        <para>- I am aware of that, and therefore I do not think it is well placed, but I certainly approve of any principle designed to safeguard the people from rotten investments by directors of private banks. I know of one instance of a high official in this Parliament who many years ago bought a block of land for &#163;20, and re-sold it a few days later for &#163;40. Shortly afterwards, when he met the purchaser, he asked him what made him give &#163;40 for the land, and was informed that it was quite all right, because the buyer had got an advance of &#163;150 on the land from the Joint-Stock Bank. That land is still unoccupied, and is not worth 150 pence. If we inserted in our banking legislation some provision such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> suggests, banking authorities would be wary of advancing money on fraudulent valuations. The land to which I refer is in the possession of a man whose money was invested in the bank that advanced &#163;150 on it. He had to take that or nothing in return for his money, and actually he got nothing, because the land is worth nothing. I was one of those unfortunate individuals who suffered at the hands of a reconstructed bank, and that bank is among the number showing great trading profits for the year just completed. I have seen unfortunate old men and women almost crying for the money they had deposited with banks that subsequently ceased operations. Many  of these people lost their life savings. Therefore, I support anybody who stands up to advocate the inclusion in our legislation of wise provisions to put a stop <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> this class of investment, which is a disgrace to any institution. It is the only solution of the difficulty and will not interfere with the operations of the bank. A provision which will serve to compel the bank to get rid of  a  liquid asset in two years, will make the bank officials very shy of advancing more money than ought to be advanced on  a  particular security. </para>

                    (Victoria) f 5.6&#93;.  -  I have heard nothing to convince me that the amendment is in the right direction. It should be remembered that we are dealing not with a private financial institution, but with a bank that belongs to the people. In these circumstances we must view the proposal in a way different from that in which we would regard it if the bill were dealing with private institutions. Under it, if money were advanced by the Commonwealth Bank on land on which buildings were erected, the bank would be compelled to sell the land and the buildings by public auction, within two years after default by the mortgagor. But it might not be of advantage to the bank to sell within that period. It might be better for the bank, and for the people of Australia, as shareholders of the bank, to retain the buildings for an indefinite period. It might get more out of them in the way of rentals than could be obtained by submitting the property to sale by public auction.

                        <para>- It would shut out these unfortunate people. I know that many people who have settled on the land in Victoria have got into arrears in their payments to the state, but because the land they hold belongs to the state the Government has not sold them up, but has given them . breathing time to get out of their trouble. On the other hand, private institutions are run in the interests of the shareholders, or. of a particular section of the community, and they look at such matters from a different stand-point. I have heard nothing, so far, to warrant me in voting for the amendment. I should say that those who are entrusted with the management of the Commonwealth Bank would do nothing to injure the customers of tile bank, but would rather be actuated by a desire to do the right thing in the interests of the bank and the people generally. If we say to the bank officials, that under no circumstances can they retain possession, for more than two years, of land or buildings of which the bank is for the time being the owner, as mortgagee, we shall place the Commonwealth Bank in a different position from that occupied by private financial institutions. It might militate against the success of the Commonwealth Bank to place upon it limitations which  aTe  not imposed upon the private banks. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> should consider whether it would be advisable, in these circumstances, to force his amendment to a vote. If I were given accommodation by the Commonwealth Bank, in respect to certain land and buildings, and lost the possession of it to the bank under circumstances over which I had little or no control, I might, if given a little time, extricate myself from my difficulties, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> says that no time must be allowed for me to do so, and that the bank must realize on the property in two years. He will not allow the bank to determine the best time in which to sell. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is quite evident that honorable senators have not given the consideration that I have to this important subject, and as they are at present not prepared to agree to the adoption of my proposal, I shall not press it to a division. At the same time, I want to say, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that he has never heard me advocating land nationalization. I have certainly advocated straightout land value taxation, without grades or exemptions. I want to point out also that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> G. Huie. secretary of the Single Tax League, in Sydney, is not my instructor. Sometimes I instruct him. However, I know that his views are right, and that he has expressed .them to the great advantage of the people. I am prepared to admit that the Commonwealth Bank, in competing with other banks, would be at a disadvantage if my proposal were inserted in the bill. As a matter of fact, that is the real argument that has induced me not to press for a division. Nothing has been said to make me realize that I am wrong. Although it has had ample time to do so, the Commonwealth Parliament, for some reason, has refused to exercise that section of the constitution which throws upon it the responsibility of passing uniform banking legislation. It has made an attempt, which 1 hope will be successful, to grapple with the subject of bankruptcy and most of the other matters entrusted to it, but it has not yet dealt with banking. When a general banking bill comes before the Senate, I shall move for the insertion of this provision which honorable senators are not anxious to have included in the Commonwealth Bank Bill. I realize that to enforce such a restriction on the Commonwealth Bank, while the other banks had a free hand to &#34; rook &#34; their victims as much as they liked, would be hardly fair to the former institution. For that reason I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that it would be wise for me not to press my proposal to a division. In any case I am afraid it would not be carried. I am fully satisfied that the discussions that have taken place will ultimately have good effect, and I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>

Of course, my opinion differs from that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in regard to many matters in the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has intimated that he proposes to ask the Committee to give the management power to advance notes on foreign securities held by private banks in London. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the honorable senator will not be impatient with me. If he had explained his intentions a little more clearly I should not have found it necessary to speak at this juncture. Surely I am well within my rights in directing the attention of honorable senators to the possibility of this money being used in connexion with advances made against securities held outside the Commonwealth. Since this bill was drafted - and drafted, I take it, after much care and consideration by the Minister who introduced it and by the Cabinet responsible for it - the Minister has come along with what appears to be a trivial amendment to alter the word &#34; lent &#34; to &#34;granted.&#34; A tremendous change may he made in the meaning of the clause if we agree to the alteration. I do not know whether such a change would not alter the whole method of making advances to the bank. It will be in the interests of the taxpayers if we delay dealing with the measure altogether until we&#39; can form a considered opinion on the real effect of this proposed alteration. Of course, &#163;6,000,000 is a small amount in comparison with the magnitude of the bank&#39;s interests in Australia. But in view of the fact that the Minister proposes to introduce an amendment to enable the bank to advance notes against securities held in London, I question whether we shall be wise to grant the bank as much as a shilling of the taxpayers&#39; money. I prefer that the word &#34;lent&#34; shall be left in the clause. We shall not hamper the bank in any way by leaving it there. To adopt the amendment may be to embark upon a wild-cat scheme of currency inflation on the strength of securities not held in Australia, nor within the control of the Commonwealth Government or Australian courts. </para>

                        <para>- It was the intention of the Government that this &#163;6,000,000 should really be a loan in perpetuity. Otherwise it could not form a part of the bank&#39;s capital. I have not the honour to be in the confidence of the Treasurer in this matter, but I think his intention was that this amount should be in the nature of a definite subscription by the Government to the capital of the bank to strengthen it, and to enable it to extend its business. The amount was to be subscribed in the same way as shareholders would subscribe capital for an ordinary financial institution. The Government is the sole shareholder in the Commonwealth Bank, and it  proposes  to subscribe tq the capital of the institution in this way. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> inform us whether his intention in seeking to change the word &#34; lent &#34; to &#34; granted &#34; is to provide later on that if the directors of the bank think it would be inadvisable at a given time to pay the full rate of interest payable on whatever portion of this &#163;6,000,000 they obtain, because the bank is undergoing a time of strain, the Government may permit a part of the amount to be paid then, and the remainder later on ? Subclauses 4 and 5 of clause 6 of the bill read as follow. : - </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The bill provides that half the profits of the bank shall go to its reserve fund, and half to the national debt sinking fund. I wondered whether this amendment was proposed with a view to giving the bank management a certain amount of discretion with regard to the paying of the interest. . If that is not the case, I ask whether the Minister will accept an amendment making it a sort of cumulative right, so that it shall not be mandatory for the board to pay the full amount of interest due at a given time. </para>

The bill provides that the bank must pay interest on the money advanced to it for the purposes of providing capital, and I do not think we ought to alter that provision.

                    <para>. - The remarks just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> make me all the more reluctant to agree to the amendment. It is quite clear that under the clause as it stands the bank will have to pay interest on this amount, and the bill provides that a certain amount of its profits shall be set aside as an offset against the interest payable on the borrowed capital involved in the business. If this money is to be a grant to the bank, I take it that the hank, if we can liken it to a private bank, will pay interest on it in proportion to its profits. It will not be returned to the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth as interest on money advanced, but in the ordinary methods of banking, will appear in the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank, because we shall have deliberately substituted the word &#34; granted &#34; for the word &#34;lent.&#34; T&#39;hat is the position, unless I am unable to appreciate the meaning of words. </para>

                        <para>- When the bill was drafted the word &#34;lent&#34; was used, and provision made for the payment of interest, but if we substitute &#34; granted &#34; for &#34;lent&#34; we shall actually alter the position of the bank in its relation to the Commonwealth. If by act of Parliament this money is &#34; granted &#34; to the Commonwealth Bank it will be absurd for the Commonwealth to claim interest, although I realize that in the end half the profits of the bank become the property of the Commonwealth. There  &#171;an be very little doubt about that. If the bank continues to be blessed with prosperity, and is not ruined by issuing notes against foreign securities, fae profits of the bank will ultimately become the property of the Commonwealth. We have now more information at our disposal than we had when the measure was under discussion  in  another place, or when it was introduced into this chamber. We now understand that the Commonwealth Bank, which is being conducted on safe lines, is to become a bank conducted on lines of doubtful safety. If the word &#34;lent&#34; is not retained, we shall weaken the claims of the people, whom I and others represent, to what are their actual rights. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has not made it clear to me - perhaps it is because it is so clear to him- that &#34;granted&#34; and &#34;lent&#34; mean the same thing. </para>

If the word &#34; lent &#34; is allowed to stand we. will have a claim for interest, and for the return of the capital from the bank, but if we substitute the word &#34; granted &#34; the money will be a gift to the bank. </para>

                        <para>- A bank grants an overdraft only where there is sufficient security to guarantee its repayment, or if it is not repaid, to prevent loss; but in this instance we are giving any amount up to &#163;6,000,000 as a free gift or a grant. If there is any doubt as to the meaning of  the  amendment it should be made quite clear before we accept it. It is the intention of the Minister to move a number of small amendments, but I do not wish him to think that because I take exception to this one I shall treat all the others in a similar way. This is one of those little points upon which we should be sure. If the position is clearly and definitely stated, better progress will, be made. I am quite in the dark as to the meaning of the amendment. If the two words mean the same, why should au alteration be made? </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to explain why it is now necessary to suggest that &#163;6,000,000 should be borrowed for the purpose of granting that amount to the Commonwealth Bank. Notwithstanding the fact that the bank commenced operations without any capital, it now holds very large sums of money and cannot in any sense be regarded as shaky. Why is it necessary for provision to be made for &#163;6,000,000 to be borrowed? We do not know if the money is to be obtained in Great Britain, in Australia, or elsewhere. We seem to be pursuing an entirely wrong policy in regard to borrowing money, and I do not know how long the present practice is to continue. It seems, however, that the people of the Commonwealth are. to be fleeced  with the greatest possible regularity in paying interest on money borrowed in Australia and abroad. If it is intended that the Commonwealth Bank shall pay interest on the &#163;6,000,000 proposed to be granted, this appears to involve an unnecessary amount of circumlocution, and the creation of an altogether unsatisfactory position. Our present policy of borrowing has imposed an enormous burden upon the people of the Commonwealth, and something ought to be done to relieve the position. If the Government intend to borrow &#163;6,000,000, why not instruct the notes board to print an additional number of notes sufficient to cover the amount? This loan could be reduced by retiring annually a number of notes equal to the interest payable. By borrowing this sum from the money lenders in Great Britain, and paying, say, 6 per cent, per annum in interest, in addition to notation and other expenses, the money thus paid away is for ever lost to the country. If my proposal were adopted the debt would be quickly wiped out. It appears to me that the taxpayers of Australia are being, pledged too greatly to the money lenders in Great Britain. The Commonwealth Bank has done very well so far, despite its many and varied shortcomings, but this proposal w,ill saddle it with an additional outlay of from &#163;300,000 to &#163;360,000 per annum if the Government charges it 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, interest on the capital placed at its disposal. I am opposed to the idea of borrowing an extra &#163;6,000,000, either at home or abroad, because I do not consider that the bank requires to have its capital augmented by that amount. </para>

                    <para>. - The Commonwealth Bank will require additional capital because its functions are being enlarged to enable it to operate as a central bank. It is not correct to say that the bank has no capital to-day. It has accumulated profits amounting to &#163;4,500,000. It is , proposed to capitalize &#163;4,000,000 of that sum. It is not correct, either, to say that the bank commenced operations without capital, because the principal act made the Commonwealth responsible for the bank, and therefore it had  behind  it the whole of the resources of the Commonwealth. Although that backing still exists, it is necessary for the bank to have capital in liquid form available for use at any time. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Senator Grant.</inline> - Is it proposed that the Commonwealth Bank shall pay to the Commonwealth Government interest on that &#163;6,000,0001 </para>

                    <para>. - I have risen chiefly because of the amusement with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> proposal to issue notes was received by honorable senators opposite. There was a time in the life of this Senate when honorable senators opposite could afford to laugh at a suggestion to issue notes, but that time has now passed, because they have expressed their willingness to accede to a proposal to issue notes on security held outside Australia. The wildest &#34;wild cat&#34; in the Labour movement would never dream of making such an absurd proposition. I think we could well issue notes to the value of &#163;6,000,000, or even &#163;12,000,000/ A simple method of doing so is provided by the Commonwealth Bank Act, and that is to issue &#163;3 in notes for every &#163;1 held in gold. I would buy up every ounce of gold produced in Australia, and thus provide for the continual expansion of our credit. If &#163;1,000,000 worth of gold were produced annually in Australia, by buying it up we could increase our credit to the extent of &#163;3,000,000, at the same time retaining a solid gold backing for the notes that were issued. I realize that the Commonwealth Bank, as the Labour party established it, was provided with a better basis than that of gold. Some people who imagine they know everything about banking overlook a most important feature of the issue of notes. The credit of private banking institutions is limited, and they must, therefore, have gold as a basis for their notes. There is no limit to Australia&#39;s credit except that of the last shilling in the hands of the last taxpayer. The credit of Australia is so great, and is developing so rapidly, that it cannot have a limit placed upon it. </para>

                <para class="block">At the same time I want it to be clearly understood that we on this side do not favour the unlimited issue of notes. At present we stand for a gold basis. We would purchase gold for the sake of security. The mining industry could thus be materially assisted, because it would pay the Commonwealth to give for the gold one shilling per ounce more than was offered by other prospective &#39; buyers. Having announced that a provision is to be inserted in the bill to enable notes to be issued against foreign securities held by private banks in London, thereby departing from the principle of maintaining absolute security and ensuring public confidence, the Government and its supporters cannot afford to laugh at any proposition made by honorable senators on this side with regard to a note issue, because they have lost every sense of responsibility that they may once&#39; have possessed. </para>

I am given to understand that the bank of New South Wales has locked up in its vaults &#163;9,000,000 in gold, and that the other banks are similarly situated. If that is so, why should it be necessary for these institutions to be strengthened by the establishment of a central bank? The  chairman  of directors of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, which last year made a profit of &#163;400,000, has distinctly stated that that institution has not sought the assistance of the Government, and does not require it. &#39; He has made statements,, which are not complimentary to the framers of this measure, regarding the manner in which it has been placed before Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- That strengthens the position I take up. I do not want the people&#39;s money to be lavished upon the Commonwealth Bank in such a way that it will be under no obligation to repay it, although I know that in the long-run what belongs to the bank belongs to the people. The will of Parliament must be supreme. This Parliament may authorize certain provisions, and another Parliament, fortunately still the supreme authority, may pass other provisions. The Ministerwould be well advised to allow the clause to stand. I do not believe this measure has been reasonably discussed by the Government. Evidently Ministers have changed their minds. I want to emphasize that fact. What harm could be done to the bank if we allowed the clause to pass? On the other hand, what harm may be done if it is amended? There will then be no claim for the return of the money granted to the bank, although a careless board of directors may be responsible for serious losses. It is because I believe that the people&#39;s interests will be safeguarded by passing the clause as it stands that I intend to Vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  Some little time ago  . I  suggested that it might be desirable in certain circumstances for the directors of the bank to be permitted to pay to the Government  a  rate of interest less than equivalent to the effective rate of interest  payable by the Commonwealth on the loan raised for the purpose of making the grant to the bank. In the case of an ordinary financial institution, shareholders are at times paid less than the ordinary rate of interest on their investments, and circumstances may arise - although it is not likely that they will - in which the directors of the Commonwealth Bank may consider it to be advisable, for the time being, to pay less than the full rate of interest payable to the Commonwealth Government for money which may be granted, under the provisions of this clause. I ask the Minister, therefore, whether he would be prepared to accept an amendment which would make sub-clause 5 of the clause read as follows: - </para>

                        <para>- It would be dangerous to leave the matter there. It must be remembered that the profits of the bank are to be divided equally between the bank and the Government. Obviously, therefore, it would be advantageous to the directors of the bank to pay a small rate of interest, or no interest at all, on the money granted to them. They may say, &#34; We are anxious to build up our reserves, and, therefore, we propose to pay only 1 per cent., or 3 per cent., on the money granted to us by the Government.&#34; That will hardly commend itself as a sound proposition. But let us look at the matter from another point of view. Let us suppose for a moment that in a certain year the bank did not make sufficient profit to pay the full rate of interest due to the Government in respect to a grant made under this provision: It will hardly be  suggested  that the Government would foreclose on the bank. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We have already done something of a similar nature in regard to the Federal Capital Commission. We have assumed that at some time the Federal Capital Territory will return a profit to the commission, but in the meantime it is impossible for the commission to carry on unless it is provided with money. The Government, therefore, has advanced money to it, and the commission is, in effect, piling up a liability which it is hoped will later on be liquidated. </para>

It is quite clear that, apart from the appointment of the directors and the settlement of other subordinate matters, there is no expression in this bill as to how the business of the bank shall be conducted. The amendment I have submitted is an attempt to repair that omission. Our experience of banking has been of a varied nature, but happily examples of rash or careless banking in Australia have not been frequent. The public interest is so involved and so inextricably bound up with the question now under consideration that we should not lose an opportunity to  Bee  that what has happened in the past shall not occur again. I refer particularly to the happenings in this country in the early nineties, which are well within the memory of honorable senators. We can well remember that at that time about ten banks were carrying on&#39; business in Australia, and to all intents and purposes up to a particular year, and aye, up to a particular month, they were thought to be in a sound position. But experience taught us that all was not as we imagined. They had been carried on in a fashion that did not commend itself to any person experienced in banking, or to any person capable and willing to express an independent opinion as to how a bank could be soundly and safely conducted. The result was that most of the banks failed. We know the main cause, and the purpose of the proposed new clause is to prevent a similar happening. </para>

The main cause of the collapse was the way in which the banks conducted their business of extending credit. Story upon story was erected upon slender foundations, until the natural thing happened and eight or nine banks failed. Tens of thousands of shareholders lost  their money. I do not wish anything of that land to happen in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank, and for the information of honorable senators, I shall quote some of the evidence given before a commission appointed in 1893, when the debris was scattered all over the landscape, and when men who went to bed in the firm belief and conviction that they were men of substance and means awoke in the morning- to the dreadful experience of finding that they were ruined.

I cannot help feeling that too much importance is attached to the proportion of gold to the total liabilities, insufficient importance being given to the proportion of the reserve to liabilities from which circumstances I consider come the whole of the recent failure. We have about two million in coin and securities, but make ten million a year less out of them than we ought to make owing to careful banking. </para>

                <para class="block">If we are to be guided it should be by the lamp of experience, which, as Patrick Henry said, is the only one which lights the feet of men to progress through life. We should be guided by experience and avoid such a catastrophe as that which happened in the early nineties. I am quite aware&#34; that in opposition to this proposal it will be said that it will mean locking up the reserves of the </para>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth Bank to an unnecessary degree, but if the locking up of these reserves means a positive insurance against what happened in the period I have stated, our action will be fully warranted. I therefore ask the committee to agree to the proposed new clause, so that it can be said that this is a bank conducted on such sound principles that it keeps in reserve, in cash or in a liquid form, one third of its liabilities to the public. It will be said, of course, that the Commonwealth Bank is a national bank, owned and controlled in the interests of the people, and cannot be pressed into liquidation. In reply to the argument which may be raised against the locking up of reserves, I would point out that even in regard to public credits, to which I attach the greatest importance - because public credit stands superior to the credit of an individual or any section of individuals - it is universally admitted that one cannot go beyond a certain point. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> who referred to the note issue, that public credit cannot sustain the action of any Government in issuing notes upon its own responsibility and upon the good faith of the nation unless the note issue has, as a compulsory limit, a gold backing to the extent of 25 per cent. Public credit can only be trusted up to a certain point, and if that limit is exceeded universal consent will not sustain the action taken. If any one proposed to provide less than a 25 per cent, gold backing for our notes, universal opinion would be up in arms, and rightly so, too. When it is necessary to employ the public credit and provide a rigid safeguard in relation to our note issue, it is equally important to make similar provision, in regard to the bank, the operations of which we are now discussing. It is only fair to the bank, to the public, and to the good name of the Commonwealth that we should provide such safeguards as will remove the bank from beyond the point of suspicion in order that it may be established upon a foundation, so to speak, of imperishable granite. There should be&#39; no chance of its tottering. We ought to do this for the further reason .that there has been no change in our banking law since the early nineties. The Commonwealth  Parliament must soon pass a bill to regulate banking that extends beyond the limits of one state. I am sure that this Parliament will require the private banking institutions &#39; to observe some such provision as this. If it does not, the lesson of the early nineties will have been wasted. If the private banks are compelled to provide this safeguard, similar provision must be made in the case of the Commonwealth Bank. I remind the committee that this proposal is not a new one. Until recent years, the Canadian banking law provided that not more than 8 per cent, could be- declared as a dividend by any bank if the reserves fell below one-third of its liabilities. Anything in excess of 8 per cent, had to be placed to reserve, to  bring  it up to at least one-third of the liabilities of the bank. I want the Commonwealth Bank to be built on the soundest possible foundation. The only way in which that can be done 13 to ensure that, as against its liabilities, it shall have either cash or liquid assets in the proportion proposed by me. I hope that my amendment will commend itself to the committee. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a minor matter. The honorable senator proposes one of the most revolutionary changes that could possibly be made in the banking law of any country. No country in the world has in its banking law a provision similar to this. Before agreeing to make such a startling change a great deal more consideration would be necessary than I am able to give it on the spur of the moment. I fear that, whatever merits may be possessed by the honorable senator&#39;s case, he has prejudiced them, because of the fact that one is not able  in  the time available to look into the full meaning of the proposed new clause. It is. fairly obvious that, if there is one bank in the Commonwealth that does not require this safeguard, it is the Commonwealth Bank. If this provision is a necessity of banking, it should be applied to every bank other than the Commonwealth Bank. The proposed new clause would place upon the Commonwealth Bank a restriction which would not apply to any other bank in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Then such a proposal might quite properly be made. It would be most unfair to saddle the Commonwealth Bank with this restriction. The people cannot allow that bank to escape its liabilities as some private banks, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> did in the nineties. As long as there is a shilling in the Treasury locker, it must be placed at the disposal of this bank. There is another reason why, on the spur of the moment,&#39; without having had time to properly think the matter out, I do not favour the proposed new clause. It is intended to make the Commonwealth Bank a central bank. We hope that, if a time of crisis does arrive, the Commonwealth Bank will come to the rescue of the private banks. This restriction would operate at such a time, and the Commonwealth Bank, even though it had the resources of the whole of the people of Australia at its back, would be hamstring. In the nineties, when those terrible events referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> occurred, it was obviously in the interests of the people that the private banks should be kept going, and the governments of the states took extraordinary action to that end. Had the Commonwealth Bank been in existence at that time it would have been its duty to go to the assistance of the private banks, but such a provision as this would have prevented it from doing so. Everybody must recognize that this is the one bank that can safely do without such a provision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> must see, on reflection, that it would be most unfair to place this restriction on the Commonwealth Bank and allow the other banks to operate without it. I appeal to him to withdraw the amendment at this stage. It can properly be considered when the general banking law is being amended. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the amendment is worthy of more consideration than has been given to it by the Minister. Instead of being withdrawn at this stage, it ought to be deferred until the Minister has had an opportunity to consider it more at his leisure. He has said that the Commonwealth Bank could dispense with a provision of this nature. I differ from that point of view. Those banks which were affected by the last crisis observe this practice strictly without any legislative provision. It is in the interests of the directors and the shareholders that they should do so, because they are liable to suffer heavy loss. The Commonwealth Bank, on the other hand, will be controlled by directors who are under no danger of losing their personal capital, and such a provision as this may be  necessary  in its case. If at any time, owing to some great national crisis, it was imperative for the Commonwealth Bank to disregard this safeguard, it could approach the Commonwealth Parliament and have passed a measure conferring upon it extraordinary powers. It is all very well to say that the taxpayer is behind the bank. The taxpayer does not want to be made liable for anything over which he has no control. The shareholders of a private bank can bring their directors to book, but the taxpayers of the Commonwealth cannot influence the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. I hope that the Minister will not press for the withdrawal of the amendment, but that he will defer it until we can obtain a mature opinion upon it. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened very attentively to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and I am sure that he is not sufficiently aged to remember the banking crisis of the early nineties. Already this bill contains the provisions that saved the private banks at that time, even after the panic had started. In New South Wales, when private banks had closed their doors and posted the notice, &#34; Payment suspended pending reconstruction,&#34; the State Government hurriedly passed a measure pledging the credit of the state to the .private bank notes, and making them legal tender. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said that he wanted to build the Commonwealth Bank upon a firm foundation. Let us look at the manner in which firm foundations are made, in a material sense. If an architect were to provide for a foundation of reinforced concrete in the proportion of one part of cement to three of river sand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would not improve the mixture by throwing in a further quantity of mullock. The Commonwealth Bank has an excellent foundation in a gold basis and the credit of the Commonwealth. On such a foundation one can safely build, because the credit of the institution is limited only by the resources of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> statement drew from the Minis-&#39; ter  the remark that as a central bank this institution may come to the relief of the private banks. I have no hesitation in saying that that is the chief purpose underlying the proposal to transform the bank from a trading bank to a central bank. In countries in which banking has grown to any extent the thing that most forcibly strikes students of banking is the periodical panic that has to be faced. After a period of prosperous trading something suddenly causes a run on the banks. The chief cause to my mind is that in the days of prosperity, when profits are great, the shareholders get the whole of the benefit. Since the lesson of 1893, in Australia, I believe that banking has been carried on with safety as the guiding principle. I think that we are now going through a most critical banking period, and that is why I favour moving very slowly, lest, in our eagerness to help the private banks, we do more harm than good. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> proposal is tantamount to throwing too much mullock into a good foundation. What better foundation could one have than a gold basis and a taxable people ? The Australians submit more readily to taxation than the people of any other country. There appears to be no limit to their patience. They appear to be able to adapt themselves to any condition and submit to any hardship in the way of taxation. The people of Australia are behind this bank, and will submit to a good deal to maintain their own reputation. I see no necessity to tie the hands of the management by any imaginary strengthening of the bank&#39;s position. As the Minister has pointed out, if the provision were applied to all the banks there might be something in it, but as it will only apply to the Commonwealth Bank, why this extraordinary precaution? Apart from the service the bank has rendered the community, and the savings it has effected in connexion with the floating of our loans, the actual profits earned on its ordinary banking business totals &#163;4,500,000. If it had been a private bank how much of that &#163;4,500,000 would have remained the property of the people? It would, of course, have been disbursed in dividends. If the bank&#34; is managed as successfully in future as other banks are, and I venture to say it will be, the credit and the accruing profits of the bank year after year will build up a reserve greater even than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> now proposes to establish, because with the ordinary turnover of a 5 per cent. profit, the bank will double its capital in fourteen years. In a growing country like Australia, investments in land constitute one of the greatest dangers to banking. One has only to bear in mind the immense fortunes that are made. A friend of mine hot long ago invested &#163;1,000 in a Sydney suburban subdivision, and turned the property over at a profit of about &#163;5,000 in a short space of time. Panic, financial stringency, and difficulties soon come when a sufficient number of people have to pay away their weekly earnings as interest on land transactions. The Commonwealth Bank will not go headlong into that kind of investment. The government of the day, rather than the directors of the bank, must be responsible for the successful operation of the bank. That responsibility cannot be removed from them, but we must have the strong guiding hand of the man upon whom would fall the censure of the people in the event of disaster. The position of the Commonwealth Bank is sounder than the position of the private banks.We have an institution that is already successfully operating. Its earnings to date total &#163;4,500,000. Now it is to be granted another &#163;6,000,000 of capital, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynchwants</inline> to make its foundations better by adding something. It might be wise if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> withdrew his amendment, and submitted it at a later stage when honorable senators had further information as to its details, and knew exactly what it meant. At the moment I do not consider it necessary, and I am not going to impose on the Commonwealth Bank, the property of the people, conditions which are not required of the privately owned banks. </para>

I do not think that it would help us very much, for the reason, amongst others, that the Commonwealth Bank can issue notes to itself. If it found that it was running short of the percentage allowed in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> amendment, it could issue a few more notes and the position would be all right again. That is one of the dangers I see. However, I do not press it, but I suggest that the Minister postpone consideration of the clause until we have considered the position a little more. </para>

                <para class="block">I  must plead guilty to not having circulated the amendment, but I can assure  honorable&#39; senators that I had no intention of discourtesy, because in my second-reading speech I indicated my views on this subject, and intimated that  I  would  seek  to have them given effect to when the bill was in committee. Though the amendment  is  only  a  short verbal one, it will,  if  agreed to, have very important consequences  I  take exception to the title  of  the executive officer  of the  bank, and  to  his holding a position on  the  board. It would be far better, and in  6he  interests of the future welfare  of  the bank,  if  the executive officer were made the general manager. The whole future of the bank depends upon having an efficient board of directors. If the  chairman  and other members of the board do not work well with the executive officer, the progress of the bank will not be what we all hope for. It is the custom, in connexion with all banks and great institutions,  to  have boards of directors and a general manager, and I  do  not see why an exception should  be  made in the case of the Commonwealth Bank. It is true that in the  past, with one-man control, the executive officer of the bank has been termed the governor. It is quite right that, where there is autocratic control, the executive officer should he called the governor, because he exercises full power. In the case of the Bank of England the directors are termed &#34; governors,&#34; and I think the  chairman  is styled the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline> of the Governors of the Bank of England. But when we create a board of directors in the ordinary sense of the word, the term &#34;governor/ I think, should be dropped. The general manager, as the officer responsible for the policy of a hank- or any institution, brings matters &#39; of great moment before the hoard of directors, who, no doubt, are largely guided by his advice. </para>

                        <para>- He has full control. He is the board of directors and executive officer all in one. He has no master. I contend that the general manager of the bank should submit this- recommendations to the board of directors, the members of which may approve of them or vary them&#34; as they deem advisable. We want a good  chairman  of directors, because his is the most important, position on the board. If we are going to have the executive officer putting up proposals and voting on them, there will he friction with the  chairman  of directors from the outset. If, however, the board is to be &#39;composed of automatons, the will of the executive officer will prevail, and things will perhaps go on in a haphazard way for a time. We want men of the highest calibre for the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and it is not fair to the other directors that the executive officer should have a vote on the board. If it is desired that he should&#39; be on the board, then I say that he ought to be given his proper title. He should be called the managing director; not the governor of the bank. </para>

                    <para>. - There are very good reasons why this amendment should not be adopted. I shall deal first with the honorable senator&#39;s proposal to change the title &#34; governor&#34; of the bank to that of v&#60; general manager.&#34; The Commonwealth Bank, which has been in existence for a number of years, has always been managed by a governor. In fact, the term &#34;governor&#34; has grown up with the institution. It is really one of the things that differentiate the Commonwealth Bank from other financial institutions. There are many reasons why this differentiation should exist, and why terms commonly in use in private banks should not be employed in respect of the Commonwealth . Bank. The latter is the nation&#39;s bank, it has no private interest, and is not run for private profit, whereas the other banks in Australia belong to private people, and are run for private profit. There are traditions in the Commonwealth Bank associated with the term &#34; governor,&#34; and it is the same term as is used in the Bank of England. </para>

                        <para>- No, but I prefer to deal with one point at a time. There is great value in retaining the term &#34;governor.&#34; The very fact that it differentiates between the Commonwealth Bank and the other banks is a recommendation for its retention. I quite believe that the other banks are not pleased that there should be any differentiation in this respect between them and the Commonwealth Bank, and that they would like to see the term altered, but I do not think that we should fellow their lead. I therefore strongly urge the committee to retain a title that has been from the first associated with the Commonwealth Bank. I also ask the committee not to support the proposal to take the governor off the board of directors, which, will not be the same as boards of directors of other banks. The Commonwealth Bank is the property of the people of Australia, but as it would be impracticable to get the. people of Australia to a share holders&#39; meeting to elect their directors, their representatives in Parliament act as their proxies and place the people&#39;s representatives on t&#39;he board. As the bank will be a central bank, it will be necessary to have on the board at least one man with a special knowledge of banking transactions and the relations of a central bank with other banks. That knowledge is not required in the case of other banks which are not central banks. To have on the board of directors of the central bank a man with the requisite knowledge of banking transactions, it is essential that the governor shall be a member of it. Furthermore, as the Commonwealth Bank is a Government bank, with intimate relations with Government finance, the Secretary to the Treasury must also be on the board of directors. It is true that all the other banks have relations with the Treasury, but not to the extent that the Common - with Bank has, and will have in its capacity as a national bank. The other banks are private trading concerns, and it cannot be argued that because certain things are done in regard to the directorates of those banks they must also, be done in regard to the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. There is no analogy between the two classes of banks. When the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank deals &#34;with the relationship of a central bank to the private banks, it will be essential to have among them one who has a special knowledge of banking, and one who can influence them, not only by his voice, but also by his vote. This is one of the principal features of the bill. It has been carefully considered, and, as I said on the second reading, the Government attach so much importance to the necessity for having the governor of the bank on the board of directors that they are also providing that the deputy governor shall attend all meetings of the board in order that he may keep in close touch with it. Thus, if at any time the governor is unable to he in attendance through illness, or from any other cause, the deputy governor will step into his place with a full knowledge of what has been the&#39; policy of the board. </para>

                        <para>- That is correct. Other directors may come and go, but the governor will remain. His presence on the board will ensure continuity of policy. Private affairs may lead to the resignation of directors at any time, but, subject to good behaviour, the governor will be re-appointed from time to time under the provisions of the act.  Recognizing the added importance we are giving to the bank by making it a central bank, we must view the matter, not from what private banks do, but from a wider stand-point. I trust that the committee will stand by the proposal in the bill and retain the title of &#34;governor.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I am wondering whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposes to stand hard and fast by the clause, and whether the directorate will remain, with the qualifications provided for in the bill.  I  should like some honorable senator opposite who has been fortunate enough to be a director of a bank to five us his experience of the way in which a board of directors of a private bank functions.  I  should imagine that when a board of directors of a great institution like the Bank of New South Wales, the Bank of Australasia, or the Union Bank, meets, it is largely guided by the management. </para>

                        <para>- He would be a very strong man indeed who came upon a board of directors of a bank and chose to. differ from the general manager. It is generally accepted that a man who has succeeded in malting money as a pastoralist is a financier. At any rate, he gets the reputation of being one. We ought to consider this bank as altogether different from private banks. Although I hope that the Government of the day will never interfere with the management of the institution, I think it ought to constitute the real directorate, for when all is said and done it has to exercise a good deal of authority. If a government interfered with the purely business concerns of the bank, absolute failure would result. It would also be a disastrous proceeding, in my opinion, for the Government to use its influence with the bank to secure an extensive note issue, or even to cause Parliament to pass measures to instruct the bank to issue notes. </para>

                        <para>- We can make or mar the development of this country for the next twenty years by successful or unsuccessful banking. A satisfactory board of directors for the bank would be the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Manager and  Deputy  Manager of the bank. If they required advice such as could be tendered by the representative men that the Government proposes to appoint to the board, they could apply to the Government. In my wide parliamentary experience - and whatever other experiences I lack - I have had a wide parliamentary experience. I have never known a Commonwealth or state government not to live up to its responsibilities in connexion with an institution like the Commonwealth Bank. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> presses his amendment to a division I shall feel disposed to vote with him, not for the mere purpose of altering the name of the chief officer of the bank, but to create a vacancy on the board with a view to providing an opportunity to do something that will be more advantageous to the bank than the Government&#39;s proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the Minister will accept an amendment along the lines I have suggested. Careful consideration would have to be given to the duties of such a board. I do not know whether  honorable senators opposite agree with the proposal for the general management of the bank, but I feel certain that they will not object to anything that will result in the bank being furnished with all possible information to enable it to function successfully. Personally, I believe that too large a directorate is provided for. Five directors, in addition to the governor, would be plenty. I do not agree with the proposal to appoint to the directorate representatives of different interests of the community. The clause provides that the governor shall be a director, and that is quite proper. I do not think that any objection will he made to the Secretary to the Treasury being on the directorate. There are special reasons why he should be, <inline font-style="italic">ex officio,</inline> associated with it. But I do not agree that gentlemen should be appointed because they are particularly associated with manufacturing industries or commerce, or with agricultural, pastoral, or other primary industries. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to move an amendment along the line3 I have suggested. The clause also provides for the appointment to the directorate of &#34; two persons who have a knowledge of currency, and are declared by the Governor-General to have been chosen because of that knowledge.&#34; Who are these persons with a knowledge of currency? I suppose people who claim to have a knowledge of currency can be found in every class in the community. I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> &#34; if the Government are going to the University to select men who have a more or less academic knowledge of currency matters. They could get them there, but I venture to say that they are not the type of men required upon the board of the Commonwealth Bank. I do not agree with the provision to create a board within a board, which is the intention in regard to the currency directors. Later on in the bill there is provision for certain matters to be determined by these currency directors in a certain way. I do not agree with that provision of the bill. What the Government ought to do is to endeavour to get the five best men available, be prepared to pay them well for their services, and ask them to meet once a week. Such a board would exercise a very much better control over the affairs of the bank than would the board proposed in the bill, the members of which are to be drawn from men following various avocations in different parts of Australia.. The whole control of the bank will eventually fall into the hands of an executive of three. </para>

                        <para>- Matters relating to the problems of financing the wool clip have been brought before Parliament, where certain action has been authorized to enable the clip to be financed. On the other hand, there are other states which are not so vitally interested in the wool clip, but which are involved in other production. Western Australia has an important timber trade, which is more extensive, perhaps, than that of any other state. All these questions are closely related to banking, and a central bank needs to have upon its board persons who have a knowledge of them. There is one reason why the Go-( verment wish the board to be constituted as is proposed. If we reduce the number we incur the risk of sufficient attention not being given to the varied interests in the Commonwealth, and, instead of giving the different portions of Australia some voice occasionally in fixing the policy of the bank, we shall, if we reduce the number, involve the risk of having what is really not an Australian board. It has been said that it would be difficult for some members to come from Western Australia to Melbourne, but it must be remembered that there are some men who spend a good deal of the year in this city, but whose interests are solely in Western Australia. I trust the committee will not only retain the number proposed, but will also refrain from interfering with the diversified character of the board. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> was -somewhat facetious in regard to the appointment of gentlemen with a knowledge of currency. There are in the Commonwealth people who have made a study of the question, who have had a lifelong experience, and who have a greater knowledge of the matter than their fellow citizens. </para>

                        <para>-  We are extending the bank. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KINGSMILL-</inline> Exactly, and I am prepared to make what I consider a sufficient concession, having due regard to the extension of the hank. If the word &#39; &#39; seven &#34; were left out, and the word &#34; three &#34; inserted, it would, at all events, meet my views. I fancy by these geographical divisions there is a professional differentiation,&#39; and, instead of having facility and despatch in the execution of business, we shall get nothing but argumentation and trouble. Personally, I  would sooner have a board consisting of three good men, in addition to the governor, who should be paid correspondingly, and who should meet at prescribed short intervals, rather than the proposal put forward in this clause. I have listened to the debate, and I have wondered why there has been this rushing -from one extreme to the other. So far I have not heard any satisfactory reason advanced. I do not think the states are likely to insist upon their special rights in this direction when they are so often disregarded in others. I do not think Western Australia is yearning to have a representative on the board. Even if it were, I do not think in the interests of business - and, after all, this is a business, and not a political, bank - that such representation would be necessary. In regard to the representation of various interests upon boards, we have seen many experiments. I am thinking now more particularly of harbour boards, on which geographical situation and trade interests were considered. Such attempts have ended disastrously. Some years ago, I was authorized to investigate the constitution and operation of harbour trusts throughout Australia with a view to the establishment of a harbour trust in Western Australia. I inquired into the conditions under which the harbour trust for &#39;.the port of Melbourne, and also a similar &#39;body in Sydney, and in various other -places operated, and found that the most satisfactory harbour trust, in those days at all events, was the Sydney Harbour &#39;Trust, which consisted practically of one &#39;man. I found the most unsatisfactory trust was that in operation in Melbourne which consisted of about twenty men, who represented various sections and interests. I had the pleasure of being present by invitation at one meeting of the Melbourne Harbour Trust and it resembled, if I may be permitted to say, a turbulent meeting of the Senate, or what is worse still a meeting in another place. </para>

I may, perhaps, be falling into the position of having my own opinion quoted against me if I fight this question much more, but in a business such as this, which must &#34;be conducted on business lines, I think that the fewer the number consistent with safety the better it will be. Personally I am not much enamoured of the conduct of public business by hoards. Considering the actions of a certain hoard which is at present in my mind, I am more likely to favour direct management. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has, in a measure, anticipated an amendment which I intended to move later. Clause 7 contains one of the most important provisions in the bill. Whether it is carried in its present form or in an amended form is, for the moment, immaterial. No matter what the number of directors may be, the fact that the bank is to be managed by a board constitutes a complete, if not a drastic, change in its management. What reasons have, so far, been advanced in favour of any change? The Government that brought the bank into existence placed in control of it a gentleman who did an immense amount of service to the Commonwealth and its people. He was - appointed for a period of seven years. He had to organize his staff, establish branches throughout the Commonwealth, and do a hundred and one other things that the governor of the bank is not called upon to do at the present time. After it has been demonstrated that the bank can be efficiently managed by one man, the Government desires to take the management from the governor of the bank and hand it over to eight gentlemen about whom we, at present, know nothing. Then the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> says that we ought to consider the rights of the various states in making appointments to the directorate. Does any other honorable senator share that opinion ? 1 thought that this Parliament and this bank were essentially Australian institutions. If we are to have a board of directors it should have on it the best men available, irrespective of the states from which they come. Why should geographical limitations be imposed when it is necessary to obtain men who will render the best service ? If it were necessary to advertise for a governor for the bank, would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> contend that state interests should be considered, and that we should be very guarded in our movements for fear that we should interfere with state rights? Such a proposition, if made seriously, would not be listened to for a moment. If, in the states containing the smaller population there is a man with qualifications superior to those possessed by any one in the states that have the larger population, he should be chosen. Respecting currency, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> said that varied opinions had been expressed by different people in Australia. That fact is evident from a perusal of the newspapers. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to-day - the latter particularly - honorable senators will find varying opinions regarding the present financial stringency; so-called experts expressing widely divergent views. Even members of the Cabinet differ from each other. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> has a panacea for the financial stringency. He says that we should cease from borrowing abroad, stop importing, and float our loans in Australia, to bring ourselves within the safety zone. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> in effect tells the Minister for Trade and Customs that that would be a suicidal policy, and - that we have reached the peak in the flotation of loans in Australia. What is meant by &#34; currency <inline font-style="italic">&#34;1</inline> I have consulted a dictionary on banking, and I find that the word &#34; currency &#34; was originally applied to the currency, or passing .from hand to hand, of money, but it has now come to bo applied to the money itself - gold, silver, and copper. Bills of exchange, bank notes, cheques, and any other document which acts as a substitute for coin, are also included under the term. So it can safely be said that if we are to appoint two persons possessing a knowledge of currency they must be chosen from the banking sphere. I take no exception to the term &#34;governor.&#34; The Minister stated that it would not be wise to change the name to that of managing director. He also said that if the Governor were taken ill, the Deputy Governor would be expected to take his place on the board. According to the bill the Governor will be an executive officer, with a seat on the board ; but nd provision is made for such a contingency - which I hope will not arise - as the Governor being laid aside by illness. The proposed new section 12  a  provides; -  </para>

                        <para>- I hope the committee will not agree to the appointment of a board of eight directors. What real purpose will the directors serve by meeting only once a month? Other honorable senators have pointed out that the policy of the Commonwealth Bank is laid down by the Governor of that bank, and the policy of the associated banks by their general managers. The Government urges that,, for the efficient management of the Commonwealth Bank, it is necessary to have seven other directors, who shall meet monthly, and be paid approximately &#163;50 a sitting. If there is a real necessity to appoint directors, they should be in closer touch with the Governor of the bank than a meeting once a month will enable them to be. The appointment of part-time directors, who will probably be more concerned about their own business activities than about the success of the Commonwealth Bank, will not result in the efficient management of that institution. I favour the present system of management, but, as the committee is not agreeable to that, I shall vote for any amendment that will make a blank in  the clause, and enable ns to provide for the appointment of a fewer number than is proposed. I hope that the committee will agree to reduce the number of directors. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the reason why six directors have been suggested in addition to the governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. There is to be one from each state. The Minister pointed out how vital it was, in his opinion, that each state should have representation upon the board. The clause is about the most unworkable in the whole bill. I asked the Minister how often he expected the board would meet, and he said, perhaps once a month, and in times of great financial importance the board would probably meet once a fortnight. It is absurd to expect gentlemen coming from each state to meet once a fortnight or once a month for the munificent salary of &#163;-600 a year. The object of securing representation for each state may be quite right, because members of the board would be &#171;m <inline font-style="italic">fail</inline> with the conditions in their particular states; but it is utterly impossible to expect them to maintain .themselves away from their home states and devote their time to the affairs of the bank for the salary mentioned. Some other suggestion will have to be made. Coming now to the personnel of the board, a further absurdity is revealed, tt is provided that the board shall include two persons who are, or have been, associated with manufacturing industries or commerce. I am wondering from which state those members will be drawn. If they are appointed from, say, New South Wales and Victoria, is it to be expected of them that they will give special consideration to the manufacturing interests of Western Australia or Queensland ? We hear most bitter complaints from Western Australia that the manufacturing industries of the eastern states have gone to almost any length to crush out factories in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the Government is to appoint one representative from each state. I want to know from which state the representative of the manufacturing interests will be drawn, from which state will come the representatives of those who are or have been associated with agricultural, pastoral, or other primary industries, and from which state will come the two directors who have a knowledge of currency. The proposal which has, to some extent, been forced upon the Government in another place is farcical. I agree with the principle that has been enunciated here, that the proper course is to settle upon the number of directors, and, irrespective of state interests, appoint the best men available. It should not be necessary to give special consideration to this or that interest as against the interests of the Commonwealth. I do not like the Government proposal, and I shall vote for the amendment to reduce the board of directors to five, because I believe that in doing so we shall be countering the pernicious principle which the Government has endeavoured to set up. The operations of the bank will not be hampered or interfered with, and the Government will be able to get away from its idea of state representation and appoint the five best men available. </para>

One honorable senator holds that a board of directors composed of eight persons is too- many, an-d should he reduced to five; another believes that five is too many, and favours three. Still another honorable senator is in favour of one man only. Taking the last objection first, I think we are justified in saying that one-man control of large institutions has proved a failure. Taking the Public Service as an illustration of my argument, we have seen men broken on the wheel of duty because of overwork. Now we have three men doing work which formerly was done by. one man, for the simple reason that </para>

It is fair to assume that they will be selected from the populous parts of the country and from particular states. &#34;We have, for better or worse, cer- &#39; tain states which are given over principally to manufacturing industries, while other states are in the pioneering stage of development.

I, therefore, have pleasure in supporting it, as I believe that it is necessary to hold the balance fairly between different interests, and between different state&#39;s. Particularly do I see the importance of having all interests represented on this board. I am in favour of having one director to represent the wage-earners specially. We need a man to deal with the control of the currency in the interests of the wage-earner. Later, I shall move in that direction, as by that means we shall have a board worthy of the work it will have to do - one which will make for the best management of the bank itself, and act in the interests of the -whole, and not merely a section, of the Commonwealth. </para>

He evidently assumes that, when a bill specifically sets out that a board shall meet not less than once a month, the minimum is to be the maximum. The same provision is to found in the act which constituted the Notes Issue Board. It is true that on occasions that board meets only once a month, but it is true also that it frequently meets at intervals of three or four days. A board constituted to control the Commonwealth Bank would meet  much  more frequently than once a month. I am not sure that

                    was not on safe ground when he suggested that &#163;600 was a rather  small  remuneration for the members of the board. If the honorable senator proposes that the amount should be increased, we can consider his suggestion later, but at present we are not dealing  with  that question. Most of the criticism of  this  bill is directed towards the size of the board, and the consensus of opinion seems to be that it is too large. Personally, I think that it is too small, and that if an alteration in the number suggested by the Government is to be made, it should be in the direction of increasing the number of &#39; directors. Although

If the board consisted of three directors, one of whom was to retire each year, a party could in two years, by making political appointments, obtain, control of it. Even with a board of five, that control could be obtained during the life of one Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly it could be accomplished in that way. I should prefer to see sixteen members on the board, one to retire each year. That would give continuity of policy without risk of undue political interference. The directors should have a reasonably lone term of office, so that there could not be undue political influence from anywhere. The temptation to use that influence will always be present to any party, no matter to what political creed it belongs, if there is a short-term board, and if within the life of one Parliament half of that board retires by effluxion of time. It is even possible within the fife of two Parliaments, because most political parties hold office for at least two Parliaments. As men automatically retire from the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank, others will be appointed to succeed them who will serve the political ends of the party in power. How this difficulty can be overcome, I do not know; but it is a danger which causes me to wish that the members of the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank could be surrounded with such protection as would make the risk of it as remote as possible. The number proposed to be appointed to the board is small as compared with the directorates of most central banks. The Bank of England has a governor, a deputy governor, and 24 other directors. Of course, the Bank of England is a very much bigger concern than the Commonwealth Bank, but as time goes on I hope that our institution will occupy in Australia, and ultimately in the whole world, a position corresponding with that of the Bank of England in the British Empire to-day. The board of directors of the Bank of France consists of a governor, a sub governor, and fifteen others. There are eleven directors of the Reserve Bank of South Africa. Each of the twelve reserve banks in the United States of America is controlled by nine directors. Even in the case of trading banks the directorates are large. The Western Australian Bank, which operates in Western Australia only, has six directors. The Bank of Australasia has twelve directors. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to mention that fact. In addition to functioning as directors of a central bank, the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank will act as general bankers. A proposal to load a comparatively small board with the tremendous functions of a general bank and a central bank is the quintessence of absurdity. I hope the committee will not agree to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> to reduce the board to five. That would be calamitous, but to go further, and accept the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> that this great institution which we hope to build up in Australia should be controlled by a board of three, would be even more so. </para>

                        <para>.- On the second reading I indicated that I had a number of objections to the bill, including the proposed board of management and its constitution. I. am glad to find that there is at least some divergence of opinion even on the ministerial side, and that there is a remote possibility, unless the big stick is used upon honorable senators opposite, of securing a reduction in the membership of the board. I do not want to make any adverse comments on the management of the bank up to date, especially by the late governor, but at the same time I hold the opinion that as the bank has developed the time is opportune to place its management in the hands of more than one man. I do not, however, think that the extraordinary increase suggested by the Government is justified. The proposal to make the selection on geographical grounds should not bo tolerated. </para>

                        <para>- It is a matter of no importance to me where they come from. If Western Australia can produce the best men I do not mind if they fill the whole of the positions oil the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank. I am also opposed to the idea of selecting directors from any industry. They should be chosen from those who have had wide banking experience. As a matter of fact, the banking fraternity of the Commonwealth has recently shown ignorance of banking when dealing with the exchange difficulty. It is a standing disgrace to the private banking institutions, and also to the Commonwealth Bank, that they have been absolutely impotent to deal with this difficulty. Those great stalwarts of private enterprise, who are represented in this chamber by henchmen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> are to-day in the same humiliating and disgraceful position that they occupied in 1890, when they appealed to the colonial governments to come to their assistance. The exchange position to-day should be successfully grappled with by the allegedly great banking institutions of the country. </para>

                        <para>- There is &#163;21,000,000 of gold locked up in the vaults of the private banks, and a similar amount in the coffers of the Commonwealth Bank. Yet those institutions are either unable or .unwilling to deal with a trivial problem such as has arisen  recently. The time is opportune to follow the example set by the managements of some of the big industrial concerns. The evidence clearly shows that our banking authorities are not the big men they are supposed to be ; they are, in fact, very small men, and the time has come for effecting a radical alteration. The employees of the bank should be given some representation on the board of management, and I ask the Government to agree that at least one of the directors shall be elected by the employees. In other services that is a common practice. </para>

                        <para>- I desire the word &#34;seven&#34; struck out, and provision made for the appointment of a smaller number of directors, and I am suggesting that the proposed board of directors should include a representative of the employees, as do the managerial boards of some large industrial concerns. It is recognized that the men who do the work of a concern should have some say in its management. I do not suggest that the employees should be allowed to elect a majority of the directors, hut, even if that were conceded, the board would not be more incapable of dealing with the financial position than the directorates of private banks have shown themselves to be. Individually and collectively, the bank directors are absolute failures, and they are obliged to ask this Parliament to permit the issue of notes against securities which they say they have in London. I hope the Government will abandon the idea of appointing the directors on a geographical basis. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> that his desire to remove the management of the Commonwealth Bank beyond the reach of future Labour governments will not he realized. I believe that, at the next election, the Labour party will be returned with a substantial majority in this chamber and in another place ; and, if we then discover that the present Government has taken advantage of its position to appoint to the Federal Capital Com mission and the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank men of their own political kidney, it will be our imperative duty to take whatever steps are necessary to revoke such appointments. Even were it necessary to appoint sixteen more directors to the board of the Commonwealth Bank, I should be prepared to do that. The Commonwealth Bank must not be crucified by a board of directors as it has been under the past management. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. It has never had a fair chance, but I do not admit that the Labour party has been responsible for its mismanagement. The management of the bank in the past did not do its duty. There are only 68 branches of the bank throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal to appoint eight directors would have some justification if the number of branches of . the bank had been greatly increased. The Bank of New South Wales, in addition to its head office and its Melbourne office, has 399 branches throughout the Commonwealth, and has only seven directors. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, in addition to its head office, has 232 branches, and only five directors. Yet we are asked to appoint a directorate of eight to control a bank having a head office and only 68 branches. I shall support the proposal to reduce the number of directors, in order to give the Commonwealth Bank the chance it has never had up to the present moment. I should prefer the board to consist of only three members, but, failing that, I shall support a hoard of five members which shall include a representative of the employees. </para>

Valuable time is being frittered away now, and I suppose that later on we shall be asked to agree to some all-night sittings in order that the Government&#39;s programme of business may be completed. I do not feel in a fit state of health for that kind of thing. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether, to oblige me, he will find out before we meet to-morrow if it is the intention of the Government to introduce to Parliament this session a measure to provide adequate pensions for certain officers, non-commissioned officers, warrant officers, and others who have been retired on allowances which are altogether too small to support them. I am asking the Minister to obtain this information to enable me to ask a question, without notice, to-morrow. </para>
