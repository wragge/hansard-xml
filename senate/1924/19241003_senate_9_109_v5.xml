                        <para>Mr.W. L. Smallhorn, the officer to whom the question evidently relates, acknowledges that he is the holder of 249 shares in the Elcho Island Naphtha Petroleum Company. </para>
                        <para>So far, however, as it has been possible to ascertain, there is no ground for believing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smallhorn&#39;s</inline> position as a shareholder in the company referred to has at any time been other than that of an ordinary shareholder, or that any of his actions in relation thereto has been of a dishonorable character. </para>
                        <para>Section91 (2) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922, provides as follows: - &#34; Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent an officer from becoming a member or shareholder only of any incorporated company, or to any company or society of persons registered under any act in any state or elsewhere.&#34; and it seems clear, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smallhorn</inline> was within his legal rights in becoming a shareholder of the company. </para>
                        <para>The company is one that was formed primarily for the purpose of prospecting and mining for oil, and for general mining purposes. </para>
                        <para>The branch which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smallhorn</inline> controls has nothing whatever to do with the granting of oil licences and leases, or with the administration of the mining and land laws of the Territory, and he was consequently not in a position where he could, by advice or recommendation, influence the administration of the law so as to secure favours or concessions for the company. </para>
                        <para>No justification has been disclosed for any suggestion that the holding of shares by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smallhorn</inline> in the Elcho Island Naphtha Petroleum Company contributed to, or influenced, in any way, the decision to accept the tender of the Boucaut Bay Company for the Northern Territory Coastal Shipping Service. </para>
                        <para>The tender was, as far as could be judged on the information available, the most suitable of those received. It was not accepted until after the Huddersfield. one of the vessels proposed to be employed under the tender, had undergone a special speed trial under the supervision of the Commonwealth Navigation Service, and it was a condition of the acceptance that certain improvements should be made to the accommodation, and a clean certificate from the Navigation Service should be forthcoming. </para>
                        <para>So far as can be ascertained, the Elcho Island Naphtha Petroleum Company held no shares in the Boucaut Bay Company at the time the tenders were under consideration. </para>
                        <para>The shares since allotted to the Elcho Island Naphtha Petroleum Company number 250, and represent anything&#39; but a controlling interest. </para>
                        <para>Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is not seen that any ground exists for imputing improper conduct to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smallhorn in connexion therewith. </para>

                            <para> As a result of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Melbourne in October-November, 1921, the proposals were embodied in a draft agreement printed and circulated to each of the State Ministers on the18th November, 1921, and circulated also at the conference in January, 1922. Each of the states agreed to the basis of payment, viz., one-fifth by the Commonwealth, and remaining four-fifths by the states on a per capita basis. At the conferences referred to, the States of Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia were in agreement generally that the works proposed by a royal commission (estimated to cost &#163;21,600,000), should be put in hand; but Victoria and South Australia, whilst accepting the standard gauge of 4 ft.8&#189; in., and agreeing that &#34;the adoption of a uniform gauge . . . essential to the development and safety of the Commonwealth,&#34; would not assent to the work being proceeded with for the present. Acceptance by the states&#39; was subject to approval of the respective Parliaments. </para>

                <para>This is a bill to approve an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government of Tasmania, by which the Commonwealth undertakes the collection of statistics in Tasmania for both Commonwealth and state purposes. I am sure honorable senators will approve of this object. The amalgamation of the work of collecting statistics will result in a certain amount of saving to the taxpayers. Instead of having two collections of statistics, and two printings of &#39; statistics, the work will be done by the Commonwealth office, and any statistics the state may desire, &#34;in addition to those compiled by the Commonwealth, will be printed. This agreement is the result of an amicable arrangement arrived at between the Commonwealth and the states in the interests of economy, and I hope that other states will follow the example of Tasmania. The amalgamation of statistical work is on the lines already adopted in order to have a common electoral roll. </para>

                    <para>- Yes, they will be taken over under certain conditions which are agreeable to the state and the Commonwealth, and will fully safeguard their rights. The Government of Tasmania is very anxious that this bill should be passed as early as possible, because it affects their estimates of expenditure, and will mean the saving of &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 to the state, at incidentally very little additional cost to the Commonwealth. The step which has been taken . is one which all honorable senators will, no doubt, welcome, and, therefore, I ask them to put the bill through all stages to-day, so that its passage through another place this session may be assured. </para>

                        <para>- No, I have only risen to elicit a little information. The Minister has told us that the State Government is extremely anxious to have the bill passed through as speedily as possible, because it is preparing its estimates of expenditure. If the bill does not go through those estimates will be higher than they will be if the measure is passed. The Minister has also told us. that the passage of the bill will mean a saving of between &#163;2,000 and &#163;3,000 to the state, and that the state staff, now engaged in compiling state statistics, for state purposes, will be taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The salaries of those who will be taken over by the Commonwealth will have to be paid by the Commonwealth. Probably other states will hand over their statistical work to the Commonwealth, which will eventually have to meet heavy additional expenditure in this respect. The Government should say if it is their intention to undertake the statistical work for the states, as is being done in connexion with the compilation and printing of electoral rolls. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am opposed to the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders at this stage. It would suit the convenience of the Minister if he submitted the motion after delivering his second-reading speech. If the Senate is then of the opinion that the bill is of an urgent character, there will probably be no objection to its remaining stages being taken to-day. Possibly the. measure may afford an opportunity to deal with matters other than those with which the Minister will deal. </para>

                            <para>- No. At the present juncture a royal commission is investigating the administration of the officer who has held the position of Commissioner of Taxation. Honorable senators have only to consider the position to &#34;realize that it would be inadvisable for the Government to re-appoint an officer while an inquiry into his administration is pending. The Government are, therefore, forced to consider the appointment of the Commissioner as an acting Commissioner until the inquiry has been concluded. When the Crown Law officers investigated the question of the appointment of an acting Commissioner, they raised a doubt as to whether the Government had the power to do so under existing legislation. This bill is simply to give the Government power to appoint an acting Commissioner, and nothing else. The Government propose, when the bill is passed, to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing</inline> as the acting Commissioner until such time as the inquiry has been completed and the report of the commission made available. In view of these facts, honorable senators will see that the measure has no relation to the desire of the Government to terminate the session. It is essential that the hiatus should be definitely closed. We should have power to appoint an acting Commissioner to control our Land and Income Tax Department. </para>

                <para>A little more than twelve months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Colin</inline> MacKenzie of this city, who for many years has been collecting valuable specimens of Australian fauna, generously donated his entire collection to the Commonwealth. This is one of the most handsome gifts that have been made for public purposes since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. MacKenzie&#39;s</inline> collection is the result of very many years of careful research and the expenditure of a considerable sum of money. It will . be known as the National Museum of Australian Zoology, and will form the nucleus of what we hope will one day be a more extensive collection to be housed, ultimately, at Canberra. It is regarded by the medical profession as an exceedingly valuable collection, especially for the teaching of medical science and the study of human anatomy. Some of the specimen ts are almost unobtainable now. In the opinion of scientists no fauna in the world is so . valuable for scientific research as the -Australian fauna, and particularly those forms of life, such as the platypus, which are rapidly becoming extinct. I understand that as much as &#163;6,000 has been paid in New York for a specimen of the platypus. The Government gratefully accepted the gift on. behalf of the people of the Commonwealth. The agreement for its acceptance has been drawn up, and, following the  judgment of the High Court in respect of all such gifts, it is now presented, in the form of this bill, for the ratification of Parliament. It is provided in the agreement that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Colin</inline> MacKenzie shall continue as the curator of the museum. In conclusion, I desire to express on behalf of the Senate and the people of Australia our high appreciation of the splendid public spirit which prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. MacKenzie</inline> to make the gift, and to express the hope that he may be long spared to act as curator of the museum and to continue his work in the interests of medical science. </para>

                    <para>It has always been the experience of taxation authorities in all countries, that more or less frequent amendments of taxation measures, especially of income tax assessment acts, are necessary to meet the ever-changing- methods and conditions under  which  the affairs of a community are carried, on. A further experience is the discovery of the insufficiency of existing legislation to achieve all that may have been expected and intended by the legislature. The unexpected limitations placed by courts of law upon, the words used in the statutes sometimes expose the revenue to loss or prevent taxpayers from obtaining those benefits which the law obviously intended they should enjoy. The experience of the administration of the Commonwealth law has been no exception to these rules. The Government is, therefore, introducing this measure in order to rectify difficulties which have been discovered in the existing law. The main features of the bill are: - </para>

The clearer expression of the present provision of the law which seeks to collect income tax on bonus shares distributed by companies out of trading profits derived since the 1st July, 1914, and on which the company had not paid income tax at the time the shares were distributed. The present act seeks to tax these shares under the general description of shares paid for out of the profits which the company is liable to include in its return for purposes of its current assessment. This wording, however, is not precise in stating what is a &#34; current assessment &#34;. The Crown Law Department has found difficulty in determining the correct legal meaning to be applied to the term. It  is  accordingly proposed to describe in the section those profits which will not be taxed when distributed in bonus shares to shareholders, thus leaving a residue of profit which would be taxed in the hands  of the shareholders if it is distributed to them in the form of shares. This provision does not, of course, affect the portion of the present law which imposes a tax on any trading or similar profits distributed by companies in cash to shareholders. I would remind honorable senators that the act exempts to a company and its shareholders profit resulting from the sale by the company of an . asset which <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> not acquired for re-sale at a profit. </para>

It frequently happens that long before its useful life has expired, an asset may be discarded because of the necessity to use a more up-to-date item of plant. Under the proposed amendment of the law, it will be possible for a taxpayer who replaces an item of plant with a, more modern article, to continue to receive a deduction in his assessment in respect of the discarded plant, until its cost has been recouped. In that sense a deduction for obsolescence of plant, &#38;c, will be allowed. The amendment will not permit a deduction to be made of a reserve of profit to provide for possible obsolescence.

                    <para>This is an important measure, which deals with the great problem of the diversified railway gauges of Australia. I propose to give the Senate a short historical review of the events which have led up to its introduction. Without such a review it would not be possible to obtain a proper conception of the bill. I have been somewhat amused at a section of the criticism that has been levelled at the proposal in this city. Those who have indulged in that criticism have entirely shut their eyes to the events of the past. The uniform gauge movement dates back a long way, but it assumed definite shape in May, 1920, when the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth met the Premiers of the states in conference, and it was decided that it was urgently necessary to establish a uniform gauge. In July, 1920, the Prime Minister again met the Premiers of the states. It was then resolved to appoint a royal commission to exhaustively investigate the whole matter, and to report upon the best means for unifying the railway gauges of Australia, and the probable cost of conversion. A portion of the resolution passed by that conference reads : - </para>

                            <para>- It was. It was also resolved that the Commonwealth, should bear one-fifth of the total cost, the remaining four-fifths to be borne on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis by the five states concerned. As a result of those resolutions two eminent engineers were appointed, one from Great Britain and one from the United States of America, with an Australian, who was not an engineer, as chairman. After exhaustive investigation they submitted their report on the 21st September, 1921, unanimously recommending 4 ft. 8&#189; in. as the standard gauge for Australia. They also submitted estimates for the conversion of the whole of the railways in Australia to a standard gauge at a cost of &#163;57,200,000, and for linking up the capitals of Australia, and the conversion of the broad-gauge lines of Victoria and&#39; South Australia, at a cost of &#163;21,600,000. The latter scheme was recommended by the commission, and was strongly advocated by the Commonwealth Government of the day. The commission definitely reported that it would not recommend, the adoption of the third rail or mechanical device, as time and money spent on that or any other similar device would be wasted. Its report was considered by the Prime Minister and the Premiers, in conference, in November, .1921, and again in January, 1922. That conference unanimously agreed to adopt 4 ft. in. as the standard gauge for the Australian railway system. It was further agreed that the adoption of a uniform gauge was essential to the development and the safety of the Commonwealth. It is important to stress  those essential facts. First of all, the Prime Minister and Premiers, representing the different governments, agreed to appoint a royal commission and to abide by the decision of that commission. After the commission had reported, they adopted its recommendation regarding the standard gauge, and passed a resolution declaring that the adoption of a uniform gauge was essential to the development and the safety of the Commonwealth. The adoption of the 4-ft. 8$-in. gauge as the standard for the Australian railways was a marked advance, because it definitely indicated to all the Governments of Australia that that was the standard, and the various railways commissioners, irrespective of the system controlled, knew that in planning for the future they must take into consideration an ultimate general conversion to the standard gauge agreed upon. Although the conference in November, 1921, and January, 1922, agreed that the adoption of the uniform gauge was essential to the development and the safety of the Commonwealth, an agreement to commence the work could not foe arrived at between the whole of the five states affected. But, realizing the importance of the work, the Commonwealth Government has not allowed the matter to rest. A great deal has been written, and pamphlets, &#38;0. have been distributed, keeping the matter before those responsible for railway extensions, and before the people of Australia generally. In May and June, 1923. shortly after the present Government came into power,, a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was held, at which the gauge question was again fully considered. As there was no possibility of arriving at agreement between the whole of the states concerned, the Commonwealth put forward certain proposals : the one, a first instalment of the uniform gauge work, namely, the provision of a standard gauge railway between Sydney and Brisbane, via Grafton and Kyogle - the subject of the bill now before the Senate - the other, a connexion between Sydney, Port Augusta, Kalgoorlie and Fremantle. Agreement again not having been arrived at, the Governments of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales and Queensland considered giving partial effect to the&#39; recommendations of the royal commission by linking Sydney and Brisbane by (a) the construction of a railway of standard gauge between Kyogle, in New South Wales, and South Brisbane, in Queensland, so as to connect Sydney and South Brisbane; and (6) the re-grading- and relaying of the existing railway between Grafton and Kyogle in order to bring that railway up to a prescribed standard. This work represents the construction of 97 miles of new railway. 70 miles being in Queensland, and 27 miles in New South Wales, as well as the standardizing of 85 miles of railway between North Grafton and Kyogle, in New South Wales. Several conferences were held between the three parties immediately affected, and agreement has now been arrived at. The agreement, which is set out in full in the schedule to the bill, has been signed by each of the three parties, and contains the following : - </para>

                    <para>The estimated cost of the works contemplated by the agreement is &#163;3,500,000, which it is proposed shall, in the first instance, be provided by the Commonwealth. Of this amount, &#163;800,000 is for standardizing the 85 miles of railway between North Grafton and Kyogle; the balance is for the construction of the 97 miles of railway between Kyogle and South Brisbane. The cost will he proportioned as follows: - The Commonwealth will contribute one-fifth, plus the amounts which Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia would have contributed if they had come into the scheme. New South Wales and Queensland respectively will contribute towards four-fifths of the cost in the proportion that the population of each of the two states bears to the total population of the five mainland states. The Commonwealth will pay interest on one-fifth, and, in addition, will,, for thu time being, pay interest on the shares which, had agreement been arrived at by all the mainland states, would have been paid by Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. This is to be subject to review as each of the states comes to agreement on the railway gauge proposals. New South Wales and Queensland will pay interest on their respective shares on a capitation basis. The earnings from the railway in excess of working expenses will be used to defray the interest charges on the capital invested in the following order: - Firstly, on the amount representing the sum which the states of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia would have contributed had they been contributors; secondly, on the amount contributed by New South Wales and Queensland; and thirdly, on the amount contributed by the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that the railway will be a paying one, and that the whole of the interest on the cost of construction will be met from the revenue received, with, possibly, something over. If all the mainland states had been parties to the agreement, the allocation for contributions would have been approximately: - </para>

Since then there has been a large reduction in the prices of these materials. The estimate was framed on trial surveys and inspections. When the working surveys are completed more detailed, estimates can be prepared. The royal commissioners regarded &#163;3,500,000 as a liberal estimate. That, estimate was prepared by the Chief Engineers of the Queensland and New South Wales railways, and was checked and revised by the royal commissioners, who went over the actual route with the surveyors from each state. </para>
                    <para>For some years the New South Wales&#39; Government has been extending its North Coast railway system, and there is now a through run from Sydney to South Grafton over a railway built for heavy and fast traffic. Between South Grafton and the present North Grafton station runs the Clarence River, which still has to be bridged. This work is being undertaken by the New South Wales Government as part of the northern rivers railway scheme. It was not included in the estimates of the royal commission, and is not part of the uniform railway gauge scheme, but the bridge, which is estimated to cost between &#163;320,000 and &#163;350,000, should be in readiness by the time the works comprised in the agreement are completed. </para>
                    <para>I have stated that the royal commissioners went over this route in the course of their investigations. The route was also, at the instance of the Commonwealth, inspected in May, 1923, by the Chief Construction Engineers of the Commonwealth, New South Wale3, and Queensland. The trial survey from Kyogle to the Queensland border was carried out. by the New South Wales Go.vernment some time ago, and the permanent working survey is now in hand. The permanent working survey on the Queensland side is almost completed, and plans and sections are being prepared Which will enable the work on that side to be undertaken practically as soon as the necessary legislation is passed.  The survey on the New South Wales side is not so far advanced as in Queensland, but it can be pushed forward as may be necessary. </para>
                    <para>Legislation has already been passed by the Queensland Parliament, and as soon as. the necessary measures are passed by the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Parliaments, the council to control the work will be appointed in terms of the agreement. There will be no delay on the part of the council in commencing the earthworks so soon as moneys are made available by the Treasury as provided in the agreement. Tn addition, tenders could then be called for rails, sleepers, and other requisites. It is anticipated that the work will take from three to three and a half years to complete. </para>
                    <para>At times there will probably be over 2,000 men employed on the works directly associated with the building of the railway and the standardizing of the section from North Grafton to. Kyogle. </para>
                    <para>This railway is not a work which comes within the scope of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. The Crown Solicitor has definitely advised that, as in the case of the Murray River  scheme, it is not one for the committee. </para>
                    <para>The scheme recommended by the royal commissioners, of which this is a part, is estimated to cost &#163;21,600,000. The scheme provided for the following works: - (1) Constructing a railway from Kyogle . to the Queensland border, and from the Queensland border to South Brisbane: (2) bringing to standard the railway between Grafton and Kyogle, in New South Wales; (3) conversion of the broad-gauge lines of the Victorian and South Australian systems; (4) a new bridge, with necessary, deviations, over the Murray River at Murray Bridge, in South Australia, and bringing to standard the existing trunk line between the Victorian border and Adelaide; (5) a direct standard gauge line from Adelaide to Port Augusta; (6) provision of a standard gauge railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, linking with the trans-Australian railway. The &#163;21,600,000 scheme was not to connect capitals only, but it also included the conversion of the Victorian and South Australian broad-gauge railways. The foregoing shows definitely the work estimated to cost &#163;3,500,000 is part of the main uniform railway gauge scheme. It is not possible at the present time to do the whole of the work, but the South  Brisbane-Kyogle-Grafton  railway is the first instalment of the scheme. </para>
                    <para>The disabilities of the present system are manifest to all. From a railway stand-point Australia is divided into compartments, each system working independently. Trade and commerce are seriously hampered, and from a military stand-point the system is bad. At various times, while I was Minister for Defence, I discussed this matter with officers occupying high positions in the Citizen Forces of the Commonwealth. One difficulty which they always pointed out, and which is not generally appreciated by the community, is that not only must men and guns be now transhipped from one gauge to another, but it is impossible te concentrate the whole of our resources in railway rolling-stock at any given point. In the interests of the defence of Australia it might be necessary to concentrate a great mass of railway rolling-stock in one state. </para>

                            <para>- We shall only reach that stage by degrees. This is the first step in that direction. If the capital cities of Australia were all linked w.p with the standard gauge, it would be possible for the same rolling-stock to travel from Brisbane to Perth. I have travelled over the trans-Siberian railway, the journey from Moscow to Vladivostock occupying ten days. For six days of that time we were in the same carriage, which during that period ran almost continuously at the same speed of about 35 or 40 miles an hour. Apart from the broad-gauge lines of Victoria and South Australia, no matter what the condition - whether railway business is brisk in one state and slack in another, or whether one state is pressed te its utmost, whilst another state has rolling-stock lying idle - there can be no interchange of stock. Australia has experienced in the past severe droughts, and no doubt we shall again have to contend with them.. At such times the railways throughout Australia play a most important part in transferring stock from the drought-stricken areas. Australia, unfortunately, suffers from periodical droughts, and in times of drought a system which would give free transport of wagons from one end of Australia to the other would be of the, greatest value. We cannot forget the trouble early in 1920. New South Wales was suffering very severely from drought conditions, whilst there was ample fodder in Victoria. The stock could not be transferred from New South Wales, nor could the fodder be transferred from Victoria except under stupendous disabilities. In one day the number of trucks at Albury, or approaching there, loaded with fodder was well over 800. Train after train conveying fodder was halted, unloaded, and re-loaded at the border. Transfer charges, agents&#39; fees, irritating delays, and losses, all found expression in the shape of increased charges to the consignee, already cruelly hurt by the drought. This fodder was dispatched from Victorian stations to the farthest points of the New South Wales railways, and took weeks to reach its destination. </para>

                    <para>I shall not speak further on the general , question, apart from .saying that Australia can never advance as it should advance until there is a uniform gauge of railway, enabling uninterrupted flow of traffic from one end of the land to the other. Trade and commerce between the various states is growing with a consequent increasingly heavy burden of transhipment at the various  breaks-of-gauge  stations. Miles of railways are  being  built each year. That costs will grow with every year of delay is proved by the following illustration, applying to the permanent way of the Victorian railways :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">Recently the Commonwealth called for tenders for locomotives. They are to be built in Victoria, but they cannot be taken by rail to where they are required; they will have to be taken there by steamer. . The establishment of a uniform gauge will be a stepping-stone to cheaper rates and freights, and will considerably relieve the taxpayer&#39;s burden. </para>
                    <para>It is now being realized that the main evil of a break of gauge is not the mere handling charges of goods transhipped, but the serious holding up of rollingstock at each point of transhipment. The economic waste through this cause is greater in Australia than the public can estimate. An examination at one of the break-of-gauge stations showed instances of delays to wagons of as; much as eighteen days, a period of time which with a unified gauge would have been sufficient to permit the wagons to cross the continent and return again. </para>
                    <para>Great Britain had breaks of gauge, and fortunately corrected them before too late; but our comparison would be better with the United States of America, whose extent of territory is practically the same as that of Australia. In that country, conversion was effected in 1886. There were seven different gauges in the United States of America, and approximately 13,000 miles of railways were converted. They saw the wisdom of it, and&#39; converted the gauge in 1886. Would anyone say they would have gained an advantage by delay? An authority on the question has said: - </para>

Recent conferences, inaugurated by the Prime Minister, have acknowledged the ultimate necessity of a uniform gauge on commercial; and industrial grounds, but do not appear to have fully realized its vital necessity in the interests of the safety of the Commonwealth. A most important step forward was taken at the conference of the Prime Minister with the State Premiers, in Melbourne, in November, 1021, in the decision to adopt the 4 ft. <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> in. standard gauge; but the next step, i.e., the definite determination that the work of unification should commence, is not even in view. </para>

The Commonwealth Government cannot come to an agreement with all the states to carry out the whole scheme; hut it is pleasing to tell the Senate that an agreement has been arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Queensland concerning a very important standard gauge connexion which will give uninterrupted railway communication between. Sydney and Brisbane. That is provided for in the bill now before the Senate. It will shorten the journey between Sydney and Brisbane by about 100 miles. The journey will be made in at least seven hours quicker than by the present route. The line will avoid the heavy grades over the Liverpool and New England  Ranges  in New South Wales, and the Great Dividing Range in Queensland. In the New England Range, the present line runs to an altitude of 4,500 feet. </para>

Transhipment of perishable products, with inevitable handling and delay, means wastage and loss. It neither gives to the producer nor benefits the consumer.

The Commonwealth will continue to keep this important question before the state governments. The scheme having been launched cannot stop, and negotiations will continue with the states, so that as agreements are arrived at, and moneys are available, this great national work will be continued until at least there is a standard gauge connexion between each of the capitals, and the whole of the Victorian and South Australian broad-gauge railways have been converted. </para>
                    <para>After long negotiations, the three parties have come to agreement. The agreement prepared by the Commonwealth has been signed complete. The Parliaments of New South Wales and Queensland are in session, and a. bill has been introduced in the New South Wales Parliament providing for ratification of the agreement, while the Queensland bill has already been passed. As before stated, a working survey of the railway has been completed from South Brisbane to the Queensland border, and the working survey on the New South Wales side is now in hand. When legislation has been passed by the Commonwealth and the states, the Railway Council will be formed, and there will be no delay in actually putting the work in hand. The Commonwealth and the states have agreed as to the urgent necessity for a standard gauge. They have also adopted 4 ft. 8  in. as the standard, and the work covered by the bill now before the Senate is the first concrete step towards the establishment of that very desirable object - a standard gauge railway for our Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>I ask honorable senators to discuss this bill from a national and not a parochial stand-point, and to disregard for the time being, state barriers. I ask them to remember that no country with the complex industrial and commercial system that Australia has can make progress without railways, and that Australia, perhaps more than any other country, is dependent for its development on railways, because it has no great natural waterways such as the Mississippi. If we are to be content to shut the states up into compartments, and prevent free commercial intercourse by means of uniform railway communication, our country will not develop. &#34;We should take a wider view, and, by passing this bill, show the people of Australia that the Commonwealth and Queensland and New South Wales have decided to make a commencement, in the belief that the other states will see the advantage of coming in, and will assent to the carrying out of those portions of the scheme within their borders. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is the annual measure which Parliament must pass in order that income tax for the current financial _ year may be collected by the Taxation Department. As in the case of all previous bills, the schedule to the present bill sets out the rates of tax which were imposed for the purposes of the first income tax assessment in 1915-6, and clause 5 of the bill imposes the additional tax which is necessary to give effect to the decision of the Government, to reduce the 1923-4 rates by 10 per cent. In this connexion, the bill follows the precedent created in previous rates acts which have provided for reduction in rates, by imposing the additional tax at a reduced percentage of the basic rates set out in the schedule to the bill. The- 1923-4 rates of income tax were the basic rates set out in the schedule, plus 38 per cent, thereof. The present bill provides that the 1924-5 rates shall be the basic rates set out in the schedule, plus 38 per cent, thereof. This means that the 1924-5 rates will represent a reduction, as nearly as practicable,, of 10 per cent, on the 1923-4 rates. It will be noted that no reduction in the rate of tax payable by companies is proposed. The bill re-imposes the tax of 12^ per cent, on all prizes in lotteries, and provides that that tax shall continue to be collected until a date fixed by proclamation. As previously explained in connexion with the Income Tax Assessment Bill, the intention is to enable the Parliament of Tasmania to impose on lottery prizes in its state a super-tax equal to the present Commonwealth tax. When the State Parliament takes that action, the collection of the present tax by the Commonwealth will cease. As we have now reached the end of the business on the notice-paper, I trust honorable senators will agree to continue the discussion on this measure. No advantage will be gained in this instance by adjourning the debate until next week, as a similar bill is annually introduced. The only difference in this instance is that provision is made for a reduction of 10 per cent, in the income tax. </para>

                            <para>- I am well aware of that, but we can forward a request to another place. The notice-papers of the last few days show that at least three or four bills relating to amendments of the. Income Tax Assessment Act have been before this chamber. The whole system of income taxation has become so complicated that no one is- able to understand it. I realize that it is necessary to reimpose the rates every year, but this measure gives us an opportunity to suggest the reduction of taxation under the existing system. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has not told us to what extent the revenue will suffer - not that  I  am concerned in maintaining the revenue at its present high level - by the proposed reduction of  10  per cent.  I  invite the attention of honorable senators, and particularly the. protectionists in this chamber, to what is occurring.&#39; I notice in the press that, notwithstanding our policy of protection, our Customs revenue is persistently increasing. During the present quarter, there has been a further increase, and if the figures I have read are correct, we shall have an increase of  &#163;7,000,000  over the amount estimated by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> This is in strict accord with the idea underlying the policy, of protection. There are still some ill-informed persons in our midst who support the policy of protection, in the belief that Custom duties are imposed to exclude foreign-made goods. The system has been adopted, however, merely to extort revenue from unsuspecting citizens. As there is a clear indication of the revenue benefiting to the extent of several million pounds in consequence of the heavy import duties imposed, the time is opportune to effect a reduction in income tax. When we rob a man of his income - it is nothing short of robbery - we are preventing him from investing his money in various directions and thus providing additional employment. </para>

                            <para>- It does not. I do not know what moved the Government to consent to a reduction of  10  per cent, on the income tax. Considering the buoyant state of the Customs revenue and the additional trade expected from Canada and. other countries, the Government might agree to the House of Representatives being requested to reduce the rate by  20  per cent. When the bill  is in  committee, it is my intention  to  move  in  that direction. </para>

Department to deliver letters containing money orders to Tattersall&#39;s, or to any person representing that institution. Indeed, if  a  person uses his telephone for the purpose of communicating with Tattersall&#39;s, the department,  if it  has any knowledge of the matter, will disconnect the telephone. This has been done. Yet if an investor is lucky enough to win a sweep, the Taxation Department takes  14  per cent, of the winnings. Altogether, the attitude of the Government towards lotteries is sheer hypocrisy. </para>

                        (New South Wales)  |&#34;12.48&#93;.-  The Minister stated that the bill proposed to reduce taxation by  10  per cent. It appears to me that, instead of decreasing taxation, the measure will increase it, because clause  5  states that in certain circumstances an additional tax equal to  38  per cent., shall be payable. Can the Minister say where there is provision for the reduction of  10  per cent. ?

Looking around the chamber I am pleased to notice the effect which that alteration has had upon honorable senators. The thinness of the attendance is not complimentary either to the Government or to those who persuaded it to alter our sessional orders, so as to reduce to one hour the usual luncheon adjournment of one hour and a half. My purpose in rising was to point out the immorality of taxing prizes that are won in &#34; Tattersall&#39;s&#34; sweeps, and to show tha large amount of revenue that the Government is obtaining by that means. Out of a total prize money of &#163;27,500, prize winners have received only &#163;16,875. The remainder has gone to the Government. In addition to this taxation, the Government also benefits monetarily through the </para>

The postage in respect to every ticket purchased in &#34; Tattersalls &#34; amounts to 4|d., and, in addition, 2d. is charged for a postal note of the value of the cost of the ticket. Therefore, on 100,000 tickets the Government derives from this source a revenue of &#163;2,700. The winner of a &#163;5 prize) &#39;receives only &#163;3 12s. 6d., the&#39; balance being made up by taxation, exchange, and bank charges. That is unjust.

                            <para>- I should like the Minister to make it quite clear whether the bill or the schedules provide for a reduction of 10 per cent. I have looked through the measure very carefully, and instead of proposing a reduction of 10 per cent., it distinctly says that an additional tax equal to 38 per cent, is to be levied on incomes in respect of which the tax is calculated under the first, second; or third schedule. I am at a loss to understand why the fourth schedule has been exempted. These schedules have always been a source of great distraction to me. They are, of course, an essential part of the bill, and without them a tax could not be imposed. Before we proceed any further the Minister should state whether he proposes to amend the bill to  provide for a reduction of 10 per cent, in the taxation to he imposed. </para>

He then went on to say that the bill provides for  an  additional tax of only 38 per cent. How do those figures effect the object of the bill, which is to bring about a reduction of the tax by 10 per cent.? On the Minister&#39;s own showing the reduction will be greater than 10 per cent. </para>

I recollect the time when we first considered the income tax schedule. We all looked very wise, and adopted it without question. When the Statistician a few days later was hauled over the coals by a Sydney professor, he withdrew his first schedule and submitted another to effect the purpose desired. We again looked exceedingly wise, and agreed to it without question. Prom that day to this no one has understood the schedule. </para>

Queensland, unfortunately, has made its system uniform with that of the Commonwealth in regard to income taxation, but it still adheres to  a  graduated scale, which he who runs may read, in respect to land taxation.  That  system should be adopted for calculating the income tax. Although&#34; I may be as  a  voice crying in the wilderness, I enter my protest against this schedule, in the hope that the Government will soon introduce a graduated scale which can be understood and pub it into operation. </para>

                        <para>. - I again express my emphatic objection to the continued existence of this schedule for the purpose of calculating the income tax payable by citizens of the Commonwealth. Unlike many people, I find great amusement in making mathematical calculations, but I admit that it is a most difficult matter to grasp a proposal of this kind. Some time ago I discussed this question with a number of young men from the Duntroon Military College, who were travelling to Western Australia. I had with me a copy of the act, and also the demand which had been made upon me by the commissioner for my annual donation to the department. The conversation turned upon these schedules. All those young men considered that they could solve the problem in a few minutes, but I doubted their ability to do so. They were all well educated young men of from sixteen to eighteen years of age, and were very confident. I supplied them with the formula, and the amount of income derived both from personal exertion and from property, and asked them to work out the amount of the tax. After a time they returned with the problem solved, but when I compared their answers, no two were alike. Nor did any of them agree with the assessment made by the department. If a problem of this .kind was set before the members of the Federal Parliament, I doubt if any two of them would supply the same answer.- I will go further, and say that I doubt the ability of many officers of the department, without the aid of costly calculating machines, to calculate the amount of tax payable. </para>

                    <para>Some time ago I was in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whidden&#39;s</inline> office in connexion with the department&#39;s assessment of tax on my income. He called in three of his officers to work out the amount, and each of them arrived at a different answer. He himself made a calculation, which resulted in a sum less than that arrived at by any of his officers. That amount I paid. The Government should take this matter in hand, as the present system is not fair to the citizens of this country. In New South Wales it is an easy matter for a man to calculate the amount of the state tax on his income. This contraption, or whatever it may be called, is an importation from Germany. There is supposed to be a scale of taxation, but the steps are so small as to be almost . imperceptible. When incomes from property and from personal exertion are both dealt with, the curve shows a substantial bulge. In the case of a company the bulge is more pronounced, while if it is an absentee company the. bulge is still greater. All the schedules are equally complicated and unnecessary. I realize that it would be useless for me to move an amendment, because of the majority at the back of the Government, but I voice my protest against the continuance of the present system. Thousands of pounds have been spent by the department in importing machines from Switzerland, and other foreign low wage, protectionist countries, to calculate the income tax payable by Australian people. Some day I shall ask for a return to show how much these machines have cost, and what benefit, if any, has been derived from their use. In his last report the Commissioner complained strongly that the cost of administering the act had been greatly increased because of the obscurity of its provisions necessitating the use of costly machines, without producing any substantial increase of revenue. That sort of thing should stop. It is worse even than the Customs taxation. Some simple system, such as land values taxation, should be adopted, so that every one would know the amount he had to pay. If the Government accepted a fiat rate of so much in the &#163;1, on the same basis as now operates in New South Wales, probably the difference in revenue would not be very great. I see no provision -for the continuance of the &#163;300 exemption. Perhaps it is in another measure. </para>

                        <para>. -  I shall make another attempt to explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> and the committee, the meaning of the change from  53  per cent. to  38  per cent. In my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> we have not only a statesman but also a mathematician. He has given me an example which makes the position quite clear. Honorable senators must remember that, first, we had a basic tax, and that, subsequently, a super tax was imposed each year. The tax was increased as the war burden grew. The example handed to me by my colleague shows that the alteration in the bill does give a reduction of  10  per cent. It assumes that a taxpayer paid, at the basic rate, a tax of  &#163;100.  Under section  5  of the act of last year a super tax of  53  per cent. was imposed, making the amount payable by him,  &#163;153.  Ten per cent. of that amount is, in round figures,  &#163;15.  If we deduct that  &#163;15  from the  &#163;153.  we obtain  &#163;138,  or  &#163;100  flat rate, and  &#163;38  super tax, which is the amount of tax now payable. That agrees with the  38  per cent. referred to in the bill. </para>
