                        <para>- The slow progress made by this vessel is very unsatisfactory. Inquiries have shown that it is not due to any defect in the vessel itself, which, when carrying mails and merchandise on previous occasions, has proceeded at a much more rapid rate. There is nothing in the weather conditions to militate against a better rate of speed. Unfortunately, we have no means of recalling her, as she is not equipped with wireless. I am not aware of any warship being in the vicinity which could render assistance. </para>

                            <para>- In this matter we should endeavour to meet the convenience of all honorable senators, and should have as much regard for those who desire to travel to Tasmania as for those who wish to leave for Adelaide or Sydney. It is, however, not thought advisable that we should reduce the short time which we have available for the transaction of public business, and for that reason it is considered that on Fridays one hour should be. sufficient for the luncheon adjournment. This motion and the second one of which I have given notice, are for the purpose of meeting the convenience of honorable senators, and will, at the same time, retain the same amount of time as hitherto for the transaction of public business. . </para>

                        <para>. - I do not see the necessity for this change. We have continued under the present arrangement for a long time, and have managed to get through all right. When the Government wants to get through with its business, it is prepared to sit on until 4.30 a.m. or 5 a.m. An adjournment from 1 o&#39;clock to 2 o&#39;clock would enable most honorable senators to get a meal, but I do not know whether it would meet the convenience of Ministers. In a much less responsible position than Ministers occupy, I have found that the luncheon adjournment is sometimes not sufficiently long to enable me to prepare the information I desire. If we curtail the time of the adjournment for luncheon by half an hour, I can see that it will encroach on the only time which honorable senators have for discussing many matters connected with the business of the Senate. I suggest to .the Minister that the Senate should meet at 10.30 a.m. on Fridays. The Minister&#39;s only desire seems to be to save the half hour, and to meet at 10.30 instead of at 11 a.m. would give us the same time for the transaction of business as we now have. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that; but I fear that when we are working at high pressure in preparation for a recess the suggested arrangement might cause inconvenience. If the Minister will give an assurance that on no occasion will he persist in sitting beyond 4 p.m. on Fridays, I shall agree to the motion. I am not in favour of one-sided agreements. If the Government desires to sit beyond a certain time the proposal to do so is made a President&#39;s proposition, and the sitting is continued. </para>

                            <para>- Not only the hoof, but the tail and the fork as well. I have remained in Melbourne on several occasions - not recently, I admit - instead of going to my home in New South Wales at the week end, because the Government majority is sufficiently strong to cause an extended sitting. Let us have a hard and fast rule that the Senate shall adjourn at 4 o&#39;clock on Fridays, and I shall fall in with it. I see no reason why the Government should not adopt that rule. I realize the necessity of transacting the business of the Senate in a way that will meet the convenience of every honorable senator. I realize also that those senators who desire to catch the 4.30 train for Adelaide have not, at present, sufficient time in which to do so. Those who wish to travel by the 5 p.m. train to New South Wales are in a much better position, as it is seldom that they experience difficulty in catching their trains. The only time when difficulty arises is when the Government desire to transact some particular business about 4 o&#39;clock on a Friday. I hold different views from most honorable senators as to the business and duty of Parliament. If we have in office the best set of men for the transaction of a country&#39;s business, the time taken in debates on bills and motions generally does not matter a great deal. The real business is to keep in office the best set of men to conduct the affairs of the country. Some honorable senators may say that at present we are in that happy position: in that case I admire their modesty. But if the men at .present in charge of the affairs of the country are the best that can be provided by the other side, then debate in Parliament is&#39; necessary. </para>

It has suddenly discovered that it is necessary to alter the existing arrangement, after we have worked under it for 23 years, and are within measureable distance of meeting in Canberra - -where, I suppose, we shall sit every day in the week, for there will be nothing else for us to do. No institution at Canberra will be more interesting than the Parliament itself. I admit that this proposed alteration would be a convenience to me, and I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for the consideration that he continues to show me. I recognize that I must be to him quite a thorn in the flesh. I think it would be wise, however, to meet  half an hour earlier on Friday mornings, and to continue to have an adjournment of an hour and a half for luncheon.

                            <para>- There is a great deal to be said for it. I can foresee great advantages that would accrue if the Government completed its business at 1 o&#39;clock, and private members were under the necessity of keeping a quorum within the precincts of the House on Friday afternoons. I believe that such a proposal . would meet with the approval of honorable senators generally. I recognize that behind the proposal to change the hours of sitting, there is the desire of the Minister to meet the convenience of honorable senators. I hope I shall never be found in opposition to him when he is in that frame of mind. I notice that a number of contingent notices of motion appear on the business-paper to enable the Standing Orders to be suspended when the Government desires to treat a bill as an urgent measure. Supposing that that action was taken on a Friday. When the hour of half-past 3 arrived an unsophisticated honorable senator might rise and inquire of the  Deputy President  whether it was not time to put the question. He would be courteously and blandly informed that the Standing Orders had been suspended, and the business in hand would proceed uninterruptedly. Will the Minister agree to withdraw those contingent notices of motion and promise that he will not exhibit a desire to hasten the passage of any measure? After 23 years&#39; experience of the present system I am not sure that the Government is acting wisely in proposing to alter it. When one gets into a groove it is very hard to get out of it. There is not much advantage to : be derived from again of half-an-hour to-morrow when that length of time is Host to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that it is the desire of the Minister to meet the convenience of not only honorable senators from Tasmania, but all those who find it necessary to travel on Fridays. There are some who could depart for Africa with the assurance that we would provide a &#34; pair &#34; for them during their absence. It is not my desire to unduly occupy the time of the Senate.I do not know whether honorable senators want to discuss this motion, or whether they are prepared, without discussion, to make -this concession to those who are compelled to travel onFridays.Ifindthat increasing years and growing infirmity do not enable the human system to recover quickly from a tedious train journey. I have to make two train journeys a week,andwhen an all-night sitting is sandwiched between them, Ifindthat the wear and tear is too great. I have calculated that under our Standing &#39;Orders ten honorable senators on this side can, without an effort, legitimately hold up the business of the Senate for ten hours. I intimate to the Government that if an all-night sitting is again forced upon us, no government or , any other business will he transacted after midnight. </para>

The Government ought to proceed &#34; full steam ahead &#34; with its business. We shall probably before long have to take a holiday until business arrives from the other House. Business has not been delayed an this chamber except when the Minister has endeavoured to force a measure through too hurriedly. We on this side intend to see that no -Government business is transacted after midnight, and in attaining that result nothing more serious will happen than the removal from the chamber, perhaps, of an honorable senator. The motion proposes an alteration of the business hours, and that, to my mind, opens up the whole question of the business before us. By altering the hours we shall alter the sequence of business and the time available for its consideration. </para>

I have always opposed the alteration of Standing Orders that have been in existence and have acted satisfactorily for many years. In this enlightened age all men who work for their living are striving for greater freedom, and to that end they are curtailing the number of working days and lengthening each working day I shall, therefore, oppose the first motion, but I shall support the second.

                            <para>.- On Friday last the Senate waa in committee at 4 o&#39;clock. The  chairman  reported to the Senate that progress had been made. Then the Government .submitted certain other business, .alter which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> moved the adjournment of the Senate. It was then near the time &#39;for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> to catch your train to Adelaide. I was not aware of that .fact when I .rose to speak on the motion for the adjournment, but I happened to remark that it seemed irregular for the Senate to be sitting after 4 p.m., and thereupon the question, &#34; That the Senate do now adjourn &#34; was immediately put and carried. I contend that, if it was not right for me to s.peak on the -motion for the adjournment, Ministers should not have conducted any business after .4 p.m. I mentioned that the matter was irregular merely because I always object to any procedure that is contrary to the Standing Orders. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to speak at length on the bill, for I realize that it will become law as it stands. Much has been said by our friends opposite concerning the change -that has taken place in trie attitude of the great Labour party on the &#39;defence question. We &#39;have been told that we once stood -for an Australian Navy and for an adequate defence system, and that we have now altered the views we held in -1912. So far as I am concerned, I -stand to-day where -I stood then. At that time I favoured the best possible defence of this country. With our small population, and limited resources, we have to consider -the best means for the defence of Australia. As the result of experience, ideas formerly held on this question have changed so materially that before committing the country &#39;to heavy expenditure we should get expert evidence concerning the most efficient system for coastal defence, because our defence must necessarily he coastal. I have the greatest faith in the ability of the Australian youth .to defend this country. No .nation has a sufficiently strong mercantile marine to enable At to land an adequate force .for the invasion of Australia. Believing this, I think we should direct our attention to coastal defence measures. On this subject we have to remember that within recent years there has been an almost revolutionary change in naval defence views. Ten or fifteen years ago cruisers were considered necessary for the protection of our coast-line. To-day, there is a general belief amongst experts that an ample defence may be afforded by airships and submarines for one-half the cost of a naval defence force composed of modem cruisers. So great is my faith in the Australian workmen, and those leading them, that I do not think it necessary to go outside Australia for the manufacture of war equipment. We are in a much better position than many other countries of the world. We have all the necessary raw material, and if we concentrate upon &#39;She development of the great essential industries we shall have nothing to fear. There is no man m Australia who would not be prepared, if the need arose, to .defend his hearth and home from aggression. We all abhor wax. I hope I shall never live long enough to forget or forgive the .nations that caused .so much bloodshed in the recent great upheaval. It is my intention to quote the opinions of one or two recognized authorities upon naval defence, and, having done that, &#62;to direct attention to what I consider is a vital necessity in any defence scheme, namely, &#39;the manufacture in Australia of all the essential war -equipment. I .have consulted our greatest naval and -military authorities and others, who -ventilate their opinions in the columns of our newspapers. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 6th December, 19.21, there appeared this statement - </para>

                    <para>The Washington &#39;Conference continues &#39;to confound all cynics and pessimists. The -air has been cleared, suspicions have been .dispelled, ground has been given for reasonable faith in the honest desire of the nations (Britain, America, and Japan) to live together in peace and amity. </para>
                    <para class="block">That was the opinion of one authority. The writer of that article believed then that the Washington Conference had given us ground for reasonable faith in the honest desire of I he nations interested to- live together in peace and amity. We all believe that if there is a real desire for peace amongst the nations of the world, there will be peace. Why should not the men who have to bear the brunt of war be consulted? They spring from the class to which we all belong. If, among the nations, there is -agreement that peace is desirable, then there must be peace. I admit, of course, that we shall require a certain military and naval establishment for the policing of our territories and  coast-line,  and, if necessary, to suppress disorder from within or without. The <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> on the 27th December, 1921, stated - </para>
                    <para>The people of all nations will be relieved of the terrible burden of maintaining the vast machinery of warfare, and no nation will become the driven victim of its own machine. </para>
                    <para class="block">On the 28th November, 1921, that journal stated - </para>
                    <para>An efficient modern army may be created in a few months&#39; time. A nation&#39;s military strength is more than anything else a question of the fitness, the spirit, and the efficiency of the industrial organizations. </para>
                    <para>That has always been the attitude of the Labour party. It is gratifying to know that it is endorsed by one of the greatest newspapers in this state, and, perhaps, in Australia. We can best defend Australia by the adoption of the most modern methods. On this question, Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Percy</inline> Scott, one of the greatest naval authorities, states - </para>
                    <para>Another bogy put before Australians is that because of their enormous coast-line they must have battleships. That is just what they do not want. If the waters of all countries are protected by submarines, all waters will be wrong waters for battleships. </para>
                    <para>As submarines are superior to battleships, we should concentrate upon a policy of defending Australia by means of submarines and aircraft. The usefulness of cruisers in certain quarters cannot be denied, but to incur . heavy expenditure on their construction for the protection of our trade routes is to waste money. Submarines have become such a powerful factor in naval warfare that it is the duty of the Government to consider whether their proposal to construct two cruisers is in the best interests of Australia. Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Percy</inline> Scott also states - </para>
                    <para>There will never again be naval expeditions carried across the sea to any enemy port, the establishment of an advance base on his coast, and the pouring in of soldiers and supplies. This has been rendered impossible against any country that has adequate air and submarine forces. If our coast is protected by airplanes and submarines, no ship can reach our shores or land troops. </para>
                    <para>The success of transporting 2,000,000 men to France furnishes no precedent. It was not a landing on enemy territory. The German submarines were not operating in home waters. They had no air forces to act as eyes, to convey information or to co-operate in attacking our convoys. It would have been an entirely different proposition if we had attempted to land on enemy territory occupied by enemy forces through hostile waters held by enemy submarines operating in conjunction with an aerial fleet. </para>
                    <para class="block">According to that opinion, it would have been impossible to land troops in France during the great war if it had not been for the protection afforded by submarines. In formulating its defence policy, the Labour party has been guided by the valuable opinions expressed by numerous expert naval authorities, one of whom has stated that - </para>
                    <para>When Australia and New Zealand are properly defended with aeroplanes, submarines, and destroyers (as regards invasion), they will have nothing to fear. </para>
                    <para>For. the protection of or the destruction of sea-going commerce, fast light cruisers are required. This fact is apparently recognized by the Japanese, as they are building them as fast as they can. They will soon dominate the world in this class of vessel, which means they will command the commerce of the Eastern seas. </para>
                    <para>Although the members of the Labour party are opposed to the construction of  cruisers,  we believe that the most modern vessels of a smaller type should be made available for policing our extensive coastline. As the safety of Australia is not in any way menaced, it is unnecessary for honorable senators opposite to strongly advocate the employment of so many &#34; brass hats.&#34; This year&#39;s budget provides for an increase of &#163;60,000- in their salaries, but unless their work is to be of a more strenuous and useful nature than it has been in the past, such an increase is unwarranted. Australian citizens do not require much training, because the conditions under which they live enable them to enter the field and prove equal, if not superior, to those of other nations. </para>

                        <para>- On the outbreak of the great war, I, as an old volunteer, offered my services, but I was told that I was too old. and had better go home. However, I travelled to Great Britain on one of the transports with reinforcements for the 19th, 22nd, and 31st Battalions, and know that those men did not have more than two weeks&#39; training. They disembarked at Alexandria, were transhipped to France, and proceeded right into the firing line, where they rendered gallant service. I was one of those who a few years ago strongly advocated compulsory military training because I then thought it necessary; but in view of experience gained during the- war I have come to the conclusion that, apart from the men in charge of guns at our forts, and other military experts, extensive training is unnecessary. Greater attention should be devoted to the manufacture and storage of war equipment. It is alarming to be told that, according to one authority, notwithstanding the expenditure incurred in connexion with defence, we would not have sufficient to keep our men going for 24 hours should we be attacked. If the leaders of this great military movement have been so lax as to allow our defence system to get in such a state of disorder, it is time a change was made. I have such faith in our Australian men that I believe that even if they were without arms they would be capable of doing what the Russians did in the early part of the war - fighting with sticks.. Admiral Kerr, of the British Navy, spoke of -  . . the Australian line of defence obviously comprised of aeroplanes, submarines, and torpedo boats against which no hostile fleet dare approach within 200 miles. </para>

                <para class="block">From the opinions I have quoted, it will be seen that it is more economical&#34; and more effective to defend Australia, by submarines and aircraft than by capital ships. Vessels of 5,000 tons, or even 7,500 tons, could render more effective service in protecting our trade routes than ships of 10,000 tons. Z am opposed to the construction of two cruisers, but if Parliament decides that they are to be built, I shall advocate their construction in Australia. They can and should be Built in Australia. I say that emphatically. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has said, the difference between the cost here- and in the Old Country; so far as&#39; I&#39; am concerned, is absolutely nothing,, when we consider that by building- these vessels-here we shall train our artisans. What is the use of having- a dock,, or- machinery, if. we have not the brain and the muscle power, to- work therm? Some- critics: sa}&#39; that if we had trained men in Australia-, they would&#39; not be permitted to carry out repairs to the vessels, because &#39;Britain would require1&#39; them to- be made in her own country. If th&#39;at . were done, it would&#39; be * case of history repeating itself, because we all know that, in the last great war.,. Australia sent her trained mechanics,, by ship-loads, to; work in the factories of England. Probably they were of more use there than elsewhere, but I am not now discussing that question. If we are tso provide for the docking&#39;, and the repairing, of these vessels we must take care- that we: have the necessary brain power behind&#39; the machines. When,, years ago, a section of the British Fleet., was located in Australian waters, repairs to&#39; the vessel&#39;s were carried out at Gard&#39;en Island1. As secretary of the shipbuilders&#39; union, T was frequently in consultation with the authorities&#39;. A list of- available, and&#39; possible-, mechanics in- Australia was drawn up in order- to ascertain what men would be available to effect repairs&#39; should occasion arise in the future. That policy has been departed&#39; from. Our opponents, before attempting to criticize the Labour party, should first ascertain what are the ideals and intentions, of that party regarding&#39; defence?.

                <para class="block">I submit this amendment with; the object of. giving to every honorable senator the opportunity to assist&#39; in establishing, and strengthening Australian industries. In view of the* present position in Europe, . where we hope to see&#34; a course of action followed which will ensure the peace of Europe for many years, are we justified in spending so much money?&#39; The money proposed to be spent in the construction of these cruisers- should be used&#39; to build up our primary industries, and to&#62; provide munitions of war, and rifles:, to be&#39; stored in the training districts-,, while factories for thee manufacture of. flying machines and the necessary equipment connected therewith, as- well as for making, and equipping motor lorries and other necessary transport facilities should be established. Australia&#39;s position is different from that of any other nation. She- has within her borders the means of making, the country self-contained. Australia could accommodate up to 50,000,000 more people, and could supply them with food and&#39; clothing for any length of time&#39;. No other nation in the world&#39; could do that. If Australian industries&#39; were fostered, and the country became self-sustaining, we would not suffer so- greatly if a successful attack were made on our trade routes. Instead of doing that, we are allowing foreign countries&#39; to manufacture goods* for us. We even allow our late enemy - Germany - to take a1, hold of the industries of Australia.. She is- pouring into Australiairon and steel goods which,, if manufactured here, would provide employment for thousands-. Yet no&#62; protest is made by honorable senators, on the other side; In 1921 we imported, wheels for railway vehicles valued at&#39; &#163;200,000; galvanized, corrugated and other sheet iron, costing &#163;5,000,000.; &#163;4,000,000 worth, of steel girders ; nails and. screws to the value, of &#163;400,000,. and engines costing &#163;900,000. We are not manufacturing in Australia to-day the requirements of our great internal works. Even the North Shore Bridge,, for which I . am taxed, but which I shall, never see, is. being made  in. some other country. Instead of the money being&#39; expended&#39; in  Australia.  it is being distributed among the people of other, countries. Canada does not act in that way. In the construction of. her bridges, no. steel but that obtained in Canada is allowed to* be&#39; used. The same applies to the United States of America. The authorities, there will not allow a nail to be driven in her territory that is not manufactured in it. Penalties aT&#169; imposed ow any foreigner who dares to enter her territory and attempt to- interfere with her industrial life by bringing in anything, which is manufactured in what they term &#34; foreign &#34; countries. How can we hope to make guns while out iron and steel, industry is neglected, and. while the foreigner is encouraged to ply his trade still further among us? Obviously, we cannot build battleships at &#163;7,000,000 a time, nor can we compete with, the aggressive establishments of older countries&#39;. But when it comes tei single-seater land planes at &#163;2,500, and 4-seater flying boats at &#163;12,000, we can compete, and at the same time create an. industry. Bases for the submarines must be constructed at the same time as the submarines, so that when, in the event of hostilities occurring, the submarines are ready to attack a battleship, there shall be bases- far them where repairs can be effected and ships refitted. If we do that we shall then be in a much better position to defend our coast than that in which the proposals of this bill will place us. At one time a harness and leather accoutrement factory was established at Clifton Hill, Victoria,, by the Commonwealth Government, and also a cordite factory at Maribrynong. In addition, an acetate- of lime factory was established at Bulimba, in Queensland, and a small arms factory at Lithgow, in New South Wales. Most of them are now gone-. The harness factory is closed. The cordite factory has only a small staff, and I believe the acetate of lime factory has also been closed down,, while the small arms factory at Lithgow has: had its operations curtailed to such an extent that it would take a long, time to make the  rifles  necessary to equip our land forces.. Some people tell us that the guns made at the Lithgow factory cost too, much., I do not care how much they cost, so long- as they can do good service. The rifles now being used by the team competing in the Old World were- manufactured wholly at Lithgow from. Hoskins steel, and from timber obtained from Queensland. Those rifles have held their- own against the rifles of the world. In that case, what does it matter if they cost a little more? The Australian workmen live on a higher plane than do those of other countries. Are we willing to pay for that higher standard of Irving, or do we want to see that standard reduced, merely to obtain cheaper guns ? I think all honorable senators desire to&#39; see that standard retained. The Australian artisan has no one but himself to thank for his present conditions. During my long experience I have seen great changes in the industrial life of this country. I have lived to see the day when the working man is able to obtain . sufficient leisure in which to enjoy a. little more, of the life God has given him. I have seen our educational institutions greatly improved. I remember the time when a man had to rise at early morn, tramp down to a newspaper office, and strike a match to read the list of situations vacant in the sheet posted outside - in order to ascertain whether a carpenter at 6s. a day, or a bricklayer at 7s. a day, was wanted. In those days a. dozen men would tramp for miles looking for a job. As only one was wanted, the remainder were disappointed, and had to return carrying a load of tools heavy enough for a donkey.. Those conditions have changed. To-day, when an employer wants labour, he applies to the proper place for it - the labour bureaus which have been provided throughout Australia as the result of thoughtful legislation. The conditions of the working classes have improved, and every improvement has been gained by their own efforts, and not as the result of legislation., or of the actions of those who have held positions- of power and prominence in this country for so long. No honorable1 senator desires that those old conditions should continue. </para>

It does not matter what these vessels: or munitions- cost, so long as the money is spent in this country to provide better conditions for those who produce &#34;them. If we foster our steel industry and our other secondary industries, we shall be able to provide all the war equipment we require. Any money that is spent in naval construction should be spent in Australia. There are persons who decry everything that is manufactured in Australia. The other day I heard a great authority say that he was surprised that the Australian newspapers Should be so apt to decry the condition!! under which shipbuilding is carried on in Australia. Those newspapers do not want to find anything good in what the Australian workman has done and can do, but, on the contrary, they are always anxious to secure evidence to bolster up the contention that the cost of shipbuilding in Australia is much greater than it is in other countries. We should follow the example Set by other nations, and establish the shipbuilding industry. The United States of America especially is solicitous for the welfare of its shipbuilding industry. The Government of the United States of America, does not pay bounties to different industries as this Government does. The secretary of the Shipwrights Union recently wrote to the Collector of Customs in the United States of America, and he has been furnished with particulars of the conditions governing the bonus system in America.

                <para class="block">There is a great deal more, but I shall not weary the Senate by reading it at this stage. I think I have read sufficient to show that the shipbuilding industry is fostered in the United States of America.  We&#39; should follow that precedent. It is not necessary to go as far as America has gone, but we- do need to take action which will demonstrate that we are in earnest in our desire to establish the industry in Australia. I claim that the work can be done in Australia. Many years ago I mounted the soap-box in different parts of New South Wales, and contended that we could build locomotive engines in Australia as well and as cheaply as they could be built in any other country. At that time the engines were being imported at a price of about &#163;10,240 each. The Peacock Company - which, I think, is now defunct; if it i3 not, it ought to be - and other great builders immediately lowered their price to &#163;7,000, in order to prevent state competition. They failed in that endeavour. I read the other day that the Newport workshops are now building for &#163;5,500 engines that are bigger, heavier, stronger, better, and faster than they have ever been. Although wages have advanced and conditions of employment have improved, we can still build those engines more cheaply than they can be built in any other part of the world. We can prove ourselves just as capable of building a steam-ship. I am a practical shipbuilder, and I have a knowledge of this subject. The vessels that have been built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard are a credit to the men who built them and to the men who supervised their construction. When the <inline font-style="italic">Fordsdale&#39; s</inline> tanks were filled, the works manager donned an oilskin to make an inspection as usual. When he could not see a drop of water escaping, he said, &#34;Are the tanks filled?&#34; He was told that they were, and he replied, &#34; I have never seen the like of it before.&#34; And he had not. Not a drop of water came from that boat&#39;s bottom, although the pressure was up to 90 tons. The time occupied in its construction was not greater than would have been occupied in similar circumstances in other countries. Honorable senators must realize that there are opportunities for saving time when a number of vessels of the same type are being constructed in the big shipbuilding yards. The <inline font-style="italic">Fordsdale</inline> has made one trip to England, and her seaworthy condition and magnificent machinery were the subject of admiring comments by those who inspected her. If honorable senators read the British trade journals relating to such matters, they will find that it has been admitted that no vessel like the <inline font-style="italic">Fordsdale</inline> has ever previously been seen in England. That is a compliment to Australian workmen. Those workmen are prepared to construct not only steamships but also cruisers. 1 do not believe that the cost of constructing these two cruisers in Australia would be one penny greater than it would be in England. Our workmen are walking about looking for work. Hundreds of members of my union do not get sufficient to eat; they have to wait for casual work, and their average earnings are not more than 30s. a week. The management of </para>
                <para class="block">Cockatoo Island Dockyard is prepared to prove that cruisers can be built there the workmanship of which will be equally as good as that of the <inline font-style="italic">Fordsdale.</inline> The workmen are anxious to be engaged on the construction of these vessels. Why not give them the opportunity to show their skill, and at the same time build up a great Australian industry? Everything possible is being done to decry Australian industries by those who wish to derive profit from the importation of articles necessary for the manufacture of military and civil equipment. The, ironwork that is landed in Australia from other countries in one week would keep members of my union constantly employed for twelve months, yet the only employment this importation gives is that of removing the iron-work from the wharf. We should manufacture everything that is required in the way of equipment for military and civil life. When we do that we shall be providing adequately for the defence of Australia. Japan, in recent years, has become a. great ship-building nation, because she sent students to Great Britain to be trained by the British Ad,miralty. Those students were afforded every facility to gain technical knowledge. Germany and America also, in past years, sent students to Great Britain to obtain technical knowledge. On one occasion, in the early days, the late John Storey and I waited upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and pointed out that this work could be done in Australia. We then advocated - and the advice was acted upon by the Government&#39; - that certain bright youths be sent to Great Britain to learn to build submarine craft. These young Australians acquired the necessary knowledge, but to-day they are in the employ of private firms. The experience they gained is not being used for the benefit of the country in the way that was intended by the Government that sent them overseas. The population of the United States of America, when it began its shipbuilding industry, was very little greater than the present population of Australia. By its policy of exclusion that country kept out the foreigner and built up a great industry within its own borders. I do not intend to vote against the building of the cruisers in Australia, for I believe that Australia should have vessels to police its trade routes. W should have a few above- water craft for that purpose, tout I contend that the greatest measure of protection would &#39;be obtained by adopting the commonsense proposals of some of the greatest -military (and .naval experts &#62;o&#39;f to-day. These -men, benefiting by what was &#39;learned in the last war, realize that large ships are slowly but surely losing their prestige. Although Great Britain&#39;s food supplies must pass through the narrow&#39; lanes of the English Channel and other water-ways, and must be adequately protected, Australia is not so dependent as the Qld Country is .on outside sources for its foodstuffs and raw materials, and therefore is not in the same* need of defence of its trade&#39; routes by  means  of large warships. The proposal of the Labour party is practical and reasonable. It is quite within the realms of possibility  for Australia to establish munition factories sand foster the iron and steel industry, but this Government has not attempted to do so. If battle -cruisers axe required, we have the men in Australia who are &#39;capable of building them. <inline font-style="italic">{Extension of time granted.)</inline> It would be unnecessary to import any naval vessels if Australia had the requisite machinery for &#39;the development of the iron and steel industry. There would be no need to establish rolling mills for the manufacture of the heavy plates required in the construction of large cruisers, since Australia could be- well defended by a small but fast type of cruiser, the plates for which could be manufactured in this country. I asked the Commodore of the Fleet at a dinner held in Sydney recently what constituted a capital ship. Nobody seems to be able to .give a precise definition. One naval man told me it was a champion ship that could blow any other vessel out of the water. Another assured me that the capital ships were those that cost the most money. .From what I have read, J take the term to mean the most up-to-date war vessel that can be procured under the terms of the Washington Treaty. - Australia, however, does not need capital ships. Vessels half that size .and suitable for our defence could be constructed here in a comparatively short time. If we also provide a large fleet of aircraft, with the necessary fuel bases at suitable centres, we need have no fear of invasion. I have faith in the Australian people - not only those horn in this country, but those who have come from abroad to make their home with us. I point out, however, .that there is now entering Australia a brand of foreigner with whom we should promptly deal. According to press reports, at the Wonthaggi mine a &#39; number of foreigners are employed, and they cannot -receive the command to go in or out of &#34;the mine except through an interpreter. Such a condition of affairs should .not be tolerated. Our laws, which provide that these people shall pass an education test, should be rigidly enforced.

                    <para>.- I have paid close attention to the remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> and for many reasons I cannot support the amendment. In the first place, it would result in the &#39;bill &#39;becoming a dead letter. But apart from that aspect, I am not going to vote for this or any similar . amend&#93;ment until I am satisfied that it is advisable to adopt such a course. I wish - to say., first of .all, that I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> every credit &#39;far has independent attitude om the defence question. Although he stated that he -was not in sympathy with the -proposal -to construct a cruiser abroad., he showed that . he thought it necessary for Australia ito have an adequate defence system. Those honorable senators opposite, who preceded&#39; him, led us to understand, however, that because of their ideas of pacifism they did not consider it necessary for Australia to have .any defence scheme. It is refreshing to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> is not in accord with his party in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> upon his maiden speech in this chamber, but I was somewhat amused at his attempts to persuade the Senate that the Australian Labour party was a peace-loving organization. He would have us believe that it was the only party in Australia that desired! the Commonwealth to remain at peace with the world, or that the world itself should be at peace. It  was  a piece of audacity on his part to claim this&#39; virtue exclusively for his party. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber are equally desirous that Australia shall be at peace, and, generally speaking, I believe our political opponents give us credit for this sentiment. Every one who knows anything of the horrors of war, and there are very few who have not had its effects brought home to them in recent years in one way or another, is anxious that peace shall be maintained throughout the world. Listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> last night, one would almost have imagined that honorable senators on this side of the chamber belonged to a blood-thirsty military party, and that the dove of peace found a. resting place only in the ranks of his party. Let  us  examine the position, and see- where this peace-loving Labour party stands. Let us see what happens in the ranks of this party that believes in the brotherhood of man, and that no ill will should be borne by one person towards another. We have had some evidence on this subject recently in the state which I have the honour to assist in representing. A- few weeks ago the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> and the members of his Ministry found the atmosphere, of peace in the caucus so overpowering that they had to leave the room temporarily to get a little fresh air. </para>

If he will be patient he will find that I have a special message to deliver to him on this question of peace and brotherly love. As I was saying, when I was interrupted, we have had many examples of the. way in which these comrades of the Labour party, these advocates of peace, love one another. I remember reading, not very long ago, about a pre-selection ballot for the division of Cook. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riley,</inline> junior, got into the winning position, these lovers of peace in the Labour movement were so much concerned that they upset the first pre-selection ballot and held another. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riley</inline> again came out ahead of all competitors, these &#34;comrads &#34; who preach peace and brotherly love were so pleased and so animated with a desire to maintain peace that as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riley</inline> was leaving the room in which the pre-selection ballot had been held., some person in the room heaved an. empty beer bottle at him. </para>

                <para class="block">Duncan,  has just furnished another  remarkable  illustration of the manner in which the dove of peace is handled by these peace-loving, brotherly &#34;comrades &#34;  of  the Labour party.. It is, of course, sheer humbug and hypocrisy on the part  of honorable senators opposite to suggest that their party stand&#39;s alone as a paragon of virtue, and that they are the only people who believe in harmony, good-will, and the welfare of mankind. We know what is happening within their own ranks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself, always a peace-loving man, must, I am sure, admit that there is not so much brotherly love and peace amongst the members of his party as he would like to see. I read, recently, in one of the Sydney newspapers, of a conference attended by representatives of 130,000 unionists, under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden,</inline> a particular friend, I believe, of the honorable senator: On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden</inline> made some most unkind statements about certain members of the Labour executive, and also about the Labour representatives in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden&#39;s</inline> remarks did not give me the impression that there was quite so much peace in the Labour movement as one would expect to find in it, judging by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan&#39;s</inline> remarks yesterday. Practically the whole of the honorable senator&#39;s speech was directed to emphasizing the merits of the Labour party. It is as well, therefore, that I should in this way expose the party, and show the hollow mockery of these protestations of peace. All right-minded people are desirous of maintaining peace throughout the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> also referred to the attitude of France in connexion with the proposed evacuation of the Ruhr, and suggested that credit for this change in French, policy must be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, the rime Minister of Great Britain. I believe that this modification of French policy will make for improved relationships in Europe. I believe also that the advent of a Labour Government in Great Britain will do a great deal of good. This &#34;opinion I expressed some time ago, when we were dealing with the Singapore base proposal. I may point out, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald had an&#39; advantage over his predecessors, . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, &#39;and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stanley</inline> Baldwin. He conducted negotiations with a new Prime Minister of France, and&#39; we are all glad to know that French policy is now coming more into line with British views. I&#39; desire&#39; now to direct attention to certain inconsistencies in the attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> concerning the proposed construction of the cruisers and his views as expressed on another occasion recently. He stated, the other day, that even if the cruisers would cost &#163;10,000,000 to build in Australia, he would advocate their construction in this country. On a former occasion the honorable senator, referring to me, suggested that I reminded him of a certain personage who faced two ways. Reading <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> speech on the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> on the 3rd July, for the abolition of preferential trade with Great Britain, and his utterances on this bill, one would be tempted to place him in the category of persons who could face about ten ways at once. I have never seen any one loop the political loop more effectively, inside of four weeks, than the honorable senator has done.  His  advocacy of the construction of cruisers in Australia is the first occasion upon which, within my knowledge, he has favoured the building up of secondary industries in Australia. </para>

                        should realize that notwithstanding the existing methods of currency, bills of exchange, &#38;c, everything whittles down to the one question of who shall trade with Australia. If we are not prepared to take Britain&#39;s products we cannot expect to sell our own. If we say that we do not want to trade with the rest of the world, we shall find that Australia with 6,000,000 of people will be producing enough to supply 6,000,000 people, and we shall become probably the most poverty-stricken and miserable nation on the face of the earth.

                <para class="block">I commended <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> when he said that he was a big enough Imperialist not to want to keep all the good things for. Australia, because I thought he meant it. I have found, however, that he is not only facing two ways, but ten ways, and within a few weeks has turned a complete political somersault. I wish now to deal with the statements made by honorable senators in this chamber and elsewhere as. to why the Australian citizen forces are disorganized, and without adequate equipment. About two years ago a National Government submitted to the House of Representatives a comprehensive scheme for the equipment of our defence forces, and placed a certain sum on the Estimates to meet the - expenditure involved. On the 17th November, 19121, the Leader of &#34; the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> moved to reduce the vote by &#163;500,000, but the motion was defeated. Immediately the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who is now Treasurer, moved that the vote be reduced by &#163;400,000, which was agreed to, and, as a. result of the combination of the Labour party and certain members of the Country party, our defence system was thus seriously impaired. The inefficient state of our present system is, therefore, largely due to the action of the members of those two parties. </para>

The action of those two- parties on that occasion is an example of the mischief which can be done by members who fail to realize the responsibility of government. In consequence of the action then taken, the Government of the day were able to show a surplus, and a reduction iu taxation was suggested, but remission of taxation would be of little use to taxpayers, who were left practically undefended. The present Treasurer and other members of his party have since found that they acted very unwisely on that occasion. It was the unholy combination of the two parties on the 17th </para>

                        <para>- That will suit some to whom the honorable senator looks for votes. The Government is having a thorough and exhaustive inquiry made to ascertain what can be done in the way of building the cruisers in Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> spoke highly of the workmen of this country. With his remarks, I agree; but I am in the position to receive advice from men competent to judge, and they inform me that we cannot build two cruisers in Australia. They say that we can build one, and that the work will take about three and a &#34;half years to accomplish. As time is of such great importance in this matter, we cannot build the two cruisers here. Sofar as I am concerned, this is not a party issue, and I think that honorable senators generally will give me credit for not having made it such. I am exceedingly anxious that all work that can &#39;be done in Australia shall be done here. The question has been raised whether Australia&#39;s defence should consist of cruisers, aircraft, or something else. In this connexion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> quoted the opinions of various authorities. I -assure the Senate that the views of all those authorities were considered seriously by the best authorities in England. I am certain that the honorable senator had no desire to mislead the Senate when he ref erred to the increase in the defence vote, but he did not appear to understand me when I said that that money was largely for the rank and file. Of the &#163;69,000, the men who may be described as being on&#39; the bread-line will receive &#163;61,000. The balance will be paid to the officers. If we are to have a defence force, we should pay the men a reasonable living wage. I am certain that the honorable senator agrees with that.  His  statement that &#163;60,000 was for the &#34; brass hats &#34; is, therefore, quite misleading. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give the honorable senator that information offhand, but I shall be delighted to supply it later. I have given the total. Honorable senators are acquainted with the personnel of the committee which has been appointed to investigate this matter, and must realize that they are capable men who will do their duty. The committee&#39;s report will be available shortly, and, when received, it . will be submitted to Parliament. I suggest, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> should withdraw his amendment, at least for the present. It is my ambition that everything possible shall be done to have the work carried out in . Australia. If we are to have the plant and equipment, we must have capable men ready and willing to do the work should the necessity arise. That consideration will weigh with the &#39;Government when deciding on the additional amount which it is prepared &#39;to pay to have &#39;the work carried out in Australia. I think that the report of the committee will be that one cruiser can be constructed at Cockatoo -Island at a price which will compare reasonably with that for which the vessel can be obtained from England On that understanding, I ask Senator McDougall to withdraw his amendment. We are all anxious to do what we can, but we cannot build two cruisers in Australia. We are hopeful, however, that one can be built here. </para>

In that case there would be no endorsement by this Senate of the proposal that two cruisers should be constructed, either here or in Britain. The whole proposal of the Government would be hung up. That would be the effect of carrying the amendment. </para>

The motion is that the bill be now read a second time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> amendment proposes to strike out the words &#34; a second time.&#34; If they are struck out, the second reading of the bill will be defeated, in which case that will be the end of it, and the end of the Government proposal to construct the cruisers. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> credit for the best intentions, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> must know that that would be the effect of the amendment. I can, therefore, only assume that he is desirous of seeing the measure thrown out altogether. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot allow such an absurd piece of reasoning to pass without question. This amendment could not be moved in the committee stage until the items proposed to be amended were amended. If a majority of the Senate decided that the vessels should be constructed in Australia, the Government would need only to amend the bill, and it would go through this Senate very quickly. So far as my party in this Senate is concerned, nothing would be done to prevent it in that event from going through before the dinner adjournment. </para>

                            in his second-reading speech, was evidently passing through one of those phases peculiar to his temperament, and was feeling somewhat independent. He so far forgot that he was a servile supporter of the Government that he spoke as an independent member of this Chamber. He said that if it could be shown that the cruisers could be built in Australia, he would support an amendment to that effect. An amendment to that effect has been moved.-

                        <para>- Let me now deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> An attack upon me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> gives me pleasure, because I am glad that I can attract the notice of one who comes from Queensland with the reputation and the record that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> enjoys. I am sorry that that honorable senator did not read  my statement in all its awfulness. I said that if these vessels could be built in Great Britain for &#163;2,000,000, and they would cost &#163;10,000,000 to construct in Australia, I should favour building them in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> appeared to think that that statement was inconsistent with my free trade views. It was nothing of the kind. Ever since I have had the time to take an interest in the defence of Australia, I have advocated as our first line of defence the establishment of factories for the manufacture 6f defensive material. Senators Foll and Duncan advocate the imposition of high tariff duties to prevent foreigners from trading in Australia, trusting to private persons to establish secondary industries. lt matters not where these cruisers are built, so long as they are built in Australia. A growing country like Australia must have factories for the manufacture of Avar equipment should she be called upon to defend herself. Quite a number of persons innocently believe that high tariffs mean plentiful employment. I believe that they cause non-employment. The Labour party has progressed beyond that stage of thought. Its objective now is the socialization of industry. I do not believe in having industries built up under a high tariff, and then buying them out.&#34; I believe in saying, &#34;No longer will we subsidize the master class to establish industries; they must be established by the Government.&#34; I know that my ideas are contrary to those held by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> I wonder whether I could find evidence of inconsistency on the part of honorable senators opposite if I cared to look for it? When&#39; one talks of war or preparations for war they always parade their loyalty to Great Britain, but when one talks of trade they treat Great Britain as though she were a foreigner. In effect, they say to the British manufacturer, &#34; You must pay a fine of &#163;40 on every &#163;100 worth of woollen goods that you send to Australia.&#34; They would shed the blood of all their wives&#39; relations in fighting for Great Britain, but they would not trade with her. The attitude that I adopt is that if Great Britain can do the work as well as it can be done in Australia I should &#39; give her a share of that which we had to offer. . The all-important point, to my mind, is that if these cruisers are to be built they should be built in Australia. The adoption of that policy will mean that the machinery and equipment and skilled workmen will be available if it is found necessary later on to build a greater number of -vessels of a suitable type. The protectionist believes that the imposition of high tariff duties will bring about the establishment of factories and result in the employment&#39; of the people. Our statistics prove that such is not the case. High tariffs do not even relieve the Australian manufacturer of competition from outside. Last year &#163;35,780,000 was paid in Customs duties, proving that the tariff did not shut out the foreign-produced article. We now have a greater number of men unemployed than we have had since the tariff was first introduced, which is a proof that it does not provide employment in Australia. Here is  a proposal that will give employment to Australian workmen, who will reap the benefit of an expenditure of &#163;4,000,000, perhaps &#163;6,000,000-1 do not care what the amount is - on these cruisers. No profiteering manufacturer, no board of directors, no limited liability company, no proprietary company, will make any profit out of the Australian people, because the whole of the money will be placed in the hands of the workmen who do the work. That proposal is different from one which would result in the taxing of our people to enable a private individual to make profits. For the last four years the Australian people have been, paying &#163;6,000,000 a year more for their sugar than they should have paid. </para>

                        <para>- In case the honorable senator, who last night quoted Admiral Sturdee, should misunderstand me, I shall endeavour to make the matter clear. The production of sugar in Australia amounts to over 300,000 tons a year. A duty of Id. per lb. on that quantity would bring in &#163;3,000,000 a year. Under the agreement entered into by the Government1 with the sugar interests the latter have been receiving 3d. per lb. more than they would have obtained in ordinary competition. </para>

                <para>Senate GARDINER. - The question is: not what Australia wants, but what it can;afford to build. What is needed for an adequate defence of these shores- is quite beyond our means, and we should not attempt to provide it ; but if Parliament decides that two cruisers are needed, the Labour party contends that they should be built in our own country. Every ship, we construct here will make it easier for us. to build the next. Great Britain is the home of the ship-building industry, and. it is not to be wondered at that, at the present time, ships can be constructed more cheaply there than in Australia. I believe that during the war over 700 naval craft of various kinds were produced in British yards. It surprises me that anybody should fail to realize the importance of immediately establishing in Australia the shipbuilding yards and factories required to provide the vessels and materials necessary for our defence. It is not a matter of interfering with private enterprise, but of doing something for ourselves in a common-sense manner. We should have yards to enable us to build all kinds of naval vessels, and we should also have the machinery for making spare parts. Some people- will tell us that our shipbuilding yards are fully equipped at the present time. On that point I am not competent to express an opinion. If they are up to date, all the more reason for building these vessels in Australia. But if they axe not as well equipped as they should be, the sooner they are improved the better for the safety of Australia. To my mind, the weight of evidence is all in favour of having the vessels built in our own country. Unfortunately this cannot be done during the life of the present Parliament, for honorable senators opposite are unable to enforce their will against the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> told us that if the Senate voted for the amendment the bill would be thrown under the table. </para>

                        <para>- I do not desire to misrepresent the honorable senator, bub, if honorable senators opposite believed in giving employment to Australian workmen, the Government would at ounce say that both vessels would be built here. I have no desire to embarrass the Government,particularly on a matter of such vital importance as defence. I claim that steps should at once be taken to organize Australian industries so- that we may be prepared to defend ourselves. If the whole of the amount of &#163;2,500,000 were devoted to building vessels in Australia, the country would not be much worse off, from the point of view of defence, than it is at the present time. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is in earnest in this &#34;matter,. I am prepared to propose the insertion of a proviso to the amendment to the. effect that at least one of the cruisers should be built in Australia. I intend to vote for the amendment, because I want the vessels built in Australia. If the amendment is rejected,  and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> being sincere in their desire to have the ships built in Australia, will submit an amendment to have even one vessel built here, I shall support it. But I cannot see them doing that; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would frown upon them.. If I, as a freetrader, am inconsistent in advocating  the construction of cruisers in Australia, what may be said of those staunch protectionists supporting the Government who wish to have the vessels built in Great Britain? Instead of saying that I am ridiculously inconsistent because I approve of the expenditure of a large sum of money in Australia, rather than in Great Britain, for the building of cruisers, these so-called protectionists should examine their own position, and see what excuse they can offer for their inconsistency. Although I have not attended a meeting of the National caucus, I should say, that, judging by the speeches that have been delivered. on this measure by individual members of the party supporting the Government, a general election is not very far distant, because instead of discussing the bill, they have endeavoured to show up the Opposition in the worst possible light. Evidently they know something which we on this side cf the chamber do not yet know. I want the best that I can get for the defence of Australia. If we cannot have a defence system based on large numbers of aeroplanes and submarines, the next best thing is to build in Australia the vessels required for our defence. I stand for Australia first; not because I love England less, but because I love Australia more. And because I stand for Australia first, I want Australian workmen to build the vessels that will defend Australia. We have many thousands of unemployed in our midst. Surely it is not too much to ask that the money available for naval construction shall be expended in providing employment here. </para>

                    <para>. - My inclination is to approve of the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> but if its adoption means the shelving of the bill, I shall have to reconsider my position. I believe, however, that if  the amendment resulted in the defeat of the bill, the Government could, within 24 hours, bring down another measure to take its place, . so it would appear that the contingency, if it arose at all, would not be quite so serious as otherwise might be the case. I do not know whether the amendment, which seeks to control the destination of the money to be placed to the credit of the trust fund, is. quite in order. I do not propose to enter into a discussion of the respective merits of freetrade and protection, or the relative merits of honorable senators opposite and those on this side of the chamber. These matters may be all right in their place. I have no intention of debating them now. I cannot quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> attitude. He has told us that he is prepared to spend up to &#163;10,000,000 on the construction of these two cruisers in Australia, as compared with the estimated cost of &#163;2,000,000 each if the vessels were built in Great Britain. In other words, he is prepared to forgo the chance of getting five ships for two, provided the two are constructed in Australia. I am afraid the honorable senator&#39;s patriotism and his desire to relieve a congested labour market has carried him a bit too far.  His  declaration means, if it means anything at all, that so long as the cruisers required for the protection of Australia&#39;s trade routes were constructed by the Government in Australia, he would fix no limit to their cost. Has the honorable senator considered where that policy may lead us? Is he prepared to protect the governmental industrial concerns to the extent of 150 per cent. ? The principle laid down by this Parliament for private enterprise should be good enough for Government enterprise. What is good enough for the one should be good enough for the other. If tariff protection of 40 per cent, is enough for our secondary industries, surely it is good enough for any Government concern. Certainly, I cannot go to the length that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is prepared to go, and endorse the principle that we should pay 150 per cent, more for vessels, merely to have them built in Australia. It is an extraordinary proposition. It is just as necessary to take extraordinary precautions against extravagance in connexion with Government works as it is with private enterprise. I am taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> amendment. If it is introduced in the right way, and with proper safeguards, I shall support it. . The price to be paid is an important consideration. If the honorable senator will agree to fix a maximum of 60 per cent, and an arrangement is made with the British Government for the use of the second ship, I shall support his amendment. If, however, he does not see his way clear to do that, then, in the interests of the taxpayer, I shall support a proposal to have one vessel built in the Old Country, and the other in Australia, even if we have to fix a very liberal margin of cost. </para>

                <para>Let us examine the amendment and see what it means. Yesterday the Opposition, if we may judge by the speeches of its. members, was against the building of these cruisers, either in Great Britain or Australia. On high moral grounds, the Labour party yesterday urged that the ships should not be built in any circumstances, because, so we were told, the adoption of this policy would weaken the efforts being made by the  President  of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain to bring about further disarmament among the nations of the world. Yesterday the Labour party declared for no ships. To-day that policy is reversed. Now, they say, we must have the ships but that they should be built in Australia. What is the explanation of this change ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s reply is sheer nonsense. Principles that are sacred are not as a rule abandoned within 24 hours, as has been done in this case. Yesterday, we were told that the building of these ships, for the protection of Australian trade routes, would be in the nature of a gesture to the warlike nations of the world; that it would paralyze the efforts being made. by the  President  of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Lo and behold ! Within 24 hours the views of the Labour party have been changed. Now they say, &#34; Build the ships, but build them in Australia.&#34; We cannot play fast and loose with the logic of principles in this way. There are other people listening and looking on. A great churchman once said the principles of some people are like mountains towering as high as the heavens, but that when they stand in the road they drive tunnels through them. That is what the Labour party has done in this instance, because within 24 hours it has adopted an entirely different attitude on this vital issue. The elements of time and location should not change principles in this fashion. If these ships were unnecessary yesterday their construction is not justifiable to-day. </para>

                        <para>- The construction is justified if the work is done in Australia ! I can see one reason why honorable senators opposite have changed their attitude. They believe that if these ships are built in Australia they will be able to say to the electors, &#34; Look what we have done in providing work for the Australian people.&#34; That may be very good election propaganda, but we. have not yet reached that low level where we can allow our principles to be trampled in the dust in order to gain some party advantage through the  ballot-box. I repeat the offer I made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> in the first instance, that if he is prepared to accept the margin, and have the suggested arrangement made with the British Government, I shall support him. I ask leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is an optimist. There is a -first-class programme of private members&#39; business on the notice-paper:, and one which is more than sufficient for anevening&#39;s work. I take it that the Government will agree to what has been done in another place because experience has convinced me that very little effort is made by Ministers in this chamber to protect the rights of the Senate. When amendments are made in another place, it is the invariable practice of Governmentsupporters in this chamber to agree to them without the slightest opposition, but the time is approaching when the Government will not be so hasty in moving the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders merely to comply with the wishes of honorable members in another place. Possibly . I voted against the amendment which has been disagreed with, but as yet I do not know where I stand. In the ordinary course private members&#39; business would be considered to-night, &#34;but if this proposition is carried I shall not have an opportunity of submitting an important motion which I have on the notice-paper. </para>

                        <para>- I aim of the opinion that the time has arrived  for  private members&#39; business to be dealt with. Had the Minister&#39;s motion been carried before the adjournment, the case would have been different. As the Sessional Orders provide that on Thursdays, after8 p.m., private business shall take precedence, we cannot now alter that procedure. If that could be done, an unscrupulous Minister - I am not suggesting that that is the position in this case -could prevent private members&#39; business from being dealt with at all. The Sessional Order, which provides that private members business shall he dealt with after the dinner adjournment on Thursdays, has not been suspended, and the time having arrived for the discussion of that business, I take it that Government business cannot trespass upon the &#39;business of private members. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> motion is Government business, and, therefore, it is trespassing on the time which should bo devoted to the business of private members. </para>

I wish to take exception to the ruling you have now given, which, so far as I am concerned, is more serious than your previous ruling. You have ruled that I, having taken exception to your ruling, can be intercepted, so to speak, by the Minister, who before I have stated my reasons for my motion of dissent can move that that motion requires immediate consideration. I claim that the person who moves a motion of dissent is the one that the Standing Orders contemplate as the mover of the subsequent motion &#34; that the question requires immediate determination.&#34; I know that you will hold the balance fairly between the parties, but I want to release you and myself from the position in which we are placed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> motion. I have the right to decide whether the Senate shall be asked to say that the matter requires immediate determination. </para>

Orders by the  Deputy President  and see that any dissent was taken &#34;in accordance with the Standing Orders. &#34;We must bow to the decision of the  Deputy President  in this matter. I do urge the honorable senator not to place upon the Senate the unpleasant duty that his disregard of this appeal will entail. For the good reputation of the Senate, I ask the honorable senator not to press his objection. The Government must ask the Senate to uphold the- ruling of the Chair, and I appeal to the honorable senator, with his long parliamentary experience, to stand by the  Deputy President,  even if he thinks he is in the wrong. </para>

As a democrat, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should know that no democracy can proceed without order. Before taking the fina! step, I appeal to him to bow to the ruling of the  Deputy President  in this matter. We must obey the Chair, otherwise we shall descend from the position of being an orderly assembly to being an unruly mob. That, should not .be. Honorable senators, both on this side of the chamber and on the other,, whatever their differences of. opinion politically may be, ought to be prepared to stand by the  Deputy President,  and see that the Standing Orders- are &#34;observed. I again appeal to the honorable senator to bow to his: decision. Since he&#187; is- evidently determined not to comply with the readiest, I very reluctantly move - </para>

Personally, I cannot see that there is much difference between the two proposals, unless it is that the board will have the right to appoint two representatives instead of one. The subclause as it left the Senate provided that one member of the Appeal Board should be appointed by the board of directors and one by the officers of the bank,, with an independent  chairman  appointed by the board, but the amendment of the House of Representatives provides that in the event of a disagreement the board shall have the right to appoint two members. </para>

                        does not appear to have grasped the meaning of this amendment, which is really in favour of the employees of the bank. As the clause left this chamber the board of directors had the right to select two representatives, but the amendment provides: that in ordinary cases where no secrecy is involved it will be open for the representatives of the board and. of the employees to select an independent  chairman,  who may be outside the bank altogether.

                    <para>. - When the bill was first placed before the Senate no proper Appeal Board was provided for, but as a result of representations made in this chamber a clause was inserted to provide for the appointment of a board, one member of which was to be appointed by the board and one by the officers of the bank, with an independent  chairman  appointed by the board. The House of Representatives has agreed to our amendment with a further amendment providing that the representative of the board and the representative of the employees shall have the right to select an independent  chairman.  That is an improvement. If the representatives fail to agree upon a  chairman,  the board of directors will fill the vacancy. So far as I can see, the  chairman  need not be selected from any particular section so long as the representatives are in agreement as to his qualifications. </para>

                    HANNAN  (Victoria) &#91;9.14}. -I do not feel inclined to congratulate honorable members in another place on their action in amending the Senate&#39;s amendment in this way. The idea was the creation of an Appeal Board. This is the. first time that I have heard of men having to appeal to a board. which
                    <inline font-style="italic">is</inline>
                    controlled by those  against  whom they are appealing. If the board of management has the&#39; right to appoint a representative on the Appeal Board, and the officers of the bank the right to appoint another the  chairman  being appointed by the board, it only requires that the member of the Appeal Board who is appointed by the board of directors shall disagree with  the appointment of the  chairman  suggested, and the board of. management&#39; appoints the  chairman.  The  chairman  of the Appeal Board should be appointed by an authority outside the. control and influence of the board itself. I should prefer to see the right to appoint the  chairman  vested in the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Some person free from the influence of the board should be the  chairman.  Supposing it was a wages board, and that the employees had the power to appoint one representative, and the employers&#39; the power to appoint another; and that the latter had the right also to object to a particular  chairman,  this committee would not consider that an Appeal Board constituted on these lines would be a proper Appeal Board. Similarly, a board constituted as suggested in the amendment made by the House of Representatives cannot be looked upon as a proper Appeal Board.

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but the Appeal Board may deal with matters of more importance to the officers of the bank than their salaries. The question of their dismissal or suspension might arise. A man&#39;s honour might be at  stake. Because of that, the  chairman  of the Appeal Board should be some person free from the influence of the board of directors. While, on the one hand, this proposal is a slight improvement, on the other hand it gives to the board of directors the right to appoint its representative as the  chairman  of the board of appeal. It is not a reasonable proposal, and should be altered. I should much prefer to see the Treasurer of the Commonwealth given the power to appoint the  chairman. </para>

                    has placed his finger on the weak spot. If either representative objects to the  chairman  suggested, the board of management automatically appoints the  chairman.  That gets us back to where we were when the amendment left us.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline>
                    pointed to the way out when he suggested that, in the event of a disagreement between the two representatives on the Appeal Board, the Commonwealth Treasurer should appoint the  chairman.  I am content to allow the Commonwealth Treasurer or the Prime Minister to be the deciding party in the appointment of a  chairman,  as either of those gentlemen would be removed from the atmosphere of the board of directors.

                    <para>. - If the Minister can make the position clear by explaining the powers that will be exercised by the board, some doubt will be removed from my mind. It is perfectly true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, that the clause we are now considering was discussed at great length in this chamber a few days ago, and that at the close of the discussion the Government agreed to a certain clause, &#39; which was embodied in the bill, and sent on to another place. I believe that it was late on a Friday afternoon when this matter -was finally dealt with. The Leader of the Opposition in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner),</inline> in tacitly agreeing to the Minister&#39;s suggestion in regard to the Appeal Board, had in his mind that &#34; an independent  chairman  &#34; meant what it said, and that the  chairman  would, in reality, be independent. According to the statement made by the Minister, the  chairman  ie to be appointed by the board from the board. </para>

                <para>When a representative of the Bank Officers Association and a representative of the governor are appointed, they will be called upon to decide who shall be the independent  chairman.  The representative of the governor will probably desire to have as  chairman  an officer of the bank, but the representative of the Bank Officers Association will probably desire the choice to be made from those outside the service of the bank. If a deadlock ensues the appointment will have to be made by the board of directors, and I am disposed to think that it will take the view that one of its own members should be appointed. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that any person appointed to the position of  chairman  of the Appeal Board would observe the canons of etiquette in regard to confidential matters. I have a better opinion of the man who would be chosen to fill such an important position than to believe that he would disclose information of a confidential nature. Because I am not satisfied that the powers of the representative of the Bank Officers Association will be as great as those of the representative of the bank, I am not disposed to regard this as a great concession by the Government. As the Government has a majority in both Houses, there is very little hope of any further amendment being successful. If the Appeal Board does not realize anticipations, I hope that we shall have the opportunity later to improve it. </para>

                    <para>. - I approved of the amendment by the other House solely because I did not consider that we were strong enough to defeat the Ministry. Our endeavour has been to establish an Appeal Board to which we could confidently look to give the employees of the bank a fair deal. I do not think that they will get a fair deal under this proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> argument does not convince me that the bank would suffer by the appointment of a  chairman  from outside its service. I am sure that it is apparent to the Minister that the measure has not been improved by the further amendment made in another place. If the representative of the governor were opposed to the employees he would not agree to the appointment, desired by their representative. We should take whatever steps we can to have the appointment made from outside the service of the bank. The bank&#39;s interests will be best served by keeping the employees contented. The Appeal Board should be one in which they will have absolute confidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> has made the excellent suggestion that an independent  chairman  should be appointed by the Treasurer. That idea could be carried a little further by providing that the man appointed as  chairman  should be entirely dissociated from the bank. There are many men who could act in such a position with absolute impartiality. </para>

                    <para>. - I appeal to the committee not to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> amendment. It could only result in further delaying the bill, and it would not have the faintest chance of acceptance in another place, for the reason  that I have already given: No private bank in Australia is forced to permit its affairs to be scrutinized by officers of rival banks. The board of appeal might be dealing with the case of an officer who had to be disciplined for having made some mistake in operating my private account, and under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Giant&#39;s</inline> amendment an officer from another bank might be able to examine my banking account. If honorable senators opposite, who profess to be the champions of the Commonwealth Bank, wish to destroy the institution, let them accept the amendment of my motion, for it would have the effect of destroying the secrecy of the bank&#39;s affairs, and would do much to prevent the Commonwealth Bank from transacting any general banking business. The amendment by the House of Representatives is a fair compromise, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has made a dangerous suggestion which the Government cannot accept. </para>

The moment that is done we shall be taking the first and most direct step towards its destruction. If the  chairman  of the board is to be appointed by the &#39;Treasurer there will necessarily be the risk of the appointment being a political one. Honorable senators opposite, who supported the Government that introduced the original bill for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, saw no necessity for such an amendment as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> now proposes. I am entirely opposed to exposing to the public the business of the bank&#39;s customers, and I hope that the power to be given under the amendment from another place will be very cautiously exercised. </para>

                        <para>- I - I understand that, under the amendment made in another place, it is proposed that the representative of the board of directors, and the representative of the officers, shall be entirely free to select whomsoever they please as  chairman  of the Appeal Board, and in most cases they will probably select somebody other than an officer of the bank. The logical conclusion to be arrived at from the statement by the Minister is that the  chairman  of the Appeal Board must be an officer of the bank, otherwise there will be the danger of the business of the bank being made known to an outsider. I regard the proposal now before us as an improvement on the bill as it left this chamber. In most cases the appointment of an independent  chairman  will, I think, be agreed to, and I hope that in all cases it will be some one apart from the officers of the bank. In my opinion, the  chairman  should be a magistrate or judge. At any rate, the Treasurer in making a selection should see that he was a person accustomed to dealing with evidence. I object to the inference to be drawn from the Minister&#39;s statement that it would be dangerous to have as  chairman  a person other than an officer of the bank. </para>

I submit that I am entitled to give my reasons for objecting to the motion. We were given to understand that the notes were to be issued to the Commonwealth Bank for certain purposes. The Minister told us that the notes were not issued to private banks on the same conditions. They do not want them on the same conditions. In my opinion they will be able to get them under different conditions. This safeguard, requiring the consent of the Treasurer to the issue of notes to the Commonwealth Bank, was inserted by the Senate in. committee. I believe all honorable senators thoroughly understood the position, and desired to prevent the issue of Australian notes against foreign securities. I object to the elimination of this very wise and sane proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I find it extremely difficult to understand the amendment. Clause 16 of the bill amends section 60 of the principal act by omitting the word &#34; board,&#34; and inserting in its stead the words &#34; note issue department.&#34; The amendment of the Senate provided that Australian notes should not be issued to the bank without the approval of the Treasurer. I do not agree that the provision inserted by the Senate would in any way handicap the Commonwealth Bank. It appears to me that there is very considerable danger of the note issue being increased to an extraordinary extent. What is wrong with the provision inserted by the Senate? . </para>

                        <para>. - I protest against the Senate now adjourning, because I have a motion on the notice-paper dealing with the case of Lieutenant W. W. Paine, who, in my opinion, has been most unfairly treated by the Government. When I last brought this matter before the Senate, I stated the position in which this man had been placed, but no reply has yet been furnished. It is particularly unfair of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to take advantage of his majority to prevent discussion, and I can only enter my protest against the Senate adjourning when such an important matter is awaiting decision. </para>
