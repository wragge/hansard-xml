                        <para>. - During the debate on the first reading of this bill, I drew attention to the injustice suffered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Houghton, searcher and watchman of the Customs Department, Fremantle. I pointed out that for the heinous offence of taking a cup of tea at half-past 2 o'clock in the morning of the 12th June, 1923, whilst on duty - a water police constable having temporarily relieved him - he had been suspended, and tried by a board, which had returned the finding " Charge not proven." This man, who had been under suspension for five weeks, was thereupon reinstated. He incurred an expenditure of £37 for counsel's fees . and witnesses' expenses, and understood that, as in a court of law, the costs would be paid by the losing side. I read the correspondence which had passed between myself and the ex-Minister for Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. Austin</inline> Chapman, and pointed out that the ex-Minister had reprimanded the Collector of Customs, Fremantle, for having used language in the nature of a threat towards Houghton. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Yesterday, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in closing the debate, said that Parliament had appointed a Public Service Board to deal with all such matters, and that, in the circumstances, Parliament should not be called upon to deal with the case. Surely the Minister does not mean that the Public Service Board: is to be regarded as. above Parliament, or that any member of the Public Service is to be denied the right of redress through Parliament, which is the highest tribunal to which any man can appeal. If that is the Minister's idea of how the Public Service is to be conducted, then I suggest that he is wrong. The other point which the Minister tried to make was that the Public Service Board had decided the matter. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Houghton's</inline> case was dealt with by an appeal board, established prior to the creation of the present Public Service Board, and prior even to the passage of the bill authorizing the establishment of the Public Service Board. What is more, the regulations governing the positions of searchers and watchmen were framed after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Houghton's</inline> case had been dealt with by the appeal board, and as a result of the evidence adduced at that inquiry the regulations were made more stringent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Houghton,</inline> as I pointed out yesterday, has been in the service of the Customs Department for a great many years, and he has been commended by the Comptroller-General of Customs for his vigilance. In the circumstances, I submit that his case deserves more serious consideration at the hands of the Minister than it received yesterday. Again I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs in this chamber to look into the matter, and see whether, in view of the fact that the charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Houghton</inline> was not proved, something can be done to relieve him of the expense which he had to incur during the inquiry by the appeal board. </para>

Its purpose is really to extend the principle already approved by both Houses for the payment of the necessary money into the trust fund.

I have not the least objection to an increase in the number of sittings of the Senate. Personally, I care not how long we sit. It would be more in keeping with common sense and business methods, and more in keeping with the dignity of the Senate if wo were not obliged to suspend Standing and Sessional Orders to deal with emergency legislation. </para>

                        <para>- Our Standing Orders should be so framed as to enable the Senate to conduct its business without having to adopt this unusual course. It appears to me that since this Government has been in office the Standing Orders have been in the way, and that wo have been obliged to use these emergency powers, which the Senate retained when agreeing to the existing Standing Orders, to suspend them whenever the need arises. This course is objectionable. On the present occasion I am afraid to call for a division, because I am aware that, in order to suspend the Standing Orders, there must be an absolute majority of the Senate voting in the affirmative. I doubt if the Government can command an absolute majority. Yesterday the Government won by only one vote. Possibly certain honorable senators supporting the Government, after sleeping upon yesterday's work, may have come to the conclusion that this business of suspending the Standing Orders is not wise. Therefore, I do not feel disposed  to call for a division lest the Government be without the necessary majority to give effect to its desires. </para>

The amounts allocated to the various states, on the basis of population and area, and on the understanding that the states should also contribute towards the work on a £i for  .1  basis, were as follow: - </para>

                    <para class="block">It was provided that the work was to be carried out under certain regulations, and the money was to be expended on certain roads, as set out in the act and regulations. In only three of the states, viz., Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland, were there bodies, such as country roads boards, possessing the information enabling the work to be put in hand at an early date after the money was made available. In the other states, either no organisation existed or the assistance of the local bodies had to be enlisted. Moreover, the work being generally in remote parts of the Commonwealth, considerable survey and location were necessary to ensure proper expenditure. The result has been that up to date the combined expenditure of the Commonwealth and the states will not exceed  £250,000,  but work in all the states is now proceeding rapidly,, and the remainder of the vote should be expended before the end of  1924. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. The states have contributed on a  £1  for  £1  basis. Whilst the expenditure of the money in accordance with the requirements of the act is being carefully supervised, so as to obtain the best effect for the expenditure, it must be pointed out that only a portion of the work on the various roads could be done with the relatively small amounts available: for instance; there are roads which will ultimately cost  £50,000  or  £100,000.  The forming and clearing to the extent of some thousands of pounds could only be done this year, the ground requiring to be consolidated for preferably a year before the more important metalling could be undertaken. Thus, the expenditure in many cases will be either totally lost, or to a great extent lost, unless the work, which will extend over some years, is carried to completion. It is therefore submitted for favorable consideration, that there should be a further grant similar at least to the amount provided in  1923-24,  which, if available, could with advantage, it is  thought, be doubled by the states increasing the amount to £1,000,000. The act, with its regulations prescribing the character of roads and the method of construction, may be said to have been put into successful operation with but some few exceptions, in which, however, the difficulties have been overcome. In one state in particular, in which no .country roads board exists, and where the assistance of the shires had to be sought, some difficulty has occurred, as each of some hundred odd shires submitted its definition of the roads that would come under the definition of the act. This has necessarily meant some delay in dealing with the applications, and disappointment when the applications have had to be refused, but it is understood that this state will, like the ' other states, shortly have a central body, such as a country roads board, to deal with construction of roads, and thus the trouble experienced will be overcome. Again, in three other states where country roads boards did not exist, the Government placed the construction work under the respective Public Works  Departments.  It has taken some time to organise the scheme, but it is now in good working order, and giving effective service. This organization will be available in .connexion with future expenditure. I submit the bill for the consideration of the Senate. Now that a start has been made there should be no delay in spending .the money, and there is .very little doubt that the balance remaining from the last vote and the money now being provided will be spent during the coming financial year. </para>

The states are not likely to commit themselves to the initiation of a programme of work until the money has actually been set aside.

                            <para>.- Last year when a similar bill was before the Senate I protested against what I regarded as an encroachment on state rights. The State Governments and municipal councils are the best authorities to undertake the work of constructing and maintaining roads, and if the Commonwealth Government are anxious to devote money to the care of roads, the amount should be made available to each state in a lump sum as decided upon. Thus we should avoid coming into contact with the State Governments in a way that necessitates continual negotiations between the federal and state authorities as to whether the money provided is being spent satisfactorily and with the full approval of the Commonwealth. Otherwise the Commonwealth will be losing sight of its proper functions, and this Parliament will be dragged into a position it was never intended to  occupy.  Of course, if that comes about it will prove very useful to those who claim, as I do, that Australia should have one parliament only, but a large section of the community still objects to that idea, and adheres to the belief that .certain spheres of .activity should be marked out for both Federal and State Parliaments. It is certainly trespassing tn a state sphere for the Commonwealth to mix itself up in the business of finding money to build and repair roads. </para>

It would be a huge blunder to spend £1,000,000 to build new roads while there are old roads which are almost impassable. Before we commence to make new roads, which also will have to be kept in repair, we should keep in decent repair those now in existence. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose the roads in Cumberland County are the worst in the world. It is possibly the most densely populated part of Australia outside metropolitan areas, but as the people who live there know the value of good roads, and as there is a more intelligent atmosphere than was formerly the case, they have recently elected good "roads and bridges " labour members .of Parliament. Under the old system of electing members of Parliament it was  quite  natural for .their roads to fall into a .state .of disrepair, but <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> Labour Government set to work and proceeded to put them in order. .The Commonwealth 'Government is now making it .possible for members of the [Federal Parliament to go to a public department and urge the building of roads in ±heir .constituencies. An honorable member will thus be in a position to go -to his electors armed with a Government communication -that a proposal to 'build a certain road has been brought .under attention and agreed to, and it will be a great .recommendation for him to use when Tie is seeking re-election. This bill is. but another illustration of the incapacity of the Commonwealth Government to handle the finances. I have known plenty of people in private life to .be in  an  excellent .position financially when they had only .a .small amount of money to handle., and yet become quite reckless .and extravagant when they had large sums of money to handle. Despite the fact that for the last ten years Ministers have teen faced with most serious financial problems., they are always seeking for means to squander money. The fact that a measure lias been introduced to spend money on building new roads, at a time when the financial position of the Commonwealth is so grave, is a complete outrage. I am not opposed to the building of good .roads. If we had the money to spare, which we have not, and if we had so much cash in hand .that we were anxious to give gifts to State Governments, I would spend some of it in putting up plants for £he manufacture of cement .for the building of concrete roads throughout the Common wealth, so that 'State Governments and municipal councils could secure cheap material to enable them to have, not only roads, but good roads. The greatest evil in Australia is the fact that we have roads that are not properly constructed, or not constructed in a manner that will make them last. With the rapid development of motor traffic, good roads are essential 'but that i3 no reason why the Government should .seek -to extend the powers of the Commonwealth by dabbling in the construction of .such roads. I feel sure that if the work were entrusted to the properly constituted road authorities, it would be done better than by having too many people dabbling in it. I can understand a Commonwealth Minister bringing- to bear his great experience and declaring how good roads can be made, and -no doubt he will hold up the  expenditure  off .this money in order that he may be in a position to give his .advice to the constructing authorities. The money already voted has not been fully spent, and the blame for this sort of thing is always put on some one else. The Federal -Government blame the states, the states lay the blame ion the Federal Government, but -no one will accept the responsibility for the delay. If the matter is made -the responsibility of one authority only, we shall always be in a position to £x the .blame for an  ill-constructed  work. I -cannot understand where the urgency exists for the suspension of  the  Standing Orders of the Senate in order to rush through at one sitting a  measure  for the making of new roads. This sudden desire to tenter upon the task of building new roads is extraordinary -on the part of ;a Federal Parliament. 1 .could .quite understand the members of a shire  council  realizing the prompt need for having a road  built.  I could quite understand -representations being made to a State Government that a hew road should <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> built in a hurry. A State Government has its departments  in order, and officers available -,to make an immediate report .upon the .necessity for such a new road. I -cannot understand, however, a Federal  Government  with an 'overwhelming financial burden undertaking this sort of work at the expense of the workers of Australia, taxed so heavily as they are to-day, and as they have never  been  before. I think the Minister should give us some idea where these new roads will be built and some reason for suspending the Standing Orders of the Senate to pass the "bill. I could understand the urgency for passing a bill i;o provide money to repair existing roads, and making them passable to the great 'benefit of the community, but when the Government look about for places -where they can build new  roads,  -which -will get into the same state of disrepair as existing roads, I cannot understand the need for urgency, and I shall certainly call for a division on the second reading of the bill. </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that it is not the work of the Federal Parliament to interfere with the state and municipal authorities and to say what is to be done with the money expended within their borders. So long as it is expended in placing roads in the best possible condition and ' constructing a. road which is a mere track, no objection can be taken. It is not, howover, the responsibility of this Parliament to definitely state what particular road work shall be undertaken. That is not our job. In a case of which I know something we did not do that. The money was advanced to the states on £1 for £1 basis on the understanding that it was to be spent on main roads and on the construction of new roads. That is, I think, as far as this Parliament can go. I admit quite freely as an old politician that one may not obtain the same political advantages as if it were spent solely on new roads. </para>

                            <para>- Not in all the states. The state and municipal authorities should be able to say "where the money can best be expended. We receive a very large  revenue  in the form of a petrol tax, and also derive a large revenue from the duty on imported chassis. These are purely revenue duties. Parliament has deliberately imposed taxation in that form to raise revenue, and in view of the fact that the Government derives considerable revenue from these two sources, which are directly associated with the transport of goods and people within Australia, we have a right to find some of the money required for the construction and maintenance of roads. I am entirely in sympathy with the Government in granting money to the states on condition that they contribute on a £l for £1 basis in order to assist the local authorities in the construction of new roads, with the definition of new road's as I understand it. But I take the most serious exception indeed 'to the manner in which this is being done, and I think' that it is time Parliament deliberately refused, in future, to permit this system of finance to continue. What is the real object? Why is the Senate considering this bill at this juncture? Why have the Standing Orders been suspended ? The real reason is not that which the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> gave to the Senate. He knows that perfectly well. </para>

                            <para>- I say deliberately that the real reason is that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> does not wish to add this £500,000 to next year's aggregate budget figures. We are also being asked to deal with another measure, to which 1 cannot now refer, for precisely the same purpose. In last year's budget we had one of the most extraordinary examples I have ever seen of this sort of finance. </para>

                    <para class="block">Really the expenditure budgeted for was £1,250,000 more than the- aggregate budget figures disclosed, and we are having a repetition of exactly the same thing this year. The present practice must cease. I say that deliberately, because I feel that the country is not being given a fair deal. What is actually happening is this : We are asked to appropriate to-day £500,000 which is to be placed in a trust fund, and having been so appropriated, although the money is to be expended in the next financial year, it will not appear in next year's budget figures except «s expenditure placed to a trust fund. It will not appear in the aggregate figures for next year. We cannot continue financing in that way. We should frame our budget so that the country may know exactly to what extent it is committed each financial year. This measure has been introduced in this way and in this form to prevent the disclosure of what the aggregate figures are likely to be for the next financial year. Another bill which is now before the Senate has been submitted for precisely the same purpose. If its consideration were held over until next week, which would be in the coming financial year, instead of being passed this week, which is at the close of the present financial year, the amount involved would be included in the budget figures; but if it is passed this week instead of in next financial year the amount will not appear in the budget figures. That is not a fair way to treat Parliament and the country. I think the practice should cease. It may be said that the urgency is such that the money could not be found in time to permit this expenditure to proceed in the ordinary way. What has the Minister told us this morning? He eventually agreed with a statement made by his colleague in another place that the actual expenditure of the £500,000 voted last year was included in the expenditure of the year before, so that it did not appear in last year's budget figures. This was done by post-dating the actual trust account bill, as can very easily be shown by reference to the bill itself. He has also told us that only £120,000 of money has been spent by the Commonwealth, and that the Government hope that the remainder will be spent by the end of the present calendar year. It is perfectly clear, therefore, that it is not urgently necessary to appropriate an additional £500,000 to-day. The Senate should have the budget before it before being asked to agree to the expenditure of £500,000 in relation to next year's expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Of course. If the figures justify it the Government can say that they will vote another £500,000, but I repeat that we should still have the budget figures before us, as we would then be in a position to determine whether £500,000 as is proposed is sufficient in the circumstances, or whether the amount should be, say, £1,000,000 or £1,500,000. This method of finance is fundamentally unsound. We should not be asked to vote these large sums in advance of the  Treasurer's  'annual financial statement. We ought to have that document before us before we are asked to vote this money. Later on, perhaps, when it comes to another stage, it will be open to the Senate to take such action, as will present the views of the Senate to another place. I have said all 1 desire to say on this subject, and have endeavoured to put the case as clearly as I could before honorable senators. I agree with some of the statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> particularly in relation to taxation, which is to-day very heavy. I am hoping that when the budget is presented a number of the purely revenue duties which are collected to-day will be reduced so that the people may find some relief. I do riot wish to see relief given entirely to the rich man. Not in the least. During the period of the war and since, the taxpayers have been carrying an immense burden, which has been borne by the rich as well as the poor, and I am hoping that when, the budget figures are introduced, and we know the whole story, it will be possible to relieve the taxation burden of the rich as well as that of the poor. <inline font-style="italic">a</inline></para>

                            <para>- The Government are taxing the people of the Commonwealth, at a very much heavier rate, and in more directions than is necessary, in order to meet the abnormal and, to some extent, unforeseen expenditure. They are now at their wits' end as to how to dispose of the surplus. With an excess revenue amounting, to £11,000,000, the Government should realize that it is their duty <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> reduce the .taxation in a number of directions. What objection can there be to substantially reducing the income tax and raising the exemption to £400 or £500 ? That would afford relief to a large number of citizens, and to that extent would remove taxation from industry. The Government now insists, upon taxing people in proportion to the services that they render to the community. </para>

                            <para>- The Government does not know in what . direction the money will be spent after it leaves them. This proposal will have the complete approval of motor car and bicycle owners, as well as the owners of other means of transport. <inline font-style="italic">11.</inline> is an excellent vote-catching measure; but I' do not suggest for a moment that it has been brought forward with that object in view. It is altogether wrong- for the Commonwealth Government to make of itself a taxing machine-; and to hand to. the State Governments the revenue so raised. As those authorities in turn will band the money over' to municipalities, shires, and roads board's, a good deal of leakage will occur before it finally reaches the man who wields the pick and shovel. Those persons who, notwithstanding the vast resources of this continent, find it impossible to secure any employment, will, no doubt, be relieved to a certain extent by the expenditure of this money; but, if the go-slow policy of expending, only a fraction of the amount that is voted is persisted in, it 'is problematical when the total sum made available will be exhausted. It is, doubtless, true that if it is properly expended the primary producers will be enabled to market their produce more readily and cheaply. The raising of revenue by means of income taxation, land taxes, and Customs duties, and its distribution in dribs and drabs, is to me entirely distasteful. Those who expend the money are the people who should raise it. It is not a function of the Commonwealth Government to tax goods that are imported from low-wage countries, and to ladle out the resultant revenue to the states in this manner. The functions of the Federal . Government have been accurately defined in the Constitution. I defy any Minister to point to any provision in the Constitution which indicates an intention .to apply to road-making any of the funds of the Commonwealth. I realize the importance of placing a wide interpretation upon the class of road on which this money shall be expended. If the municipalities are to have control of the expenditure, roads that are in a bad state of repair may conveniently be characterized as roads that require to he newly constructed. 'The taxpayers' associations in the various states are clamouring very loudly for a remission of taxation, and they do not hesitate to specify the direction in which they would like to see the taxation reduced. One of - the immediate e'ffects of even a decision to construct a new road will be to immensely increase the value of land not only alongside the railways, but between the proposed new road and the main centres of population. The Government should repeal this act,' .and, by reducing taxation, absorb the surplus, which it is incapable of judiciously expending. It could then throw upon the local bodies the necessity  of  taxing land values. While ostensibly this expenditure is to be made 'for the purpose of giving employment  to  returned soldiers and others who are unable to secure  'Work,  a permanent effect will be the making of  a substantial donation to those who -own. land- adjacent to the roads that it is proposed to construct. Those persons should be -called upon to defray 9.9 per cent, of the cost of making those roads. It appears -.to me that the Government is -asking us to indorse a vicious system of taxation. I shall, therefore, vote against the- second reading <inline font-style="italic">sf</inline> the bill. </para>

I have been in the United States of America, and have seen the admirable roads that have been 'constructed there. Those roads are a splendid national asset. Because I believe -that the Senate is overwhelmingly in favour of the principle of the bill, I shall not refer further to it. I remind the Senate -of the difficulty that would be 'created if the criticism which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> ^Greene directed to the measure' were acted upon.

He suggested that we should include- this vote in the ordinary budget expenditure and have it debited to the financial year to which the budget applied. That was not done in the financial year 1922-23. The bill to which I refer was assented to on the 2nd July, 1923, but it was passed before the end of the previous financial year, and its provisions were made retrospective, so the amount was not debited to the year 1923- 24, but to the preceding financial year. </para>

And assuming that the Government policy with respect to expenditure for main roads development was continued, the accounts would show no payment at all for the year 1923-24. The year would be a financial blank so far as assistance to the states for main roads was  concerned,  whilst in the financial year 1924-25 provision would have to be made for two financial years. </para>

                            <para>- It is an absolute fact, unless, of course, we pass this bill in the next financial year, and make its provisions retrospective. But wherein lies the virtue of doing that? That course will not ensure the inclusion of the expenditure in the budget, and therefore does not quite meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> criticism. It would be merely doing the same thine; in another way. </para>

                            <para>- The effect would be to show an additional £500,000 surplus for this financial year, when really that amount was ear-marked for a definite purpose. Although the appropriation under last year's vote was made available early in the present financial year, owing to the delay in getting the local governing bodies in the various states into line, only £125,000 was expended in the financial year. But those local governing bodies in the various states have entered into certain liabilities. The probability is that contracts have been entered into for the expenditure of a great portion of the amount of appropriation unexpended. The reason why the Government in .1922-23 adopted the procedure which we have followed to-day, was that it wished to be able to give an absolute guarantee, through the various State Governments, to local governing bodies throughout the Commonwealth, that the money would be available. We could not have given that undertaking had we included the. amount in the ordinary budget expenditure, be cause usually the budget is not passed until later in the financial year, and the Government had to take action, in respect of expenditure for main roads .development, early in the financial year. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> suggest that we should provide for the expenditure out of the Treasurer's advance? There are really three alternatives. We may, if we choose, meet this contemplated expenditure out of the Treasurer's advance account : we may include it in the budget; or meet it, as now proposed, by passing this bill. The advantage of the present course is that we shall be able to give a guarantee to local governing bodies throughout the Commonwealth that the money will be available. The State Governments are entitled to know, because they have to prepare their own budgets. </para>

We should have to apply it to the previous financial year - that is, this year - otherwise the Treasury accounts would show no payments for this financial year into the fund.

We merely propose to do to-day what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> suggests we should do to-morrow. If we follow the course outlined by him there will be no provision for the expenditure of this money in the financial year now closing. If there was anything in the honorable senator's contention that this vote should be included in the budget, we could not make the expenditure retrospective. It would have to be included in the expenditure for the next financial year. </para>

The accounts for this financial year would show a blank, although, as a matter of fact, we had actually expended the money. </para>

My only regret is that the Government has not seen its way clear to make the amount available much large*. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that the Government had good reason for the course adopted last year of voting the money and making the bill retrospective. What the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has said is perfectly correct. If the amount is included in the budget expenditure, the accounts for the present financial year will contain no reference to the expenditure. It is simply a ques.tion whether we shall put the matter right from a strictly treasury point of view, or allow it to stand. </para>

                            <para>- The item must be shown in the national balance-sheet. Personally I think, with the Minister, that  the difference between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> suggestion and the Government proposal is the difference between tweedledum, and tweedledee. It really does not matter very much, because the expenditure will be shown in the accounts. A more important question is the condition under which the vote is granted to the states. The- treasury drew up certain conditions under which the money was to be expended, and, owing to- difficulty in getting one set of conditions for the whole of the Commonwealth,, there has been delay in expending the amount available-. Let me. take the case of my own. state. The conditions there differ very largely from, those in the other states. Tasmania has a great deal of hilly country and a heavy rainfall.  Every contract for the sale of 100 acres of land contains the implied' condition that a metal road' shall be- constructed to the land As a result, we have m Tasmania Between 5,00,0 and1 <inline font-style="italic">6,000 miles</inline> of metal roads. About 25 per cent, of the public- debt of. Tasmania is due to expenditure1 on* roads and bridges, and1 the effect" las' been to practically cripple <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> state*  financially.  The work has all been1 done8 out of loan money, and the municipalities have been unable; tew keep the roads in proper order. Australian engineers: can construct road's as well ass  engineers  in any other- park of the- world ;.  it  is- simply <inline font-style="italic">ai</inline> matter of hawing; sufficient money to carry out the work. The- light roads built  years  ago were  sufficiently  heavy for the&gt; class- of traffic then, in existence;, but.- with the. advent, of motor transport it is a, common) sight nowadays to see a. motor lorry with, a load of from 12 to 14 tons of produce or timber, bumping, along, our light, roads at a considerable speed'. Ordinary country roads were never intended' to carry such, heavy traffic, and  consequently  more costly highways have, become necessary. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GARDINER</inline> - The Commonwealth Government will not allow the states to use any of the road vote to repair such roads. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the revenue derived from that source is a mere drop in the bucket.. It is not too much to ask the Commonwealth to spend the whole of the revenue derived from motor traffic, directly or indirectly, on. main roads. A motor tax for the repair of those roads would be an unfair proposition, seeing that business motor cars are. often driven. 13,000 or. 14,000 miles a year., whereas many private owners keep their cars garaged for the. greater part of the time. We have a., petrol tax, and it would not be too much to ask the Com.monwealth Government to allow the money raised in that way to be used for road construction. </para>

                            <para>- They do. The honorable senator lives in Sydney, and perhaps is not fully conversant with the conditions' in the other states. In Tasmania* there* are- large areas of very rich land, but there are also very mud larger areas of poor- land1 oy which that land is- divided. As in- Gippsland', the land in Tasmania- is' very patchy. We- have hundreds of miles of  metalled  road's running through country- that is producing nothing and1 is- incapable- of being used' to- good advantage-. The land' is not worth more- than 10a1. an acre. and ir* merely suitable for wintering' a few cattle .or sheep. The-  residents  of the towns that ane- connected- by these roads have to pay for their upkeep', and5 the best method to adopt is  indirect  taxation:. - Everybody in the Commonwealth, whether' a shopkeeper in Sydney or a potato grower in. Tasmania, benefits, by good roads, .and a larger amount of general revenue could, equitably be spent for  the  purpose of obtaining the increased production that results from good high-ways. If a State Government came forward with a proposition to- build a new road in a- new district the Minister for Works and- Railways would, say, "Very well; that is just, the place where you can, spend, this money." If some of the roads, now in at  worn-out  condition, had not been built  by  the T.asmanian  authorities, the  Government would readily allow Commonwealth funds to be used for their construction.. But seeing that Tasmania has already built those roads, and now finds itself, unable to reconstruct them, it is unfair for the Federal Government to declare that Commonwealth money cannot now be spent on them. At least a reasonable proportion should be available for reconstruction purposes. I believe it has been decided to keep down the grades of the new roads to 1 in 20. I should like to see roads of no steeper grade than 1 in 30 if they could be obtained, but that is impossible in a great many parts of Tasmania. In consequence of the regulations framed by the Commonwealth authorities, the engineers have had to look about them to find places where roads to* fit the conditions laid down could be built, instead of being permitted to spend the money in places where it could1 be- used with the greatest benefit to the largest number of people. I have had a good deal of experience of the principle of making grants on the <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> for £1 basis, and I believe that if a municipality' or a State Government is prepared: to advance half the money for a necessary work, it is an earnest of their bona fides, and one need have no compunction in giving favorable consideration to their request to be allowed1 to spend the money. Where_ money is allocated on this principle, it is in the interests of the states to see that it is spent in the most economical manner, and in places where it will do most good. I am, therefore, convinced that the allocation of the expenditure could with safety be left very largely to the states themselves.  If the Commonwealth Government allowed the State Governments and the municipal authorities to decide in the main where the money should be spent, it would result in roads being constructed to the best advantage. </para>

                            <para>- Some Ministers, in the opinion of some people, are never reasonable. It all depends on the point of view. It will be quite possible, if a good case is made out, for the responsible Minister of any party to give consent to the expenditure of  money  even for much needed repairs. It is obvious, indeed, when we consider how few really new main roads have to be constructed, that much good cannot be done unless the money is partly used for reconstruction work. The main arteries of traffic are already laid down, and whatever new roads are now built will be merely veins or feeders. I think, therefore, that it is reasonable to say that the money should be spent for reconstruction work as well as for the making of main roads. The only other point on which I desire to speak is that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene.</inline> It is a point that escaped the notice of the Senate when the original bill was passed. The Leader of the Senate has said that there is not very much difference in the mode of procedure, but from my point of view there is this difference - one is right and the other is wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has undoubtedly taken up the right attitude. Expenditure which has to be made in any year should be, as far as possible, debited to that year. There is a very easy way of providing for it. A trivial amendment in the body of the bill will do so, and if it is moved I shall certainly support it. That we have done wrong in the past is no reason why we should continue to go wrong ; rather is it a reason why we should set matters right as speedily as possible. It is unthinkable that any honorable senator would oppose the second reading of a bill that is undoubtedly for the benefit of the states, and means giving back to the states some of the money which, rightly or wrongly - in some cases wrongly - the Federal Government has taken from them. Every honorable senator must support it, more especially when for some time the tendency of federal revenue has been upwards, while that of state revenue has been downwards. It is right that the Federal Government, out of the fulness of their purse, should relieve the stringent necessities of the states which have suffered a great deal and have been hampered by losing their main sources of revenue to the Commonwealth. I have much pleasure, with the reservations to which I have alluded, in supporting the .second reading of the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- - I appreciate the remarks made by the two honorable senators who have preceded me with regard to the need for recognizing that main road development should not be confined to the construction of main roads, but should also apply to the further development of existing main arteries. The title of the bill would lead one to imagine that under certain conditions the improvement of existing main roads is permissible. A main road may have served a district for a number of years, and yet be totally inadequate to meet the requirements of further development until it is put in such a condition that proper use may be made of it. Many seem to imagine that the people of Tasmania expect roads to be made without calling upon the land-owners to make some contribution towards their cost, but, for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> who has interjected that land-owners should be compelled to pay for the roads of the state, I may say that there is no part of Australia to-day where the land-owners and the land occupiers are paying as heavily for tie maintenance and construction of roads as they are in Tasmania. </para>

These, while suitable for the  purpose when  built, were, on account of the cost, necessarily light, and will not stand the present-day traffic." </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator can speak of his own state. The conditions in the hills of South Australia may be similar to those in Tasmania. I am putting the case for Tasmania. Another Victorian senator may argue from the point of view of  Gippsland.  The case I am putting up may be supported by representatives of other states This question of widening and strengthening main roads is very urgent, and I ask the Minister to bring under the notice of Cabinet the necessity for amending statutory rule No. 104 of 1923, which lays down the conditions under which the money made available can be expended. I suggest that it should be recognized that money spent on improving existing main roads by widening and strengthening thorn is equivalent to putting down another length of road to be termed a main road for the future development of the state. The Huon-road carries an enormous traffic, and its maintenance in anything like decent order has involved a heavy expenditure on the part of the ratepayers and taxpayers of Tasmania. Its disrepair has been brought about by the heavy traffic caused by the additional production of the district, and the same remark applies to the north-west and north-east roads. If we strengthen main roads, and at the same time give due attention to the building of additional main roads which are necessary to develop the country, we shall be materially assisting in the development of the states. I trust that the suggestions made to-day will be considered by the Government, and that provision will be made in the direction requested. </para>

                        <para>.- The root of the evil in connexion with the disbursement of the Commonwealth's millions is the fact that we have a federated instead of a unified Australia. The only cure is the adoption in the very near future of the proposals of the Labour party for unification'. Wise men in the early days of federation predicted what would take place within twenty years under the present form of government, which has proved such a huge failure and blunder. The States have refused to provide £1 for <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> so far as expenditure on main roads development is concerned, because they have very little control over the way in which the money is spent. Conditions are laid down by the Federal Government to which they cannot conform. One condition is that a road must develop some new area. If a state finds that the money is to be spent on a road in a portion of the state in need of development it may agree to the conditions imposed, and provide £1 for <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> with the Commonwealth Government for that work. But if it' realizes that a road proposed to be developed may be' of little value to the state, and that as a matter of fact no money need be spent upon it for many years to come, it will not put up its £1 for £1, because the money spent in building that particular road would be practically money thrown away. The states are perfectly willing to avail themselves of the opportunity to spend the Commonwealth's money, but the conditions imposed by the Commonwealth Government are such that they cannot conform to them. They do not feel justified in spending their own money 'in developing roads that may not be required for years to come. <inline font-style="italic">.</inline><inline font-style="italic">Sitting</inline><inline font-style="italic">suspended from 1 to 2.30 p.m.</inline></para>

                            <para>- The extension of main roads does not mean the development of private property or the making of roads through privately owned lands, but the construction of: roads which will be of advantage to the whole of the Commonwealth. Main roads are necessary in the Northern Territory and in the north of South Australia, and Western Australia, where portions of the country are at present quite inaccessible except by means of an aeroplane. The principle involved in this instance is a very good one. The general body of taxpayers in the Commonwealth will have to find the money, because we cannot: expect the states to incur heavy expenditure in the construction of roads which for some time will be of comparatively little value. It has been contended by some people that the money is being advanced to the states in order to provide employment for a certain section of the unemployed, and whilst that is a most laudable object, we know that the bill has been introduced at this stage and its passage is being expedited merely to enable the Government to adjust the* financial position in the way they desire. </para>

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to oppose the second reading ' of the bill, but I think it is the duty of honorable senators to carefully note the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> as to the reason why this measure is being treated as urgent. The honorable senator stated that the amount involved is to be charged to the expenditure of the present financial year which will end within two or three days, whereas it should really be a charge upon the funds of the next financial year, because during that period most of the money will be spent. I' gathered from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> that a precedent was created twelve months ago by pawing a similar bill before the close of the financial year, but that is no justification for adopting a similar practice on this occasion. The Minister pointed out that we should be in an unsatisfactory position if two appropriations of a similar amount for the same purpose were made in one year, but I cannot see why there should be any objection to that. </para>

                            <para>- If there were no appropriation in one year, later there would probably be two appropriations in the same year. The Minister did not deny: that ; this is an undesirable way in which to conduct the public finances, but merely suggested that we should be guided by precedent. I respect the opinions expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> who has not only had extensive ministerial experience, but has also a wide knowledge of public finance.  His  views are, I am sure, of benefit and of interest to honorable senators. The Government should take cognizance of the fact that it is apparently the wish of a large number of their supporters that this method of conducting public finance should be discontinued. I do not feel justified in opposing the bill, because such action would create the impression that I am opposed to the Federal Government assisting the states in the matter of road construction. I am not opposed to the principle of advancing money to the states to assist shire councils in this very necessary work. </para>

                            <para>- I object to the interjection of the Minister. I am not endeavouring to do what he suggests. I shall claim my right to express my views on any matters which come before the Senate for consideration. It would be reasonable on the . part of the Government, seeing that so many of their followers object to the method adopted, to delay the passing of the bill for a few days, because if it is passed next week the appropriation will automatically come out of next year's revenue. In common with other honorable senators, I regret that the amount is only £500,000, particularly when one considers the large amount of revenue extracted by way of Customs duties and other taxes from the people who use the roads. It is only fair in the circumstances that a substantial portion of the revenue so derived should be devoted to road construction. If a person purchases a motor car, even an ordinary low priced American machine, he has to pay £60 or £70 in Customs duties, and from the moment he commences to run it he is further taxed on the petrol he uses. He is also taxed on the tires, although he is assisting one of the largest industries in this country. Generally speaking, it can not be said that the average motor car owner  runs  his car for pleasure, especially in country &gt; districts, where motor vehicles" are as an important factor in developmental work as was the bullock wagon or the sulky in early days. I am not in favour of the imposition of a tax on motor chassis. I think they should be admitted free. Until oil is discovered in Australia in payable quantities the users of petrol are likely to be taxed somewhat heavily. There is a larger number of cars per 100 of the population in Australia than in many other countries, . and the Government should recognize that the users of motor vehicles are entitled to more consideration than they are at present receiving. In addition to the charges which have to be met in the form of Customs duties, a motor car owner also has to pay £5 or £6 a year for using roads which, in some instances, are practically impassable. He has also to pay a driver's license fee, and generally has to contribute a much larger sum to the revenue of the country than should be necessary. 1 have no hesitation in saying it would be impossible in any other part of the world to find roads worse than some of those in Australia. I am not blaming the local authorities, because the task which they have to undertake, with the limited funds at their disposal, is in most instances formidable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes mentioned that in Tasmania there are large areas where the nature of the country is poor, and where the shire councils are unable to raise sufficient revenue with which to -construct roads. During a motor tour which I made a little time ago, I discovered that where good country had been subdivided into small holdings which were occupied by prosperous people there were good roads, but in the poor country where the revenue was inadequate they were in a most unsatisfactory state. A scheme should be agreed to between the federal, state,' and shire authorities for building roads in the manner provided in the bill. There is a strong feeling in the country against the continued imposition of heavy Customs -duties, particularly on motor chassis, accessories, tires, petrol, &amp;c, and it is thought that the time has arrived when the duties should either be reduced or a considerable portion of the. money so collected spent on the construction of better roads. If a request is submitted in committee to increase the amount from £500,000 to £1,000,000 I shall support it, as I think it only reasonable, in view of the state of the Customs' revenue at present, that a larger grant should be made. Consumers and users of dutiable commodities do not like to  see' a-11 accumulated surplus of £11,000,000, while at the same time they are 'being heavily taxed. It is necessary; of course,, to make some provision  for lean years, but I ' do not see why the Government should raise by direct or indirect taxation millions more than is '. necessary to carry on the work of the country. That is an aspect which should be seriously considered. The Government should not seek to increase the amount received in indirect taxation through the Customs Department or gloat over the accumulated surplus. On the contrary, the finances should -be readjusted in such a manner that only, sufficient revenue will be collected to carry on the government of the country and make the necessary payments into the sinking fund. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> forcibly voiced the opinion of the majority of honorable senators on this side when he expressed dissatisfaction with the manner, in which this bill has been introduced. The question of roadmaking in Australia is one of considerable magnitude,  and honorable senators should have been afforded the opportunity to prepare to discuss the matter and advance constructive criticism. However, the Standing Orders have been suspended, and, in the terms of the motion that was carried by the Senate this morning, the bill must go through all its stages without delay. In submitting that motion the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> pointed out how essential it was that the bill should go through.; but on analyzing the matter we find that there is no necessity to pass the bill to-day, -because roadmaking is not being held up pending its passage. This is an attempt by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> to balance the ledger. The accounts will not truly reflect the position of the finances, as this advance of £500,000 will be made next year, and should properly be debited to next year's accounts. A point that I want to make in conclusion was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Kingsmill.  If this money is to be spent only in making new roads, the whole scheme is farcical. We have not the right to limit the activities of the municipalities or of the states by insisting that they shall not repair an existing road or  build  other than main roads. </para>

                            <para>- We are laying, down, the principle that the Federal Govern- . ment is to participate in the work of" road-making. The scheme was originally evolved to afford relief to unemployed returned soldiers. It was then recognized that the Commonwealth Government was to some extent responsible for roadmaking. Our duty is not merely to vote the money, but to advance constructive ideas for future guidance. We have not today been given the opportunity to do that. None of us knew that the bill was to be introduced at this stage, and we have been compelled to make a few impromptu remarks. I hope that the Ministry will repent in view of the fact that honorable senators, who are loyal supporters, are not satisfied with this .method of dealing with the finances. Let the bill stand over until next week, and so enable honorable senators to endeavour . to improve it. The money that is advanced can then be included, as it should be, in next year's expenditure. </para>

                        <para>. - It appears to me that there is trouble  amongst  some honorable senators sitting on the government benches, and there are signs of decay in the ministerial ranks. This afternoon I witnessed an attempt by. the Minister to persuade an honorable senator to desist from making further remarks, and later the Government Whip was told, <inline font-style="italic">sotto voce,</inline> by the same honorable senator to mind his own business. It is interesting to note that honorable senators opposite, by their conduct to-day, admit that an attempt is being made to bind them and compel them to swallow  holus  bolus whatever measures are brought down. The principle of the bill has my entire and hearty support, but I have one or two objections to it. My first objection - which I think is a very sound one - was voiced very ably this morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene.</inline> It is that money which should be expended from next year's accounts should not be debited to this year's accounts. Another objection I have is that the amount proposed to be advanced is not sufficiently large. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil</inline> has very well said that the Commonwealth Government for the second time is taking a very active part in road-making. There is something more in this matter than the construction and maintenance of good roads for the use of motor cars and other vehicles. In determining our course of action we should be guided by the question of defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> must realize that good roads are essential if we are to defend Australia against an invader. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> is having his usual joke. He has never heard me state that I am opposed to the defence of Australia. I would cheerfully vote for the allocation of £2,000,000 for road-making, and I would provide that sum out of the surplus in which the Government is at present wallowing. That money would be well spent in constructing good roads in the different states. Whilst I agree with the principle of the bill, if honorable senators opposite have the courage of their convictions, and will call for a division in order to have the further consideration of the measure deferred until next week, I shall support them. </para>

                        <para>.- Briefly I want to endorse the remarks of honorable senators regarding the manner in which this Bill has been rushed forward. Road-making in Australia is a very important matter. Good roads are a national asset, and there is no work on which money could be better spent. It is a disappointment to- me that, altheugh last year the Commonwealth Government made available £500,000 with the stipulation that the states were to .advance £1 for £1, for road construction, for some reason or other only 25 per cent, of the money voted has been expended, notwithstanding the fact that the people are complaining about the bad state of the existing roads, and urging the necessity for the construction of new roads. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> has told us that the fault does not lie at the door of the Commonwealth Government, but that the reason is a lack of organization in the states. That does not apply to Victoria, which, fortunately, possesses an excellent organization in the country roads board, that is doing splendid work in the construction and upkeep of roads. The sole reason that a greater number of roads is not constructed, and that those at present constructed are not kept in better repair, is a lack of funds. </para>

In view of the state of the Commonwealth finances - there is a surplus of about £11,000,000, largely owing to the collection of high Customs duties - it is reasonable to expect the Government to make provision for more and better roads, particularly in view of the fact that some millions of pounds of the revenue comes from duties on motor cars and petrol. The Government should grant a larger amount to the states for the construction and maintenance of roads. A great many of the roads which have been constructed, even in this state, where the Country Roads Board is doing a splendid work, are rapidly deteriorating. Big motor lorries, fitted with solid tires and carrying up to 10 tons, are tearing our roads to pieces. The condition of some of the roads, even in Victoria, is deplorable. On Wednesday afternoon I tried to get a man to motor me from Terang to Melbourne, but he refused because of the ruts in the road between Camperdown and Colac. Some of the nits are said to be 2 feet deep. It is no use shutting our eyes to the fact that roads in Australia are deteriorating, and that there is urgent need for the maintenance and consolidation of our arterial roads. I should like to see a trial made somewhere with concrete roads, as has been done in the United States of America. If I had the power I would put a heavy wheel tax on those heavy motor vehicles which are doing so much damage to roads throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I regret  very much  that the bill is being rushed through the Senate. The amount proposed to be allocated is totally inadequate. The bill should make provision not only for road construction, but also for the maintenance of existing roads. When the measure is in committee, I should like to see a clause inserted to enable the money to be spent on the maintenance of existing roads, as well as on road construction. </para>

                    <para class="block">My object, of course, is quite clear. I want to indicate definitely to the Government, if the committee agrees to my amendment, that this bill and its expenditure belong to the financial year in which the money may be expended; and not to the financial year now closing. A little while ago, when I was dealing with this question at another stage of the bill1, I expressed as forcibly as circumstances permitted my opinion of the method of finance for which the bill provides. The short title suggests that the expenditure belongs to the financial year 1923-24, when properly it belongs to the year 192.4-25. I have moved my amendment so that honorable senators may have an opportunity to indicate by their votes whether this method of financing meets with their approval. There are quite a number of. trust accounts in the general finances of. the Commonwealth. Large sums, as. a matter of fact,, are paid from trust accounts for old-age pensions and for repatriation benefits, and every year Parliament votes in the Estimates for the* year the- amounts which ar&amp; to be placed' to. the credit of those trust accounts. My fundamental objection to the Government proposal is that if this method' of procedure is followed year after year, these sums will never appear in the- annual Estimates. This bill expressly designs to shut the amount out from the Estimates for the year. The procedure is wrong. It is fundamentally unsound finance, and the committee should not agree- to it. I ask honorable senators to- register their disapproval' of this method of finance. </para>

He* knows that I was responsible for what was done, and he knows the reason why it was done. Parliament in the previous year had voted a considerable sum of money towards, defence expenditure, but in  1921-22  I was sent to the Defence Department with definite instructions to curtail the expenditure for the following year by a very large amount. I knew as well as the Minister knew that that instruction meant the dismissal of a very large number of men from the department. It also meant that if, during that financial' year, we expended all the money that Parliament had put into our hand's for the Defence Department, a great deal' of <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> would be thrown away. Accordingly, from the moment I became Minister for- Defence I set out to save every penny that I could of the amount which- Parliament had voted for the department, placing- it on one side to be used as compensation for the officers who had to go. The difference between what the Government is doing now and what we did then, is that Parliament had* voted £300,000 for defence expenditure-. </para>

Then we got the sanction o£ Parliament to establish a. trust fund,, and spend the money in. the way we suggested. The other statement made by the Minister was;, as- nearly as I can recollect it, that the money does appear in the Estimates because it is- shown in. the column, giving the previous! year's expenditure. I think that is the- way in which the- Minister pu&gt;t the matter. </para>

This practice will go on year after year, and this- sum* will never be brought to- account in the Estimates of Expenditure for the current year. </para>

If it be right, will the Minister ten me why the Government does not treat other trust funds in. the same way?: Take old-age pensions. Every vote for the old-age pensions account goes: into a. trust fund.

                        That may be; but every year- the money ordinarily voted by Parliament to this fund: goes into a trust account. A. similar practice is followed with regard to- the repatriation! vote. It is voted every year, and it goes into a trust account. I maintain that the mam roads development vote should be treated in the same way. I am- perfectly satisfied' that" the only reason for this action is that the- Treasurer

                        mot wish to- show the true- expenditure for the year. He knows' very well what - the' effect would be if this expenditure were included in the year's figures. He knows that it would show that some of his promises given to the country in the flamboyant speeches he made when he was opposed to the Ministers with whom he is now associated in the Cabinet had not been redeemed. The Senate should insist upon the Treasurer putting into each year's accounts the expenditure for that year. That is what I want to see done, and in urging it to-day I consider that I am doing a public service. The method of finance now adopted simply means hiding from the country the true expenditure year by year. The Treasurer owes a duty to the people to be frank with them. The practice of which I complain is not a frank one; it is a deliberate attempt to hide the true position, and it should cease forthwith.

                        <para>. -  The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> has completely failed to show any good reason why the practice complained of should be followed. He' has informed us that not more than one-fourth of the amount voted by Parliament last year for main roads development has been taken by the states in accordance with the conditions laid down. Up to date, only about ?120,000 has been expended out of the available sum of ?500,000. Although it is expected that the ?500,000 available last year will be exhausted before the end of December, we are within a few days of the close of the current financial year, and we are asked to make available a further sum of ?500,000. The object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> I think, is a very laudable one. He desires that the money to be expended during the currency of the next financial year shall be voted in that year and brought into account in the figures for that year. In the circumstances, I fail to see how any honorable senator can so far neglect his duty as to assist the- Government to do something which is shown to be quite unnecessary. Why .not wait until the end of the financial year ? It will close next week. We are assured by tha daily press, and from the floor of the Senate, that the accumulated surplus is in the vicinity of ?11,000,000, and at the close of the year we shall see exactly how the finances of the Commonwealth stand. It will then be time enough to consider the voting of any money for the ostensible purpose of making new roads. The real effect of the vote is to place handsome donations in the hands of the land-holders whose properties adjoin the roads to be constructed. I, therefore, support the amendment. </para>

It was not a precedent to be followed in this Case. I admit quite frankly that not very much will be gained directly by agreeing to the amendment, but the indirect gain will be that we shall accomplish, what we desire - the Government will be obliged to bring down the bill in the next financial year. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think the Leader of the Senate(Senator Pearce) is quite fair in his interjections regarding the possibility of the bill being rejected because the Senate wishes to express a definite opinion about tine method in which the finances are administered. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> does not propose to withdraw his amendment, and I venture to pay that its acceptance will not lead to the rejection of the bill. If another place will not agree to make the alteration it will only have to say so, and the amendment will have to take its chance of toeing insisted on or not pressed, as the case may be, if it comes back to this chamber. No one objects to the principle of the bill. Our only objection is that it does not observe the principle that estimates of expenditure shall show the expenditure for the current year to which it belongs. That is the stand I take up. </para>

If the measure is passed ins its present form £1,750,000 will be available during the coming financial year, which should surely be sufficient. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point I am making. The Government are proposing to place at the disposal of the states a certain sum which they can use if they so desire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> suggests that it should be increased. If the states wish to use the money it will be necessary for them to provide an equal sum on a £1 for £1 basis from their own funds, but they may not desire to do so. On the other hand it may be their desire to expend a larger sum, and I do not think the operations of the states should be limited in this necessary work to the extent of £1,000,000 as proposed by the Government when we can, by adopting: the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> make an additional £500,000 available which, of course, may not be used. We know that certain states which are not experiencing financial stringency are interested in extending and developing main roads; and it is imperative that we should place as large a sum. as possible at their disposal. The request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> seems to be a fair one to the states. </para>

                        <para>. - The request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> if adopted, would mean a substantial increase in. taxation. In the bill, as now amended, it appears that the whole of the sum mentioned is to be made a charge on the revenue for the next financial year, and not against the accumulated surplus of £11,000,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">Tho proposal to increase the amount by £500,000 seems to suggest that further consideration of the bill should be delayed' until we have the Estimates for the next financial year before us. There is no immediate hurry or necessity to vote this money at present. As the committee has decided that the amount involved is to be made a charge against the revenue of the next financial year it would, I think, be better to adhere to the smaller amount. If at a later date we found it necessary we could increase the amount in an amending bill. To make a larger amount available at present is simply juggling with the national balance-sheet. We should make a fresh start on the 1st July, as soon after that dato we will know what our commitments are likely to be, and can then give some indication to the electors as to where we are to obtain the money. If we intend to continue collecting revenue through the Customs and using it in the construction of roads throughout the Commonwealth, we shall be perpetuating a most unfair system. Would it not be better to adopt the policy in force in Queensland and New South Wales, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the Commonwealth, and to clearly indicate to the electors that we propose to raise £1,000,000 by imposing a land tax of  ¼d.  in the £1 which would produce that amount each year. If we made it Id, in the £1 we would raise about £4,000,000 per annum. A policy of that nature should be embodied in a bill, "as it is unfair to collect money from Customs and excise duties and other sources which the Government have tapped. It must be remembered that the expenditure of this money will place land-owners whose property adjoins new roads or roads which are thu3 improved in a much better position, and the policy of improving people's property at the expense of the whole of the taxpayers should not be supported.

                        <para>. - I shall oppose the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> not because there is no necessity for the expenditure of the larger amount, but because I believe the amount provided in the bill is sufficient to meet the requirements for this specific purpose during any one year. It must be borne in mind that each state, however much we increase the amount, will have to raise a similar amount by way of taxation if it wishes to take advantage of the larger sum. In Tasmania a much larger amount could be spent on the maintenance and construction of new roads, and I would prefer to 6ee this grant made available for a longer period rather than to increase it for any one year. In Tasmania a comparatively large sum could be profitably expended each year. </para>

                            <para>- I think so; and it is right and proper that it should be handed back. But there must be a limit to the amount that can be economically and profitably spent by the State Governments each year. At present there is a substantial balance unexpended, apart from the £500,000 for which provision is now being made. I intend to oppose the request, because many of the states will not be able to take full advantage of the added benefit, although they will be called upon to provide their quota </para>

                        <para>. - Speaking on the second reading, I said that owing to the large amount oi revenue that is derived by the Government from motor cars and other vehicles it could well afford to increase this grant. I still believe that that is so, and I do not retract one word of what I said. The Government, however, is responsible for the finances and must say where the money is to come from. We have approached it with the request that this grant be increased, and it has advanced reasons why, for the present year, that should not be done. It has been pointed out that more than £800,000 was available for the current financial year. I should like to see the amount increased, but I do not think we would be acting fairly if we endeavoured to take out of the hands of the Government the conduct of its finances. When I am not satisfied with its actions I shall not hesitate to say so. Because I have not succeeded in inducing them to make a greater advance, I do not on that account intend to vote against the Government. I believe that if, at the end of the year, the sum provided is found to be insufficient, the Government will deal fairly by us. </para>

I know the Queensland Government would be quite willing to make a much larger subsidy than it is called upon to make. It was only after speaking to the original bill that I had the opportunity of discussing the matter fully with the Queensland UnderSecretary for Public Lands. Queensland, which is a state of vast areas, will leap great advantages from this scheme, even though Tasmania's finances are such that it is not able to fully avail itself of the generosity of the Commonwealth. I intend to vote for the request. </para>

                        <para>. - The mere fact that a deputation representing certain municipal  associa'tions  to-day waited upon the Treasurer should not for a moment be taken by honorable senators as an indication that they have any authority to represent the ratepayers in their municipalities. 1 know from a long experience that deputations from municipal councils have, time and again, without any authority from the ratepayers, waited upon the Government and asked it to come to their assistance. Municipalities in New South Wales in which the unimproved . value of the land is as great as £2,000,000 have had the impertinence to approach the State Treasurer praying for assistance to enable them to construct their roads. In the same way some Tasmanian senators are always seeking assistance. Those supplicants should be told pointedly and clearly that the proper course for them to adopt is to tax local  land values -and .find .their own revenue. There can be -nothing more ridiculous or -a'bsurd than t© tax the poor people through the Customs House and ladle out the revenue so derived to the wealthy 'land-owners -to "increase, the value of their lands. Those who vote for a measure of this sort ought to be impeached before the electors. It is the most outrageous proposal that I have .ever had placed before me. 'I am surprised and .disgusted to find that men who occupy 'a good, strong, financial .position 'can urge that the money which is extracted from the public through the Customs House, the income tax, and by other means, should be handed to people who .are well able to pay their .own way. Some time ago I had a .return prepared from data that was furnished .on the wealth census cards. The estimates of the very people who ar.e behind this agitation to subvent the Customs duties showed that the value of the lands .of Australia at .that time was £455,000,000. I -venture to say that today those lands are worth at least £1,'000,000,GOO. The imposition of Id. in the £1 : upon their land values would provide them with, not a paltry million, hut £4,000,00.0. The poor land in Tasmania, which is said to he worth only ' about 103. an acre., would only be called upon to pay about Ji. per .acre. That is the source from which this revenue .should come. I protest against such a rotten proposal .as the subvention of the national funds for these purposes. </para>

                    <para class="block">The hill brought down in August last, ,and passed into law, provided for the establishment of a  sinking  fund of 10s. per cent, per annum, as well .as certain other payments, including one-half the profits of the Commonwealth Bank, to a fund for the extinction of the national debt. That measure vested the sinking fund in a .commission consisting of the Treasurer, the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Governor <inline font-style="italic">a£</inline> the Commonwealth Bank, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Solicitor-General. The act placed the commission beyond 'the  'Control  of the Treasurer. It is anticipated that the sinking fund  will  earn 5  per  cent. on. the amount paid into it, and that it will liquidate the irrecoverable debt of  the  Commonwealth within 50 years. On the 30th June last, the war -debt was £219,450,000, and other debts totalled £31,550,000, or a total of £251,000,000. This  bill  provides  for  a variation of the principle in respect of post office loans. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> is recognized that those loans may 'be expended on works having a shorter life than 50 years, and  therefore it is considered desirable that the sinking fund should be so controlled as to extinguish the debt so incurred in a shorter period. As regards payments, the first paragraph of the amending clause of the bill requires a contribution of £91,000 per annum to be made for a period of 30 years, beginning with the current financial year. In the principal act, the contribution is fixed at the rate of 10s. per cent. per annum on the public debt, other than the war debt, existing at 30th June 1923, and it totals £158,000. Of this amount, £45,500 is applicable to the debt represented by expenditure out of the loan fund on post office works, and by the value of post office properties transferred from the states. The amount of £91,000 represents twice the amount of the original contribution, which is at the rate of 10s. per cent. per annum. The bill is on the same lines as the measure passed last year, except that there is an alteration of the amount of contribution in respect of loans for post office works. It is necessary to pass the measure without delay so that payments may be made into the sinking fund during the present financial year. </para>
                    <para>SenatorGRANT (New South Wales) [4.23].. - During the passage of the principal act, it was decided to annex one-half the profits -of the Commonwealth Bank to the sinking fund. I offered all the objection I could to that proposal, but it was agreed to. I had some hope that, in this amending bill, the Government would have reviewed the decision then arrived at, and have given the Commonwealth Bank authorities an opportunity to extend their operations to all the principal towns and cities in the Commonwealth. I find the Government has not done so. It is now proposed to take from the present surplus the sum of £91,000, and place it to the credit of the national debt sinking fund, and to do so for a further period of 30 years. When the principal act was being dealt with, a number of questions were asked as to the probable date of the extinction of the national debt. We were assured then that it would be wiped out inside of 50 years, but apparently the predictions then made were not well founded, for it is now proposed to make further substantial additions annually from the Consolidated Revenue to the sinking fund. To that, I do not offer very much objection, but I find that, in the second sub-clause of clause 2, it is proposed, in connexion with the Postmaster-General's Department, to contribute to the sinking fund a sum equal to £1 per cent. of the expenditure of that department out of the loan fund from the 1st July, 1923, to the end of the financial year in which the payment is made. In the third sub-clause, there is a provision to continue this payment till 1954. The Government might just as well borrow more money for the purpose of liquidating the national debt as to borrow money, and place it in the sinking fund to the credit of the Postmaster-General's Department. This provision is quite unnecessary, and will lead to an unjustifiable amount of bookkeeping and circumlocution. It would be much better to strike out the second and third subclauses. I cannot understand why the Minister in charge of the bill has given us no explanation of the reason for the inclusion of these provisions. If he desires to place more money to the credit of the National Debt Sinking Fund I have no objection to assisting him in that direction, for I think that the proper way to deal with the national debt is to gradually liquidate it. I am prepared to request the other House to assist in liquidating it to the extent of the sum the Minister expects to receive under paragraphs and <inline font-style="italic">cc</inline> of sub-clause2. Federal income tax officials enter into calculations involving microscopical fractions of a penny, and surely there should be no difficulty in wiping out the second and third paragraphs, and mentioning a round sum in the first paragraph. If we agreed to the last two paragraphs, nobody would have the slightest idea as to how much either or both of them would produce, and I shall move in committee for their deletion. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of this measure is to ratify an agreement which has been provisionally made with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited to increase the capital of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited by the sum of £250,000, of which one-half has to bo provided by the Commonwealth and one-half by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The bill also provides for the appropriation of the necessary loan moneys. I need scarcely point out that mineral oil is of great and growing importance both for industrial and defence purposes. The internal combustion engine has revolutionized motive power, and the number of petrol-driven engines is increasing with great rapidity. Again, the substitution of oil for coal in firing the boilers of ships is also increasing rapidly. Many merchant ships and most modern warships burn oil. There are at present more than 3,000 vessels, many of them of very large size, fitted for using liquid fuel, and a number of them are trading to Australia. Hitherto, owing to the high price, there has been little market for fuel oil, except for a limited number of special purposes. The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited will be able to supply large quantities, and to sell, <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline> tank, at a price not exceeding 70s. a ton. For large orders even less will be charged. The company has evidence that it has created a market for this article which has never previously existed. Before the war, the control of oil production and distribution was almost entirely in the hands of foreign countries, chiefly the Standard Oil group and the Royal Dutch-Shell group. In 1909, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was formed to develop certain oil interests in Persia originally obtained by an Australian - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> K. D'Arcy, of Mount Morgan. During the war, the British Government acquired a controlling interest in this company. The British Government is not prone to purchase interests in commercial ventures. But twice in its history has it done so - in the case of the Suez Canal and in the case of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In each instance the object was national security. </para>
                <para>Oil is of vast importance to the British Navy, and it would also be required for many military purposes in time of war, such as for motor cars, aeroplanes, tanks, &amp;c. The British Government's investment is said to have cost £5,000,000, and to bo now worth many times that sum. The company has been developed entirely by British capital and enterprise, and is controlled in the last resort by the British Government with its majority of shares. The British Government has also two representatives on the board of directors. </para>
                <para>In 1920, an agreement was entered into between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited to refine oil in Australia. The capital of this company is £500,000, divided into 500,000 shares of £1 each. Of these, the Commonwealth Government owns 250,001, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and its nominees 249,999. The board of directors, numbering seven members, includes three representatives of the Commonwealth. The objects of the refinery company, shortly stated, are the development in Australia of the oil refining industry, the erection and operation in Australia of modern oil refineries, the sale and disposal of the refined products, and other incidental objects. </para>
                <para>The terms of the 1920 agreement are well known to honorable senators. They bind the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to supply crude oil in sufficient quantities until indigenous oil is available in Australia; they provide that the company shall sell its oil products at prices which are fair and reasonable; and they give the Commonwealth the option -of purchasing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's interest in the company at the expiration of fifteen years. The first fruits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's interest in Australia was the erection by it of large fuel oil bunkering tanks at Sydney Melbourne, and Fremantle, which greatly increased the oil bunkering facilities in Australia, and made it possible for large oil-driven liners to trade here. The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited has now completed the erection of its first refinery, which is operating at Kororoit creek, near "Williamstown. It lias also built a bunkering tank on the Yarra, at Spotswood, and has established pipe-line connexion between that and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's tank at Port Melbourne, so that fuel oil can now be delivered on board in bulk at either place. It has also established distribution depots in the various capitals to market its oil. </para>
                <para>One thing was not decided or definitely provided for in the original agreement, namely, the marketing of- the oil. It was left open whether the company should market its own products, or whether that should be done through some other agency. The capital of the company has enabled it to establish ' the refinery, wharf, the depots and pipe-lines mentioned, but it is not sufficient to enable it to carry trading stocks. -The Government is in agreement with the refinery- company that it is necessary for the company to market its own goods, which involves its having a trading capital. The holding of the necessary stocks for, say, three or four months, before realization, involves a trading capital of at least £250,000, and the Commonwealth has, subject to ratification by Parliament, agreed with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to supply this capital, each partner to contribute one-half. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited does not enjoy u monopoly. It shares the Australian business with other large and well-established- concerns. It is bound to sell at fair and reasonable prices. Subject to this condition, its policy is in the hands of the directors. It can be reasonably expected that its effect will be to exercise a stabilising effect on the price of oil. As regards fuel oil, of which the available quantities aBd the facilities for bulk purchase were formerly very scant, there will be an immediate advantage to the public, both as regards price and quantity available. As regards motor spirit and kerosene, in which the supplies of the refinery are only a fraction of the whole trade, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries cannot control the price, but can undoubtedly help to stabilize it. At the present moment, and probably for the first time, the price of motor spirit in Australia is down substantially to the level of London prices. This has certainly not been the case during the last few years. . Whether the fact that the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited has been in the field has had anything to do with this result maybe a matter of opinion, but so it is. It is anticipated that the company can make a reasonable profit by selling its products at reasonable prices, and that its existence will be a useful check on any tendency to maintain prices above what the world's market justifies. The Commonwealth has, on the unanimous advice of the- directors, confirmed a favorable price for crude oil for a period of two years, and freight for the same period is being negotiated: I may add that the vice-chairman of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmond</inline> Slade) and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt's,</inline> another director, -have recently been here, and expressed high satisfaction with the refinery itself, and with the quality of the products. </para>
