For my own part, I regard the proposed extension as altogether inadequate, but as it will improve the bill to some extent I must support it. I hope that the minister will not oppose it, and if he does so, 1 appeal to honorable senators to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny</inline> in his effort to make the bill more useful than it would be if not amended. </para>

                        <para>- That is not correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare&#39;s</inline> statement was a definite one, foreshadowing his intention to move an amendment to insert the word &#34;twenty-seven,&#34; but the Government and their supporters prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> from moving his amendment by retaining &#34; twenty-six &#34; in the bill. In these circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> could not move his amendment. As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> is not fully conversant with the correct procedure, it is unfair of him to say that although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> did indicate that he intended to move an amendment, he did not actually do so. He could not move his amendment because the committee refused to create a blank to enable him to do so. </para>

                    <para class="block">The object of this measure is to obtain parliamentary approval of an agreement which is set out in the schedule to the bill, and which modifies the original agreement made between the Commonwealth&#39; and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited on the 28th March 1922. The original agreement provides that the company shall have a capital of &#163;1,000,000, of which the Commonwealth should contribute &#163;500,001. Under that agreement, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited undertook to erect stations in Australia capable of communicating with Great Britain, and also to erect and operate reciprocal stations in Great Britain and Canada. After the agreement was entered into, difficulties arose between the Marconi Company, which had contracted to erect these stations, and the British Government. Considerable delay occurred in consequence of the British Government deciding not to permit the erection of any privately-owned high-power stations in Great Britain. In the meantime, certain developments occurred in connexion with wireless telegraphy, and what is known as the beam system became a practical possibility. In the amended agreement, which is set out in the schedule to the bill, it is proposed to erect a beam station instead of a high-power station which was provided for in the original agreement. The beam system has two distinct features, one of which is that by focussing the rays in one direction by means of a reflector, a short wave length of 100 metres can be operated. I understand that the high-power station which we proposed to erect in Australia was to have a wave length of 2,000 metres. Another feature is that, in addition to rendering it possible to communicate with Great Britain, Canada, and other countries, it will be practicable under the new system, by simply throwing the reflector out of action, to convert the proposed beam station into a broadcasting station, but, of course, communication will not be able to be carried on over such a long distance as with the high-power station. In the new agreement, which is dated the 20th August, it is provided that it shall have no force or effect, and shall not be binding upon either party, unless and until it is approved of by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. Under the agreement, a beam station will be provided with a traffic capacity of at least 21,600 words per day each way for 300 days in the year, at an estimated capital cost not exceeding &#163;120,000. A high-power station was to have cost &#163;480,000, so the proposed beam station will not, at the most, cost more than one-fourth of that amount. It is also provided that a guarantee is to be given, of such a nature and of such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the board, for the erection of the main trunk station, and for its capability to provide the&#39; service stipulated. The agreement also contains a provision to relieve the company of its undertakings to provide a high-power station in Australia, and reciprocal high-power stations in Great Britain and Canada. It is also agreed that the rates to be charged shall not be more than one-half of those set out in the original agreement. Those rates are - </para>

If Parliament approves the agreement, it is anticipated that the proposed beam station will be in operation within nine months, and in view of the urgent necessity of establishing effective wireless telegraphic communications between Australia, Great Britain, and other countries, I trust the Senate will pass the bill without unnecessary delay. </para>

Summed up, the position is that if we have received for shipment bills of lading, and ordinary bills of lading, it rests entirely with the banks whether they will accept them. The Government takes the view that in legislation of this kind we must legislate for the whole of the community, and not for individual banks. For the information of honorable senators, I shall read a cable which was sent to England in regard to this matter. </para>

                        <para>- It certainly rests with the banks to say whether they will lend the money or not. The provisions of the clause may prove of benefit to a large section of the community, but there is no obligation on the part of the banks to accept received-for-shipment bills of lading. They may take the stand that they must have the shipped bill of lading, and in that case they would not lend the money.

                    <para>. - Since we had this clause before us &#39;the other day I have made certain inquiries as to its effect, and the answers that I have received absolutely confirm the views I then expressed. In the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Morning Herald</inline> recently it was stated that in shipping and consigning circles received for shipment bills of lad-, ing would be considered a convenience, provided that the ship was named, and a reasonable time limit imposed. It is not necessary to include details of that nature in the clause, as the banks or other people concerned will be careful to see that their interests are protected in that direction. I put the position to the general manager of one -of the leading wool exporting houses in this country, and he said that in cases where the ship was destined to leave in a fortnight or three weeks, it would be a matter cf great convenience to them and to their clients if they could get a received for shipment bill of lading for the wool to be consigned in a certain time by a certain ship. I asked if he considered that there would be any difficulty in negotiating the document, and he replied, &#34; Certainly not. It would be a great convenience.&#34; I can conceive of circumstances in which a received for shipment bill of lading would be a better document than an ordinary bill of lading. Suppose, that a Peninsular and Oriental boat - one of the fastest . vessels travelling between Australia and Great Britain - were timed to leave in. three weeks, and that a client desired to ship wool by it. If he obtained a received for shipment bill of lading he would be in a better position than if he possessed an ordinary bill of lading for the goods to be shipped by a tramp steamer leaving immediately, but which would take about eight weeks cn the journey. It is purely a matter of convenience. The manager of the firm to which I have referred stated that it would be a great convenience at times to the shipping community to have received for shipment bills of lading, and he thought that for that reason the clause might well be left in the bill. </para>

                        <para>- lt is certainly open to the banks to accept or refuse it. 1 consulted the  chairman  of directors of one of the leading banks in Australia, and he said that, given a reputable firm, the name of the steamer, and a reasonable time limit, he saw no objection to the document being negotiated. He said that at times such documents might not be negotiated, but that in favorable circumstances there would, in his opinion, be no difficulty in that direction. As the provision might be a convenience to a number of people, I recommend the Government to stand by the clause. </para>

If neither the carrier nor the ship is to be responsible for loss or damage arising from any&#39; act, neglect, or default, of the master, mariner, pilot, or the servants of the carrier, for what are they to be liable? Apparently they are to be responsible for nothing. Reasonable provision should be made to see that the ship-owners have some responsibility placed on them for the care of the goods entrusted to them. Nobody desires to hold them liable for a mere error of judgment, but they must be made responsible for neglect or default.

                    <para>. - Irrespective of th&#171;* opinions of legal gentlemen, for which T always have the utmost respect, it seems to me that the schedule as it stands will lessen the responsibilities of ship-owners as common carriers. If I send a load of wheat by a ship, and the vessel is deliberately run on the rocks, why should we say that no act of negligence on the part of the carrier shall entitle me to compensation ? </para>

                        <para>- With all respect to the legal authorities, honorable senators must realize their own responsibilities. It appears to me that under one clause of this bill the sea carriage of goods in an unseaworthy vessel will be permitted, and it is now proposed to remove responsibility from the carrier for his own neglect. How a Minister can be satisfied with the legal opinion given on that point I fail to understand. Let us; be guided by our own common sense. The law should be so plain that it cannot be misunderstood. The bill should clearly lay down that for any act of negligence the carrier is responsible. If, as a common carrier, I undertook to deliver a valuable cargo of wine, and through my running amok the bottles were smashed, I should be responsible to the owner. The same argument applies to the carriage of goods at sea. </para>

                        <para>- But this article of the schedule deals with neglect or default, apart from the perils of the sea. Why should not the ship-owner be held liable for losses of goods through the neglect or default of his servants ? In our legislation, dealing with transactions on land, this responsibility is definitely upon an employer for acts of negligence by his employees. Although &#34; high legal authority &#34; may express the view that the provision is quite right, commonsense suggests that there should be an amendment to make ship-owners responsible for the neglect or default of their servants. It would appear that the draughtsman, forgetful that some progress has been made during last century, when ship-owners made the law to suit themselves, has been content to lift the provisions of old English acts for the purpose of applying them to present day conditions. To-day we live in a country where ship-owners obey the law, just as every one else does, and have no more say in the making of the law than other citizens of the Commonwealth. This is an opportunity to amend the law so that the ship-owner shall not escape his responsibility. The manner in which we slavishly follow old ideas was brought home to me when I was apprenticed to a trade. The indentures which were signed on my behalf bound me to obey the lawful commands of my master day and night, and to be respectful to all the members of his family. I did not know until I was old enough to take an interest in such matters that the indenture signed for me in 1882 was practically ah exact copy of indentures that had been in force in Britain for centuries. An apprentice in those days was virtually the slave of his master, and only became a free man when he had served his apprenticeship. The draughtsmanship of this bill is suggestive of that line of thought. We should amend it. Suppose, for example, that a bundle of silk worth a considerable sum of money was thrown overboard by one of the seamen. Under this legislation, the ship-owner would nob be held responsible. </para>

                <para class="block">That clause means that the Navigation Act is not repealed, amended, or in any way interfered with by this bill. If incompetence be proved on the part of the officers or any member of a ship&#39;s company, or if there is any breach of duty, there is ample provision in the Navigation Act to bring offenders to book and punish them. Under that act we have a department with officers whose duty it is to see that no ships leave our ports in an unseaworthy condition. Our navigation law, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself has admitted, is the most up to date in the world, safeguarding the safety of the officers, crew, passengers, and cargo. Certificates have to be issued showing that the engines and machinery of a ship are in good condition. All that the honorable senator is contending for is already provided in our navigation law. This bill, I repeat, has nothing to do with the Navigation Act. It. deals merely with the relations between the shipper and the receiver of goods that are carried by sea. Surely the honorable senator realizes that the seaworthiness of a ship is a question as between the owner and the Government representing the community. &#39; , </para>

It is obvious that he is not. It might as well be argued that a consignee or consignor of goods on our railways should be held responsible for the condition of the rolling-stock or permanent way. It would be just as logical, for example, to contend that, if I shipped a ton of flour to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> on the railways, and if, owing to defects of the rolling-stock or through faulty management of the railway system the consignment was lost or damaged, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should hold me responsible. Yet that is what he is suggesting should be done in connexion with the sea carriage of goods. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator might have a claim against the carriers, but certainly not against me, if I were the consignor. The seaworthiness of a ship is entirely a responsibility under the Navigation Act. Does not the honorable senator see that if he achieved his purpose, and struck out these provisions, no shipper would receive goods, because whilst a shipping company might make every provision for the safety of a ship, if, through carelessness of its officers or for any other reason the ship &#39; was lost with the goods, every consignee would have an action against the company ? </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It is inserted so that in such circumstances the consignee shall have no right of action against a shipping company. If, in these circumstances, a shipping company were held liable, carriers of goods from Australia would certainly be obliged to insure themselves against a risk which is not borne by carriers in any other part of the world. We are now suffering sufficiently from high shipping freights, but if the&#39; amendment were carried I am afraid that, if in the matter of freights we may be said to be beaten with whips to-day, we would be beaten with scorpions in the future. The rate of insurance to cover this additional risk would so increase freights as to make them prohibitive. Therefore, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> object were achieved, all possibility of securing reasonable rates of freight would be destroyed. When the honorable senator claims that the retention of these words in article iv. is an inducement to shipowners to employ unseaworthy vessels for the carriage of goods, he is practically imputing that there is no navigation act in existence preventing ship-owners from sending vessels to sea in an unseaworthy condition, or that there is no navigation department in control of such matters.. If the honorable senator is not content to rely upon the adequate provision in this regard made in our navigation laws, and thinks that a similar provision should be inserted in a bill dealing with the sea carriage of goods, I am afraid he will also be obliged to insert in that bill all the provisions of the Navigation Act. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is correct in saying that the omission from the Sea Carriage of Goods Hill of any prohibition against employing unseaworthy ships for the carriage of goods should be remedied in the way he suggests, he might just as easily argue that the sea carrier of goods should be prevented by this bill from loading his vessel above the load line, which he is already prevented from doing by a provision in the Navigation Act. It is quite unnecessary to repeat in this bill what is already provided for in the Navigation Act. The fact that the sub-paragraph of article iv. to which the honorable senator takes exception has been the law for many years does not necessarily make it wrong. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> boast that he is sufficiently conservative to adhere to old conditions, which he thinks good, until he is shown something better. The provision to which he is now taking exception has stood the test of time and experience. The British mercantile marine stands supreme to-day, because the conditions of British shipping in regard to crews and the carriage of goods are better than those which obtain in any other mercantile marine. Shippers know that on British ships they have a better chance than they have on ships of other nations of having their contracts observed, and of getting decent treatment. That confidence is based upon laws which have been operating for many years, and which this bill now proposes to continue. We should be very careful before we listen to any proposal to set aside laws which have stood the test of the experience of centuries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in his criticism has entirely overlooked the fact that all that he claims should be done is already done under the navigation laws. </para>

                    <para>. - The speeches of Ministers have amply convinced me of the need for striking out sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of paragraph 2 of article iv. Neither Minister has attempted to say that the carrier should not be held responsible for neglect or default on the part of his servants, and neither Minister has done more than say that, as the Navigation Act makes ample provision in certain regards, it is not necessary to make similar provision in this bill. That being the case, what harm would be done by omitting this subparagraph, and relying entirely on the Navigation Act? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand why this sub-paragraph appears in the bill. The Minister has not made the position clear. He said that if the amendment is agreed to the bill will be destroyed, and awful consequences will follow. He has said the same on other occasions, but despite his warnings the Senate has proceeded to amend bills, and its amendments have been accepted by the Government in another place. We are tired of hearing the Minister cry &#34;Wolf!&#34; so often. I should imagine that the carrier of goods would be amply safeguarded by all the other sub-paragraphs of paragraph 2 of article iv., but we think he should not be relieved of responsibility for the neglect or default of his officers in the navigation or management of a ship. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has told us that the legal advisers of the Government have assured him the words to which we object have not the significance which they seem to have to laymen, but most of us are laymen, and we are legislating for laymen. It behoves us, therefore, to insert in our legislation common-sense provisions which the man in the street can understand. Neither Minister has told the Senate what will happen if this sub-paragraph is omitted from the schedule. </para>

                <para class="block">Surely a man&#39;s goods are to be protected against negligence, or default on the part of the employees of a ship-owner in the navigation of a ship. I venture to say that if the highest legal advisers were consulted they would agree that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> could be omitted without hampering the measure, and that as a matter of fact its omission would strengthen the bill. I can understand a Minister adhering to advice given to him by his legal advisers, but those legal advisers do not carry the responsibility borne by members of Parliament. Although we may be influenced by their judgment on matters of law, I do not think we ought to be absolutely guided by them in framing legislation. At any rate, 1 do not think any legal authority would say that the carriers of goods should not be held responsible for the default or negligence of any one on a ship. I do not believe that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> would hold that if injury is done to goods by the employees on a vessel the owner of the vessel should be exempted from liability for the damage. The purport of the amendment is to leave out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> which relieves the carrier of goods of any liability if the goods are damaged owing to the act, neglect, or default of those engaged on the ship. The amendment does not affect the question of the unseaworthiness of ships. Why should we exempt those responsible for the sea carriage of goods when the Railways Commissioners are liable for acts of negligence on the part of railway servants? The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> drew a parallel between carriage of goods by rail and by sea. I do not intend to pose as one possessing expert knowledge on the responsibilities of Railways Commissioners in this connexion, but if I am not under a misapprehension a consignor of goods by rail who pays the freight and complies with the regulations is guaranteed against loss due to the neglect of railway servants. Why cannot the same principle be applied in this instance? Why should not a carrier of goods by sea be as liable for safe carriage as one who carries goods by rail or any other means. As legal advice can sometimes be obtained in the Senate without paying for it I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> to confirm my opinion that a common carrier is liable for the damage done by his employee. Am I not correct? </para>

                        <para>- I recognize that it is undesirable to place the ship-owners operating under our laws at a disadvantage in competing with foreigners; but will our shipping companies be at a serious disadvantage if we provide that those carrying goods by sea shall be responsible for the acts of their employees? If a seaman, for instance, wilfully threw goods overboard the carrier would be exempt from any liability. That is, of course, an extreme case. </para>

                    <para>. - If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is not speaking with his tongue in his cheek, he must be labouring under a misapprehension. But for this provision if a ship with a full cargo for 200 consignees was piled upon the rocks through an error of the master, the navigation of the ship would be involved, and the 200 consignees could claim on the ship for damage or total loss of goods. A vessel when berthing might bump the wharf, which might come under the term &#34; management of the ship,&#34; and in consequence certain: fragile goods be damaged, in which case there would also be a claim against the ship. This paragraph has been inserted to prevent claims being made in such circumstances, and without it the shipping companies would have no security, and would not be prepared to carry on. </para>

                        <para>-  Yesterday I asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General some questions relating to the proposed alterations to the post office at West Wyalong. During the last week-end a party of honorable senators and honorable members from another place visited that district, and, at the request of the local Chamber of Commerce, eight or ten members of the party inspected the post office, in order to see what ground there was for the very serious complaints that had been made regarding it. We inspected the whole of the building, and the alterations which the Postal Department proposes to make were pointed out. At present, the building is like a dungeon. Every postmaster who has gone to West Wy along in good health, has left with his health broken down. The present postmaster feels keenly the conditions under which he is forced to live, and the people of West Wy along, knowing the position, have taken the matter up, and have made strong representations to the Postal Department. Some time ago a block of land adjoining the post office, and on the corner of the street, was offered to the department for about &#163;300, but the offer was rejected. Subsequently, a two-storied brick building was erected on the site. On the other side of the post office there is another two-storied brick building. The post office is, therefore, jammed in between these two higher buildings, and is thus in a sort of flue, through which the wind whistles, while, because of the high walls on either side, little or no light enters the postmaster&#39;s residence. The. conditions are deplorable, as honorable senators who inspected the building will agree. I suggest to the Minister that he should again refer this matter to his officers to consider the advisability of purchasing the two-storied brick building on the corner. It has a frontage of only 20 feet to the street, and the building could be adapted for postal purposes. The district of West Wyalong is a prosperous and growing one, and it will not be long before additional post office accommodation will be required. The Postal Department should see that its officers are housed in buildings which at least are healthy, and in which they can do their work under conditions which conform to Australian ideas of hygiene. This may be a minor matter compared with many of those with which this Senate has to deal, but it is an important one to the district concerned, and should also be viewed in that light by the Postal Department and members of the Federal Parliament. The present building is a danger to the health of the occupants. For the expenditure of a few hundred pounds, the block alongside could be purchased, and the building now erected thereon utilized for post office purposes. In that case, portion of the land could be sold, and the amount received could be set off against the cost of the corner block. If that were done, the Commonwealth Government would have the premier position in West Wyalong, and the post office could be made a credit to the department. Having seen the position for myself, I can assure the Minister that I have no intention of letting this matter drop. Seeing that it affects the health of the occupants of the building, I shall spare no effort to make the post office do its duty in this. case. </para>

                        <para>. -  I take this opportunity to draw attention to the steady increase in the number of foreigners coming to Australia. The Government is at present negotiating with a shipping firm with a view to having additional steamers running between Australia and Great Britain . Unfortunately, many of the vessels which now come to Australia, are manned by foreigners. That is because coloured labour is cheap. Before the Government proceeds further with any negotiations, it should insist that the company shall employ white men - Britishers or Australians - on its vessels. Of the 19 oversea vessels which arrived in Sydney during one week recently, 10, or more than 50 per cent., were manned by coloured crews. Only five had British crews. Vessels belonging to the Clan, the Peninsular and Oriental, and the Ellerman and Bucknall lines, carry only coloured crews, most of whom are Indians. The French mail steamers are manned mostly by Cingalese and negroes. The HollandAustralia liners were, until recently, manned by European crews; but the Dutch steamer, <inline font-style="italic">Aagtekirk,</inline> arrived from Rotterdam with a Malay crew, who are content with a payment of 10s. a week for their services. I hope that others who stand for a White Australia will join in the protest I have made, otherwise members of the British race will be excluded from the vessels carrying passengers and cargo to and from Australia. </para>

                        <para>. -  In reply to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> yesterday, I informed him that it was proposed to spend approximately &#163;3,000 on the West Wyalong post office. Honorable senators will recognize that the expenditure of that sum would make a material difference to the post office in that town. </para>
