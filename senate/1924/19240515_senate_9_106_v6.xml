                    <para>. -  This is one of the more important clauses in the Bill, and I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to its effect. It is desired to bring the principal Act into conformity with the legislation of a number of States, particularly the Conveyancing Act, No.  6,  of  1919,  New. South Wales, the Conveyancing Act, section  4,  of  1915,  Victoria, and similar Acts in the other States which have been introduced in connexion with conveyancing. Probably most, if not all, of those have been introduced since our. original Land Acquisition Act was passed. They provide that a purchaser is not allowed to require proof for more than  40  years. In many cases, however, land is acquired under what is known as the Old Law, the Common Law, or the General Law system, and are held under conveyances. At the present time, it is necessary for the Commonwealth, in order to prove a title, to have searches made right back to the original Crown grant, as since the Crown grant was issued many conveyances and changes of title may have taken place, covering transactions over many years, and the property might have passed from individuals to companies or bodies. The subsequent change of ownership has frequently been found to be incomplete and uncertain, due to the same land having apparently been at some time or other conveyed to two different people; or, as is frequently found to be the case, the legal position of the person in possession is indefinite, there being a break in the continuity of the transactions. This proposed amendment of the Act will, we hope, remove any doubt on that point, and bring our law into conformity with those that the States have seen fit to pass respecting these conveyances. </para>

                <para class="block">I invite the special attention of honorable senators to this new sub-clause, because I do not wish it to be said later that it was &#34; sneaked in.&#34; There is a deep-rooted and proper objection on the part of all Parliaments and of local governing bodies to the granting of any authority which will lead to the frittering away of our public parks. In the original Lands Acquisition Bill first introduced, there was a clause that gave to the Common wealth compulsory power of acquisition of public parks. That was decisively and, I think, very properly defeated. At present, we have no power to compulsorily acquire any public park or recreation ground. We are not now seeking that power. By examining the proposed new subsection honorable senators will see that it provides only for a lease or licence, which is expressly stated not to exceed ten years. When the power to compulsorily acquire park lands, recreation grounds, or reserves set aside for that purpose was previously refused, it practically prevented the Commonwealth from accepting a lease or licence to go on those lands for any public purpose. That has been found to be as bad in the other extreme, because many of these lands that have been reserved and set aside, are not being used at present for the purpose for which they were dedicated. In the interests of the advance of aviation, it has become necessary that the Commonwealth, with the consent and agreement of the local governing bodies concerned, shall be able by licence to go upon such land, or to obtain a lease for use of such land for a definite period. I am not wedded to the proposed period of ten years provided for in the sub-section. If any honorable senator thinks that there is  a  danger in it, and so that the people may have an opportunity to review any decision to grant a lease, I do not object to a lease or licence for a shorter term. The fact that it is a lease or licence, and is for  a  definite period, gives to the people, through their municipal or other representatives, the right later to decide whether the lease shall be continued. </para>

Early last year the Air Force desired to acquire by lease portion of a public park at Albury. The municipality of Albury agreed to grant a licence to the Commonwealth to use this land., portion of Alexandra Park, as a landing ground for aeroplanes. Search disclosed that the land in question was a public park dedicated for the purpose of public recreation, and placed under the control of the municipal council of Albury, as trustees. Section8 of the Public Parks Act 1912 of New South Wales is as follows: - </para>

We can surely depend on the local authorities not to grant a lease where it will interfere with the rights of the people for recreation purposes. If a lease of land is granted at a township, and the town grows, and the population increases to such an extent as to warrant the withdrawal of the lease, then the local Board will step in to safeguard the rights of the people. This is not a compulsory power. Under this clause we can obtain only a lease or agreement, and therefore it is not in the same category as the clause to which objection was formerly taken. I thought it only right to point this out to honorable senators, and to invite them to offer any objections they might have to the sub-clause in its proposed form. I am as strong as any one in the desire that full protection shall be given to public parks established in the neighbourhood of large towns. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am satisfied now that no duress can be exercised by the Commonwealth against a State or a local authority in regard to land over which, by the Constitution, the Commonwealth is given very little jurisdiction. It seems to me that this Bill, the tenor of which seems to predicate a hostile attitude on the part of the States, puts in the hands of the Commonwealth Government not friendly disposed towards those States a very powerful weapon that may be misused to their detriment. I want to avoid any possibility of that, and it is the duty of the Senate, which is the States&#39; House, to see that nothing of the sort takes place. However, on the assurance of the Minister that no compulsion is possible, and that he is prepared to have the period fixed at seven years instead of ten, I think the Senate would not be lacking in its duty in accepting the proposal. </para>

In some instances it may not be necessary to disturb a lessee. It is very desirable that in such cases the Commonwealth should not be liable for compensation, but that the lessees should simply become tenants of the Commonwealth until such time as the property is required by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - This is an important amendment of section 19 of the principal Act to which I direct the attention of the Committee. The power to revoke an acquisition, either wholly or as to any part of the land acquired, is necessary to safeguard the Commonwealth from any claims that might occur due to the Commonwealth acquiring some interest in the land other than that disclosed at the time of acquisition. As a case in point, I may mention that the War Service Homes Commissioner acquired from the Caledonian Colliery Company a property known as the King&#39;s-road Estate, Adamstown, New South. Wales. The purchase price, amounting to &#163;5,943, was agreed to prior to the acquisition. The property was subsequently acquired under the compulsory clauses of the Lands Acquisition Act, and after the acquisition, the Caledonian Collieries Limited (Howard Smith and Company) claimed &#163;10,000 damages for loss of certain coal, and loss of access, as the acquisition acquired, in addition to the surface of the land, the land below the surface, practically to the earth&#39;s centre, and all interests in connexion therewith. After the acquisition, the Caledonian Collieries Limited produced evidence that they held a registered transfer from the Waratah Coal Company, which was not disclosed by a search against the title, of all the coal under the subject land, and had the right to pass over and through the land in any way for the purpose of working such coal. This company also owned certain coal areas on both sides of the subject property. If the Commonwealth had had&#39; power under the Act to revoke such acquisition as to the interests of the company, the difficulties experienced in settling this case- would have been overcome. The acquisition of the property at Fairy Meadow is another case in point. Tn that instance, an exorbitant claim was made for certain valuable lime deposits which, up to the time of the acquisition, and &#39; not until their value was disclosed by the Commonwealth, were not considered of any commercial use by the then owners of the property. The question of revocation has already been provided for in the Lands Acquisition Act, as modified by regulation for War Service Homes purposes, and has been found in practice to be of great assistance to the Commonwealth. The concluding portion of section 19 provides that no persons interested by such revocation shall be hardly dealt with, as provision is made to compensate any person who is entitled to compensation for any damage which he may actually and unavoidably have suffered  by reason of th&#171; notification. It will be noticed that the voiding of the acquisition is by resolution of both Houses of Parliament, which is an adequate safeguard. </para>

Provision is made in this clause for compensation to a lessee of property compulsorily acquired for any right or option of extension of his lease or renewal for purchase which he may be legally entitled to at the date of the acquisition. This interest of a lessee has, in the administration of- the Act, always been considered, and the amendment is to bring the Act into line with every-day practice. </para>

                    <para>. - Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> 6, and c of sub-clause 2 are in conformity with the principal Act, but sub-clause 4 is a new departure, and provides that the Minister may make an offer in respect of an acquisition to all or any two or more of the claimants jointly without apportioning the amount offered among those claimants. The need for this amendment has been experienced in the administration of the Act in cases where the Commonwealth has . acquired a property, portion of which has been let under a long lease and the lessee has sub-let to others. A case in point is the acquisition of premises for the Commonwealth Bank in Adelaide. The Commonwealth should be able to make one offer for the acquisition, and those who have claims against each other should be the subject of adjustment between themselves. It does not seem right that the Commonwealth should have to shoulder the responsibility of settling claims against lessees and sub-lessees of property acquired by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a rather important clause. The suggested amendment of the Act is nothing new so far as the method to be adopted with regard to the allocation of costs is concerned, as it follows closely upon section 30 of the Victorian Lands Compensation Act of 1915. . The amendment is considered necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth, as, in practice, the method adopted by claimants in disputed claims has invariably been to claim an amount considerably in excess of the value of the property, and call a large number of witnesses to endeavour to substantiate such claim. The Commonwealth has relied in such cases on the evidence of, at the outside, three or four valuators of repute, and during the Court proceedings the weight of evidence produced by the claimants has always, in practice, had the effect desired by the plaintiff of getting a judgment somewhat in excess of the Commonwealth&#39;s offer. This has resulted in the Commonwealth, in almost every case, having to pay the costs of the plaintiff. These costs, in consequence of the number of witnesses called by the plaintiffs, have been of considerable moment. The following are some of the cases which the Commonwealth has had before the Court during the last few years : - </para>

                    <para>. - We should take a rather generous view of this matter. It often happens that the land-owner has no desire to part with the property which the Commonwealth decides to acquire for public purposes. For sentimental reasons, the owner may be particularly anxious to retain his land. The decision of the Court does not always afford positive proof that the owner has received adequate compensation. A property may have been in a family for generations, and although its ordinary market value may not be equal to the sum offered by the Commonwealth, there is nevertheless a sentimental value that it is difficult to estimate by arbitration. We should not make the owner pay the costs in these cases when the land is acquired by the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - It does not seem desirable at present to alter the rate of interest, although 3 per cent., as proposed in this clause, may seem low. The present indications are that money is becoming cheaper. The question of the rate of interest is, of course, a matter of policy. The other amendments made by the clause are designed to place on a more equitable basis the payment of interest on compensation. Should the owner continue to occupy and use the land, it is considered that interest should not commence until the Commonwealth takes possession, and in cases of compensation to a mortgagee, he will only be entitled to statutory interest as from the expiration of six months from the date of acquisition of the land, instead of as at present from the date of acquisition. It is considered that these amendments, together with others in sub-clause 3, will considerably assist the administration of the Act with regard to the computation of the amount of interest to be paid. </para>

                    <para>.- It is not desirable to retain the low rate of 3 per cent. which was the amount fixed in the original Act when it was passed some years ago. Money is now much dearer than at that time, and there is no likelihood of its being as cheap as it was when the original measure became law. Whatever is the reasonable current rate should be paid. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> himself, apparently, does not feel satisfied that it is desirable to retain this low rate. It might meet the case to provide for a maximum rate not exceeding 5 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not wise to import into Bills a greater number of definitions than are naturally inherent in them. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that, if the Committee agreed to an amendment providing that the interest should be at a rate not exceeding 5 per cent., it would not thereby fix the rate, and no authority would be appointed which would be charged with that duty. I should very much prefer to provide for the payment of the ruling bank rate, which, although indefinite in sound, has the merit that information relating to it is obtainable at a few minutes&#39; notice. There is generally a reluctance displayed by any Government to payment of the ruling commercial rate of interest, though there is usually extreme willingness to receive it. By making the indefinite provision suggested, we would be adding another difficulty to a piece of legislation which already bristles with a great number of difficulties. It would be far better to say that the rate of interest should be 4 per cent. This proposal is on similar lines to an amendment which once was handed to me, proposing that certain actions should be legal two or three times a year. </para>

                    (Western Australia - Minister for Home and Territories) on a definite rate of 3 per cent., 4 per cent., or 5 per cent. Under the amendment proposed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline>
                    the Minister would fix the rate, and he would be in a position to say that it should be 2 per cent. I ask the Committee to adhere to the rate of 3 per cent. This Act has been in existence for twenty years, and there has been no great outcry in regard to compensation, although we have been paying 3 per, cent. right through. It is not possible to acquire until the money has been voted by Parliament. Therefore, as soon as the legalities have been complied with, there is generally very little delay in making payment. In the circumstances, I think we can very well allow the rate to remain at 3 per cent.

                        <para>That, in the opinion of the. Senate, it is desirable, in the best interests of the progress of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, that immediate steps be taken by the Government to make provision for the election by the local adult residents of a Committee of niue of their number, for the purpose of considering and advising the Administrator on all matters affecting the Territory. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">When I ask that the adult residents of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea be clothed with power to elect nine of their number as a Committee, honorable senators must understand that I mean the adult white residents. I had the pleasure recently of visiting a portion of the Mandated Territories, and I took a very keen interest in all that I observed during the brief period at my disposal. In conversation with the residents, I ascertained that there was a good deal of discontent and dissatisfaction among them on account of having no representation or control over the making of the ordinances or regulations by which they are governed. As far as I was able to gather, they were unanimously of the opinion that the time was  opportune for some form of local government to be extended to them, and with that I agree. The men and women who have gone to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea are, generally speaking, well educated, enterprising, and necessarily intelligent. They are a class of people who might very advantageously and very safely have conferred on them the instalment of self-government that I have suggested. Australia was once controlled from </para>
                    <para class="block">London, but, in the early stages of its history, it was divided into colonies which had conferred on them almost complete governmental independence, and, at a later stage, it took further steps in that direction by merging the colonies into a Commonwealth. It may be pointed out that Lord Howe Island has no form of local government; but just across the mountains, On the mainland of New Guinea, the people of Papua, of the same class as those who are pioneering the Mandated Territory, have an instalment of local government with which, so far as I have been able to ascertain, they are satisfied-. There may be some objection to the partial form of self-government in operation in Papua, but, nevertheless, it is a step towards com.plete self-government, and my proposal is merely to extend that partial form to the adjacent country. There are 92,000 square miles in the Mandated Territory - about 10,000 more than there are in the State of Victoria. The white population will gradually increase. For climatic reasons the increase may be slow, but, whether it be slow or quick, the people in the Territory are entitled to self-government. I do not make any adverse comments on the present Administrator,  but  I think it is unfair to subject to the complete control of one man a large number of Australians who have been accustomed to taking a share in the government of the country in which they reside. I know that the regulations drawn up by the Administrator must receive the approval of the Commonwealth Government, but it would be more satisfactory to the pioneers of that part of the world if they were given a small instalment of self-government. The bulk of the white population of New Guinea is situated mostly in and around Rabaul, on the island of New Britain, but there is a very fair sprinkling of people, in New Ireland and on the other islands of any importance. On the mainland, also, there is a fair-sized township at Madang, and there are white people at the various mission stations. All of those I met, and with whom I discussed this subject, were of the opinion that the time was opportune to extend some form of self-government to them. They declared that they would be prepared to visit Rabaul once or twice a year, for a limited time, at their own expense. The men and women in New Guinea are  obliged to pay taxes. first of all, there is the Customs House, which seems to be a necessary adjunct to any form of civilization, and all the residents are obliged to contribute a percentage on all goods they import. There is &#39;.so an export duty on copra. The more coco-nuts the planters produce, the more they are fined. It seems a stupid idea, but that is the arrangement which has been foisted on them by the Administration, with the endorsement of the Commonwealth Government. They have also to pay another stupid form of taxation, known as the income tax. The more work a settler does, the more he is fined annually It is a system of taxation not unknown in other parts of the world. The membership of the Committee I propose need not be the number I have suggested. I do not think that the fact that the Territory is controlled by the Commonwealth under a mandate should prevent the residents from having some form of local government. They are separated from each other by immense distances, and means of communication ire costly, but these handicaps do not prevent them from taking an interest iri what is occurring in other parts of the world. They may be inarticulate through having no local paper to voice their opinions, but it must not be thought that they have forgotten that they belong to Australia. They feel very much aggrieved that they have no form of self-, government. If a vote of the white people in the Territory were taken it would be almost unanimously in favour <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> securing some form of self-government. We have given this concession to other Territories. The Northern Territory has representation in the House of Representatives, and it is a mistake that the people of that Territory were not given the right to return a representative to this Chamber. My opinion is that as time  goes  on the people of- all the Pacific Islands under the control of the Commonwealth, whether under mandate or otherwise, will insist on the right to govern themselves. They will not be content to continue paying taxes without some form of representation. In New Guinea they are entirely under the domination of the Administrator. However benevolent, capable, and willing- that gentleman may be, he cannot give to the residents of th&#171; Territory that satisfaction which would be afforded to them by self-government. They suffer considerable hardships. They are doing the pioneering work required at the outposts of the Empire, and the very least that we can do for them is to extend to them without delay the small instalment of local government suggested in my motion. </para>

There are practically only two activities there - the administration under the control of the Administrator and his officers, and the operations of the Expropriation Board. In that respect New Guinea differs from Papua, where the plantations are privately owned, and where .mining companies are also operating. In Papua, the population consists of plantation owners and mine owners, and plantation managers and mine managers, and whatever white men are employed. Nothing like those conditions are to be found in New Guinea, and if an Advisory Council were elected it- would simply mean Government officials electing other Government officials to give the advice which is now available. Officials are paid to control the plantations and to administer the Territory. It would be farcical to elect a certain number as an advisory council to control the whole. The motion is premature. The time will arrive when we shall dispose of the plantations instead of conducting them under the Expropriation Board, and when they are controlled by private owners there will be a civil population. At present it is almost wholly an official population. I do not think the time has arrived for the election of an advisory council. If the honorable senator wishes to pass some motion on this subject, perhaps he will be prepared to accept an amendment, which I now move - </para>

                    <para class="block">Our action would then be consistent with what was done in Papua, where the first step was to appoint a Legislative Council, some of the members of which are nominated by the Lieut. -Governor and some by the people. A further step has recently been taken in connexion  with  the Legislative Council at Papua, by allowing the non-official representatives in the Legislative Council to elect a non-official member to the Executive Council. We cannot, I think, very wisely rush in bo provide for elective local governing bodies in such  communities,  as they have not reached that stage in. their evolution. The proper course is to follow the practice adopted in Papua. From that system a more completely elective body can develop and eventually self-government may be secured. If the honorable senator cannot accept the amendment I have moved the Government must oppose the motion, because it is one to which effect cannot be given at this stage. After having organized a public service in which certain men are placed in public positions to advise the Administrator, it would be unreasonable &#39;to bring the same people together to select others to advise him.

                            <para>- The overseers on <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> plantation are doing the actual pioneering work in the Territory, and, so far as I am able to gauge the position, they have no voice or vote in advising the Administrator in regard to the Ordinances or regulations brought into operation. What physical change are the overseers likely to undergo when they become owners of the plantations or are employed as overseers for those who may subsequently purchase them? Their interests will be precisely the same as they are today. The proposal to postpone any form of local government until the civil population equals or exceeds that of the Administration and that controlled by the Expropriation Board is only an attempt to postpone the granting of local government to the people.&#34; We might just a3 well say that the Commonwealth public servants should not have a voice in the Government of Australia, because the men employed by the Board are actually public servants. I do not know why the Administration should not control the plantations instead of the Expropriation Board, as the men employed by that body are as much public servants as are those employed by the Administrator. These men are in exactly the same position that they will be in when they own the plantations, or when they are under the control of other people, and are therefore entitled to a voice in the control of the Territory. The Government will not entertain the idea of disposing of the plantations until Central Europe is rehabilitated and reasonable prices are obtainable for copra. If the properties are sold before that stage is reached the price obtained will be 50 per cent, less than that which, will be available when the Central European powers are purchasing copra. I cannot accept the amendment, and trust the Senate will reject it. </para>

                    <para class="block">For many years trial by jury, which is regarded as the bulwark of the liberty of the subject, has been firmly implanted in the Commonwealth and throughout the British Dominions; but that right is not conceded to the people of New Guinea. Those who went to that Territory to carry out the necessary preliminary work are deprived, not only of the right to vote, but also of the right of trial by jury, as the Administrator is both Judge and jury. When I was in New Guinea it was represented to me by almost every white resident with whom I conversed on the subject that they were unanimously in favour of, urgently requested, and in fact demanded, the right of trial by jury. It is a very reasonable request, and if we are not to extend to them any form of local government we should at least be prepared to give them the right of trial by jury. I do not know if there is anything to prevent effect being given to the motion if carried, because the Territory is being controlled under a mandate; but if such is the case the difficulty could, I presume, be overcome. I commend my motion to the favorable consideration of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - I must oppose this motion, very largely for the same reason that I objected to the previous motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> The population of New Guinea is almost wholly official. The conditions there are not analogous to those in Australia, where the great majority of the people are non-official. An even greater objection to trial by jury in such a country is the fact that the population is scattered over a wide area. In many districts only two or three white people are to be found. When, the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> was at Rabaul, in October last, the same proposal was made to him, and he asked the Chief Judge of New Guinea to comment on it. This official very pertinently points out in a memorandum on the subject that in some districts of the Territory of New Guinea there are not sufficient Europeans to form a jury. In others - Kavieng and Madang - practically the whole white population would be on the panel, and the business of the place would be suspended, and that at the busiest times, because, as a rule, the Court can only sit when the steamer is in port. In Rabaul, it would be possible to get enough Europeans to form a jury, but only at the sacrifice of much valuable time, and to the detriment of the work of the community. The community is so small and so isolated that every case would inevitably be thoroughly discussed before the trial; and, as a matter of fact, during the trial. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> many cases the views and sympathies of the persons on the panel could be ascertained before the trial. Very seldom would a jury go into the box with an open and unbiased mind. The jury system would be quite unworkable in cases where the accused was not a European. There is grave objection to the members of the Civil Service or the Expropriation Board serving on juries. If they were exempt the remaining population would be much too small to supply sufficient persons to serve. Arrangements are being made for the passage of an Ordinance to be called the &#34; Central Court Assessors Ordinance,&#34; which will provide for the appointment of not more than two assessors to advise the Court on matters of fact, customs, or usage, or any other matters arising at a trial. The assessors will not have power to adjudicate in any case. Juries selected under the conditions obtaining in New Guinea would be very different from those  empannelled  in Australia, where there is a large population to select from, where the right of challenge can be freely exercised, and where it can be fairly assumed that the jurors would not previously have discussed the case among themselves. In a small community, probably every juror would have expressed some opinion before he entered the court. Since the jury system would be totally inapplicable to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will not press his motion to a division. If he does, I shall have to ask honorable senators to vote &#34;against it. </para>

                        <para>. - The arguments of the Minister in opposition to my proposal are of the most flimsy character. Why should not the men employed by the Expropriation Board and by the Administration of New Guinea be eligible to sit on juries?&#39; I do not think the statement quoted by&#39; the Minister regarding the population is correct so far as New Ireland is concerned. There are about 60 plantations, and on each there is some white population. A number of people reside at Kavieng itself and on the islands adjacent to it. At Rabaul there is a considerable white population, and southwards from it the plantations are all occupied by white people. Madang may only have a few white residents, and it might upset business somewhat if they had to serve on juries. That, however, is not a vital objection to my proposal in view of the importance of the principle involved. Some little advance on the present crude state of affairs will be made by the appointment of assessors, but that does no.t go far enough. . If a vote were taken of the white population of the Territory, it would show that the people were almost unanimously in favour of some form of local government, and certainly in favour of the right of trial by jury. Every white man and woman I met there expressed that view in no uncertain manner. They feel that they are exiled Australians who have been deprived of the right of self-government, and even of the right of trial by jury. They resent the idea that one man should exercise the combined functions of judge and jury. I regret that the Minister has taken the retrograde step of whipping up his supporters, and asking them to vote against the motion. I cannot accept the suggested amendment. No attention should be paid to the remarks of the high officials of New Guinea. The residents themselves - the men working on the plantations, and those occupying various positions at Rabaul and elsewhere - are the people directly concerned. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I wish to remind honorable senators that as far back as 1910 the Commonwealth acquired from the State of New South Wales, 900 square miles of magnificent territory suitable for agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and building purposes. Despite all the representations that have been made to date, the various Commonwealth Governments have persistently refused to build homes in any number there, or to give other people the opportunity to do so. In October, 1921, the then Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> approved regulations relating to the leasing of building sites at Canberra&#39;. The idea then was to permit private individuals to secure the right to purchase a lease, and to build their own homes at Canberra. Up to the present that right has never been seriously challenged. I recognize that some persons believe that all the buildings at Canberra, including the erection of homes, should be exclusively the work of the Commonwealth Government. I would have no objection to that if the Government were prepared to do the work, but that is one thing which the Government is not prepared to do. Those who advocate such a policy, in my opinion, are retarding the progress of Canberra. Nothing has retarded the progress of Canberra more than the refusal, of this Government to permit any one to engage in building operations there. I am informed that between five million and seven million bricks are available for building purposes. I know that many hundreds of building sites were pegged out months ago. I understand that when the Government held a Cabinet meeting at Yarralumla House, on 31st January last, it decided to make available to private enterprise 500 building sites within the Territory. That was a step in the right direction. Its action, or want of action, since has been typical of the inactivity displayed in regard to the leasing of blocks at Canberra in the past. It also decided for reasons which have not been satisfactorily explained, that no persons would be permitted to employ any one at Canberra until after 1st October next; in other words, that no building sites would be made available at Canberra for a period of nine months from the date of the holding of that Cabinet meeting. We read in the press to-day, and mention has been made of it in this Chamber during the last few days, that other enterprising people have been disposing of blocks of freehold land adjoining the Territory even in London. I was pleased to see that there is a possibility of its being brought so forcibly &#39; before the London people that those sites are outside Canberra, that very much harm is not likely to result. It may be interesting to look at the regulations laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> when he was Minister for Works. He laid it down that the rental value of each of these blocks should be equal to 5 per cent, of the capital value of the land, and that the term of. the lease should be 99 years, subject to reappraisement  at the end of&#39; the first twenty years and every ten years thereafter. We do not yet know what regulations the Government proposes to submit to this Parliament for approval. Some persons would be delighted if a Board were created, clothed with the power to fix the rental value of these blocks of land. I should not like to see such a Board created. I believe that the public are the best judges of the value of the land. These blocks should be widely advertised, and the highest bidder should become the purchaser of the lease. I know there are some people who do not favour that doctrine. </para>

                            <para>- Those who do not believe that the highest bidder should be the purchaser of a lease would like to see a Board established to fix the rent, perhaps over a very long period of years. I do not want to see that done. In my opinion, the Commonwealth is entitled to receive the full rental value, and no more, of each of these building sites, and the lessee should be called upon to pay to the Commonwealth that full rental value. I have no sympathy with those who would give individuals the right to the use of these blocks over an extended term at a rental lower than that which the Commonwealth is entitled to get. Every effort which has been made in that direction, I believe, has proved a failure. Only a few years ago the Government of Queensland leased a big frontage on the south-east portion of the coast, and permitted the lessees to secure the use of that land without imposing any conditions in regard to building. The result has been that those blocks are still in the same condition as when they were leased. At a later date the Queensland Government adopted a different method; it leased blocks to the highest bidder, imposing the condition that a building should be erected thereon within a certain specified time. While the blocks originally disposed of are yet in a virgin state, in. almost every case those more recently disposed of have been built upon. It ought, I think, to be the aim of the Commonwealth to ensure that these blocks at Canberra are used for the purpose for which they were intended. I do not favour the making of very many regulations in connexion with these  builds  ing sites; the fewer the regulations, the better. If the lease were fixed for a term of ninety-nine years, subject to reappraisement at such periods as would ensure the Commonwealth getting the full rental value, and no more, of each block, it would be fair to the Commonwealth, and to the purchaser of the lease. There would not be the remotest possibility of any one acquiring building sites under those conditions for speculative purposes; no one could afford to do so. </para>

                    <para>I should certainly object to one man securing many blocks. At the same time, we must not forget that, at Canberra, there are over 1,000 square miles, and even though a man secured two or three blocks it would, not be a serious&#39; matter, so long as he were compelled to pay annually to the Commonwealth the full rental value of each block, and to erect and keep ,in order a building in accordance with the regulations laid down. I would not support a proposal to give any person, no matter what he paid, the lease of a block, unless he utilized it foi the purpose for which it was intended. If my suggestions are carried out there would be no  possibiltj&#39;  . of the capitalist coining along and scooping up thousands of blocks and building upon them. I should be very glad if some one went to Canberra and built a thousand house&#39;s. That would be a very good thing if other blocks were available, so that any one who felt aggrieved at the rent exacted by the landlord, could acquire a block and build his own .home. Why has the Government persistently refused to make available any of these building sites? Around Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and other cities, during the last two or three years, I venture to say, tens of thousands of blocks have been made available for building purposes, almost at a few weeks&#39; notice; but, for some reason or other, the Government has persistently held out of use the whole of these building sites. </para>

There is, of course, a limit to the number of building sites  available at Canberra; but a great number of quarter-acre blocks could be carved out of an area of 1,000 square miles, and certainly a good many within the area of the Capital itself, whether 16 square miles or 64 square miles. It is not yet settled whether there is to be a Capital area 4 miles square or 8 miles square, but in either case ample space is available, for a considerable number of years to come, for building sites. . This Government, to prevent settlement at Canberra - and there can be no other object in view - is deliberately withholding from the public the leases of building sites. The time has come for those in favour of the progress of the Federal Capital to express their views on this question. No- one can get behind the motion on the flimsy pretext that it is designed to hand over Canberra to private enterprise. It provides for nothing of the sort. </para>

Does not the honorable senator know that, notwithstanding all our beneficial legislation, we have large numbers of unemployed who would be only too pleased to engage in building operations at the Federal Capital ? While the Government officers there are housed in Yarralumla House, and in a magnificent and palatial residence at Acton, the working men are living at Queanbeyan, in camps on the Capital site, or in the old German concentration camp. These things do not concern the legal plutocrats like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline></para>

                        <para>. -  Referring to the cost of certain lighthouse service vessels mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> on the. motion for adjournment yesterday, I am informed that these steamships are of special design, having been constructed for very special work. They have extensive and complete accommodation for lighthouse-keepers and their families, and also for certain officials, in addition to the officers and crew. Other special fittings and accommodation and refrigerated space for tropical service are provided. The auxiliaries and gear are of a special and complete character, the vessels being found in every respect with bedding, napery, and cutlery; in fact, with every essential for special work at sea at short notice. For their comparatively large dimensions, they carry only a very limited amount of dead-weight, which is made up of lighthouse stores, equipment, fuel, water, &#38;c. In no sense of the word are they cargo boats. No shipbuilder would estimate the cost of vessels of this type on a deadweight basis ; the cost would be arrived at by taking every item in detail. It is incorrect to say that these vessels could be built in England at anything like &#163;9 or &#163;10 per ton. </para>

                        <para>. -  I wish to invite the attention of the Minister dealing with War Service Homes to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Eva</inline> Penketh, of &#34; The Retreat,&#34; Hathill-road, Blackheath. This lady, for a considerable number of years, has endeavoured to obtain a home from the War Service Homes Commission. She had the misfortune to lose her two sons at the Front.  Her  efforts to secure a home from the Commission have been futile, as the pension the receives from the Repatriation Department is not considered to be sufficient to enable her to pay the instalments necessary to purchase a home. I have no doubt that the Commission are carrying out the provisions of the War Service Homes Act, but their action is particularly hard upon this lady. I do not suppose that she is the only one directly concerned. In New South Wales rents, even for small homes, are very high, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Penketh</inline> finds it difficult to live in reasonable comfort. I shall submit the correspondence, concerning the case to the Minister in the hope that he will carefully consider the matter, and, if nothing can be done under the Act, I urge him to consider the advisability of bringing in an amending Bill to provide for such cases. </para>
