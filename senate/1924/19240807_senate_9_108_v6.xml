                        <para>. - My reason for speaking on the third reading of the measure is that the bill is now quite different from what it was when introduced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Its most important feature consists in the extraordinary amendment so skilfully engineered by the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene.</inline> I refer to the amendment which provides for the issue of notes against securities held in London. To me it is quite refreshing to know that a change has come over honorable senators opposite since July of last year. Probably this is because we have the advantage of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene&#39;s</inline> presence ; because last year, when I was putting forward, in a practical and common-sense way, a proposal to issue notes against gold in the Treasury with a view to paying off portion of our war indebtedness, honorable senators opposite were almost unanimous in their opposition to it. My suggestion then was that the additional issue should be on the basis provided by the original act, namely, a gold reserve of 25 per cent., and I showed that on that basis there was still a margin of &#163;46,000,000 available. Almost without exception, honorable senators, by their interjections and later by their speeches, showed strong antipathy to the proposal. What a change has come over honorable senators since then ! They are now prepared to issue notes on securities held in London. What is the reason for their change? Is it because we now have with us a distinguished senator from my state? Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> convertedhis friends ? </para>

                            <para>- Well, I am trying to avoid the suggestion that perhaps my remarks under this heading last year converted them. It is possible that, in the recess, they ruminated upon what I had to say then, and that they have come round to my point of view. I have looked up my remarks on the occasion referred to, and I intend to make a note of the interjections then made. I want specially to refer to one. made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> because he was most pronounced in stating his viewpoint. I put forward the suggestion that we could increase the note issue by about &#163;26,000,000, and to that extent could redeem our war loans. In my opinion, that was a modest proposal, since we had a clear margin of &#163;46,000,000. Nevertheless,- it met with quite a round of opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> interjected - </para>

                            <para>- Apparently the honorable senator still holds that view. Let us look at the position fairly. If, in July of last year, the issue of &#163;20,000,000 of Australian notes against gold in the Treasury and the credit of the Australian people would have sent Australian currency in pursuit of the German mark, where will our currency get to if we issue &#163;20,000,000 worth of notes against securities held in London? That is a fair question to ask. </para>

I have also heard it said that the notes are to be issued to relieve the balances held in London, and I have read that those balances go as high as &#163;70,000,000. I have here a. number of remarks by recognized authorities on finance. It might be as well if I gave honorable senators the benefit of their opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> J.

                        <para>The balance of exchange with London at the present time is largely in favour of Australia, though I do not think that the accumulations in London are as large as they are, by many, supposed to be. This condition has been brought about largely by transfer of Government and municipal funds borrowed abroad,  and by invisible exports, i.e., money remitted here for investment and other purposes, pf which there is no record. The amount of these invisible exports must, I imagine, be very considerable. The only way in which money can be brought from London now is by import of goods. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the honorable senator, is so busy interjecting that he never has time to listen to what- 1 have to say. A perusal of my <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> speeches, interesting as they may be, shows that interjections from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> are more numerous than from any other honorable senator. It would appear that he never waits long enough to hear what I have to say, or that, having heard it, he is incapable of understanding any one who talks ordinary commonsense. _ He thinks only of himself, and has not time for any one else. However, I do not wish to bo drawn into personal exchanges with the honorable senator, so I shall desist. I was referring, when diverted by interjections, to my remarks in July of last year, in favour of increasing the issue of Australian notes upon the credit of the Australian people and gold in the Treasury with a view to paying off portion of our war indebtedness. On that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> was the most frequent interjector in opposition to my proposal. Now I find him favorable to the issue of notes against London securities. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen</inline> has pointed out that the only way in which money can be brought from London now is by the importation of goods. That is one of the things which the Senate should consider. When speaking only a few weeks ago on this subject I emphasized that our accumulated surplus in London was due to the fact that we had not a free interchange of commodities with Britain. Our produce enters Great Britain without any barrier, but products from the Mother Country have to surmount a Customs barrier of 30 per cent, or more. This is one of the causes of the present huge surplus in London. This gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen,</inline> speaking of the note issue, said - </para>

The adoption of either of these proposals would mean decided inflation, with all its dangers, and, instead of improving the position, would, in my opinion, eventually make it worse, and would lead to serious trouble. </para>

All that they have to do is to1 induce the Government to introduce a bill to give them the right to issue notes again, and no one on the Government side of the Senate will oppose it. Another financial expert has expressed similar views. I do not pretend any acquaintance with him, but as a responsible newspaper has given him a column of its space to deal with the exchange question, one may readily accept him as a financial expert. </para>

                            <para>- The newspapers gave the honorable senator, for his speech on the second reading of this bill, an amount of publicity that has never been given to any other senator. Before I gathered the purpose of that publicity, I said that it was so much in excess of the importance of the honorable senator&#39;s utterance, that, like the chess player who is always wondering what the next move will be, I would wait until the next move was made. Now I know that the reason for it was that pressure was being brought to bear on the Government to do something; and because the Government have yielded to that pressure I am now addressing myself to this question. The publicity given to the honorable senator&#39;s speech was a part of that pressure. The honorable senator urged that before this bill was passed, a royal commission should be appointed to inquire into it, and I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> amendment for the appointment of such a royal commission was , also part and parcel of the pressure of the private banks upon the Government to give them the concession to issue their own notes. At any rate, I shall .quote now the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butchart,</inline> an exchange broker of Melbourne. According to the newspaper from which I am quoting, this gentleman, who was formerly chief inspector of the London Bank of Australia, in an address delivered before the Legacy Club., blamed the banks for the present exchange difficulty in regard to Australia&#39;s trade with England. This is the newspaper report of this gentleman&#39;s address: - </para>

                    <para>Here was the Teal reason for the present exchange difficulty. The real reason was that the banks had made such large advances of a non-liquid character, which they could not pay off by ready cancellation of deposits being set ofl&#39; against the advances to liquidate them. The delinquents were the bankers; they were at fault. As .a British financial expert had put it &#34;A big note issue told more of the past than of the future, and proved not that the moment had come for a change of course, but that the navigation was already at fault, and the ship was on the rocks.&#34; It was the bankers who &#39;desired to increase the note issue to cover up their over-trading. One banker recently said the remedy was to cease borrowing in London. He (the  speaker)  wondered if this -were the same man who in December, 1920, said the only way to bring about a satisfactory state of things was to float a loan of &#163;10,000,000 in London. Circumstances altered morals. (Loud laughter). It was hoped that whoever was put in charge of the note issue would be wise enough and strong enough to appraise rightly advice  given by bankers. With one or two .honorable exceptions they had no principles, but were men of expediency. The golden rule to be followed by the authority m charge of the note issue should be - &#34; Due limitation of the amount of the currency to maintain its &#34;purchasing power; keep your weather eye on the condition of credit, and let the request of the bankers for more notes go hang&#39;&#34;. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is very .sound advice. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable senators will persist in attributing to me, by means of interjections, something altogether apart from what I have said or  have in mind, they must take their change in the way of replies. I am endeavouring to &#39;show that one authority on &#39;finance has declared that the bankers may &#34; &#39;go hang &#34; so far as their demand for an increased note issue is concerned, and that it is their own over-trading that has brought about the present position and has caused them to  clamour  for an increase in the note issue. It is a claim that must be resisted. As honorable senators can gather from remarks during this debate, efforts which have been made for a considerable time to get the Notes Issue Board to issue notes have been resisted by that board. Yet the Government have now inserted in this bill a provision to compel the board to issue notes, not on gold in the&#39; vaults here, and not on the credit of the people of Australia, but on credits held in London. By the votes recorded, the members of the Government and their supporters have done something which was never contemplated in the past. I trust we shall not hear any more of those indiscriminate interjections that we are sending our currency in pursuit of the German mark. No such statements can be made in regard to any of our proposals when it is remembered that the Government now propose to issue notes against &#39;Securities held in London. The private  banks  were insisting upon a further issue of notes, ,and in my opinion ! one of their chief reasons for so doing was to acquire the right to again issue notes. I presume the next move on the part of the Government will be to give the associated banks that power. No one would expect honorable senators with  experience, and particularly the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> to immediately concede such a point to the private banks, because that would be acting in too candid a way. The method adopted by the Government was to break down the prejudice which existed against increasing the note issue against the gold reserve by embodying in the bill an amendment which gives the Commonwealth Bank the right to issue notes against securities held by the London branch of that institution. The fact that the Government have gone that far is a. clear indication that they have little respect for Australia and its currency. Is no limitation to be imposed? If a government other than the one now in power, particularly one composed of members of the party which I represent, were, to recommend the issue of additional notes, such a government could be reminded that the Bruce-Page Government issued notes against securities held in London. If that can be done notes can be issued upon the flimsiest possible security. The flood gates have been thrown open, and our Australian currency is now faced with the gravest possible danger. I am not one of those who oppose a reasonable inflation of the note issue, provided the gold reserve is adequate. That is shown by the remarks I made twelve months ago. The notes in &#39;circulation can never be in excess of what the people require. It would be just as reasonable to bake more bread than was required, and endeavour to compel the people to consume it. The community will not use more notes than it requires in the conduct of business, and when the limit is reached the balance will find its way back to the Treasury. We have not yet reached the limit, but the Government suddenly submit this proposal, which was decided upon after the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> had been in conference with the representatives of the private banking institutions. We were informed by a Minister in this chamber that an agreement had been reached, and that in consequence of the decisions arrived at this amendment would be incorporated in the bilL That may&#39; be the Minister&#39;s way of doing business, but it is not mine. It does not suit me, and that is why I am protesting against it. The issue of notes in the manner proposed will lead to disaster, because the security is altogether inadequate, particularly as the Government have no control over the securities held in London. The proposal to issue notes against securities held in another country is one of the worst proposals ever submitted. The accumulated surplus in London is not due solely to the difference between our exports and imports. It has not been sufficiently large over a, number of years to create such a large surplus. Some will probably say that the Commonwealth Government, the State Governments, and municipalities have been borrowing money in London, and that the borrowed capital can only come to Australia in the form of goods. I am inclined to think that that is true. On an average we impose a 30 per cent, duty on goods imported from Great Britain, which means that for every &#163;100 we borrow in London we receive only &#163;70. This is one of the many important questions which the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> will have to consider. That Minister has already stated that he intends to recommend the removal of the preference given to Great Britain over other countries on all  goods in which there is not 75 per cent, of British material and labour. Great Britain is not a great producing country.  Her  industries are engaged largely in gathering up and manufacturing the raw products of other countries, and - then disposing of them. The woollen goods Great Britain manufactures consist largely of the wool purchased in Australia, and its iron and steel manufactures comprise the products of Spain and other countries. I have raised this question particularly to show that the minds of our Australian statesmen are not alive to the fact that the barriers between Australia and Great Britain in the matter of trade are responsible for the accumulated surplus in London and for the tightening of title money market. Our position is due to the fact &#39;that we take .a selfish view of these matters, and believe that there is only one country to be considered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> very rightly pointed out that we have to produce more to sell more,- and purchase less. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Where is this buying less to end ? If we continue to produce more and to buy less what will happen ? If we buy less, we use less of the goods which hitherto we required. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> how are we to sell unless we buy ? Other people cannot buy our goods unless we buy theirs. There must be an interchange of goods between nation and nation, or buying and selling between nations will cease. When dealing with our financial proposals, we must consider that the act of selling involves also the act of buying. We must realize that we cannot continue to sell unless we continue to buy. In a country like Australia the remedy is not to sell more and buy less. We must buy more from others in -order to enable them to purchase more of our goods. It is by buying more from outside that we enlarge the circle of our customers and increase our business. That is at the root of the present financial &#34;hold up.&#34; Honorable senators know that in business circles generally there is at present practically a financial &#34; hold up.&#34; Men who have been conducting businesses for years - men, with good reputations and good businesses - now find that the advances from the banks, upon which they have hitherto depended, are not &#39;so easily obtained as formerly. Many reasons are given. They are told of the restriction of the notes issue, that money is tight, and that instead of advancing more, the banks must call up their securities. They are told that they must prepare for difficult times ahead. Now we have the Government introducing legislation along those lines in that it proposes to issue notes against London credits. A little while ago when I mentioned the sum of &#163;20,000,000, I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> interject that the amount involved would be nothing like that sum. A note issue of &#163;20,000,000 is a huge one to make upon foreign securities - I mean &#34; foreign &#34; to be interpreted as applying to all countries outside Australia. To issue notes against securities in London is to issue notes against foreign securities, as those securities are removed from the jurisdiction of our courts. If trouble arose at any time we would have to depend upon the decisions of courts outside the Commonwealth. I am not complaining of the action of the committee in deciding these matters as it has &#39; done. I am not even complaining of the sudden conversion of some honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> on the 6th July, 1923, said that he would issue no more notes against our gold reserve. Yet to-day he is prepared to vote to issue notes against securities in London. That is a remarkable change in the attitude of the honorable senator. </para>

                            <para>- 1 do not want my speech to be marred by personal attacks on honorable senators. Twelve months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> was so emphatic that he said that anything in that direction was to chase the German mark along a very dark alley. I am not surprised at the conversion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> because my experience has been that he generally votes the opposite way to that which he has indicated in his speeches. During the second-reading debate he moved for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the Commonwealth Bank Bill.. Two or three days later he told us that he desired to withdraw his motion. He said that he had got all that he wanted, namely, the issue of notes against credits in London. Had the honorable senator informed us that he was in favour of the whole of the bill, except in so far as it did not provide for the issue of notes against credits in London, and that he desired the assistance of other honorable senators to secure its amendment in that respect, he would have acted in a straightforward manner. Actions such as those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> in indicating to the Government that, unless it conferred with the bankers, he, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> and other insurgents, would hold up the bill, may come off once in this chamber, but once only. Should the Senate become aware of ulterior motives on the part of any honorable senator, it will look with suspicion on future amendments from that quarter. Senators Greene and Foll practically presented a revolver at the Government, saying, in effect, &#34; We shall join the Opposition against this bill, and assist them to hav9 it referred to a royal commission, unless you grant the issue of notes against credits in London.&#34; I repeat that actions of that kind succeed but once in this chamber. The action of Senators Foll and Greene in bringing the Government to heel is a great triumph for them, but  so far as I am concerned - I say it openly and truthfully - if ever such demands are made on the Government, and my vote is sought to assist in enforcing them, I will, if acquainted with, the facts, support constitutional government rather than allow a small minority in this House to direct the affairs of the country. The Government can depend upon it, that no small insurgent section of its supporters in this House shall use Opposition members to secure something which &#39; cannot be obtained in a straightforward manner. I was very much incensed at the flippant manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> asked leave to withdraw his amendment, stating he had got all that he wanted. I take this opportunity to indicate to the Government a course of action which will relieve them from the awkward position in which they will be placed should a few of their supporters endeavour, by means of a revolt, and by holding up the business of this country, to obtain what they want. Opposition members in this Parliament are not willing to place themselves at the beck and call of the private banking&#39; institutions of this country merely at the request of honorable senators who are subservient to those interests. Some honorable members may consider that that is strong language to use, but the time has arrived for plain speaking. This proposal is the worst which has yet been brought forward in this Parliament. No government has yet introduced into the Senate any measure of such importance and magnitude as the one before us. It is a danger to safe banking in Australia. The whole complaint of honorable senators on this side against the management of the bank in the past is that it has proceeded too safely, and, therefore, too&#39; slowly. No honorable senator on this side has ever raised his voice to complain concerning the Notes Issue Board. &#34;We gathered from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene&#39;s</inline> speech, and from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> utterances, that efforts had been made to get the Notes Issue Board to do something in this direction, and that the board had refused to do so. A final effort was successfully made to compel them- to do so. Legislation is now being passed to bring this about. I desire members of another place to know what has happened in the Senate, and the reason why the Government made this concession to one or two honorable senators. I do not think I need delay the Senate any longer. I have promised the Minister to assist to the utmost extent in expediting the passage of this measure. I do not mean to suggest that I am prepared to consent to any curtailment of the rights .of honorable senators to free discussion. Every honorable senator having had full opportunity to express his opposition to the bill, a vote will be taken on the third reading without undue delay, and there the matter will end. As to all the other business that &#39;the Government may introduce, the Opposition will give it full consideration, and, when the Government desires to adjourn, whether for a. short recess or a long one, it will have to shoulder full responsibility for its actions. The Government alone is responsible for the conduct of the business of this chamber, and the Opposition is certainly not in the humour to share any of that responsibility. We on this side realize that that responsibility is grave enough already, and is calculated to sink in the sea of public opinion all who support the Government. I am glad to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> in his place at the present moment, for I feel sure that my remarks concerning him and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> call for some reply from him. </para>

Senators Greene and Poll virtually presented a pistol at the head of the Government, and demanded that it should concede to the private banks the right to obtain notes issued against London securities. Failing the granting of this they threatened to  hold up the bill. I condemn&#39; such a practice in- the strongest terms. It is a practice in the strongest terms.. It is a scheme that is not likely to succeed a second, time- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> will need to give a remarkably convincing explanation of his action., not only to the Senate, but also to the- people he represents. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> relating to the permissive power to be granted to the new board of the Commonwealth Bank, since large credits are now held in London, to hold portion of their reserves against the Australian note issue in securities at the other end of the world. If, instead of doing that, the board simply issued Australian notes, and invested the fund&#39;s in Australian securities here, it would not relieve the exchange position in the same way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> started out, as I understood him, by twitting honorable senators on this side of inconsistency owing to their declining to follow him in his proposal, made some time ago, that in view of the high ratio to the note issue of the present gold reserve which has been built up under the administration-&#39; of the late Government and the present Ministry, we should use the wide- powers that exist  under  the Australian Notes Act to pay a considerable portion of the debts of the country. That would involve the issuing of notes to a large extent, but necessarily within the limit allowed by the Australian Notes&#39; Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> seemed to think that his was- a perfectly sound proposition,, and that the proposal of the Government, by the amendment moved by the Minister, was quite unsound. I venture to say that if either of the two propositions be economically unsound, it is that by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and not the proposal he has been discussing to-day. If history teaches us any lesson <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> relation to the- inflation of currency, it is the danger of a government proceeding to. pay its debts by issuing paper money. There are a number of notable examples&#39; in the history of nations which should be a warning to us. We only need to remember what has been the experience with the French assignat, the &#39; &#39; greenbacks &#34; of the United States of America, the German mark,, the Russian rouble,, and the Austrian krone. What set the ball rolling and eventually Led to the financial <inline font-style="italic">debacle</inline> in those countries, was the attempt by the Government to pay its debts by the issue of&#39; paper currency which it made legal and  Inconvertible  tender. So far as I know,, that has been the beginning of the trouble in every instance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> proposed to foll&#39;ow that course - only&#39; to a limited; extent,, I admit, but it would be the beginning of the downward path. I am not going to say that there have not been some transactions in connexion with the . Australian notes issue that have been perilously near following that track. One such step was taken not so long ago, when &#163;6,000,000 worth of notes were issued to the banks in connexion with the redemption of the war gratuity loan obligations. In that case the Government was- under a definite obligation to the banks to issue currency, and there was a good d&#39;eal of excuse for what was done. The fundamental principle in relation to the issue- of currency, however, is that, if there is any additional issue, it should be directly against debts owing to the country in respect of goods which are sold and pass into consumption-. Currency which is issued as the result of transactions in goods which are sold and1 pass into consumption is vastly different from the currency which arises from the product of the. printing- press, issued by the Government simply as payment or public debts: I d&#38; not. wish, this afternoon,, to enter into a long, detailed discussion&#39; of. this very vexed and difficult problem, hut I feel that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> if he. will pardon me  for saying so, has not quite grasped the true principles underlying what has been done. He persists in talking about the difference&#39; between issuing notes against credits, as he calls them, in London, and issuing notes against the gold and the credit of the Australian people. The notes which will be issued under the amended proposal, against which the honorable senator has directed all his criticism, will be issued in exactly the same way as any other Australian notes, and they will be backed by the gold reserve and by the credit of the Australian people. </para>

                            <para>- The security behind the notes will be exactly the same with this difference, and only this difference, that when we come to invest the money made available by the issue, instead of investing it in Australian securities here it will be invested in money or British securities in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> forgets that the original Australian Notes Act, for which he and his party were principally responsible, provided for that very form of security being held by the Australian Notes Board, or by the Treasurer of the day, who then controlled the note issue. There is no difference in principle between the two issues. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> went on to say that he believed the time had come when, owing to the expansion of trade in Australia, it was necessary to issue more currency. On that, I largely agree with him. I frankly admit that the utmost care must be exercised under the present abnormal conditions, owing to the fact that the note is inconvertible, and that gold is immobile. Working, as we are, under a Government issue which from its very nature prevents the desirable feature of elasticity coming into the issue, and the normal adjustment of it from day to day, to the actual trade requirements of the country - a disability which is inseparable from the class of issue that Australia has - it is all the more incumbent upon those in control of the issue to see that every care is exercised, and that there is no undue inflation. I would say, quite frankly, to the board of the Commonwealth . Bank that in the present circumstances, if it had the slightest suspicion that there was over-trading in the community at any time and additional notes were required to carry on the normal trading needs of the country, it would be perfectly justified in declaring its intention of issuing additional notes only provided a fairly high rate of interest was paid on those so lent to the banks. Of course, under normal conditions, and when there is a free interchange of gold between the nations, the customary method, in Great Britain, at all events, is to employ the rise or fall of the bank rate to adjust the exchange position from time to time. It is almost impossible, under existing conditions, to apply that principle to its fullest extent, because we have not free gold. I want to say, in conclusion, that I regret very much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should have imagined for one moment that I, or any other honorable senator on this side of the chamber, was actuated by any ulterior motive in connexion with anything we did to ensure the passage of the bill. </para>

                            <para>- I still hold the opinion that the Government would have been well advised if, before it introduced the bill at all, it had sent the whole question to a royal commission for investigation, or if it had taken some other steps to throw into the arena of public discussion, for the widest possible consideration, the proposal it was bringing forward. The Government then would have had the advantage of valuable advice from a great number of men with sound experience of financial matters. May I add that when I said of the Treasurer and the Secretary to the Treasury that they had had no banking experience, I meant nothing that was personally derogatory to them. No man can fairly claim to possess all the knowledge and experience which, in my opinion, are essential for the proper public discussion of this subject. We want the expression of many views, because there are many angles from which this question may be viewed. I do not profess, for a single moment, to have acquired a knowledge of more than the barest outline of some of them; but I felt, and I still feel, that it would have been wise if the </para>

                    <para class="block">Government had taken the step I suggested. However, I recognize that, under existing conditions, the primary producers of this country are suffering a very serious handicap. I feel that finance in Australia, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself pointed out this afternoon, has been for some considerable time extremely difficult. Money has been very tight. This financial stringency has held up many important business ventures, lt has prevented many perfectly justifiable additional enterprises from being undertaken; but I believe that by means of this amending measure we shall probably find a way out and a solution of our difficulties. I believe that this way out will be very much along the lines against which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> directed most of his criticism this afternoon. For this reason, and in view of the very definite statement that the Government proposed to take action along the lines indicated, I felt justified in taking the risks and saying that I was prepared to do what I could in committee to shape the bill in a way which I thought best in the interests of the bank and Australia. I want my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> to disabuse his mind entirely of the thought that I, or any one else so far as I know, was actuated by any ulterior motive in connexion with this measure. One could go on almost indefinitely talking about this subject. X have tried in the few words which I have addressed to the Senate this afternoon to clear up the misconception under which I felt confident <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was labouring, and to assure him that if he himself was satisfied that it would have been safe to issue notes along the lines that he proposed, and to which he referred in his opening remarks this afternoon, it is infinitely safer to do what the Government is now proposing to do. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to delay the passage of the bill, but I cannot allow the present occasion to pass without having a last kick at it, for we shall have no other opportunity.- A perusal of the measure as originally introduced and the bill in its amended form convinces me that the efforts made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> and other ministerial supporters have not been effective in perfecting it. It might just as well have been passed in its original form. The underlying principles of the bill as introduced, namely, an alteration in the control of the bank and an increase of its capital, are still in the measure. This increase of capital is to be secured by borrowing money upon which the country will have to pay an excessive rate of interest. All the arguments employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> and other honorable senators have not convinced me that the measure is going to be of any great advantage to the community, or that it will ease the present financial situation due to a dislocation of the exchange position which, in its turn, has been brought about by financial troubles in other countries. So far as I can see, this bill will not smooth out our difficulties. I do not profess to have a very great knowledge of banking or finance, but I know that the present capitalistic system, if it is to continue, must be dominant in the solution of currency and other financial problems. I have no desire to say anything . against the capitalistic system in this country, as at present constituted. In my opinion the social system under which we are living cannot continue under the existing system of finance. I object that this question of finance should always be surrounded with such an air of mystery. Men alleged to be wise in finance think that the man in the street is incapable of understanding these problems, which, we are told, should be left to experts. We all know that our capitalistic system is controlled by the banking institutions of the Commonwealth. The bill as amended has not been improved. Suggestions from this side of the chamber were never entertained, and the amendments that were incorporated in the measure have not interfered with its main principles. When the first Commonwealth Bank Bill was introduced capitalists and financial institutions became alarmed. The Labour party, we were told, should never have contemplated entering the arena of finance. The banking authorities did all in their power to prevent the Commonwealth Bank from becoming the great institution it is today. We were told that we would be unable to get a manager for it. Financial authorities, one or two of whom - including a director of the greatest banking company in New South Wales- - were then in this chamber, declared that by establishing the Commonwealth Bank the Labour party would sink millions of  the people&#39;s money. Experience has proved those apostles of finance to be entirely wrong. The Labour party intended the bank to be a national bank, in which the people&#39;s money would be secure. I was one of the unfortunate individuals who suffered as a result of erratic investments by private banking institutions many years ago. Because of the widespread failure of private banks there arose the need for the Commonwealth Bank, with the credit of the country behind it. I am afraid, however, that the career of the bank will not be continued along its present lines. I believe that before long the savings bank business will be dispensed with. Authority to do this is given, in this bill, to the board. The Labour party intended that the bank should become an important institution, for the encouragement of- industrial and rural -enterprises. Unfortunately, in this bill the Government refused to accept an amendment which would have enabled the bank to develop in that direction. Up to the present, it has not materially helped industrial or rural development, but such a bank, with the credit of the nation behind it, must ultimately overshadow all the private banking corporations of the Commonwealth, and reap some of their gains. In the earlier stages of its career the bank made satisfactory progress, but latterly something went wrong. The bill, as it leaves the Senate, will do what it was aimed to do - prevent&#39; the Commonwealth Bank from getting some of the gains which private banks wish to monopolize. I believe that there is a combine among the banks. Of course, they deny its existence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> G. Cohen, the veteran banker of Australia, denies that the banks had anything to do with this bill. He declares that it was not submitted to them for their&#39; advice. The Government claim that they have had the advice of bankers, and yet these people say they were not asked to give it. If the Government did get advice from some quarter, I want to know where they got it&#34;. So far they have not answered that question. All we know is that an alteration has been made, and we are not aware who instigated it. So far as I can see, the purpose of this bill is nothing but an attempt to interfere with the policy of the Labour party. It is a direct move against the principles of a national bank. </para>

                    <para class="block">At the very outset the Commonwealth Bank did not become as formidable a competitor with the private banks as was originally intended. Its functions were curtailed,* and its powers were limited, because it was likely to interfere with the monopoly held by private institutions. What that monopoly was may easily be gathered from the fact that half a dozen men would meet in some office and determine what the rate of exchange should be, and how bills should be discounted; and every private banking institution had to fall into line. But when the Commonwealth Bank was established they were faced with the competition of an institution which was outside the ring, and from that time onwards they have used all their endeavours to have its functions curtailed and its powers limited. At last they have succeeded. The Government have fallen down in front of the foes of the Commonwealth Bank. They are now willing to permit of its slaughter in the interests of private profit-gaining institutions. As the members of the -present- Government are not wonderful financial experts - the Treasurer has made such heinous blunders that his financial record does not give one the impression that he ought to be regarded as a great financial expert - there must be something, of which we have not been told, behind this attempt to curtail the powers of a great national institution, and save the private banks by eliminating all competition with them. Prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, this little combine to which I have referred, could gamble as they liked with the people&#39;s money. They were doing this to such an extent before the bank smash of the early nineties that unfortunate people lost their life savings which they had placed on fixed deposit in the banks, having. been induced to do so by the offer of a rate of interest that any one in his sane judgment would know the banks could not pay. When the institutions closed their doors for reconstruction, the workers were left lamenting for all time. Many people went to their graves without being repaid. I understand that the Commonwealth Bank, which was to be a people&#39;s bank, is now to become, a bankers&#39; bank. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has tried to explain what this means, but,  in my opinion, a central bank is an institution that discounts for other banks and does work for those institutions. It is a </para>
                    <para class="block">Bort of combine that exercises a certain amount of control over the financial operations of the Commonwealth. If that is the case, this reactionary piece of legislation must have been introduced by the Government at the dictates of its masters. There is a certain amount of outside influence behind every party, but- the outside influence behind the present Government is stronger than that which has been behind any of its predecessors in office. At any rate, it is sufficiently sinister to force Ministers to take steps to destroy a great piece of Labour legislation&#39;. Fortunately, everything points to the early advent of Labour to power. When that comes about the bank will escape from the bond3 forged for it by this bill and will then fulfil its historic destiny. I have not the slightest doubt it will again be placed on the pinnacle of fame it has earned throughout the world. In Canada, the United States of America, and other parts of the world, its success has been held up  as an object lesson to the people of other countries to induce them to undertake their own banking. This bill has been brought forward at the dictates of the financial institutions to drag the bank down from that great pinnacle to which it was raised by the brains and foresight of one who is now departed from this life. However, I have done my duty in regard to it. With a few others on this side of the Senate, I have attempted to defeat the objects of those who are behind the Government in this move. We have failed. Although the bill has been altered in certain details the main principles have not been touched, but like an old boxer leaving the ring after defeat, I do not give this departing measure my blessing but give it, rather, one last kick. </para>

                        <para>. - Before this bill leaves the Senate, I wish to say that I thought of using the present opportunity to insert in it a safeguard in the public interest, namely, to oblige the bank to keep a certain amount of its assets in cash or liquid form. That intention was dictated, as I have already mentioned, by my observance of the experience of Australia in the early nineties. I believe that the law in regard to the control of banking has not been altered from what it was at that &#34;period in Australia&#39;s history, and that the banking legislation of to-day does not compel the banks to keep within easy reach a negotiable part of their assets which would enable them to withstand any sudden demand upon them. I have already quoted the opinion of a leading banker given before a royal commission in New South Wales at the time to which I have referred, that too much attention was paid to the necessity for keeping a gold reserve in respect of notes in circulation, and not sufficient attention to the more vital necessity of compelling the -various banking institutions to keep a substantial cash &#39;reserve, and securities in a fairly liquid and negotiable form, so that these might be made available to meet any sudden demand made upon the institutions. I intended to ask the Senate to agree to some such safeguard in the case of the Commonwealth Bank, so that a recurrence of the unfortunate -experience of the early nineties might be avoided, but I now realize that to do so would be to place the bank in a very disadvantageous position as compared with other banks. To call upon the Commonwealth Bank to keep within easy reach a valuable portion of its assets in order to meet a sudden demand, such as was manifested in the early nineties, and not to call upon the other banks to do likewise, would impose on it a handicap that would seriously interfere with the carrying on of its business on a profitable scale. Therefore, it would not be fair to apply this safeguard to the bank owned by the Commonwealth while not applying it to private institutions. Nevertheless, my conviction is not undermined that some such safeguard is absolutely necessary in order to compel the banking institutions of this country to conduct their businesses on safe, sound, and rational lines, so that they shall never again furnish us with the spectacle of the early nineties, when thousands of people were ruined as a result of the careless, rash, and almost criminal action on the part of some people conducting banking in this country. The law to-day is the same as it was at that time, and it is open for the same thing to recur; yet no action is taken to prevent such a possibility. I realize, as the Minister has pointed out, that the Commonwealth Bank has behind it the credit of the nation. The good faith of the people is a most important/ asset, and is something that does not stand behind any private bank. With the security behind the- Commonwealth Bank there is not the necessity to apply to it. the safeguard that would be warranted in the case of private banks. However, I take this opportunity to record my conviction that a general banking bill ?s required to deal with that class of bank which extends its operations beyond the limits of a state. Since such a bill is not before us, if my suggestion were applied to the Commonwealth Bank only, it would impose a handicap on an institution which stands least in need of a safeguard which should be, in my opinion, applied to all banks operating in Australia. The other point to which I wish to direct attention is that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who referred lengthily and very interestingly to what he called a novel departure in arming the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank with power to issue notes in Australia to banks which may have their balances in London.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> mentioned the danger of departing from the established practice, and paid that- it was not wise to issue notes against other than a gold security. Up to a certain point 1 am in agreement with the honorable senator. At the same time I have to ask myself if the time will ever come when there may be a necessity to depart from this principle, and when the departure may be made without any danger arising. Whilst I am supporting this bill embodying the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> considers so objectionable, I am doing so in the firm belief that the powers which are to be given to the board will not be abused. I believe that the old and established principle of acknowledging and, accepting gold as the only safe basis must in the main be observed. Gold, as every one who has studied the subject knows, is a convenient substance and one which will always be accepted by the nations of the world at its face value in liquidating debts. It possesses a rare measure of exchangability,  and having that unique quality it is superior to any other substance in existence to-day. Generally speaking, paper currency is not accepted beyond the boundaries of the countries in which it is issued, although Bank of England notes were accepted by the German Government in 1870, in payment of the huge indemnity which that country demanded of France. We have, however, not many Banks of England in the world. The ordinary paper in circulation is not of great value beyond the borders of the country of its origin. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> very laudably objects to currency being placed upon other than a secure foundation, instances can be quoted in which departures have been made, and where no evil results have followed. A case I have in mind is in connexion with the issue of notes under the Canadian Banking Act. The Canadian Bank is conducting business on sound and safe lines, and it has the power to issue notes on a different basis from that proposed in this bill. It issues notes upon gold deposited in the treasury, notes issued by the Canadian Government, and upon the unimpaired sharpe capital of the company. In addition the Government do not call upon the .bank to put up any security for an excess issue, but allows it to do it under statutory authority. Assistance is given in this direction only in particular instances, such as in connexion with the shipping of the wheat crop, which is a loading feature in the industrial life of that dominion. The bank is allowed to issue ten per cent, above the stipulated amount, and an additional deposit of gold or an increase in the unimpaired share capital is not required. The Bank of British North America is also allowed to issue notes on dominion securities in excess of the stipulated amount up to 25 per cent, of its unimpaired capital. It will therefore be seen that there has been a departure from the established principle to enable the Canadian Bank to facilitate the commercial transactions of the country without injury to the public credit or the possibility of a financial catastrophe such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> contemplates. The securities held in London represent the accumulated balance which has been built up in various ways. These balances are locked up, so to speak, owing to the exchange rates being against Australia, which makes it difficult to transfer the funds to Australia. The securities which the amending provision of the bill is to cover are of such an unquestionable character that I am justified in saying that they are quite as good as gold. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Short-dated bills are first-grade securities, and are just as good as gold deposited either in London or in Australia. As this surplus cannot be used to facilitate business in this country, it must be regarded as a dead asset. Every one knows that it is most difficult to obtain credit from the banks even on the most reliable security, and I therefore trust that the board will utilize the power which this Parliament has given it in a plenary fashion, and see that the currency of this country is not unduly inflated. I am satisfied that as the Government will charge the board with the responsibility of seeing that the currency is not inflated it matters very little after all whether the currency is on the basis of gold held here or whether it is on its equivalent held in London. I trust that the bill will be the means of placing the Commonwealth Bank in a better position than it has hitherto occupied, and that it will be of greater service to the Commonwealth than with its lesser powers it has been in the past. </para>

                        <para>. - The three* principal amendments which have been made in the Commonwealth Bank Act will not, in my opinion, tend to improve the position of the bank. Originally the bank was conducted by a Governor, but it has now been decided that its operations shall be controlled by a Governor, Deputy Governor, and six directors, with a number of subsidiary state directors. Although some are of the opinion that considerable improvements could be effected in the control of the bank, I am not at all hopeful that the alterations made will prove beneficial. The Government have also decided to place the note issue department under the control of the Commonwealth Bank, and to issue notes against securities held in London. The time is long overdue for the enactment of some of the powers conferred upon the Commonwealth by the Constitution, included in which is the power to pass a general banking bill. The Government, no doubt, have been too busy attending to. their own domestic affairs to give attention to this matter. I have no particular objection to placing the note issue department under the control of the Commonwealth </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Bank, but I strongly object to the manner in which it has been decided to dispose of the profits derived by the bank&#39; from its ordinary business, and also from its control of the note issue. The Commonwealth Bank ought to be able to stand upon its own resources, and should be empowered to use the whole of its profits in extending its operations. The Government is silent on that point. Apparently, it does not care whether the bank extends its business or not. Clauses appear to have been inserted in the bill with the definite object of preventing the extension of the bank&#39;s operations. Take, for instance, the decision not to interfere with the disposition of the profits from the Notes Issue Department. Surely that department is part and parcel of the business of the bank, and, as such, its profits should be used by the bank for the purpose of extending its operations. Since the establishment of the notes issue branch, profits totalling &#163;9,600,000 have been made. The whole of those profits should be used to extend the operations of the bank, chiefly in the. direction of establishing branches throughout the Commonwealth, and, as far as possible, elsewhere;&#39; but that, apparently, is not the Government&#39;s intention. On the contrary, its desire appears to be to cripple the bank by utilizing the profits in other directions. The Government has also decided that the profits made by the bank itself shall be disposed of in such a manner as to rob the bank of its legitimate property. &#34;Dp to the end of December, 1923, the total profits made by the bank were &#163;4,570,000. This bill proposes that a little less than half of those profits, namely, &#163;2,000,000, shall be transferred from the redemption fund to the bank reserve fund, making the latter fund about &#163;4,000,000, which is to be used for any purpose in connexion with its banking business. That is a step in the right direction. In addition, the bill provides that in future one-half of the neb profits from the banking business shall be applied to the liquidation of the national debt. A more ridiculous proposal it would be almost impossible to imagine. Why should the profits of the Commonwealth Bank be used to reduce the national debt? Surely there are many other ways by which the national debt :may be liquidated. I do not agree that the tightness of the money market is due to the  causes mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene.</inline> That tightness and the existing unemployment in the Commonwealth are due to other causes, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> together with a limited number of other senators, do not care to discuss in. this chamber. Both are due to the fact that the best of our land is monopolized by people who do not put it to its best use. I tried, unsuccessfully, to secure an amendment that the bank should not be permitted to hold land indefinitely, but I realized that it would be unfair to handicap the Commonwealth Bank in that manner, and that a proposal of that nature must wait until such time as a general banking bill is introduced. That, I hope, the Government will do at an early date. I am unable to understand why the Government should in this bill seek power to issue notes against credits held in London by privately-conducted Australian banks. According to the latest figures furnished to us in the budget, there is at the present time, &#163;56,890,225 represented by the notes in circulation. Of that amount &#163;34,518,426 is held by the banks, and &#163;22,371,799 by the public. I should like the Minister to say why he desires to secure the power to issue more notes, when the banks now hold notes representing over &#163;34,000,000. The Minister has given no reasonable answer to that question, which I raised at an earlier stage. The proposal to issue notes against credits held in London is an entirely new departure, and no one has yet given us any indication of the way in which the proposal will work out. In my opinion, its effect will be to increase the credits held by the private banks in London, and to make the position considerably worse than it is now. I hope that in this I am mistaken, and that the result of the&#39; Government&#39;s action will be to make money cheaper. I point out that if the currency is increased by machinery being put into operation to print millions of new notes - from some statements made in this &#39; chamber I presume that that will be so - the excess credits in London totalling &#163;35,000,000 will be increased. If the Government issues a large number of new notes, it will, in my opinion, increase the cost of living considerably, and at the same time it will give no compensating advantage to that great army of men and women who are on fixed salaries. The bill is not one which should receive the endorsement of this Parliament, and I shall vote against the third reading. </para>

It is, therefore, unnecessary for me to repeat them. This bill is to appropriate the money for the purpose of carrying out the works and buildings programme for the year. Any delay in the passing of the bill will mean that we shall not be able, during the course of the year, to expend the whole of the money which is voted. As the passing of this measure will enable these works to be proceeded with at once, I urge the Senate, subject, of course, to any legitimate criticism, to agree to it without delay. I draw attention to the main items, so that honorable senators may devote themselves to them, and thus be prepared to deal with  the bill when it reaches the committee stage.

                            <para>- This bill deals only with new works. It may save discussion if I give particulars regarding the expenditure for oil and fuel storage. The Oil Agreement Act 1920 provided for the establishment by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company of the industry of refining mineral oil, and for the erection of an oil refinery in Australia. The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited was to be formed with a capital of &#163;500,001, of which the Commonwealth was to contribute &#163;250,001. The Commonwealth subscription was fully paid before 30th June, 1924, the Commonwealth thus acquiring a controlling interest in the refinery company. The object of the company is to import crude oil until local supplies are available, refine it in Australia, and put the products - such as motor spirit, kerosene, and fuel oil- on the Australian market. When local supplies of crude oil become available) they are to be utilized, instead of supplies being imported. The erection of the refinery at Newport, and the provision of the necessary tanks and wharfage,, have been practically completed, and the refining of oil has been commenced. It was found, however, that further capital was required to enable the company to attain the full objects for which it was formed. The Oil Agreement Act of 1924 provided for the capital of the company being increased by &#163;250,000, representing 250,000 shares at &#163;1. each. The Commonwealth&#39;s share of this increase is &#163;125,000, of which &#163;31,250 was advanced during last financial year; the balance of &#163;93,750 is being provided on this year&#39;s Estimates. I suggest that, as the items in the schedule to the bill are mainly a matter for consideration in committee, the Senate pass the second reading without delay. Any information desired by honorable senators will be furnished in committee, as far as Ministers are able to do so. </para>

                    <para>. - The problem of defence has for a long time been calling for something like reasonable consideration. The trouble is that Australia has no fixed defence policy. Some Minister in charge of the Defence Department occasionally develops a spasmodic desire to spend a million of money and the sum is forthwith voted, but effective defence is brought no nearer than before. Only six years have elapsed since the armistice was signed, and we have spent since the war,, in round figures, &#163;4,000,000 per annum on the so-called defence of Australia. But with what result? If we are to believe those men who by reason of their positions and qualifications are entitled to advise us, no result of any value has been achieved. I intend to approach the consideration of the bill, not in a party  spirit, but &#39;with a desire to advance the interests of the country. Before Parliament commits itself to any expenditure upon a navy it ought to consider whether we have any effective defence at the present time. In conversation with the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> the other day I somewhat jokingly remarked that I would support the defence proposals of the Government if it intended to spend &#163;100,000,000 for the protection of Australia. To my mind, any comparatively small naval expenditure would be equivalent to throwing money into the ocean. The expenditure should be sufficient to give Australia real defence ; it is no use wasting a million here, and scrapping a battleship there. Before any expenditure is decided upon there should be a conference of men whose service and capacity would enable them to arrive at a sound conclusion on some of the most important aspects of the defence problem. In the first place, we should decide how much money Australia is prepared to expend in this direction. It is useless to propound a scheme and then be met with the question: &#34;But from where is the money to come?&#34; I do not bind my colleagues to the views I am about to express, for I venture to say that the Labour party&#39;s defence proposals are very much the same as those of the Country party, or the National party - they are in the minds of the individuals, and are not outlined in the party platform. I think I can safely say that expenditure upon anything like an adequate defence of Australia will never be shirked by the Labour party. What we do object to, and what is most repugnant to me, is the expenditure- of money on defence without, any practical result. It would be- better to have no navy and no Defence Department than to carry on, at a cost of &#163;4,000,000 per annum, a department which is supposed to prepare this country for defence, but which in reality makes no provision whatever for it. I am inclined to look upon General Monash as a soldier whom Australia takes seriously. Here are some of the observations he is reported in the press to have made in regard to Australia&#39;s lack of defence - </para>

                <para>Those are important extracts from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> speech. Though I have lifted them from their context, I have not in any way misrepresented the honorable senator. Are we to continue this system of spending millions of pounds on defence for such a result, or axe we going to Lave a well considered defence scheme, not for this and the next financial year, but one that will continue irrespective of the Government in office until at the end of, say, 20 years, we shall have something that looks like a defence system, and which might be of some use to us if we were attacked? At present, notwithstanding the expenditure of many millions of pounds, we are in a helpless position. We are not prepared for anything like a serious emergency. Another attempt is now being made to improve the position. We have here a proposal to spend &#163;4,500,000 on two cruisers, to be built in England. I expect some honorable senator will say that one only will be built in England and the other in Australia. But we shall have to wait till certain people decide whether Australia is able to build cruisers, before we determine whether both shall be built in England or whether one shall be built there, and one in Australia. On the relative merits of freetrade and protection honorable senators generally know my views. On this question of naval defence, I say that if the cruisers could be built in Great Britain for &#163;2,000,000, and if built in Australia they cost &#163;10,000,000, I would prefer paying the &#163;10,000,000. I make that statement definitely in order that I may not be . misunderstood, for  I realize that the defence of Australia must ultimately fall upon Australians. If, then, we are to start with a serious defence scheme, and if we are to spend &#163;4,500,000 on cruisers, what better proposal could we have than to start building the cruisers here now, even if they cost &#163;10,000,000 ? We may be quite sure that, as the result of experience gained, the second cruiser will cost less than the first, and as we continue the work, gaining experience and knowledge in the business, we shall be able eventually to build Australian cruisers in Australia as cheaply as they could be built in any other country. This question is a very serious one. I hold the view that the expenditure of money outside Australia for the defence of Australia, is worse than useless. I have heard it said that we want these cruisers for the protection of our trade routes. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> will agree with that statement. </para>

                        <para>- Do honorable &#39; senators really believe that the trade routes of Australia could be protected by two cruisers of the type which the Government has in mind <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Let us examine the position and make a few comparisons. Australia has a  coast-line  of approximately 8,850 miles; England, Scotland, and Wales, a coast-line of approximately 4,600 miles; France, a coast-line approximately of 1,084 miles; and the United States of America a coast-line of between 4,000 and 4,500 miles. &#34; What kind of a navy is required for the protection of the coast-line and trade routes of those countries ?&#39; I do not intend to go very closely into the details&#39; of the naval vessels required for the protection of Britain&#39;s coast-line, but I should like to say that, unfortunately for Australia, our statesmen incline to the view that the methods employed for the protection of Britain&#39;s coast-wise trade should also be adopted for the protection of Aus- &#39; tralia&#39;s coast- line and trade. But there is this important difference between the two countries: Britain is a manufacturing nation. Practically the whole of her raw materials -and nearly the whole of the foodstuffs required for the sustenance of her people come from across the seas. The experience of the war showed that if her supplies were cut off for any length of time Britain would fall. She depends upon an uninterrupted flow of raw materials and foodstuffs for the maintenance of her position as a manufacturing nation and the feeding of her people. Australia is in an entirely different position. Our exportable commodities are chiefly primary products. We require no fleet for the protection of our food supplies. Having, unfortunately, only a few people in this country and an abundance of foodstuffs, our position is secure. I suppose that if an enemy had command of our trade routes Australia  would  be the ideal home of the protectionist. We should then have abundance of goods for Australian people. We should be a self-contained nation, for we could manufacture everything that we required. That,, surely, is the protectionist&#39;s ideal! </para>

                        <para>- If Australia were attacked, and if an enemy fleet had command of the seas but could not land a sufficient force to subdue the country, we should still have sufficient food and clothing for our people. We could get along all right, although there might be difficulty. If, on the other hand, Britain were attacked, and if an enemy fleet had command of the seas - if her sea communications were cut - the Mother Country could not hold out for any length of time. Therefore, Britain&#39;s coast-line and trade routes must be effectively protected. Let us see what it costs Britain to do this. This is important to Australia, because, since the war we have been spending considerable sums of money every year, and, according to the authorities I have been quoting this afternoon, we are in a worse position than ever. On page 89 of the London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail Year-Book,</inline> 1924,j there is some interesting information by a well-known naval authority, H. W. Wilson. </para>

All that the honorable senator said on this- subject clearly indicated that he and his friends are incapable of appreciating Labour&#39;s viewpoint of responsibility and office.

                        <para>- I thought so, too, at first, but later I realized that the Minister&#39;s remark suggested inability on his part to appreciate the character of a Labour Prime Minister. He and those who think with him appear to be under the impression that a Labour Government and the Labour party in Great Britain would not conform to the conventions and ideals of the rest of the community. There are many people who think that. There- are some who believed that the Labour Government in Britain would reverse the defence policy of the Mother Country, and would cease to build warships. We want to realize that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, for the present, at all events, is in charge of the House of Commons with all the responsibility of maintaining the prestige of Britain; and I am satisfied that, whatever obligation the position involves, he and hie party will not shirk it.

                        <para>- Of course, there are many trade routes, and we learned during the war that this immense armament, even with the support of the navies of Japan, Italy, and France, and eventually the American Navy could not protect Britain&#39;s shores from bombardment. The trade routes were never safe, because a new force in naval warfare had almost reached perfection. Had the use of submarines been understood in the first months of the wax as well as it was understood in the concluding months, it is very hard to say what would have been the outcome of the struggle. It waa not until 1917 that the Germans began to make effective use of submarines in the destruction of vessels carrying food to Great Britain. Had they done so in 1914, the result of the war might have been different. One can imagine almost anything happening in a conflict, conducted as it will be tomorrow if hostilities are declared between two first-class powers. The effective battleships and armoured cruisers of Great Britain are as follow: - </para>

I am unable, to follow their reasoning, but when the Washington conference decided that certain vessels were to be scrapped, the best naval authorities of Britain evidently decided that Australia required no battleship, because our only battleship had to be scrapped.

                        <para>- Tes, with the absurd military training that produces the results to which I have alluded. The policy of the Labour party can be well summed up in one sentence: &#34; We are prepared to scrap the whole of the existing system of defence, which is only a pretence.&#34; It is something that - we pay for but which gives us nothing, and it must go. What we want in Australia is a defence system that each year will leave us in a better position to defend ourselves than we were in the previous year. I would scrap the whole system of compulsory training, because I can quote the opinions of military officers who realize that compulsory training has -broken down of its own weight. That is to say, we have spread our efforts over the whole continent in an attempt to train every one, with the result that more men do not attend drills than those who do attend them. We want to scrap compulsory training, because the men in charge of it have made it the miserable failure that it is to-day. </para>

                        <para>- The millions we are now spending on a defence system that, on the authority of the best men we can quote, give us nothing, should be spent on establishing factories to give us arms and equipment, engines for flying machines, submarines, quick-firing guns, and vehicles necessary for the rapid transport of troops, and on the provision of roads to enable that transport to be carried out rapidly. Such a policy would carry us a long way further than the spending of &#163;4,000,000 a year on a system of defence, only to be told by the people who are spending the money that we have nothing to show for it. Before I was led away to the discussion of land defence questions, which are quite in keeping with the bill, I was giving the Senate some idea of the magnitude of the British Navy and its importance to the Empire - or, to use a term which I prefer, the Commonwealth of Nations. Britain has to maintain this navy because of her peculiar position. She is dependent upon outside sources for the employment, the clothing and feeding of her own people. We sometimes meet persons with a shallow view, who ask, &#34; Do you think that we in this Commonwealth of Nations should ask Britain to maintain this navy while we escape any portion of its cost? &#34; If Britain is spending &#163;58,000,000 on a navy, and we are spending nothing, it does not mean that we are not doing our share of the work of Empire development. We have very few people in Australia. We and our fathers before us have made this outpost of the Empire habitable for 6,000,000 people. Some of those who are listening to me&#39; to-day will live to see 16,000,000 people in Australia, and in turn their children will live here in a British community of perhaps 60,000,000 people. But the whole cost of the development of this outpost of the Empire has fallen upon the pioneers of Australia. Whatever assistance Britain has rendered in the shape of loans has. been, not more than she has always been ready to render to any other country. Will any one affirm that the building of thousands of miles of railway is not playing just as effective a part in the defence of the Empire as the building of a battleship to cruise in the North Sea? Those who say that the making of roads and the clearing of land to make this continent habitable, or that making two blades of grass grow where only one grew before is not taking a part in the task of holding together the British Commonwealth of Nations, are not viewing the matter, as I do, through Australian eyes. Our expenditure on defence per head of the male population considerably exceeds that of any other portion of the Empire, so that we are not under a compliment to any one.

Therefore, as we cannot nearly approach that - it is a moderate estimate for the naval defence of Australia - we certainly should not waste &#163;4,000,000 in building two cruisers. I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> cannot appreciate that aspect of the question. </para>

                        <para>- I shall now give the Senate some idea of the magnitude of the American navy, which has to protect a coast-line 4,000 miles less than our own. Are more vessels required to protect America than .to protect Australia? With a more extensive coast-line, more vessels are needed for our protection. According to the publication from which I am quoting, the cost of each of the first-class battle-ships required by America is about &#163;8,000,000. America has the following battle-ships : - </para>

I do not think I need quote further from the -figures relating to the American navy, except to say that their submarines and cruisers are in proportion to the number -of battle-ships. The American fleet is large in number, effective, and up to date, and my view of naval defence is that, unless our naval strength is equal to a first-class naval power, we should not waste a few million pounds in the direction proposed. If we had millions to spare, I could quite understand some one suggesting the construction of two cruisers to protect our trade routes. </para>

I can also understand that there are more important things to be done than to assist Britain in the matter of naval construction.

                    - I gave Great Britain&#39;s figures as 100,000, and I have no doubt that the American figures, which I cannot locate at the moment, are also given in the publication from which I am quoting. I also note, according to this . authority, that the battleship is still the backbone of the fleet and the bulwark of the nation in sea defence. That statement is worth giving, because if we are to undertake naval construction it should be in the direction of building battleships. In my opinion, however, the real defence of Australia can best be assured by submarines and aircraft. Japan has also an efficient navy. I am not one of those who fear attack by Japan, although we have great statesmen, such as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline>
                    who put forward the proposition that every nation must be regarded as a potential enemy. Japan had the opportunity during the late war to attack us, if she so desired. I do not think such a favorable chance will occur again. At that time we had stripped Australia of its manhood, its arms and equipment, and our ships had been sent to the North Sea. Notwithstanding that, our honorable little ally never broke her pledge. Had Japan looked with jealous eyes upon Australia it is only reasonable to assume that at a critical stage of the war - in January, February, and March, 1918 - when it was very doubtful what the issue was to be, we would have been attacked. Loyal to her old alliance with Great Britain, Japan honored her obligations. Having lost that opportunity, is it likely that Japan would risk an attack upon Australia at a time when there is likely to be a force sufficiently strong to make an effective landing impossible ? Any one who has read of the Gallipoli campaign knows that within a few hours&#39; steam of a base, and with the British Navy, including the biggest battleship then afloat, the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Queen Elizabeth</inline>
                    behind them, 120,000 Australian, British, and French soldiers, had the greatest difficulty, in effecting a landing. It is true that they occupied a small strip of territory, and held on for eight months, but they did not do anything effective. The Turks on that occasion did not have a force anything approaching that which Australia could put up against an invading army. The following facts in regard to the Japanese Navy are of interest: -
                </para>
                <para>There are 28 light cruisers in the Japanese Navy built, building, or projected, of 30 knots or upwards. The Japanese destroyer forcer is extremely efficient and admirably trained, and consists of 113 modern destroyers, with 60 older and smaller boats. </para>
                <para class="block">If such- a force were to attack us, what would be the use of two cruisers? They would naturally take refuge in some protected harbour from a force which would outnumber them a hundredfold, and the guns of which would outrange their own. To spend &#163;4,500,000 on building cruisers for our defence is equivalent to throwing the money into the sea, because their construction will not be completed for two years, and they will have to be scrapped in ten years. At that mighty review of Britain&#39;s naval strength at Spithead a week or so ago, of the 192 ships that took part, only one was of a pre-war type.. It will therefore be seen that these vessels will no sooner be completed than they will become obsolete - perhaps before they are off the stocks. Can we reasonably undertake the construction of vessels which are likely to be of so little value to us? I do not think we can, and we should not waste one shilling on such expenditure. Let us imagine there waa in the vicinity of this building, one of the gun men who have been making Melbourne notorious during the last few weeks, and that he had in his possession an automatic pistol,, capable of firing eight or nine shots in rapid succession. We could say to one of our members, &#34;Here is a pea-rifle; go and attack him.&#34; The person so directed, would doubtless be brave enough, but he would question the wisdom of the action. To construct two cruisers to oppose battleships is similar to sending a man with a pea-rifle to attack a man in possession of an automatic revolver. </para>

                        <para>- The battleship <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> was considered useless when she was sunk in order to honour an agrees ment. Why was not a British battleship sunk ? We had in power a Government so patriotic and so determined to honorably carry out its contract with other nations, that it was responsible for the sinking of not only the <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> but also a number of new guns which had never been unpacked. These guns were placed on board the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> and sunk with her. No one has a greater admiration for those who honour agreements and more contempt for stupid conduct than I have, but guns that had never been used were placed upon that battleship and went down with her. A government that had any fear of Australia being attacked, or possessed any common sense, would not have permitted that to be done. The British naval authorities had no fear of Australia being invaded, or they would not have left us with only two cruisers, while they have 100 cruisers and other modern battleships. The Honorary Minister gave us .a little glimpse of the Government&#39;s policy in regard to aircraft.  We  are &#39;informed that submarines operate effectively for 200 miles from the coast, and I suppose we can safely say that aeroplanes are capable of doing the same. My idea of effective naval defence for the Commonwealth would be to enlarge Cockatoo Island Dockyard &#39;and extend the factories in which engines for submarines and aeroplanes are manufactured so that we should be well equipped in the event of war. I believe that &#163;2,000,000 would be sufficient to construct three well-equipped submarines, and that the expenditure proposed would be sufficient to build seven or eight. Will any one say that submarines and aeroplanes would not be able to more effectively defend Australia than fast cruisers? Battleships would hesitate before attacking vessels transporting troops or goods, if they knew that submarines were operating against them. </para>

                        <para>- The distance between England and France is not great, and that stretch of water was well protected. We all know that narrow passages only were provided for vessels to travel from one country to the other. Lord Fisher said that the North Sea was sown with mines; but when a vessel went down he said that it was due to a German mine. Britain protected her own Grand fleet from submarines by stationing them in a secure place, waiting for the day when the German fleet would come out. But it is ridiculous for us in Australia, with no fleet to protect anything - the big vessels of the British fleet being thousands of miles away - to think that by spending &#163;4,500,000 on the construction of two cruisers we shall be doing something for naval defence. I shall vote for no. expenditure on defence until the Government places before us a programme extending over a period of years. If a workable scheme is presented, all parties are patriotic enough to assist in carrying it out. What is the use of introducing a scheme which is only a waste of the people&#39;s money ? While our defence farces are handicapped for want of equipment, millions of pounds are to be wasted.

                    <para>A question which has been prominent for the past four years, but with which little progress has been made owing to financial stringency, is the establishment of ordnance workshops, which must exist for the efficient upkeep of military equipment.

                        <para>- I think that the Australians are a warlike people. The best fighter is the pacifist, because patience abused turns to fury. A good fighter who will adopt every means to avoid a fight will not readily leave off fighting once he starts; he stays there till the fight is over. If the honorable senator had had as much experience of pacifists as I have had in connexion with political organizations, he would not underestimate their ability to fight. The Labour, party believes that friendly relations between nations can be maintained by fair trading and honest dealing. Some one may ask, &#34; Are you prepared to throw away your arms and other means of defence, and trust to that good, feeling being maintained?&#34; Should Australia be attacked by another nation, I feel that I could riot conscientiously ask our people to fight unless they were provided with the means of defending themselves. Rather than be in the position that we could fight only for a given time, I would provide equipment so that, if war came, we could say, &#34; There is a machine gun for every four men fit to use it, and an ample supply of munitions. There is also a rifle for every man able to use one, and plenty of ammunition.&#34; If Australia did that, and had her coast defended by airships and submarines, the British Navy itself could not win a footing here. If the money which we&#39; are wasting on what we call &#34; defence &#34; were spent in the development of the country, we could double our population in a very short time. That would provide greater security for Australia than all the cruisers we could build. &#34;When two distinguished statesmen - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> - went to Britain and gave an order for one, and perhaps two. battle cruisers - I do not mean necessarily that they signed a contract, but they evidently let it be known that when they returned to Australia&#39; an order would be placed in Britain for the building of two cruisers- </para>

                        <para>- That makes the party a difficult one with which to deal. In another place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bayley</inline> said that one of the cruisers was already being constructed in England, and the Minister there did not deny his statement. &#39; I object to the building of the cruisers, because I consider that our defence system should take into account what money it is proposed to expend for .the next twenty years, and to what particular purpose it is to be devoted. Nothing short of that will appeal to me. My idea is that we should establish the factories necessary for the manufacture of all that we require for the defence of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That matter could be considered a long while after the material to fight with had been supplied. It might be desirable to train a staff as the nucleus of a defence force, but it seems to be forgotten that we have in Australia to-day thousands of officers who are better trained for war than any we have ever had. Those men have been thrown aside as if they were of no value, whereas, under an intelligent system, their services could have been utilized. If voluntary schools had been established, they might have been called together for the discussion of military subjects, and their services would have been available to the country without any expense being involved. </para>

                        <para>- It could easily be made a success. The first thing necessary is to provide for the manufacture within Australia of the means for defending ourselves. The training of the men to use the equipment can proceed while we are waiting for the attack. If we are to build naval vessels, instead of spending this &#163;4,000,000 on the construction of a couple of cruisers, let us build seven or eight submarines. Personally, I prefer to rely on the flying machine, for I think its possibilities are not yet realized. </para>

                        <para>- That would not matter if we had factories manufacturing interchangeable parts in order to maintain supplies of up-to-date aircraft. With five or six factories centrally situated so that they could be economically operated, it would not matter how soon the equipment became obsolete, for the factories would be constantly producing war-like material of the most modern type. In a country like Australia we could have thousands of men trained in this class of work. They could be fitting themselves for such service, and at the same time could be engaged in turning out commercial articles. I do not contend that such factories should &#39;necessarily return interest on the money invested, but they would certainly serve an admirable purpose. Rather than spend money on building cruisers, attention must be devoted to submarines and aircraft, but I place first and foremost the establishment of factories in all parts of Australia to manufacture the material required for defence. The possibilities of my suggestion are unlimited. I appeal to the Minister, even at this, the eleventh hour, to advocate, not the spasmodic expenditure of a few millions, but a system based upon Australia&#39;s capacity to pay. Our expenditure arising out of the late war amounts to about &#163;30,000,000 per annum, including pensions, reparations, maintenance of the injured, &#38;c. That indicates to some extent the financial possibilities of a nation of less than 6,000,000 people. I contend, therefore, that the Government will do well to scrap its pretence at dealing with the defence problem - because what we have is a pretence rather than a defence system - and start anew by adopting an adequate system to which all parties can agree, and which will have continuity, irrespective of changes of government. I have quoted several authorities to show that Australia has no defence system at the present time. The Government would be well advised to withdraw the bill, and. prepare a wellconsidered scheme. Australia will never have adequate defence so long as we continue to spend a million here and a million there in this spasmodic fashion. </para>

                        <para>That a select committee, consisting of Senators Kingsmill, Cox, Elliott, Foster, Duncan, Grant, and the mover, be appointed to inquire into the allowances being paid to warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, and other officers retiring from the Defence Department, with full power to send for persons, papers, and records, and to move from place to place. </para>

                    <para>The inquiry should be a simple one - an inquiry into the subject of superannuation benefits or retiring allowances paid to warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Defence Department, who have been retired. I shall refer very briefly to two officers, and since they have discussed the matter with me I shall take the liberty of mentioning their names. One is Warrant Officer Ingall, a retired officer with a record for splendid service in several states, notably in New South Wales and Tasmania. Probably he is one of the ablest warrant officers that we have ever had in New South Wales. For 36 years he rendered excellent service to that state and later to the Commonwealth. He was retired in 1922 without a pension or superannuation benefits. The other case is that of Warrant Officer Gale.  His  term of service was not quite so long as that of Warrant Officer Ingall, but the circumstances of his retirement are so peculiar that I feel confident the Senate will agree to the motion for the appointment of a select committee to make the necessary inquiries. The composition of the suggested committee is such that it will be representative of both sides of the Senate. I do not want, and will never ask for, the appointment of a committee so constituted that it will be likely to return a finding in accordance with my own views. I want the committee to be absolutely unbiased so that it may deal with the cases that come before it on their merits. </para>

                </para>
                <para>I was discharged on the 14th February, 1923, having reached the age for retirement, viz., 60 years, according with the D.A. after 23 years service in the Permanent Forces and 10 years in the Militia Forces of N.S.W. </para>
                <para>Previous to my discharge the amount of &#163;5 13s. 5d. had been stopped from my salary for contributions to the Superannuation Fund. On making application &#39;for superannuation after discharge I was informed by the Finance Officer -of this State on 7th September, 1923, that it would be necessary to complete 26 fortnightly payments, and to forward the sum of &#163;30 16s. 9d., which was done, making a total of &#163;36 10s. 2d. paid into the fund. </para>
                <para>After a time, 4th October, 1923, I was informed that I would receive a pension of &#163;14 18s. 9d. per year, or a weekly pension of 5s. 8Jd. The thing seemed so absurd to me that I wrote to the  president  of the board asking if some mistake had not been -made, but he assured me that no mistake had been . made, and after much correspondence I had to seek other means of trying to get some sort of justice. </para>
                <para>I find on investigation that W.O. W. Smith and W.O. T.  Chedgy,  both members of the Permanent Military Forces, who had been discharged months before the Superannuation Act came into force, are receiving a pension of &#163;70 per annum, and they never contributed one iota to the fund. In reply to a letter for a  consideration  of my case, the Secretary of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> Trumble, stated that with a view of remedying such anomalies representations for the amendment of the act had been made to the Treasurer. Up to the present I have heard nothing about it.  His  letter was dated 13th Mardi, 1924. </para>

                    <para>Dear Sir,</para>
                <para>With reference to your application for a pension under the- Superannuation Act, I have to inform you that the board advises that the amount necessary to complete 26 fortnightly payments in your case is &#163;30 16s. 9d. I shall be glad if you will forward the amount to this office as early as possible. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I direct attention to that letter. Warrant officer Gale had been contributing for five units of pension, which would have entitled him, upon retirement at the age of 65 years, to a pension of &#163;130 per year, and yet he was called upon to pay &#163;30 16s. 9d.&#39; in a lump sum. Then upon his retirement he got a pension of only &#163;14 10s. 9d. a year, which works out at 5s. 8&#163;d, per week. My first action when this case came under my notice was to arrange an interview between Warrant officer Gale and the Minister for Defence. The warrant-officer stated his case, and was advised by the Minister that, as there were other anomalies of a similar nature, the Government intended to introduce a bill to remedy them. I waited, and when Parliament met I asked certain questions. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> will remember that, last week, I asked whether the bill was to be introduced.  His  answer was vague and most unsatisfactory. He told me that the Defence Department was pressing to have this matter settled, but could not get it completed. In the circumstances, I think that an inquiry by a select committee, as proposed, will do a great deal of good, and result in the remedying of many grave injustices. If, as has been stated, a certain department is preventing the necessary legislation from being introduced, the proposed inquiry will probably expedite a settlement of the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has just told us that the Superannuation Board is drafting a scheme. Speaking from memory, I think that, very shortly after Parliament adjourned last year, I brought this matter under the notice of the Minister, for Defence, and, as I have already stated, I waited until Parliament met before taking any other action, as I was given to understand that amending legislation would be introduced. Admitting that the Superannuation Board is drafting the necessary amending legislation, these men cannot wait indefinitely for consideration. Therefore, I ask the Senate to agree - to the motion for the appointment of the select committee, because, whilst I have mentioned only two cases in which it is apparent grave injustice has been done, I know there are others. Warrant-officer Gale&#39;s record is an excellent one. Upon his retirement he was given the honorary rank of lieutenant in recognition of his meritorious services, and as evidence that the department was highly satisfied with his work. Although he was over the age limit, he volunteered times out of number for active service, but, as he was a very useful man for the training of men who had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, he was kept in Australia. It is extraordinary that, after 23 years of service, and after he had paid over &#163;5 for superannuation benefits, he should have been called upon to pay &#163;30 16s. 9d. in a lump sum, and then receive a pension of only 5s. 8Jd. per week. If the Minister will give me a definite promise that the necessary legislation will be introduced this session - I am sure that, if introduced, it will be passed - I shall not press for the appointment of the select committee. But when we get nothing but vague answers it is time that the Senate took up the matter and had a full inquiry into it. </para>

                    <para>Realizing the limited time at the disposal of honorable senators, and the great amount of business to be transacted, I bring this matter before the Senate with some degree of reluctance, but so far as I can see, there is no other means of securing redress for this returned officer, who has been unsuccessful in obtaining from the Repatriation Department that to which he believes he is entitled. He was wounded at Gallipoli and returned to Australia. When in Australia on home service he was repeatedly operated on in various hospitals, and the real point at issue is whether or not the septic condition if his body is the result of wounds he received in the war. There is a conflict of evidence upon the point. I have here  a certificate from the medical superintendent of St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital, Darlinghurst. It is as follows : - 28th November, 1923. </para>
                    <para>This is to certify that W. W. Paine was admitted to St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital on 26th September, 1923, and discharged on 31st October, 1923. </para>
                    <para>During that time he was operated on for ischio-rectal abscess, but the relief afforded was only temporary and a further operation of a more radical nature will be necessary to ensure a cure. The condition has been present for some years, and it is more than probable that the sinus tracks up into the rectum, i.e., a fistula-in-ano. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know who the seven doctors are, but if a man who occupies the position in his profession that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hood</inline> does, has expressed an opinion of this sort, Lieutenant Paine should undoubtedly get the benefit of whatever doubt there may be. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hood&#39;s</inline> language conveys any meaning at all, it is that the abscess from which Lieutenant Paine suffered was due to the septic condition he was in as a result of his war service. I was of opinion that the production of this certificate would have some weight with the Repatriation Department, and I- presented it to the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page. On the 17th July last, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page sent me the following reply: - </para>

I do not suggest that the Minister did not give very careful attention to the matter, but, with all due respect to him, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hood,</inline> who saw Lieutenant Paine frequently from 1915 to 1918, was in a better position to express a reliable opinion upon the case than one who had merely undertaken the task of examining the departmental files. </para>

                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. -</inline> I am in receipt of your letters of the 31st July and 4th August instant, and wish to thank you for the efforts you are making on my behalf. </para>
                <para> In the letter from the Minister for Repatriation to yourself (copy numbered 14605) it is stated <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> tha&#163;- &#34; The  ischio  rectal abscess did not appear until 11th September, 1917, long after his discharge. This complaint was considered by the surgeon who performed  the  operation on 2nd November, 1917, not to be the result of service, and by another examining doctor to be due to &#39; infection of recent origin &#39;. The departmental medical officer reported it had been established that there was no sequence of abscesses from the date of his discharge to October, 1917.&#34; </para>
                <para>The above statements are, to say the very least of it, very misleading - in fact, they are Untrue. </para>
                <para>The facts are, briefly, as follow: - </para>
                <para>I returned from active service in July, 1915, and was discharged , on the 4th August, 1916, as medically unfit on account of gunshot wounds in right arm and left leg., For the period, July, 1915, to August, 1916 (thirteen months), I was an. out-patient, receiving treatment, at the Randwick Military Hospital. The treatment I received was for the wound in my arm, which was septic. After a long series of vaccine treatments the wound in my arm closed (about December, 1916), or some seventeen months after my return to Australia, and four months after my discharge. I was discharged on 4th August, 1916, with a supporting septic arm. </para>
                <para>The sepsis evidently remained in my system, as a series of abscesses formed on various parts of my anatomy, principally on the right side of -my neck. These abscesses were treated at the Randwick Military Hospital. </para>
                <para>After another series of vaccine treatments, an  ischio  rectal abscess occurred, and early in 1917 (during the month of February, I believe), I reported this trouble to the medical officer at Liverpool camp (where I was then engaged on home service), and was sent to </para>
                <para>Randwick Military Hospital, where I was operated on by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Curtis</inline> Elliott (about February, 1917). See <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Curtis</inline> Elliott&#39;s letter in Repatriation Department&#39;s files. </para>
                <para>Therefore, you will see that the Minister for Repatriation&#39;s statement that, &#34; the ischio rectal abscess did not appear until 11th September, 1917,&#34; is untrue, and also that there is, to my mind, ample .proof that there was a &#34; sequence of abscesses from the date of my discharge to October, 1917. </para>
                <para>There is every reason- to believe from the foregoing that my medical records are very incomplete, and therefore it is extremely desirable, and, may I say, essential that a select committee be appointed to inquire into the whole of the circumstances and to peruse the whole of the evidence relative to my case, and should such committee be appointed, I shall welcome the opportunity of appearing before them in person to substantiate, by documentary evidence and otherwise, all statements made by me. </para>
                <para>You already have certificates from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jarvie</inline> Hood, and other eminent medical authorities, supporting the contention that the ischio rectal abscess is a direct or indirect result of my war service. </para>
                <para>I have  been  compelled to attend other  than  military hospitals for treatment of my complaint, owing to the Department of Repatriation refusing to treat me under their medical scheme. </para>
                <para>The final suggestion in the Minister for Repatriation&#39;s letter, that I should now go to civil hospitals for treatment is, in all the circumstances, resented. </para>
                <para>Should there be any further particulars that you require, I shall be pleased to give you same immediately. </para>

                            <para>- That is understood. It appears to me that this is the only means by which I can obtain justice for this man. I believe the people of Australia are strongly in favour of giving every consideration to the claims of incapacitated ex-soldiers, who should in all instances be given the benefit of any doubt which may exist. The committee I propose would consist of seven members, four of whom are returned soldiers ; and I am sure that if the case were fully investigated a recommendation would be made to the effect that Lieutenant Paine is entitled to further treatment, and also an increased pension. I trust the Government will at the earliest possible moment bring in a bill to enable the Repatriation Department to deal with cases of this character. It was an easy matter for those who returned from the front in good health to re-establish themselves in civil life, but men who came back incapacitated, or who are now feeling the effects of illness, consequent upon war wounds, find it extremely difficult to undertake work which will return them a living wage. As the Government are in possession of all the facts, I trust that an adjournment of the debate will not be sought, but that the motion will be agreed to without a division. </para>

                        <para>. - I second the motion. I support all <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has said concerning the disabilities experienced by men who are indisposed owing to illness consequent upon  war  service. A number of cases in Western Australia have been brought under my notice,, in which men who returned from the front have been unable to follow their ordinary avocations owing . to disabilities such as those -mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> One case in particular is that of a young man named Tucker, who served abroad for three years and ten months, received a good discharge, and on his return endeavoured to follow his ordinary work, but after a week found it impossible to do so. He was under the doctor&#39;s care for fifteen months, and during that time his wife and children were dependent upon charity. Twelve months after the termination of the war Tucker contracted an abscess on the liver, and after being operated upon he was in hospital for seven months with a tube in his side. Since that time he has not been able to do anything. The doctors who have watched the case are of the opinion that the abscess on the liver may have been contracted as the result of dysentery, from which he suffered while at the front. He has endeavoured to prove that his present condition is due to war service. The two doctors who had him under observation had also suffered from the same complaint when they were on active service. Their condition, however, was not sufficiently grave to be reported to the authorities. Scores of similar cases which I could enumerate all require investigation. Something should be done to enable these men to get that to which they are justly entitled. After doing their bit &#34;in the great war, they are thrown on the wings of the world, and their wives and families have to be kept by public subscription. Such a state of affairs is a disgrace to this country. I hope that the Senate will take notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> remarks, and act upon them. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with pleasure to the remarks of the Minister when introducing this bill, and was glad to learn that the Government was taking the question of defence very seriously. The Honorary Minister has told us that at the Imperial Conference the defence question was discussed by the delegates from the different portions of the Empire, and that they were all seised of the great importance of arriving at a satisfactory solution. I was also pleased with a considerable portion of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. With many of his statements I agreed, but not with other portions of his speech. The honorable senator told us that Australia had a certain coastline, which he compared with the mileage of the coastline of the United Kingdom and that of the United States of America. He indicated that the protection of the coastlines in those countries required a considerable amount of expenditure. I want to show that we, also, should spend considerable sums on the protection of our coastline. I was sorry that the Leader of the Opposition gave expression to some pessimistic views. He certainly made one or two flights of optimism, and indulged, occasionally, in a flash Of humour.  His  speech reminded me very much of a story that I once heard. In a village of Ireland, an amateur veterinary surgeon treated the donkey of the local squire, and when he sent in his bill it read - &#34; To curing your honour&#39;s donkey till it died, 10s.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would have us carry on only the internal work of Australia, and provide practically nothing for her actual defence until we were <inline font-style="italic">in extremis.</inline> During the last few years, much has happened to affect the world&#39;s naval and military position. First came the Washington Conference, and, as a result of that conference, the Washington Pact. Again, the American Parliament passed the Johnson-Reed bill, under clause 12b of which Asiatics are not permitted to enter American territory. We must therefore realize that a new phase of the situation has opened up. The result appears to be  that the &#34;Washington Pact goes by the board. That being so, it is time that the people of Australia took into consideration the very grave situation which. may arise, and which is generally referred to as the problem of the Pacific. What is the problem of the Pacific? It is the awakening of the teeming millions of people, who are inhabiting the upper regions bordering on the Pacific Ocean - their adoption of western methods, the improvement of their standard of living, with a consequently intensified struggle for existence, and a scramble for space on which to live. We have to take into account the position of Australia both nationally and geographically in relation to those regions. In 1914, the strategic naval centre was in the North Sea. With the defeat of Germany, the alteration of the boundaries of various countries in Europe, the collapse of Russia, and the opening of the Panama Canal, that strategic centre has shifted from the North Sea to the Pacific Ocean The problem of the Pacific is the problem of Japan. In Japan there are 60,000,000 people living in narrow islands, with only one-sixteenth of the land fertile, and an annually increasing population. To provide for their growing numbers and the improvement in the standard of living among her people, she is already pressing on the margin of subsistence. She must enter seriously into competition with other countries in the marketing of her manufactures, and she must also obtain additional land. Japan is then faced with the great problem which has bred wars since time began. For as tribes and nations of the past outgrew the resources of their territory, they moved on, and hacked their way to fertile lands adjoining. I desire to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that although Japan, when our ally, acted honorably dur the war, she has still to fight for her position in the world. Japan, like the United Kingdom, is a manufacturing nation, and must have markets for her manufactured products. Across a comparatively narrow sea she sees the awakening of 400,000,000 people to whom she is related both geographically and racially. She feels that her geographical circumstances give her a special right to the exploitation of these markets. But the rest of the world, that is doing all it can to secure the trade of China, has said, &#34; No; there must be an open door.&#34; What is Japan to do? Australia has refused the Japanese admission to the Commonwealth, and the United States of America, by her exclusion bill, has adopted a similar attitude towards these people. Where are the over-flowing millions of Japan to find room ? Surely the Pacific problem is the modern riddle of the Sphinx! It is useless for the people of Australia or America, or any other people, to shut their eyes to the problem, for it does not consist of the things of which dreams are composed. It is no use talking of disarmament at the present juncture unless the causes of naval armaments are removed. I should be in favour of disarmament if there were no possibility -of any naval or military struggle. It may be interesting to follow the tactics adopted by the Japanese in working out their destiny. I hope that it will be thoroughly understood that I am not speaking in antagonism to Japan; I desire only that my remarks shall serve as an object-lesson. Japan has her destiny to fight for; but we also have ours. The Government must realize that an expenditure of two, three, or four million pounds is not sufficient to meet the needs of the situation. Just prior to the late war, Germany had certain rights in China - rights that had been ceded to her under duress&#39;. On the 15th August, 1914, Japan sent an ultimatum to Germany that she must part with her possessions in- China without conditions or compensation, in order that the Japanese Government might hand them back to China. Germany,- as is well known, .did not comply -with the request within the time specified by Japan, and thereupon a Japanese force, in company with a contingent of British soldiers, landed in the province of Shantung and seized the German concessions. Japan then took possession even to the extent of establishing civil government in addition to garrisoning with troops. In the beginning of 1915, Japan, having made up her mind to hold those rights in China, sent an ultimatum to the Government at Pekin intimating, under the famous 21 points, that it would be obligatory for China to consent to the transfer of all German rights and privileges to Japan. The military establishment of the Chinese Government was not sufficiently strong to enable it to dispute the matter with Japan, and accordingly it had to agree. But it will be remembered that, in 1917, when the Chinese determined to throw in their lot with&#39; the Allies, all those rights which had been ceded to Germany were abrogated. The Japanese Government, appreciating this position, again exchanged notes with the Pekin Government. Unfortunately foi* the justice that one should read in the Treaty  of Versailles, the framers of that- treaty allowed the lands that were sacred to the Chinese to be given over to the rapacity of Japan. One might continue to give illustrations of the <inline font-style="italic">polley</inline> of Japan. Take Korea, which . stood in the road of Japanese penetration into China. Not even 43 centuries of historical existence could secure the Korean people from the endeavour of their powerful neighbour. In 1894-5, at the time of the Chinese and Japanese war, Japan compelled China to renounce her protectorate over Korea. In 1904-5, at the time of the Russo-Japanese war, Japan declared a protectorate over Korea, and in 1910 she annexed it. Then she set out to obliterate the national entity of the Korean people, and to make the country Japanese. For this purpose she employed a network of spies, and exercised a rigorous news censorship throughout the land. Japan introduced a reign of terrorism, against which the Koreans naturally retaliated. The Koreans were hopelessly crushed under the chains by which they were fettered. The manifesto of these people, as an appeal to the justice of the world, makes pathetic reading. I remind honorable senators again, that I am not speaking in antagonism to Japan, but for the purpose of furnishing an object lesson to Australia. If these are the facts, and I assure honorable senators that they are, it is necessary for the people of Australia to look- to their defence establishments. It is utterly futile to imagine that it will be sufficient to build two or three cruisers. There must be naval bases. And here I shall come into conflict with some of my honorable friends. In my opinion, a base nt Singapore alone&#39; would not meet the situation. After the battle of Jutland, Admiral Jellicoe furnished a report, dated 15th October, 1915, and his main contention was that it was necessary to have bases close to the scene of action. In spite of the fact that the British fleet was one-third stronger than the German fleet, he refused to engage it, because it was 500 miles distant from his main base. What, then, is the position in regard to the Pacific problem? We were told at the Washington Conference that Great Britain had renounced any intention of further fortification of Hong Kong. Why? For the very simple reason that Hong Kong is backed by a country over which England has no control, and it would be a simple matter for Japan to dispatch an armed  force and attack Hong Kong from the rear. As regards the American position, By water, the great American naval writer, points out that the Philippines, being only a short distance from Japan, could be captured by that power in three days. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, to a large extent, with the aid of the British Navy. Admiral Jellicoe put the position clearly when he said that there should be three kinds of bases. First - Arsenal bases with adequate docks, stores, safe anchorages for the entire, fleet, and strong defences. Second - Operating bases supplied with sufficient means for . repairing ships so that they may reach No. 1 bases, and with sufficient fortifications to protect a fleet. Third - <inline font-style="italic">Points</inline><inline font-style="italic">d&#39;appui,</inline> with fortified places for covering fleet from attacks of destroyers, &#38;c.

                    <para class="block">Japan? With the centre of any naval storm in the Pacific Ocean, Japan has many bases fulfilling these conditions. She has also bases and <inline font-style="italic">points</inline><inline font-style="italic">d&#39;appui</inline> in the Yellow Sea and Korean Straits. Under the five power pact Japan has agreed to renounce her right to fortify the Pescadores, Formosa, Rin-Kui. and the Bonin Islands. But it must be remembered that these are now sufficiently fortified. The principal base at  Sassebo  dominates Shanghai, whilst Port Arthur covers the entrance to the Gulf of PechihLi. If the United States of America entered into war with Japan, its fleet would have to steam 5,000 miles, and then, begin a movement that would sweep the Japanese fleet into its own territory. The American fleet, or any other, would need to be in first-class condition to undertake such a venture, and it would require bases from which to operate. Suppose, for argument&#39;s sake, that war between those two countries was declared. Japan could promptly destroy the whole of the fortifications in the Philippines, she could lay her mine fields, and she could have her <inline font-style="italic">points</inline><inline font-style="italic">d&#39;appui</inline> and her intelligence bases whenever she required them. Japan has the good fortune to have a mandate over the Marshall Islands - that long string of islands stretching south, which seem to have been designed by nature to provide for submarine bases. An American fleet, leaving Pearl Harbour, would have to travel a distance of 5,000 miles at a speed governed by that of its slowest vessel, and it would probably have to carry with it a floating dock, or something of that kind. Apart from that disability, its present capital ships have a speed of 2 knots below those of the Japanese. Suppose Great Britain decided to take part in such a struggle. She has Hong Kong, which she could never reach. The Singapore base would be 2,000 miles from the scene of action, so that these bases would not help the situation. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do. not suggest that the Singapore base is of no value. It might be of material value as an oil depot, and for many other purposes, but of itself it would not be sufficient. Thus all the fleets of the potential enemies of Japan are remote from the theatre of war, and the initiative will thus rest with Japan as long as these conditions prevail. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Commonwealth Government should be in constant communication with the rest of the Empire on the subject of naval defence. I appreciate the remarks made by the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson),</inline> in introducing the bill, when he suggested that steps were being taken in that direction. He pointed out that at the recent Imperial Conference representatives of the Empire came together, and realized that definite steps would have to be taken towards the establishment of effective Empire defence. God forbid that the day should ever come when there will be a shadow over our navy, but if it should so happen Australia will no longer be a proud white race. Japan, feeling that she must have room for her teeming millions, that are increasing in numbers year by year, sees, away to the south, as one of her professors has said, a great land with boundless possibilities, and inhabited by a mere handful of people, a large percentage of whom are deposited upon five or six spots on the wonderful continent. Does any honorable senator dare to tell me that Japan does not look on this land of ours with rapacious eyes? Japan naturally feels that here we have a land merely fringed with a few inhabitants, a land of boundless possibilities, and in their eyes a land flowing with milk and honey. Yet some folk will tell us that this country is not worth defending. It is a crime to the race for Australia not to do her part in supplying a portion, at all events, of the fleet that will defend our shores and make us safe from attack. Our birth-rate is declining, and our immigration scheme is largely a farce. On the other side there is a people with an increasing birth-rate, and a large overflow of natural population each year. In view of these facts, it is no use our merely considering the expenditure of a few million pounds for defence. We have to give consideration to a comprehensive scheme of Empire defence, to a co-partnership in which we should join to maintain and hold this great Empire of ours. Henry Ford, when speaking to a friend of mine recently, said that he would like to visit Australia. &#34; Oh, yes,&#34; said my friend,&#39; &#34; you would like to come to Australia and see our wonderful land? &#34; &#34; No,&#34; replied Ford, &#34; I do not want to see your wonderful land, but I do want to see your wonderful white race.&#34; If we believe in this principle of a White Australia, and if we stand for all that a white race means, we should be prepared, if necessary, to fight for those ideals. They can never be mixed with the ideals of an Asiatic people. If they are worth fighting for - if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> suggested, the stalwart sons of Australia think that this land is worth holding - then we shall have to do something for our defence. It is not a question merely of constructing a few lines of railway in a certain direction, or the establishment of a few mills or factories. We shall have to do something substantial. Japan, believing in her destiny, is fighting for her place in the sun. That she intends to take her place in the councils of the world is shown by the fact that she is spending 42 per cent, of her total revenue on . her military and naval establishments. Does it mean nothing to us when we read in our newspapers statements from documents that are absolutely authoritative that there is remarkable activity in Japanese ship-yards? I am not blaming Japan. Japan has to reach out for her destiny. If we believe that we, too, have a destiny ; that our sons who died on distant shores did not fight in vain, we should get busy and take our place in a comprehensive defence scheme worthy of the British race. </para>

                        <para>. -  I listened very attentively to the eloquent address delivered by the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> and I could not help thinking that no amount of money which we might be asked to spend under this bill would satisfy him. If he had his way a. scheme for the defence of &#39; Australia would cost very much more than &#163;2,500,000. It would take something like &#163;50,000,000 or &#163;60,000,000 to do all that he wants. I was also very much surprised at his remarks concerning Japan. Japan is our ally in peace just as she was our ally during the years of war. Therefore it ill becomes any man in the public life of Australia to utter words that would in any way irritate a friendly nation. The honorable senator told us that Japan had covetous eyes on Australia. That statement has been repeated time and oft during the last twenty years. We ought to look at facts as they are, and not conjure up imaginary dangers. </para>

                            <para>- The conference decided upon a limitation of armaments. Certainly that was a step in the right direction, and to-day we should be considering the question of further disarmament instead of the building of cruisers. Is it not a fact that the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> was sunk in accordance with the terms of the Washington Conference ? </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell the honorable senator before I&#39; resume my seat. Fortunately we have recognized the principle of open diplomacy. I think it is admitted that as a result of open diplomacy there is now an evident desire on the part of responsible statesmen the world over to bring about the economic stability of the nations. Even at the present time there is a conference sitting in London to deal with the  question  of German reparations and to endeavour to lay the foundation of the world&#39;s future peace. </para>

                            <para>- It was brought about by open diplomacy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, the British Prime Minister, placed all his cards on the table, so did M. Herriot,  the French Prime Minister. But for that fact the conference would not have been sitting. That gathering* is dealing with a very serious &#39;question, and we all hope that it will be successful. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> speakingin another place, spoke of the League of Nations as being the hope of the world. Up to the present it has only been a league of some of the nations of the world. By his recognition of Russia and by his invitation to the representatives of Germany to the Reparations Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald is helping to bring about a league of all the nations so that eventually we may be far removed from the dangers of -war. Referring again to the Washington Conference, I remind the Senate that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> returned to Australia he declared that the decisions of the conference would enable &#39;us to devote our energies to the arts of peace. Will the Minister say that in considering this proposal for the construction of two cruisers we are doing that ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said .that the Pacific would be the cockpit of future activities, yet we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;s</inline> word that the Washington conference guaranteed peace in the Pacific as far as any effort of man could guarantee it. Why then the need for this extra expenditure? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> also emphasized the danger of an attack from Japan. I do not share his opinion in that regard. I see no danger now or in the future of an attack from that source, hut in any case if Australia is to be attacked by Japan two cruisers will not repel the Japanese navy. . From what other direction can we be in danger of attack? Only from Europe, where there are hundreds of thousands of people starving. In another place the Prime Minister said that he could not see any danger of attack from Europe, and he did not say that he was anxious about any immediate attack from Japan. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks,</inline> another member of the House of Representatives, who can speak with expert knowledge of naval matters, and whose opinion therefore should be heeded, ha3 no fear of an attack from Japan. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> asked himself the question, &#34; Can an expeditionary force be sent against us?&#34; and he admitted that it was impracticable. Therefore, there is no danger of an .attack from Europe or Japan, or of an expeditionary force. I am not quoting the opinion of a Labour member or the views of a Labour journal. I am putting in the witness-box eminent men who hold political views entirely different from mine. If we do build two cruisers, will they ever be in a position to protect our trade routes ? I am afraid that if our trade routes are to be dependent upon the protection likely to be afforded to them by two cruisers it will be good-bye to our trade relations with other parts of the world. We ought to be frank in this matter. We should tell the people that more than two cruisers are necessary to protect the trade routes of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- When I insure my property I shall take out an effective policy, and will not bother about a contribution towards one. The Public Accounts Committee was recently engaged in considering the possibility of making Australia self-contained in the matter of munitions supply. After all, we must fall back upon the first principle of defence, and that is our capacity to manufacture in Australia the munitions which may be necessary in the event of attack. Suppose we do have two cruisers in active commission and there is a sudden attack upon us from any source. What will our position be? It is disclosed in the report of the Public Accounts Committee dated the 19th July, 1924. That report contains a history of the effort now being made by the .Munitions Supply Branch of the Defence Department to make Australia self-contained in the matter of munitions, and from it I quote the following : - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the kernel of the proposals. The committee endeavoured to bring about a change in factories working under this scheme, whereby iri certain establishments a portion of the premises would be set aside for the manufacture of munition supplies so that operations could be effectively carried out at given centres when the occasion demanded it. Provision has now been made not only to conduct these factories in time of peace, when employment will be available to our artisans, but to have a reserve of material and of skilled men capable of carrying on the necessary manufacture in the event of war. The money allotted has not been spent during any one of the six years mentioned, because the department has not been ready to proceed, but I believe from now onwards this scheme will work more effectively and rapidly. I wish to again emphasize the point that I am opposed to the construction of cruisers, but if Parliament determines that two are to be built, I shall strongly advocate that the work of construction be undertaken in Australia by Australian workmen. </para>
