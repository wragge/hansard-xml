                        <para>.- I realize that this Bill deals with an important subject, upon which there is perhaps justification for a considerable difference of opinion, especially with reference to the appointment of the proposed Commission. The Government, in order to give honorable senators a lead, should be in a position to say whether the work at Canberra, up- to the present, has been satisfactorily performed, and if it is likely, in the near future, to increase to any great extent. Honorable senators, I believe, hesitate before agreeing to the creation of a Commission to take over the work of developing the Capital City area. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has informed us that the appointment of the Commission will not remove from Parliament control of operations at Canberra, but the Bill will clearly give to. the Commission powers which hitherto have been under the direct control of Ministers responsible to Parliament. If the change from control by the Director-General of Works to a Commission is to be one in name only, I shall have nothing to say in opposition to the proposal; but I do not think it right to relieve Parliament of all responsibility in connexion with work at the Capital City. The Bill provides for the appointment of three Commissioners, one, the  chairman,  being required to give the whole of his time to the duties of his office, and the two assistant Commissioners to be called in from time to time as their services may be required to confer with the  chairman.  I approach this question with an open mind. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, but my present intention is to oppose the appointment of three Commissioners. - In my opinion, one Commissioner should be quite sufficient. I do not anticipate, nor do I share the views of those who say that in the near future there will be big developments at Canberra. The continuance of the work at Canberra is now the accepted policy, and, as large sums have already been expended in developing the city, it would now be futile for one to offer any opposition. It has been stated by some honorable, senators that there will be considerable development, in the Federal Capital Territory in the near future, but with - that opinion I do not agree. Competitive designs were called for, and on the accepted plans the city has been laid out. Sewerage, water, and power schemes have been installed, a provisional Parliament House is in course of construction, and provision made for the erection of an administrative block, so that the Commission, if appointed, will merely have to carry on work the foundation of which has already been carefully laid. Criticism has been offered concerning the methods adopted in connexion with certain undertakings, but it is admitted that the officers at Canberra have done their work well. Many of those who have visited the Federal Capital speak in the highest terms of commendation concerning the activities there, and, if the work of construction is proceeding as satisfactorily as we are led to believe, one naturally wonders why three Commissioners should be appointed. One Commissioner, who would have the assistance .of experienced officers in the Department of Works and Railways, the Home and Territories Department, and the Treasury, would be ample. It has been stated that it is necessary to appoint a Commissioner capable of dealing with the financial side of the undertaking. </para>

                            <para>- That would not be necessary. Many extensive commercial undertakings, handling larger sums and doing more important work than ls involved in this instance, are controlled by one man. It is reasonable to assume that, when the Commission is appointed, a new Department will be created and additional officers engaged, which, in the circumstances would be unwarranted. In addition to Parliament House, the administrative building, and the dwellings required by public servants, very few buildings are likely to be erected in Canberra for many years, as there will be little to attract other than those directly or indirectly connected with the government of the Commonwealth. Canberra is not likely to become a commercial city.  A3  provision has been made for a building in which Parliament can meet and for the administrative offices, there is no necessity at present for other extensive works to be undertaken. My present intention is to support the second reading of the Bill, and in Committee to suggest the appointment of one instead of three Commissioners, unless the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)^</inline> when he replies, can justify the appointment of three Commissioners. </para>

                        <para>. -  One naturally wonders what justification there is for the appointment of three Commissioners to control the work of the Federal Capital, because it is generally admitted that under the present system good work is being done there. The Bruce-Page Government should be termed the " wooden" Government, because they believe in government by Commissions and Boards. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> expressed the fear that if the Commission to be appointed  doe3  not comprise some of the principal officers now in control at Canberra a grave injustice will be done. During the war the Government of the day appointed Boards for controlling certain governmental activities, but, even when peace was declared, additional Boards and Commissions were appointed, until to-day there are  34  of such bodies in existence. It would be interesting to know to what extent the burden of the taxpayers has been increased in consequence of this delegation of authority. It is said that the rich pay their fair share of taxation. These burdens filter through the different strata of society until they eventually reach the shoulders of the workers, where they remain, because they cannot be passed on to any one else. The Government should be honest with itself and with Parliament; it should say that it is not able to govern, and should not throw on these Boards the responsibility for its mistakes. Can it be wandered at that the people are asking the reason for Parliament's existence t Government should be by Parliament, not by Boards. Honorable senators and honorable members in another place are paid  £1,000  per year each to govern Australia. If we are not prepared to accept the full responsibility which our position entails we should advise the electors, to abolish Parliament and save the present expenditure. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has referred to the good work done by similar Boards in America. Who  has received the benefit of that work - the toiling masses ? Never ! The benefit has been derived only by the financial magnates of America. That will be the result also in Australia. If one could get to the bedrock of the matter it would be found that the Government is obeying the dictates of those financial magnates. The Minister treated lightly the cost of appointing this Commission, and stated that the system had proved highly successful in America. No other country can equal America in the matter of political bribery and corruption. That country is ruled by trusts and combines. Seven men control its destinies. They have the power to prevent the running of every railway, close every mine, throw every town and city into darkness, and starve the people. </para>

If the men who are now charged with the administration of the Federal Capital area are not doing their duty they should be replaced by others. But every honorable senator says that those  officers  have done their duty effectively and well. Nothing can be said against them, yet the Government proposes to change the system in order to provide fat billets for some of its friends. </para>

                            <para>- The  honorable  senator knows perfectly well that there is truth in my statements. That fact is recognized also by the electors-. This Government attained power on the plea that economy must be practised, and immediately incurred additional expense by appointing a number of Boards. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> referred to the potentialities of Canberra and drew a picture of what the city will be in the future. Where is its greatness ? Where are its wonderful potentialities? The city has been planted in .a howling wilderness. Will the surrounding country make Canberra., self-supporting? Will the city possess any commercial value?. Or will it be left to the- politicians and the officers connected with Parliament? I contend that the, latter will be the experience. Those who are so placed that they can. leave the city will only be too pleased to shake from their feet its dust or its snow. A most astounding feature of the discussion that has taken place on this measure is that each honorable senator opposite who has spoken has opposed certain of its provisions. Senators Duncan and H. Hays believe that the Government should appoint only one Commissioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is afraid that some serious harm will result from these appointments. Yet those honorable senators, will assist the Government to put the measure through. </para>

                        <para>. - The arguments so far advanced on the Ministerial side of the Senate are not sufficient to convince me that the Bill is necessary. Some honorable senators who support- the measure say that three Commissioners are too many. I do not desire to see any Commissioners appointed, and I shall do what I can to prevent the passage of the Bill. Years ago the people of Australia were asked to express by referendum their opinion on the Commonwealth Constitution Bill, and they were made aware of the fact that if they voted for it there would be a. capita) situated at least 100 miles distant from a harbour city. Having approved of that measure the people are, of course, committed to a Federal Capital. I have always been in favour of the proposal. Various Governments have, from time to time, recognized the verdict of the people, and have proceeded with the work at Canberra, and, up to the present, satisfactory progress has. been made. But apparently the present go-slow Government, has received an intimation from one source or another that it must go ahead at express speed so far as Canberra is concerned . . We have  even  been informed by the newspapers, probably -to expedite  the building of the Capital, that the first Cabinet meeting of the Composite Government has been held in the new Capital. I suppose that item of news was heralded from one side of Australia to the other, and even reached the heart of the Empire. We are also told that the Government is extremely anxious to have the temporary Parliamentary buildings at Canberra completed before the present Parliament expires by effluxion of time. Why this great anxiety to leave Victoria? This State has an invigorating climate, magnificent sea beaches and glorious vistas from the hilltops within a stone's throw, comparatively speaking, of this building. </para>

                            <para>- They should go further afield than Footscray. A short distance inland the Yarra is' one of the most beautiful rivers in Australia. We have in Melbourne a press that is kindly disposed to this Parliament and to the members of it, and we can here enjoy the conveniences and comforts that make for happiness and civilization; yet everybody supporting the Bill is saying, " Hurry up and let us go to Canberra." Do they forget that in winter time they will be more or less frozen, and in summer time more or less scorched ? I, too, want to go to Canberra, but I do  not wish to do so in a hurry. We ought to consider seriously what is proposed <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this Bill. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> like myself, are over 21 years of age. In the winter time we shall have to board a train at Spencer-street, and after travelling on the comfortable broad gauge of Victoria as far as Albury, we shall have to change trains in the middle of the night. When we reach Yass in the early hours of the morning there will be another call for us to leave our warm beds and step into one of the Bruce-Page ''' Lizzies," which we are told will whirl us to Canberra, a distance of some 40 miles, at the rate of about a mile a minute. It will certainly <inline font-style="italic">hu</inline> most bracing on- a cold morning in winter, and we- shall need to be clothed like arctic explorers. If we desired t.7 reach Canberra in a perhaps more convenient way, by taking a little more' time over the trip, we could continue the train journey from Albury to Goulburn, change trains there, and proceed to Queanbeyan, from which, after a further change of trains, we could reach the Capital. </para>

                            <para>- Those trams provide a very up-to-date means of locomotion, notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, for they are most convenient to both young and old. Ever since I have been able to think for myself I have been opposed to nominee institutions; they should not be countenanced in any democratic community. Up to the present satisfactory progress has been, made at the Capital city. The work has been carried on by two Departments of the Commonwealth, and I have not heard of any complaints worth serious consideration respecting those who "Iia ve been entrusted with its supervision. Large works have been commenced by these Departments, and, now that they are almost completed, we are told that it is necessary to have a Commission of three. It waa proposed by the Government in another place that there should be three permanent Commissioners, as there would be, they said, ample work for them at the Federal city. But after' making that statement they amended the Bill to provide for one permanent Commissioner and two part-time Commissioners. What is the definition ofl a part-time Commissioner ? Paradoxical as it may sound, is he to be a sort of permanent casual - that is to say, is he to be a permanent employee of the; Service, only partly employed, and allowed to perform duties outside the Service during the time that he will not be engaged on work in the Federal Capital city? </para>

                    <para class="block">Commissioners. Even if there were any justification for a Commission, the Government would not be justified in appointing one permanent Commissioner and two part-time Commissioners. What are to be the duties of the Commission? Is that body to be a sort of super-Parliament at the Federal Capital ? If so, the people of this country will not tolerate for a moment the establishment of such an institution. If the Bill is passed, the Commissioners will be clothed with extraordinary powers. In October next leases of land in the Federal Capital will be submitted to public auction, and the Commission, if appointed in the meantime, will have control of that matter. It will have power to impose rates and taxes, and to float loans. It will be entrusted with the revenues of the Capital, and with the spending of them, and have power to engage a staff of officers, employ them as long as it likes, and pay them what salaries it thinks fit. The  Commission  will have power  to engage  all sorts of labour, and to dismiss employees, apparently, at its own sweet will. I ask the Minister what is to become of the public servants who may be transferred from the various capital cities to the Federal city ? </para>

                            <para>- It does not. We are told that no one can enter the Public Service unless he has passed a prescribed examination. I know, however, that some of the most lucrative positions in the Public Service are filled by officers who have not qualified in the  ordinary  way for appointment to the Service. Even if the Bill be passed, there is no guarantee that the positions of Commissioners will be filled by public servants. In any case, there is no real necessity for the measure. I cannot understand why the Government are showing such a keen anxiety to pass it, and to appoint these Commissioners. The people of Australia are not clamouring for this Parliament to remove from Melbourne to Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- They are not. What will be the advantage  if Parliament  does go there in a year or two;-? 'There ;is no real need for the appointment of these Commissioners. What is the reason for the proposal. It may suit members of Parliament representing States other than those of Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania to remove to Canberra. From their view-point it may be well for the work at that city to be expedited. There never was any real justification for the expenditure of large sums of money in the employment of an army of men at Canberra. What has been the result? The policy of the Government has made skilled labour scarce in certain cities of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- My party believes in fair working conditions. My remark was in answer to certain arguments advanced from time to time by honorable senators supporting the Government that my party, by its advocacy of the limitation of apprentices, has been responsible for the dearth of skilled labour in the Commonwealth. I answer that by saying that the Labour party, being always in favour of good wages and good working conditions, is * anxious t o see essential works proceeded with first. There is a shortage of houses in nearly all the cites of the Commonwealth - at all events there is in this State - and we say that the withdrawal of artisans from Melbourne and other capital cities to the Federal Capital has made it more difficult for those essential works to be proceeded with. </para>

The Commissioners will require a staff to do their work, and although it is proposed that the  Chairman  shall receive a salary of £3,000 a year, no amount is fixed as the remuneration for the other two members of the Commission.

                            <para>- The Commission will require a very big staff,- so it is likely that the £7,000 a year representing the salaries of the Commissioners will be a small amount compared with the total expenditure to be incurred by the Commission. This form of city government is one which I cannot support. It is the first time in the history of the Commonwealth that such a proposal has been made. </para>

If there was any logic in the reasons advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> in support of the Bill that, owing to the large amount of work ahead at Canberra, it would be injudicious to entrust it to an elected body, what would have happened in regard to Federation if he, supposing he had been in public life then, had taken up the attitude that after the people had approved of the Constitution it would be necessary to appoint Boards or a Commission to do tie work which properly should be discharged by the Federal Parliament? It is because I am an advocate of and a believer in the municipal form of government for cities that I am opposing this . Bill. I do not know whether there is any likelihood of it being defeated, but T understand that certain honorable senators have expressed themselves strongly in regard to the number of Commissioners. When we get to the Committee stage, if it- is desired to reduce the number of Commissioners, T shall support any -amendment to secure that- end. </para>

                        (Tasmania) £3.59].- In speaking 'to the second reading of the Bill I wish to- draw attention to- the fact that for some years now work at the Capital city' has been more or less of a developmental character, and that it is hoped, eventually, to found a city worthy of the Commonwealth. I could well understand the- ' honorable .senator who preceded me if his remarks had been directed to the state of affairs that existed a few years ago. But having . visited the Territory annually during the " last four years and having taken a keen interest in its development, I have come to the conclusion that the time- has arrived when some provision should &gt;be made for its permanent administration. The Federal Territory, as every honorable senator who has visited it with an unbiased mind must admit, is far- from being a " howl-"
                        <inline font-style="italic">ing</inline>
                        wilderness " as suggested by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare,</inline>
                        and by certain sections of the press of Australia. On my first visit to Canberra I found, to my surprise, that  the  city was situated in the centre of as fine a stretch of undulating pastoral country as T have seen in New South Wales. 1 do' not suggest 'that it is an agricultural area suitable for closer settlement, but knowing as. I do from personal observation that the pastoral country surrounding Canberra is better than asheeptothe"acre land, I can give the lie direct to any one who declares that Canberra is a " howling wilderness." Any land in New South Wales that is "better than a-sheep-to-the-acre is looked upon as good pastoral country. I was at Canberra only ten clays ago, and found the conditions as cold as any one could wish to meet with anywhere. The weather had been cold for some time. The ranges were covered with snow. During my visit I saw a herd of cattle in beautiful condition being driven in from one of the soldier settlements to the - periodical sale at Queanbeyan, and I was surprised  at  their splendid -condition.. I was informed that all  the  returned soldiers are making a good living on their blocks, the land being well suited for their purposes. Much work has already been done at Canberra. I recognize, of course, that mistakes have been. made. These are inseparable from any large work of public construction, but the city is now taking shape and the work done during the last year or two has been most satisfactory. The time has arrived, in my judgment, when steps should be taken to&gt; put the affairs of the Capital city area under a permanent administration, not so much with regard to necessary public works as with reference to municipal administration. I was very pleased to find that the departmental officers responsible for the work have made tha living conditions of tie workers so comfortable. A certain -section of men employed in the laying of tramlines and the making of roads are housed in tents. I have never yet seen a colony living in tents under such, admirable conditions as the tent dwellers in Canberra. The tents are good. Each tent is floored; each floor has a skirting round it, and better than all, the entire area occupied by the tent-dwellers is effectively sewered. Along at a .place called "The Gap," I found 30 or 40 wooden buildings, or rather shells of wooden buildings, each of four rooms, provided with electric light, water laid on, bath -and sink, and every convenience except a brick chimney. At present there are galvanized iron chimneys and fireplaces attached to each building,- but I understand that within, the next month or two steps will be taken to erect brick chimneys in those buildings. From inquiries I found that the workers were highly satisfied with all that had been done on their behalf by the departments -concerned. I approach consideration of the details of this Bill with mixed feelings. T agree with what has been said by 'the Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                        that something must be done in the way of appointing an administrator or Commission to control future developments "at Canberra. But I do not- feel justified in giving support, to the proposition embodied in the Bill. Consistent, of course, with satisfactory control, we ought -to proceed warily for a few years, and I .believe one Commissioner, who would have as his .advisers the heads of the Departments now carrying out the work, would be ample for the
                        <inline font-style="italic">nest</inline>
                        five years. We could- then see whether that form of administration was suitable for the growing needs of Canberra, and, if it were found necessary, the personnel of the Commission could be increased. I do not believe that it is in the best interests of the Commonwealth, or of the development of Canberra, to appoint an expensive Commission, because, one Commissioner with the. assistance of those capable officers who are already engaged there would be quite capable of doing all that is required. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, but when it is in Committee I trust it will be amended in such a way that the Government will be assured of having all the assistance they require for the next five years, when, if the development of the Capital City necessitates it, a larger Commission can be appointed.

                        <para>. - No one can rightly accuse me of not being a supporter of Canberra, as I have from the commencement always been very keen on the Seat of Government being . transferred from Melbourne to that city at the earliest possible moment. After listening to the honorable senators' who spoke yesterday and to-day, I am more than ever convinced that the work at the Federal Capital is now proceeding as rapidly and effectively as it possibly could under the proposed Commission. The work which has already been done by departmental officers has been commended on every hand, and the Government have been especially fortunate in having at their disposal the services of such highly-trained and efficient men as those who are directing -constructional work at Canberra. "If we were to search throughout Australia I do not think we could find officers more competent, or who rank higher in their professions, than the members of the present Advisory Committee. As a member of the Public Works Committee for six years, I was able to judge the capabilities of the departmental officers responsible for the constructional work at Canberra, and I realize that it would be difficult to find more earnest or more efficient officers. Considering that such satisfactory work has been undertaken, and such splendid progress made during the last few years, I fail to see why .it is necessary to make' any alteration at the present juncture. In. addition to the assistance given by tile Advisory Committee, the Public Works Committee also investigates every work undertaken there the cost of which exceeds a fixed amount, and after that Committee has made its recommendations and the work is completed, the Public Accounts Committee inquires into the financial side of the undertaking. The Bill provides that the "Public Works Committee shall still inquire into the larger works, and the Accounts Committee will also have authority to make whatever investigations is considers necessary. I have always been opposed to the appointment of Boards which usurp the responsibilities of Parliament, and, in my opinion, that is a strong reason why this Commission should not be appointed. Quite apart from the fact that the appointment , of a Commission is unnecessary. . the question of the expense must also be considered.  I ' do not object . to the salary to be paid to the Chief Commissioner, because, if a suitable man is to be obtained, an attractive remuneration must be offered. It is interesting to note, however, that the salary of the' Chief Commissioner is to be higher than that received by the' Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, who, in conjunction with his colleagues, is responsible for the government of the whole of the Commonwealth. In this instance the Commission will have control of operations in a comparatively small area, and the responsibility of the Chief Commissioner' will be small in comparison with that of the Prime Minister. It is provided that the two Commissioners acting under the Chief Commissioner shall bo paid fees, but at present we have no idea of what amount will be involved. I an unable to find any limit fixed in the Bill, but it is reasonable to assume that the fees paid to each Commissioner will nearly approximate the remuneration paid to the  Chairman.  The fees prescribed will doubtless bring the cost of the Commission up to a substantial figure. We have also to consider whether the gentlemen appointed will be compelled to live at the Federal Capital, or whether they will be permitted to reside in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Port Darwin, or Hobart, thus involving rail and steamer fares, as well as travelling expenses, when they visit the Federal Capital. As the two Commissioners will not be serving continuously, it  i3  probable that the Commission will sit daily for a fortnight or a month at a tin\e, and  that considerable expenditure will be involved in paying their travelling and other expenses. ' The estimated cost of the Commission should be stated. Immediately it is appointed, a staff of secretaries, accountants, clerks, typists, and timekeepers will be appointed whose salaries will add tremendously to the cost. I do not think I shall be very wide of the mark in saying that the cost of the Commission is more likely to be £20,000 than £10,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- It would be if it could be shown that, up to the present, work has been carried on in an unsatisfactory way, but we are authoritatively informed that the progress being made is all that could be desired. I should much prefer to see a Minister appointed who would be responsible to Parliament, and whose sole duty it would be to control the Federal Capital. If a Minister were appointed for  the purpose, the control 1 would be taken from the Department of Works and Railways and the Home and Territories Department and placed under that one Minister, who would be responsible to Parliament, and Parliament would be responsible to the people. I shall take my full share of the responsibility for everything the Government do, and I wish to be in a position to defend their actions and my own whenever necessary. But I shall certainly decline to accept any responsibility for the expenditure that is- incurred, or the work that is done at Canberra, by a Commission. I regret the nature of the opposition that is sometimes shown to Bills introduced by the Government, because it is of a factious character and has its genesis in the fact that the Government is responsible' for their introduction. Some honorable senators lose sight of the interests of the taxpayers. I look at this matter largely from the view-point of the taxpayer. At present there is a determined agitation for .a reduction of taxation. I think the people of Australia are well entitled to some reduction, but if we continue to pile up costs by appointing Commissions such as this we shall not. be in a position to make any considerable reduction. I owe to the taxpayer the duty of pleading for some consideration for him when he is not able to make the plea himself. The present method of administering Canberra can very well continue until Parliament meets there. We shall then have the opportunity of seeing what is really required, and thus will be in a better position to determine the best means of government for the Capital City. Once Commissioners are appointed it will be almost impossible to remove them from their office. I have never heard of that step having been taken. </para>

                            <para>- The conditions governing their appointment will present difficulties that are not at present appreciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I regard clause 14 as the crux of the Bill. I believe that it will place a very dangerous power in the hands of an outside authority. I direct the attention of honorable senators to sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">h,</inline> which gives to the Commission the right to levy rates and taxes upon the residents at Canberra. We have often heard the phrase : '.' No taxation without representation." Those who will live in Canberra will not have a representative in the Federal Parliament, nor will they be represented in the municipal government of the city. The three Commissioners will have full power to collect revenues, to carry on the construction work, to provide gas and electricity, to make provision with regard to markets, weighbridges, the destruction of vermin and noxious weeds, and every other matter connected with the Territory. Not very long ago the residents of Port Darwin did not have a representative in the Federal Parliament, although they had local municipal government. Certain of the residents decided to go to gaol rather than to pay the taxes that were levied. I can imagine a demand for the payment of a tax being made upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> by this Czar whom it is proposed to appoint. The honorable senator doubtless would say: "I will go to gaol rather than pay * ray rates .and taxes." </para>

                            <para>- Believing that the people have the right to decide the manner in which the revenues shall be spent, I should assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in that agitation. This Commission should not be given the power to insist upon the payment of taxes by the residents of Canberra, unless those residents are given the opportunity to elect representatives to a local council. Those who will go to Canberra will be drawn from every State in the Commonwealth and, not being as docile as the residents of New South Wales or Victoria, they will probably demand the right to elect representatives to a local council. The Bill deliberately denies them that right, and if Parliament passes it in its present state it will be responsible for an act of injustice to a considerable section of the citizens of the Commonwealth. I point out, further, that clause 17 confirms that power in the hands of these gentlemen. I take the stand that no amendment made in Committee can perfect this measure. If the Senate agrees to the motion for the second reading of the Bill I am content to allow the remaining stages to go through. The Bill ought to be thrown out. Summed tip, I oppose the Bill because, in the first place, it is quite unnecessary to ensure the progress of Canberra. Ample proof has been given that the work at Canberra is proceeding as rapidly as possible. The Bill is undemocratic. Surely honorable senators of this democratic Chamber are not going to inflict upon their fellow citizens  legislation that they themselves would resent root and branch. The measure will have the effect of increasing very' considerably the cost of government and thus  placing a  further unnecessary burden on the taxpayers of Australia. Those tax-' payers have the right to expect - and at present they do expect - to retain, through their representatives, full control of all taxation. My final objection is that under the present administration the work at Canberra is proceeding as expeditiously and as satisfactorily as it could under the proposed Commission. I have always been opposed to the appointment of Boards to control utilities under the Government, and I have frequently indicated that I intend to oppose any further appointments. Some of the Boards that arc already in existence are not rendering the satisfactory service that was expected by this Parliament, and I for one do not intend to risk further waste. </para>

                        <para>. - This debate has certainly been entertaining in  more  respects than one. First of all, it has revealed that wonderful unanimity that we now always expect from honorable senators opposite. The speeches of Senators Gardiner, McDougall, Findley, Needham, and Hoare have not deviated one syllable one from the other. Honorable senators on this side in this respect labour under the disadvantage that they possess freedom of conscience and freedom to express their views. If an honorable senator on this side honestly disapproves of a Bill ho is at liberty to oppose it; and he does oppose it. Some honorable senators opposite may agree with the provisions of a Bill as heartily as honorable senators on this side, but they do not vary in the slightest degree in their opposition to the measure. I warn honorable senators on this side that honorable senators opposite have decided to treat this as a party measure. </para>

                            <para>- Another entertaining phase of this debate is the extraordinary view that is taken by some honorable senators ' opposite regarding the functions of this Parliament. I have always been under the impression that the function of a Parliament is to  legislate, and that the function of a Government' is to administer; but apparently some of our friends opposite think that it is the function of a Parliament to administer. As a matter of fact, if there is one body that is, from the very causes  that give it life, unfitted to administer, it is a Parliament. Under the British system of . parliamentary government, Parliament .has, luckily for itself, never attempted to administer: yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> objects to all Boards. He says, " This is the work of Parliament;  it is for this that we are elected." He quite ignores the fact that Parliaments are never elected for such a purpose. All British Parliaments have recognized that fact- from time immemorial, and have contented themselves with legislating only, reserving to themselves the right to criticize administration. They have delegated the administration of affairs in the first place to Cabinets, and in the second place to corporate bodies and others, who derive their administrative authority from the Parliaments. What is local government to-day? It amounts to a recognition by  a State Parliament that it cannot concern itself with the minutiae of municipal government, such as attending to sanitation and hygiene, the control of which is entrusted to the local governing bodies. </para>

                    <para class="block">With those matters of lesser importance Parliament has neither the time nor the organization to deal. What do the State Harbour Boards and Trusts indicate but a recognition by Parliament that it has no time, and has not the necessary organization, to enable it to administer those functions. When I hear' old parliamentarians like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> objecting to Boards without discrimination, it makes me rub my eyes and wonder whether, Rip Van Winkie' like, those members have been asleep while sitting in Parliament. Both Federal and State Parliaments have found it necessary to delegate all the lesser functions to other bodies, always retaining the power to end or mend the life of the "corporate body it creates, and also reserving to itself the financial control. When I hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> say that all Boards have been a failure, and that he would not support the appointment of any more of them, I wonder whether he' would condemn the Murray Waters Commission. </para>

                            <para>- The Murray Water Commission furnishes a- very apposite illustration. In that case we had to deal with a work that was to be of a Federal character, for more than one State was interested. There were the navigation interest and the irrigation interest, - and South Australia was more concerned at the time in the navigation than in the irrigation aspect, whereas Victoria and New' South Wales were taking great quantities of this water for irrigation purposes. The three States, each with its different interest, were at last brought together, and they decided to so construct works on the Murray that the river could be used both for navigation and irrigation. Each of the State Parliaments concerned attempted to do so, and what happened ? Nothing was done. Year after year there was a lot of talk in Parliament, but no progress was made. It was then decided to invite the Commonwealth to co-operate, and the only way in which Federal cooperation could be obtained was by the appointment of a Commission. Such a body was appointed with certain definite powers, the Parliaments retaining financial . control, just as is now proposed in connexion with the Federal  CapitalCommission. Since the appointment of the Murray Waters Commission. there have been changes of Government in each of these States, and also in the Commonwealth, but the work of. the Commission has. gone on continuously and: economically. There is nobody in the Commonwealth to-day, not even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Newland,</inline> who utters, one word of criticism of the work of that Commission. In his happy-go-lucky style the honorable senator tells us that he is against all Boards, although his. own State is specially interested in the work of a Commission which <inline font-style="italic">Taas</inline> furnished a remarkable instance of Parliament being helpless, and acknowledging its helplessness so far as such an undertaking is concerned. I could quote numerous instances of a similar kind, but I have merely mentioned one case that I thought would particularly appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland.</inline></para>

                            <para>- A curious turn has been given to the debate by Senators Newland, Gardiner, and others, who argue that it is urgently necessary to grant local government in the Federal Capital. If the residents of Canberra were allowed to govern themselves, would this Parliament allow the municipal council of Canberra to expend millions of money contributed by the taxpayers of Australia? Where is the cry of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> and other alleged democrats, of " No taxation without representation " ? What about the representation of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth who contribute the millions? We should have the genial ratepayers of Canberra, no doubt, welcoming such a proposal. What a glorious thing it would be for them I' They would fix their own rates, be it remembered, but the millions that the Commonwealth is to expend on roads, streets, sewerage, gas, and electricity would be provided by the taxpayers outside the Federal Territory. How carefully' these honorable senators have considered their proposal before voicing it on the floor of the Senate! Yet these are the honorable gentlemen - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> and others - :who put' this argument up in opposition to the proposal in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I am astonished that they should suggest that the few hundreds of people now at Canberra should be given the government of the Federal Territory. I would invite honorable senators to remember that 85 per cent, of the people at present in the Federal Capital are Government officials, whose salaries are paid by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. When one examines, the  proposition  a little further, and remembers that these officials would be able to elect the representatives who are to govern the city, who are to make the roads and footpaths and provide the gas, electric light, and other conveniences, and who' are, incidentally, to fix tha salaries to be paid in the Federal Capital in the carrying out of the work, one sees that the argument does not bear investigation. Seeing that the proposed council would have unlimited funds upon which to draw, since it would determine what its annual rate should be, while the Commonwealth would have to provide the money  for  the carrying- out of the works, it would, indeed, be a happy picnic. </para>

Let us see what that would mean.. The people would be given a vote, and they would at once proceed to elect the municipal council.

This Parliament decided to adopt the best plan obtainable to enable it to build a Capital worthy of Australia, and therefore Parliament must also find the money for the work; otherwise we should have Parliament on the one hand taxing the whole of the people to raise the funds for the construction of the Capital, and a municipal council that did not represent the taxpayers expending the money. </para>

                            <para>- There have been loose thinking and talking on this Bill, and attempts have been made to draw an analogy between Canberra and Sydney. No city in the British Empire supplies a true analogy, for Canberra is unique in the Empire. To find an analogy we should have to go outside the Empire. Our Constitution is modelled on. that of the United States of America, and the only Federal Capital analogous to ours is Washington, which site is in a Federal Territory, just as Canberra is. Sydney is not a Federal Capital, and it is not located in Federal Territory. It is the capital of the State of New South Wales, and the laws of that State extend throughout its borders, with the one exception of the comparatively small area reserved as Federal Territory, where no State law can operate. That territory is as much Tasmania as it is New South Wales. It was suggested that we should give to the people of the Federal Capital Territory political representation, and one honorable senator even said, "We ought to tack the Territory on to some adjoining electorate." Evidently there are still honorable senators who look upon this Territory as part of New South Wales. Politically, it has no more to do with New South Wales than has the Kimberley district of Western Australia, and to tack those people on to any other constituency, politically, is to refuse to recognize the distinct status that that Territory has iu relation to the Commonwealth. If, in looking at this Bill, one loses sight of the main principles that are being dealt with - a. Federal Capital in Federal Territory - then one goes astray and is faced with a mass of contradiction, but if one holds fast to those principles one will see that there are reasons for this Dill that did not exist in relation to any other city. Because we propose the appointment of this Commission, it is argued that we are advocating the commission form of government as being superior to the municipal form of government. That is where the confusion of thought has arisen. We are bringing this Bill forward, not because we believe that the commission form of government is better than the municipal form of government, but because we say that for a Federal Capital in Federal Territory we cannot logically have a municipal form of government, as that would be inconsistent with, and involve the destruction of, the Federal idea. We must have one of two things - either the Federal Parliament must control and govern that area and all appertaining to it, or also the Federal Parliament must, for its own convenience, hand over to some other authority, created by it, its control and administration. To refute the attempt to draw an analogy between Canberra and Sydney, I shall take the question of electric light. Would any one in his proper senses believe that the few hundred people at Canberra would install an electric light system there similar to that provided by the Commonwealth ? Of course not. The works at Canberra, are being constructed, not on a village scale, but on a national scale by the nation, and the whole of the people of the Commonwealth must carry the burden, and not the few local inhabitants. </para>

I now come to some of the objections to the appointment of the Commission. First of all, the taunt was thrown at the Government by the other side that this Bill, when originally introduced in another place, provided that there should be three permanent Commissioners, but that owing to some mysterious outside influence the Government had to climb down and agree to appoint only one permanent Commissioner and two part-time Commissioners to be paid by fees.. I have with me the original  Bill  -introduced by the Government in the House of Representatives. The pertinent clause is clause 6, sub-clause 3, which reads - </para>

What was done in another place was this: They struck out the words "partly by fees and partly by salary," and, in my judgment, somewhat strangely struck out the limitation of £2,000 per annum. This Bill as amended by another place provides that the  Chairman  shall be paid £3,000 per annum, and that the other two members of the Commission shall be paid by fees as prescribed. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators on the other side seem to think that the style of the Government was cramped by some mysterious outside influence. If they look at the Bill in its present form they will see that the Government have been left with a freer hand than they had under the Bill as originally introduced. I wish to deal with the criticism against the appointment of three Commissioners) because there seems to be a general agreement on the part of those in favour of the Bill that there should be at least one Commissioner. Some doubt was expressed as to whether there ought to be two other Commissioners. The Senate should consider the varied phases of the work which the Commission, if appointed, will" have to carry out. First of all, it is absolutely wrong to say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> has said, that this Commission will be more costly than the present form of control.  His  argument that the present Advisory Committee is costing nothing is incorrect. If the honorable senator had heard or read my second-reading speech- </para>

                            <para>- I then pointed out that one of the members of the Advisory Committee receives £1,000 per annum, and that all the members receive travelling expenses when they travel from Sydney to Canberra. Another member of the Committee draws £400 per annum. It is a mistake to think that there is no staff. The Committee have the necessary clerical staff to enable them to carry out their duties. There are three so-called honorary members, but only one is a purely honorary member. The cost of the Advisory Committee is a forecast of what that of the Commission will be. There is no necessity for the appointment of a larger staff. I now come to the question of the duties of the Commission. At present the administration is divided: the construction of works comes under the Works and Railways Department, and this land, municipal, financial, and all the other varied functions are administered by the Home and Territories Department. There are two heads - one, the Director-General of Works,  Colonel Owen,  who, while resident at Canberra, directs and supervises the works; and the other, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goodwin,</inline> who deals with local government and other matters at the Capital. So that to-day there are two Government Departments dealing with the administration and control of Canberra, which necessitates a fair amount of work on both sides. Any one who is familiar with the variety of the work will know that it is impossible for one man to direct, with wisdom-, the various activities there. I ask honorable senators to consider what they are. Take the work of construction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays is under a misapprehension when he says that all the main construction works have either been completed or designed. I assure him that that is not so. For instance, be spoke of sewerage. As a matter of fact all that Has been done so far in relation to sewerage is <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> construction of the main outfall sewer. That is only the backbone of the system - all the ribs have to be added and the connexions made. </para>

                            <para>- I remember the time 'when the work of sewerage at Canberra was attacked in this Parliament. If I am not mistaken a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into that work, and reported that it had been very well carried out. The sewerage has not yet been completed, and is really only in its initial stage. Then there is the work of street . making, which has not yet been begun. The advent of private enterprise iii October next, when leases will be offered for sale, means the opening up of shopping and residential centres, requiring the., provision of streets and footpaths, and gas, electric light, water and sewerage services. I now come to public works. It is  true that work on the Parliament House has been commenced; but so far as the administrative offices . are concerned we are only just calling for competitive designs. There are big buildings still awaiting designs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin's</inline> plan did hot provide for the various public buildings, but only for the lay-out of the city. For instance, a war memorial estimated to cost anything up to a quarter of a million, and probably more, has yet to be designed.- There are works such as the post office, the town hall, and probably a military barracks yet to be constructed. One can think of a great number of other works that will be required if the Commonwealth Government is to function fully as far as the central ad- . ministration is concerned at the Federal Capital. Practically none of these works have yet been provided for, and, therefore, if this Bill is passed, they will come under the control of the Commission. We know that the present railway connexion is of a very rudimentary character. There is no provision for tramways yet we know that the scattered nature of the city will render such a service essential to bring the people from the residential centres to the administrative and shopping centres. Honorable senators will thus see that there is a great deal of essential work yet to be done. </para>

                        <para>. - This is one of the vital clauses of the Bill. It proposes a complete departure, so far as Australia is concerned, from our system of local government. With the exception of the United States of America, I know of no other -country where the system of government by commission has superseded government of local areas by representatives elected by the ratepayers. It has been said by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that the position at Canberra is so entirely different -from that obtaining in any other Australian city that an entirely different system is necessary for its government. It has been stated that it would be entirely  wrong to give a handful of people at Canberra the right to expend large sums of public money collected from the taxpayers of the whole Commonwealth. With that I agree, but I do not consider that contingency need be feared. If settlement were permitted upon the 64 square miles representing the city area, Canberra would produce locally all the revenue required for the public works. Surely Canberra is not for ever to be regarded as a place where public money is to be sunk without any return. If the present policy is continued, no doubt that will be the result. If, however,  the Government adopt a different policy, and permit people to settle in the area, Canberra should, before long, pay handsomely. If in the other cities of the Commonwealth the Government had not parted with the fee-simple in the land, the rentals would have passed into the -coffers of the local councils instead of into the pockets of private individuals, and would have been available for all essential public works. They would have had more money than they knew what to do with. If Canberra makes the progress which we all expect it will and if settlement, be permitted, the return in rentals should show a- handsome surplus over expenditure, and possibly permit the local governing body to reduce the rates. Canberra, in short, ought to be one of the most desirable residential and business cities in the whole of Australia. </para>

I repeat that I want existing conditions to continue until Parliament meets at Canberra, and we can provide for the residents there to have the right to govern themselves. It is all very well to say that, if we granted the people of Canberra local autonomy, they would be spending money raised by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth; but if we give people the right to  settle  there, at a very early date the rentals received will provide enough revenue not only to meet all expenditure, past, present, and prospective, but to provide a. surplus as well. For' this reason I intend to oppose the clause. </para>

We are Australian people. We have one destiny, and are all actuated by the desire to be essentially Australian. To whom is the Federal Capital to belong? To the people of Australia.

The number of residents in Canberra today is comparatively small, but within a few years it will undoubtedly be very large, and those most concerned at the Seat of Government should have the right to say by whom they shall be governed. What is to prevent the Federal Parliament passing an Act, such as a State Parliament would, bringing into existence a municipal form of government and giving to those elected as councillors the power to control the Capital City? What is wrong with the work which is at present being performed? Why is a Commission necessary? </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and operations could be continued as at present for a considerable time. The suggestion was made that if we were not favorably disposed to an elective municipality a member of the present Cabinet, who. would have the assistance of men with experience and judgment, should be placed in control of Canberra. In such circumstances the work could be done just as well as by these three Commissioners, who will receive high salaries. If citizens at Canberra were elected to responsible positions it is said, to use the vernacular, they would play " ducks and drakes " with the taxpayers' money. What a bogy to trot out ! In what way would they be appointed? Would there be anything to prevent the Parliament, after assembling there, passing an Act bringing into existence a governing body ? The Minister said, " From whom could the councillors be selected ? A lot of public servants and others."- Surely the  public  servants are as much entitled to representation as those outside the Service. Arguments have been advanced by " die-hards " and Tories why public servants should not have the same rights as other citizens. That principle was embodied in legislation in Victoria a few years ago, when the public servants were disfranchised, but were given special representation in the State Parliament. It was not long, however, before that legislation was repealed, and the public servants in this State, and throughout the whole Commonwealth, now exercise the rights to which they as citizens are justly entitled. If a municipal council is established, the  public  servants should have as much right to representation on such a body as those who are not in the Service. There is no justification whatever for a departure from the principle which the people of Australia have wholeheartedly endorsed from time to time,, and I shall endeavour to prevent this clause passing in its present form. It will not be long before the Seat of Government is transferred to Canberra, and I believe that the administration would be much better carried out without a Commission such as is provided for in this clause. I am opposed to a Commission, because it will be a superfluous and costly institution, the members of which will be clothed with extraordinary powers. If a Commission is appointed, the  chairman  will become more or less an autocrat, and the people in the Federal Capital Territory, and the people of Australia generally, will be in. a much worse position than they are at present, because they will be called upon to meet the expenditure which it incurs. What a poor opinion the Minister has of the intelligence and outlook of the residents of Canberra if he thinks that they will not be as much concerned in the development and future of the city as will the members of the proposed Commission. It will be their pride and ambition to assist to make the city a model one, and also to lighten as far as possible ' the burden of taxation. The Minister said, incidentally, that they would make the burden lighter for themselves and heavier for the rest of the taxpayers. If the Commission is appointed, its members will be placed in a better position than those of an elective body. There will be insufficient revenue for a time to meet the expenditure incidental to the successful carrying on of extensive work to be undertaken, and as there will be insufficient revenue, the Commission is to be given power to float loans of any amount. </para>

                            <para>- That is only incidental. We are justified in presupposing that it will have to float loans. It will have the power; but if we had an elective body it would be permitted to raise money only under the terms of the Act under which it was created. Municipalities can, at present, float loans for comparatively large sums if the work on which the money is to be expended is justified. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Local governing institutions in different parts of Australia have done remarkably well. From time to time they approach the Treasurers of the various . Governments seeking subsidies, and these they receive from time to time, not from the people in their respective municipalities, but from the Consolidated Revenue, into which the money of the taxpayers of the State goes. The local governing authorities are responsible for lighting, road-making, and for everything which makes for the protection and betterment of the people in particular areas, and there should be nothing to prevent a municipal council at Canberra acting similarly. The number of residents at the Federal Capi-tal to-day is comparatively small, so small, in fact, that we ought not - to use the words of the Minister - to give serious consideration to the small band there. If there is anything in that line of reasoning, a number of places in the more remote portions of Australia should not have any form of local government. The number to-day at Canberra may be small, but when Parliament assembles there the population will be considerable, as members of Parliament, their wives and families, heads of Departments, the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, printing office employees, newspaper men, artisans, and others will have to be accommodated. Members of Parliament will have to be fed. They will not be permitted to go about in the garb of Adam, and will have to bo clothed and housed, which will mean that others will be employed in fulfilling their needs. More land will be placed under cultivation, there will be increased production; and as for every man placed oil the land work is provided for two others, it will not be long before a big population will  be  settled there. </para>

                        <para>.- On this clause I shall endeavour to give effect to the proposal I made during my second-reading speech. The clause provides that " for the purposes of this Act there shall be a Federal Capital Commission, which  shall  be charged with the general" administration of this Act." My remarks on the motion for the second reading of the Bill must have conveyed to honorable senators the impression that I considered that one Commissioner would be sufficient for the work that would require to be done for some time at Canberra. I, therefore, think that the word "Commission" should be omitted and the word "Commissioner" inserted, and that "who" should be substituted for "which." I have given the matter a good deal of consideration since I spoke earlier, and I have not heard anything that would induce me to alter my opinion. </para>

                            <para>. -  I understood that this matter was to be tested on the next clause, but it may just as well be dealt with now. I invite the attention of the Committee to the varied nature .of the duties that will -devolve upon the Commission. I refer particularly to clauses 14, 17, 21, 22, and 23. Clause 14 refers to matters of a widely varying character, including the control and management' of Crown lands ; the levying and collection of rates; the construction, maintenance, and operation -of tramways; the construction, maintenance, and control of . roads, bridges, culverts, &amp;c. ; the provision of gas, electricity, water, and sewerage. One cannot conceive of a successful lands administrator having a .particular knowledge of all the other matters I have  mentioned. Other duties will be the provision and maintenance ' of markets, weighbridges, pounds, and abattoirs; the destruction of vermin and noxious weeds ; the protection of public health and the maintenance of sanitation - purely local government matters, which differ widely from those previously mentioned.' Honorable senators are aware that, before a man can secure appointment as a. town or city engineer he must pass an examination in; local government, sanitation, hygiene, and matters of that description. Then there will be additional- duties, such as the construction and maintenance of all works and buildings, as well as any other matters that are specified in any regulation. Honorable senators can see that there are three groups, each distinct and widely different from the others. Further duties are outlined in clause 17, and I invite attention to their importance. That clause refers to the accounts of the Commission, which relate, not merely to rates and charges for services, but to the rents received from lands leased by the Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I am showing the necessity for the appointment of more than one Commissioner, because of the varied nature of the duties that will have to be undertaken. The rents will amount to a considerable sum, and the adjustment "of those rents - in view of the growth that is expected to take place in the city - will "cost very heavy duties upon those responsible for the administration of the Terri-' tory. The adjustment of the rents of the surrounding land has already caused me considerable concern. Disputes were continually arising in relation to allotments of land and rentals, and I found it advisable to appoint a small Lands Board - composed, it is true, of officials. The lessees were not satisfied, with the decisions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Goodwin. Every unsuccessful applicant charged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goodwin</inline> with bias, or something of the kind, and the only way in which' I could get peace of mind or give satisfaction was to appoint a Board of three members. I have given an outline of the works that will have to bc undertaken. They are of such a nature that the amount of borrowing necessary in the next few years will be substantial. Then clauses 22 and 23 provide for the preparation of the annual estimates for submission to the Minister in the first place, and, subsequently, to Parliament. One of the most difficult tasks of a Minister is the preparation of the annual Estimates. Imagine the task that would face a man who had to devote his attention to municipal matters, sanitation, health measures, and land questions, and then be responsible for the financial administration, which in the next few years will involve an expenditure of ' at least ?1,000,000 pen' annum. The Government does not expect that the man . responsible for the financial administration will devote the whole of his time to it; but it considers' that it can secure the services of a man who will lay down and direct the* financial policy, as well as see that the- accounts are properly kept, and that economy is being practised. The idea is that one of the Commissioners  shall be a- financial man, taken, probably from a. leading firm of accountants in either Melbourne or Sydney. He will give the Chief Commissioner the benefit of his advice on financial matters, and see that the policy laid down is properly executed. The Government thinks it will also be able to secure the services of a person possessing a knowledge of local government, matters. When private enterprise enters Canberra, and shopkeepers and private individuals are erecting buildings on their leases, the city will not be a paradise for a member of Parliament, because his neighbours will be constantly bringing to his notice matters relating to local government, and will expect him to raise them in Parliament or to wait upon the Minister to see that they are remedied. We know how irksome such duties are. I have had experience of municipal life, and although I fully appreciate the importance of these matters of local government to the persons concerned,, I realize that the time of the Parliament of Australia will be occupied with much more important matters than those of sanitation or the condition of the streets of Canberra. We do not want the executive head, whose chief business it will be to look after the constructive side of the Capital, to have his time taken up with local government matters, although in that respect also we wish Canberra to be a model city; Therefore, we propose to enlist the services of some well-known authority on local government. There are many such persons in the various States, and we should be able to secure the services of some one whose advice will be of incalculable value to the Chief Commissioner, who could not possibly be skilled hi those matters in addition to those with which he will be principally concerned. i- </para>

When I was at the Federal Capital about six weeks ago T went down the main sewer where the men were working. If the Minister can tell us where we could obtain engineers capable of doing better work than I saw there, then Australia will be indeed lucky, for it is one of the. finest examples of such work that I have ever seen. From what I know personally of the officer in charge he is one of the most able men in Australia for that class of work. The Minister must admit that the roads in Canberra are well made, and that a Commission could not make better roadways than are now being constructed. The plantations are similarly creditable; the electric- light is already there; and the supply of water being pumped from the Cotter River to meet domestic requirements could be increased to such an extent  as to make water available for generating electricity. Therefore all the public utilities necessary for any city are  to be  found in Canberra. The work is said to be in the initial stages, and the operations will no doubt have to be extended, but so satisfactory has been the preliminary work that it would be wrong to appoint a Commission at this stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> in the course of his speech yesterday, pointed out the danger of the two part-time Commissioners being subservient to the permanent Commissioner. I also see that danger. The opinion of members of Commissions is often swayed by that of the permanent head. If there are to be three Commissioners the attendance of two of them should not be intermittent, but the attention of the whole three should be . continuously concentrated on the work. They should be in daily attendance and be paid properly for their services. I have no special objection to the salary proposed to be paid, but if a Commission is to be appointed all the Commissioners should be permanent officers. Why should we not adopt the  system followed in the Victorian railways, which are governed by three permanent Commissioners, or else follow the system in Western Australia, where the railways are under one Commissioner. Whether we have one or three Commissioners a salary worthy of the position should be paid. </para>

                            <para>- My amendment will not interfere with the underlying principle of the Bill.. I desire it to be clearly understood that, I do not wish to be associated wither any honorable senator whose sole purpose is to destroy the measure. In view of the developments that have taken place in the last two or three years, and the approaching completion of the Capital, the time has arrived when there should be some administrative head at Canberra. I listened attentively to the speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who reminded us that a number of problems would arise for solution at Canberra that would necessitate the appointment - of a Commission. He referred to such questions as the control and management of Crown lands, the construction and maintenance and operation of tramways, the construction of roads and bridges, the provision of gas, electricity, water, and sewerage. The Minister also referred to the financial operations which would have to be carried out under the auspices of the administration. He particularly referred to clauses 22 and 23, under which the Commissioners are to prepare estimates annually of their revenue and expenditure, and submit them to the Minister. He also pointed out that one Commissioner should be a sound financial man, and another a local government expert, while the chief Commissioner should have an executive mind and plenty of driving force. As to the chief Commissioner's requirements I entirely agree, but I point out that there will be no need, say for the next four or five years, at any rate, to have a local government expert at Canberra. Local government, as I know it, has proved to be effective because it has been able to furnish the people living in particular municipal areas with those services that are essential to their health and comfort, such as light, water, and sewerage. The Commissioners, if appointed, will not be called upon to direct the provision of these services at Canberra, as they are already there. They have practically been completed by the existing Departments. </para>

                            <para>-  I quite agree with that, but the provision for connexion with them is there. I recently had the opportunity to view the Cotter Dam and the reservoirs at Stromlo and1 Redhill. The water service is laid on to many places in Canberra, and the only work remaining is the laying of the reticulation pipes, and this is not work requiring the services of a local government expert. The same thing applies to sewerage. The bulk of the work has been done, and all that remains is the linking up of the various areas with the main sewer. This work also does not require the supervision of a local government expert. If nothing had been done in those directions, I could understand the contention that it is essential at this particular stage to have three Commissioners, one of whom must be a local government expert; but I cannot agree with it, in view of the substantial progress that has been made with these works. I have no wish to jeopardize the future of Canberra, as I am very interested in it. I was once absolutely prejudiced against the place, but after four visits my former anticipations were dispelled by personal observation, and I am now convinced that Canberra has a reasonably good future before it. In many ways I was surprised to find that it was such a fine place; but we shall need to be very careful in our expenditure there. If a Commissioner is appointed, he will have every opportunity to avail himself of the services of men who are at present acting in an advisory capacity at the Federal Capital. On financial matters the Commissioner could have the advice of. the financial experts among the Depart?' ments of the Commonwealth. The main thing is to have a Commissioner with an executive mind, with the ability to take up the reins of government and to drive along the administration of the Territory. At all events, for the next three or five years we should hesitate before incurring the expenditure that would be involved by appointing one permanent Commissioner and two others to act in an advisory capacity.

                        <para>.- After listening to the debate, I have concluded that it is necessary to appoint a Commission to control the Federal Territory. The very fact that w.e expect large revenues from that Territory, which comprises 1,000 square miles of land, makes it appear inevitable that the control of that area should be placed in the hands of a capable Commission free from parliamentary  influence. The cost of the proposed Commission is excessive, and should he lowered. In looking through the Bill to discover a means of eliminating at least some of the cost, naturally the first solution that presents itself is a reduction in the membership of the Commission from three to one. At first I thought it possible to obtain the services of a man capable of doing all the work required of the Commission, but having heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> -who opened this debate, and having carefully considered clauses 14. and 17 of the </para>

                            <para>- We require men with the training necessary to enable  them  to cope with the various phases of the work. The business aspect of it could be dealt with by a trained accountant, but tq .control and administer 1,000 square miles of land, we would need ' a man with a knowledge of irrigation and land development, and capable of leasing land at its proper value and drawing up the necessary regulations. It would be impossible . to hand that work over to, say, a construction engineer, who might very well deal with water, electric light, and other schemes. With a Commission composed of three experts an immense benefit would be derived by the exchange of their opinions. The future development of the Federal Territory will result in substantial revenues, and for that reason it should not be a one-man show. Even if the best man in Australia were appointed as Commissioner, it would not be very long before all sorts of complaints would be levelled at the Commission on the ground that it was a one-man show. For these reasons I support the appointment of three Commissioners. When the Committee is dealing with clause 7, I should like the Minister to give an indication that the fees of the other two Commissioners will be kept as low as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - We are about to institute at Canberra something in the nature of a new and very comprehensive department. It is proposed to create a permanent head of that department and to give him the services of two alleged experts on all matters that may crop up in the Territory. What is the position to-day regarding the control of large cities of the Commonwealth? Generally speaking, in such cities the head of the local council is the Lord Mayor, who is,, associated with a number of unpaid councillors. In addition, there is a well-paid council clerk. I presume that once the Commission is appointed, it will immediately look round for and appoint an intelligent and well: equipped secretary. It will also appoint an engineer, an architect, and an expert in land matters at Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- Whether they are there or not, we shall find that the moment we appoint one Commissioner or three Commissioners they will simply act as a kind of council and appoint trained accountants, architects, engineers, and other experts and well-informed men to advise them in the administration of the Territory. The proposal to appoint a Commissioner will not necessarily mean that he must be an expert in any one line, excepting probably that he will have a strong personality, with, some idea of executive government and with plenty of driving force; but he need not be an engineer or an architect so long as he has the qualifications mentioned. The Commissioner, although depending to some extent upon his own knowledge, will act largely upon the expert advice of other people. I do not think that it would De better to have the two additional Commissioners, -even although they are to be paid fees, instead of being appointed as permanent full-time Commissioners. Three permanent Commissioners are absolutely unnecessary, because for every department under the control of the Commission a permanent head will be appointed, and around him a local staff, until, in time, we shall have in miniature at Canberra another complete form of government. As time goes on that staff, instead of being composed of a paltry 70 officers, as it is to-day, will reach 800 or more. I should like to know from the Minister what the Advisory Committee&gt; which has been frequently referred to in this debate, has done. So far as I am  able  to understand, I believe they recommended the Minister to hold Canberra lands out of use as long as possible ; but I am not quite ;sure on that point. The completion of the main outfall sewer at Canberra has been mentioned by honorable senators. They may not know, as I do, that the termination of that sewer is more than 20 feet below the level of the ground and that, none of the sewerage from Canberra will disappear by gravitation. It will all have to be pumped up at least 23 feet before it reaches the surface, and if it is to be spread over the surrounding country it will require to be pumped up at least 30 or 40 feet. The water supply is pumped up 800 feet from the Cotter River Into reservoirs, and reticulated thence through the Territory by gravitation-. </para>

                        expressed a wish to move, in the clause that has just been passed, for the reduction in the number of members of the Commission, but in my opinion that may best be done in this clause. The arguments advanced by the Minister, with regard to the danger of divided control of affairs in. the Capital city area, commend themselves to those who desire to have only one Commissioner . The two extra Commissioners will really be men selected for a special purpose, and they should be unnecessary. If the  Chairman  wanted the advice of an accountant, or an engineer-, or an expert on local government, he could engage one for a' great deal less than the fee3  which it is proposed to pay under this Bill. I believe that one man should have complete control. The other Commissioners should not have power to override the chief Commissioner in .making recommendations to the Minister as to the manner in which necessary works should be carried out at Canberra. The Government proposal would certainly make for divided control. I very well remember that when the Government of the day, ..a Labour Ministry, .were passing the Commonwealth Bank Bill, the present Minister for Home and Territories
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                        .fought determinedly for the principle of one-man control -for that bank. To-day he is fighting for an entirely different principle. I believe that all Government institutions should be under the control of one leading Commissioner. The Minister also referred to the constitution of the Murray River Waters Commission, and sought to justify the attitude of the Government by drawing an analogy between the constitution of this proposed Commission and that which controls the Murray River works. As a matter of fact the position at Canberra is entirely different. The Murray River Commission is acting on behalf of the Commonwealth and the three States interested - New South Wales, . Victoria, and South  Australia - in an undertaking  in which they are all financially concerned. I have no desire to delay the Bill in Committee. I believe it will pass as it is. We know that the Government are anxious to find work to do to keep the Senate busy. If I had my way I would pass this measure as quickly as possible and oblige the Government to introduce some really useful legislation.

                        <para>.- In the Mandated Territory of New Guinea very important problems have to be solved, but considering that the present Administration has been in control for less than three years it has done splendid work. Any one who expects immediately to have perfection in an Administration which has to solve problems that have never before been submitted to any individuals or body of men must be disappointed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Taking everything into consideration splendid work has been done by those in control. The work has been so satisfactory that a perusal of the financial position occasions one very great surprise. On looking through the statistics I find that the record is better than any under the German régime, which in itself is a tribute to the manner in which affairs are managed. The year after the present Administration took control a loss of £6,000 was incurred, and I am assured that the figures of the last financial year will disclose a balance in favour of the Administration, or at any rate show that the revenue has been sufficient to meet the expenditure. When we come to other matters affecting the welfare of the Territory - nothing affects the welfare of the Territory more than the care of the natives - it must be admitted that the Administration has done good work. I found on inquiry when visiting the Territory last year that the Administration, with the aid of its Medical Department, had worked wonders in the prevention! and spread of diseases amongst the native races which had during the term of the German Administration decimated, in many instances, almost whole tribes. On New Ireland, where it was proved that the population had decreased by 50 per cent. in twelve or fourteen years, under German rule, the population showed an increase. The population of the Territory consists of about 1,000 whites, spread over a large area - one can travel for  thousands of miles and still be within the Territory - about 1,800 Asiatics, and 232,000 enumerated natives. There are probably 250,000  unenumerated  natives, because, at present, only the edge of the Territory has come under the direct control of the authorities. The island of New Britain, where the Seat of Government is established, is not, with the exception of the coast-line and a few miles inland, under the ' complete control of the Administration. In the interior the natives are still following primitive and barbaric customs, and the work of penetration can only be carried out by patient work, with due regard to the interests of the native population and the conservation of the interest of the tribes. As work of such an important nature will take many years to accomplish, the honorable senator. is somewhat premature in submitting the motion. . The white population there will have to increase considerably before it is necessary to create an Advisory Committee or .a Legislative Council. There are certain things in the Territory of which I do not approve, but on which I shall not touch at this juncture. We cannot expect perfection. It is, however, imperative that the Minister in charge of the Home and Territories Department should  use  his influence as speedily as possible in the direction of removing from the Territory any one whose presence is detrimental to its progress. It is no place for a " dud." Every officer of the Public Service there should be a man with an ideal. We cannot hope for any expansion or progress' without the aid of the native population, and the eventual development depends entirely upon the manner in which the native population is dealt with. It is essentially a black man's country; and it is very gratifying to find that ' the natives are working more willingly and in happier circumstances than under, their former masters. I learnt a few days ago that, during the last year, the medical branch of the Administration has been performing splendid work. It has very fine offices, and in the bacteriological laboratory valuable research work has been undertaken with such success that over 30,000 cases of hookworm were cured last year. When the present Administration assumed control, 90 per cent, of the total population was affected with this disease. </para>

                    <para class="block">On New Ireland, lying to the north-east of New Britain, the natives were regarded as the most degraded race in the Pacific. Notwithstanding that, I can vouch .that to-day a picnic party could go to any native village along the north-eastern coast of New Ireland, and have a comfortable picnic party, without the slightest fear of contamination through dirt. -1 have not seen any villages in Australia so clean and well conducted as those on the north-east coast of New Ireland. This happy position  i3  attributable to the very fine work done by Colonel Walstab when in charge of that particular district. He is absolutely firm in his treatment of the natives, but they know that, although he is firm, he is absolutely just. If we can secure the services of such men to perform administrative work in the Territory, I shall have no doubt whatever in regard to its ultimate success. We are holding the Territory in trust. It is not our property. The League of Nations, in its wisdom, offered a Mandate over this Territory to, the Australian Commonwealth, and we accepted it. Australia was more or less  compelled to  accept the Mandate, because of the strategic importance of the Mandated Territory. It, therefore, appears to be imperative that the Administration should do all that it can to justify the confidence that has been reposed in Australia by the League, of Nations. Should that confidence be betrayed at any time .Australia will run the risk of losing the Mandate. It is regrettable that certain persons in Australia, and in the Mandated Territory, have endeavoured to discredit the work of the Administration. The other day I heard a statement that made" my blood boil. The brief opportunity that I had of looking into matters personally, on the spot, convinced me that such happenings as were alleged would be impossible under the Administration. It is not claimed that crime could not be perpetrated, but it is a fact that immediately knowledge of its commission reaches the Administration every effort is made to sheet it home to the offender and bring him to justice. There is one matter that should receive the very careful consideration of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Under the terms of the Mandate the first duty imposed upon the Administration is to do all that it can to improve the social, moral, and physical well-being of the native population. A clause of the Mandate insists that no intoxicating liquor shall be supplied to any of the native inhabitants. The coloured man, whom we do not regard as being on the level of the white man, is, by the customs of the Territory, placed on a higher pedestal than we would place any white man ; he is told that he must not take any intoxicating liquor, and that, if it is found in his possession, or he is proved to have taken it, he will be placed in the native calaboose, and yet he is permitted to handle it. It, behoves the Minister to see that drastic steps are taken to prevent the infringement of the terms of the Mandate in respect  to that matter. The day may come when we shall have to consider the establishment of some body to assist the Administration,; but, taking everything into consideration, the Administration has proved eminently successful and satisfactory, not only to Australia, but to the League of Nations, and at the present time it does not appear to me to be necessary to take the action mentioned in the motion. </para>

                            <para>- Let the honorable senator furnish ail the information be can.- I consulted amongst others the secretary of the Returned Sailors- and Soldiers' Imperial League at Kavieng <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Carter),</inline> the secretary of the Civil Service Association at Rabaul, and every other -white person I came across. It was on the information of British people only that I formed my opinions. I made an effort, by means of a question I asked fo-day, to induce the Minister who led the delegation to New Guinea to produce the document presented to him from the Civil Service Association at Rabaul; but so far that paper has not been produced. To-morrow I propose to submit a motion asking for its presentation. It is not sufficient for me to look at it at the office of the Home and Territories Department. I wish it to be laid on the table of the Senate, and later on to be printed. From that document we shall be able to ascertain, not the opinion of honorable senators supporting the Government who -visited New Guinea, but the views of the members of the Civil Service Association at Rabaul. Notwithstanding the assertion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> I maintain that that association is seething with discontent. That is the only impression to be gathered from a perusal of the document that was placed iri the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> a copy of which, I believe, was also given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline></para>

The document clearly indicated that the members of the Civil Service Association at Rabaul were highly displeased, particularly with the Administration, the way in which the bungalows were made available, .the fact that  they had  no trial by jury, and the fact that their complaints were ignored by the Administrator. As a matter ot&gt; fact, they have no representation at all. Most, if not all, of them are returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>-Not the Germans. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GRANT.</inline> - There are only  a. few Germans. The total white population - men, women, and children - numbers about 1,200. I gathered from the people that times were strongly in favour of having some kind of Committee- that would meet periodically at Rabaul so that it could, after conference, make representations to the Administrator with a view to ensure that, when regulations were made by the Minister at the instigation of the Administrator, the residents would at least have some voice in framing those' regulations. Probably the Committee would not be able to meet more than once in three: months, but that would, I believe, satisfy them. I do not know how many white people there are on the mainland of New Guinea, which is almost as large as Victoria, but - 'I do not suppose that the total would be more than 150. It should be .remembered that the residents are not only returned soldiers, but are mostly native-born Australians, who have been accustomed to exercise a voice in the affairs of the country in which they live. </para>

                            <para>- A careful examination of the list of Bien employed in New Guinea during the past three years will show that a considerable number of them, for one reason or another, have had to leave the Territory. A number of them told me that they were afraid to make complaints, and did not care for their names to be used ; ' a man who has been somewhat physically incapacitated as a result of the war does not find it easy to obtain a position in the south. I notice by reports in the daily press of thi3 city that some hundreds of returned soldiers are unable to obtain any employment, and, considering the hardships they have to' endure in New Guinea, I regard them as underpaid. Th§ wages do not average Wore than £1 per day, and we should not forget that it is recognized as necessary for their wives to have a holiday in the south for three months in every twelve. The men themselves are not made of iron, and the enervating climate makes a trip southwards occasionally very desirable in the interests of their health. I understand that they have to pay the return -fare, as well as their expenses when in Australia, and the salary they receive is not more than sufficient to enable them to make ends meet. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw that remark, and say that there is another important body operating in New Guinea, known as the Expropriation Board, and I do not regard the employees under the control of that body as being subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. These men are doing strenuous work. They are entirely removed from the two or three important centres of population in the Territory, and for that reason alone undoubtedly ought to be given some voice in framing the regulations under which they are controlled. In no part of the Commonwealth are the people refused a vote in the election of their representatives. Even in Papua, just across the mountains of New Guinea, the white residents have the right to "elect at least some of the members of their local Legislative Council. But the very same type of men and women on the north-east coast of New Guinea have no voice whatever . in their country's affairs. </para>

We have been informed by him that under the benevolent guidance of General Wisdom, the balance was about £6,000 on the wrong side of the ledger. That was in the year before last, as1 last year the accounts balanced. The Administration should not have the additional right to tax a man's income. </para>

I draw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> attention to the fact, that, instead of addressing himself to the point of order, he is making statements which are not relevant to it. The point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> was whether a discussion on the Expropriation Board was relevant tq the motion before the Senate. As I understand it, even if a Committee were appointed, it would have, under the form .. of local government which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has asked to be established in New Guinea, no power or authority over the Expropriation Board, not even in an advisory capacity; I rule that the honorable senator's remarks referring to the Expropriation Board are not relevant to the subject-matter of . the motion. - </para>

The plantations are worth more than £5,000,000. The present price of copra is about £26 per ton, but the moment the price goes up the value of the plantations automatically increases. A number of employees are engaged in the copra industry, which is the only one worth mentioning in New Guinea. Even a brewery has not yet been established there. The industries other than that of the production of copra are negligible. I made an effort some time ago to ascertain from the Government the financial position of the Board. Did I get an answer? No. Did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> back me up in my request? He did nothing of the kind. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> likes to make inquiries of a casual and courteous character in the right quarter he will find that the' Commonwealth Bank has a big overdraft on account of the operations of the Expropriation Board. </para>

The Board is under the control of the Administration, and we cannot consider the affairs of New Guinea without considering the operations of the Board. In his statementSenator Pearce did not put the position fairly and squarely before the Senate. I do not say that he wilfully or deliberately refrained from doing so; but I should like the Government, at the earliest possible moment, to produce the balance-sheet of the Expropriation Board. </para>

We should teach the natives there to speak English, and to some extent we are doing that at the schools at Kokopo and elsewhere. The object of the Administration should be to teach the natives to speak English, to give them to understand that the country belongs to them, and after a time that the white man may go further south to a more suitable climate.  I  would not, however, advocate the immediate withdrawal of the white people from New Guinea. </para>

                    <para class="block">It has been held by the High Court that "reasonable ground" should be interpreted to mean that' the Postmaster-General in determining whether he has reasonable ground to suppose that any person is engaged in any of these pursuits, is exercising, not a judicial or merely Ministerial function, but a discretion. That decision leaves it entirely free for the Minister, if he believes that any such undertaking is being carried on in opposition to section 57, to issue an order prohibiting the  carriage  of mails to any such individual or institution. The Act itself was passed in 1901, and the section referred to was inserted among its provisions for the express purpose of prohibiting the carriage of letters to the lottery then existing in Tasmania, and known as Tattersall's. The representatives' of Tasmania in the Senate opposed section 57, holding, of course, that it was an unfair discrimination against a State that had legalized this lottery, and also that the provision itself was not within the four comers of the Constitution. The constitutional point has never been tested, but there is extreme doubt whether, if it were, the Government would have the right to refuse to deliver letters ' to an institution legalized by the law of a State. I am not going to argue that point now. I am not approaching this subject as one who believes in gambling. On the contrary, I advise every 'one not to gamble at all. I do not gamble myself. I very seldom have a ticket in Tattersall's, and I feel quite sure that if  opposition to this Bill were represented by the number of honorable senators who are not patrons of Tattersall's, it would be very slight. Tattersall's as a lottery was legalized first -in Victoria, but eventually the people of this State arose in righteous indignation, passed legislation, and Tattersall's had to remove to New South Wales. It flourished there for a little while until New South Wales passed similar  legisation,  and Tattersall's was forced to move to Queensland. The people of that State in their tura became self-righteous, and banished the institution, which eventually found refuge in Tasmania. </para>

At the present time the State Treasurer has the right, under the same Act, to license any. number of lotteries, provided the necessary deposit is lodged with the Treasury. I do not think it is likely that others will do so, as one organization there is  sufficient.  Let us see what Tattersall's i* worth to Tasmania and to the Commonwealth, which holds up its hands in horror at the thought of s\ich  an evil, but, nevertheless, calmly sends the tax-gatherer to collect revenue from the organization every year. The Commonwealth Treasury goes further. It makesTattersall's its agent for the collection of. the tax on the 'prize money which it distributes, and to this extent the Federal Government are virtually partners in this so-called illegal and discreditable business ! I have with me a document, prepared in Tattersall's office, giving, the figures up to 1923, and I can assure honorable senators that it is .quite reliable. I find that since 1904, following7 the death of George Adams, the founder of the institution, Tattersall's has paid to the State of Tasmania in taxation the sum of £1,735,000. I find, further, that this " illegal " institution has contributed! of its ill-gotten gains no less a sum. than £514,279 to the Commonwealth Treasury.. </para>

                            <para>- I should say it is worse than that. What is the annual value of this institution to Tasmania? This document shows that last year Tasmania collected £201,875 in taxation from Tattersalls. A substantial portion of that money came from the other States. </para>

                            <para>- Probably 80, or even 90, per cent, of it came from New South Wales, and perhaps some came from the honorable senator who has just interjected. Last year Tattersall's  contri.buted  £110,000- in taxation to the Commonwealth, so that it is a fairly profitable institution for the Federal Government. </para>

                            <para>- Judging by the honorable senator's reputation I do not think he would touch gambling, unless, of course, he were certain of a very large profit. If he were quite sure, perhaps he would not hesitate sometimes. It is remarkable how some men who refuse to put ls. in a sweep or lottery, or 10s. on a horse race, will go all over the country looking for the very best speculations in land, and take the unearned increment if they can get it. Thus there are various forms of gambling. </para>

                            <para>- But let me return to the subject-matter of the Bill. Is the holding of a lottery immoral ? I do not think it is any more immoral than is drinking in moderation. Gambling is not necessarily immoral. As a matter of fact, we gamble every day of the week. We gamble in land. </para>

The gentlemen whose names I have quoted are worthy representatives of the denominations to which they belong, but they are very illogical, as this institution was established in Tasmania in 1897 under the law of the State, and very few of them now raise their voices against its continuance. If this evil is to be curtailed or abolished, these gentlemen should approach the State Parliament and ask their representatives to repeal the Act under which it was created. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Too profitable. In a small State such as Tasmania, with a population of only 215,000 people, an annual revenue of from £215,000 to £220,000 is obtained from this institution, and the question of its abolition requires very serious consideration before any one dares to move in that direction. In Melbourne a race meeting is held nearly every day, and horse-racing is a greater evil than Tattersall's, as a man goes to the race-course with <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> £10, or £15 in his pocket, and, if he loses £5 at the outset, he chases it with the balance of the money, and eventually very often comes home without funds. In some instances it is even worse, because a man can bet upon credit, whereas under this system it is necessary for a bettor to put up the hard cash before he can obtain a ticket. I am not a very strong advocate of Tattersall's, and if I were a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, and the State could finance itself without its assistance, I would favour its abolition. I am not an advocate of gambling. </para>

                            <para>- It managed to struggle along, but its population has not increased in proportion to its financial responsibilities. Tasmania, in common with other States with a small population, is in an unfortunate position. The young men, particularly, who arc unemployed in Tasmania, catch the boat to the mainland, where they are more likely to find work in the large cities. An honorable senator interjected that the Queensland Government abolished "Tatts" 20 years ago ; bub another Government in that State established a consultation known as the" " Golden Casket." I am not conversant with the conditions under which it is worked, but I understand that the whole of the proceeds are paid- into Consolidated Revenue. </para>

                            <para>- That is a special consultation conducted in the name of the Treasurer, and the Government have not the power to prohibit the carriage of letters so addressed. Probably I shall be told that the " Golden Casket " is a State institution, and that the Federal Government cannot, therefore, prohibit the carriage of letters directed to it. The injustice, however, still remains, because an institution in one State is allowed to carry on its operations, while another, in Tasmania, established under Statute, is not allowed too receive communications through the post. The Commonwealth issues postal notes and post office orders, and the whole business is carried on as efficiently as if the Government consented to carry the letters. What is the result ? Thousands of agents have been appointed, all over Australia, who collect money from patrons, which is forwarded through the banks, and eventually reaches its destination. The patron, however, has to pay a commission on the tickets purchased, and in the aggregate the amount is considerable. Not only do the patrons pay 8 per cent, to the agents who collect contributions, but I have known of a case in which an agent made a client who won a prize contribute a considerable sum for collecting it. The present system leaves the door open to a host of men who render no useful service to the community, to make a profit out of this institution. That is wrong. Let us be honest. If the institution is an evil one, let us abolish it, but we should not shut our eyes to the fact that contributions are being despatched to it. In order to prove that I am not wholly actuated by a desire to perpetuate the evil, I shall show patrons that it is not altogether a profitable investment to purchase a ticket. The cost of a ticket to subscribers living beyond Tasmania varies from 6s. to 6s.- 6d., including all postage, agents' commission, &amp;c. Taking 6s. 3d. ' as the average, we find that taxation and charges absorb 2s. 9d. of this amount, leaving only 3s. 6d. to go to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> prize fund, as shown by the following figures: - </para>

Although it is not a sound commercial transaction so far as clients are concerned, the Federal Government have no right to take up the attitude that it is an illegal institution, by passing legislation to prevent the despatch of contributions through the post office. Not only do they collect revenue indirectly, but' they also become partners, and get the institution to become their agent for the  collection  of the Federal tax. The principal reason that actuates me in moving for the removal of the embargo against the carriage of letters is not because it is a gamble. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I do not think it would be worse for the Government, to take the whole of the proceeds than it is for it, as a partner, to take only a portion. Tasmania would certainly be better served if the lottery were run as a State institution. I do not think the Tasmanian Legislature would agree to make a State lottery of it, as has been done in Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- The nationalization of gambling is not part of the platform of the Labour party. I preach the gospel of work. I do not try to encourage any one to endeavour to get something for nothing. I move the motion because I believe that at present we are acting hypocritically. The Federal Government says it does not believe in gambling, and therefore will not carry mails to Tattersall's, yet it is a partner in this immoral undertaking. I leave the matter in the hands of the' Senate, and trust that it will decide to wipe out this anomaly that has existed since the inception of Federation. I have read the debates that took place when the Post and Telegraph Bill was before Parliament in 1901. That measure was in charge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who was then Postmaster-General. This section would not have been agreed to but for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who was then Prime Minister, whipped up his followers and told them that, if it were not passed, the Government would resign. Consequently it was carried, but the majority in favour of it was not very great. </para>

                    <para>.- I bring to the notice of the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> a question raised recently in Hobart regarding the training camp at Fort Nelson. Some of the trainees were taken before the police court for absconding from the camp. The reason they gave for their action was that there was insufficient food in the camp. I would not have taken much notice of a mere statement by the boys but for the fact that the magistrate who tried the boys was evidently so impressed by it that he stated that a Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire into the matter. I advance no opinion as to the truth or otherwise of the statement, but I should like the Minister to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> so that he may make inquiries and ascertain the facts of the case. </para>

                    <para>.- Last Friday I questioned the Minister representing the Treasurer regarding the operations of regulation 89k and 89l of the Repatriation Department. The replies which I received did not satisfy me. I hoped that they would contain a promise of more sympathetic administration and an observance of the spirit that is supposed to underlie the  regulations. I do not pose as a champion of any particular branch of returned soldiers, but as I appreciate the services that have been rendered by these men, and am anxious to do all that I can to see that no want or distress is experienced by partially incapacitated soldiers in any part of Australia if it can be avoided, I bring the matter to the notice of the Senate. The first question I asked related to the number of applications received under those regulations, and I received the reply that under regulation 89l there had been 584 applicants, while only 62 applications had been granted. </para>

                    <para>The large number of rejections is due to the fact that many persons ineligible under the particular regulations gazetted apply as soon as a new benefit is promulgated. ... In Regulation 89l it is stipulated that " the Commission take into consideration as income earned any amount which the soldier should be receiving as earnings from the occupation which his disablement does not debar him from following." </para>

                <para class="block">It would be interesting to ascertain the. number of instances in which applications were rejected when the occupations that could have been followed were not available. I desire to refer to that aspect of the matter most particularly. The regulation provides that the Commission may take into consideration the amount that the partially incapacitated soldier would have earned had he followed the occupation for which he was fitted. I have had brought to my notice the case of a soldier who lost one arm near the shoulder, and also had a gunshot wound in the leg. He has no trade or profession, and is unfit for anything except such work as lift driving. That work is not available to him. If it was the intention of the Department, when framing this regulation, to give the necessary assistance to these unfortunate men - many of whom are married - surely the request that I made in my second question is reasonable. That question was whether the Minister would approve of instructions being issued that the allowance under regulation 89K and <inline font-style="italic">89l</inline> should be paid where the Deputy Commissioner for Repatriation, the State Board, or the Commission, as the cass, might be, was satisfied that the applicant was unable to do any available work and could only undertake employment that was not available to him. -If a satisfactory reply had been given to that question, I should not now be speaking. It was pointed out in the reply of the Minister that that attitude could not be adopted by the Department. I should like to know_ the reason. Surely if discretion is given to . the Board or the Commission to render additional assistance in the case of .a. man who, through incapacity, is compelled to leave his work' to such an extent that his service is of no value to his employer, the same consideration should be shown where a, man is able to follow a particular occupation, and one only, and that occupation is .not available to him. </para>

                    <para>. -  I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to the fact that, according to a two-column article in the evening <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> there are between 300 and 400 returned men in the city of Melbourne who are unable to secure any employment whatever. I do not say that the Minister is responsible for this state of affairs, but it is a deplorable circumstance. Some of the men are, no doubt, not quite normal, and they may have lost their employment on that account; many of them, however, are apparently in perfectly good health, and it is a. standing disgrace to the municipal councils, the State Governments, and particularly the Federal Government, that conditions should exist involving the unemployment of large numbers of returned men throughout the Commonwealth. To some slight extent, perhaps, the returned men themselves are to blame. I think that they should not confine their attention entirely to efforts to secure their own betterment, bub should take a wider view and try to effect a general improvement in the conditions of employment, since many who are not returned men are now without work. </para>

                <para>It seems to me that the Government might well consider the advisability of bringing in an amending Bill to enable the Repatriation Commission and the War Pensions Department to deal more effectively with the applications coming forward for pensions, especially for incapacitated men, who under the Act are unable to obtain any degree of satisfaction. I am sure that every member of the Federal Parliament has had cases of this kind submitted to him, and no matter what steps are taken the law does not permit of any further financial assistance being given. The people generally are willing that the Government should make the necessary provision for such cases, and the time is certainly opportune to review the legislation in regard to these pensions. Our sailors and soldiers had no hesitation in responding to their country's call several years ago, and having done so they now find it move difficult to obtain employment than it would have been had they remained in Australia. </para>
