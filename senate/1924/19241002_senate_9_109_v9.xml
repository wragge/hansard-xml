                        <para>.- The title of this bill will probably lead some honorable senators to overlook certain of its features. The measure will seriously affect quite a number of public servants, who have given good service to the Commonwealth. Many persons believe that if economy in the administration of the departments can be effected by a reduction in the number of public servants, nothing else matters very greatly. My belief is that it ought to be possible for changes to be made in the Public Service without inflicting very serious hardship on individual members of it. Clause 2 of the bill provides - </para>

                        <para>Section 12 of the principal act is repealed, and the following sections are inserted in its stead :  - "12a. (1.) If, in consequence of any alteration effected by any Act passed during the year One thousand nine hundred and twenty-four in the law relating to income tax payable under Commonwealthlaw, there is a decrease in the work involved in the collection of that income tax so that, at any time prior to the thirty-first day of December. One thousand nine hundred and twenty-five, the services of any officer of the Taxation Branch, or of any officer transferred to the service of a Stateunder an arrangement made in pursuance of section four of this Act, are no longer required, that officer may, subject to this section, be paid compensation in accordance with this Act upon his retirement from the Branch or Service (as the case may be) as a direct consequence of the decrease in work. " (2.) Compensation shall not be paid to any officer retiring from the Taxation Branch or from the service of a State unless the Public Service Board certifies that there is no office in the Service of the Commonwealth to which the officer could be suitably transferred. </para>

                    <para>That, on its face, appears to be a perfectly fair arrangement. We should, however, examine the matter closely to ascertain what is likely to occur. As honorable senators are aware, some time has elapsed since this amalgamation was effected, and certain officers who were transferred from the Commonwealth Service have taken up duty as state officers. It is natural to assume that those officers will be retired from the Commonwealth Public Service, as the whole of the business is being done by state officers. That, at any rate, is the case in New South Wales. What will happen to those Commonwealth officers? In many cases they have been receiving in the state Service higher salaries than would have been paid them had they remained in the Commonwealth Service. Under this bill, when it becomes an act, they will receive compensation unless the Public Service Board certifies that positions can be found for them within the Commonwealth Public Service. Members of that Service are always anticipating trouble, because they have so frequently encountered it. These officers fear that they will be offered a position that, in respect to salary and conditions, will not be on0 an equality with what they at present hold, and if they decline to accept the position offered, they will be retired from the Commonwealth Public Service without receiving any compensation. They very properly think that the positions offered should be on an equality with those which they now hold, or that they should be equal to the positions which they would have held had they continued in the Commonwealth Service, and so have been eligible for promotion to any vacancy that occurred. I hope that, in committee, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will give to this claim the consideration that it merits, and guarantee security and satisfaction to those who will be affected. </para>
                    <para class="block">I realize that the principle involved is not a big one, but it nevertheless requires to be ventilated. There is no warrant, in a bill of this or any other description, for inflicting the slightest injustice upon any person. In making changes to effect economy in the collection of taxation no one is anxious that the whole brunt of the saving shall fall on the men who are doing the work. I hope that the Minister will see his way to add a proviso to clause 2 providing that when the change takes place officers of the Commonwealth Taxation Department will either receive other  positions in the- Commonwealth Service at salaries commensurate with those they now enjoy or not be deprived of compensation, because they are offered positions which they must refuse on the ground that the salaries attached to them are lower . than those which they are drawing in the service of a state. The Minister may be able to assure me that these officers are amply protected, and that the amendment I suggest would' unnecessarily load UP the bill to provide for a danger that is unlikely to occur. He will see, however, that men in the circumstances I have outlined may suffer hardship. I do not know whether this bill will receive much detailed consideration in committee. It must be passed, because the work covered by it has been already carried out, and because it is inevitable that retrenchment should follow the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments. </para>

                        <para>. - It waa my intention to take advantage of the opportunity this bill presents to lay down for the guidance of honorable senators a scheme for national taxation, but I think I can do that more effectively on the Income Tax Assessment Bill when it comes before us than on a measure which merely makes provision for the compensation of certain officers formerly employed in the taxation office. I again enter my emphatic protest against the expenditure of a large sum of money annually to carry out the fatuous idea of taxing people in proportion to the amount of service they render to the community. I cannot imagine anything more foolish and more likely to lead to trouble, and prevent- people from being industrious than the old world fashion of taxing people in proportion to the" services they render to the community. The sooner that method of taxing is swept away the better. I am pleased that in his report the Income Tax Commissioner has drawn attention to the fact that he has been compelled to purchase costly calculating machines, for the purpose not of collecting more revenue from the taxpayers, but of carrying out the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The purchase of these machines, which is a dead financial loss, is only typical of the very large volume of work that has to be done in order to carry out the provisions of the act. However, as the Government has found it necessary to introduce at least four amending measures dealing with the collection of income, tax, ample opportunity will be afforded to me to submit to honorable senators some of my ideas on taxation, which I hope will meet with their approval. </para>

The position is governed by the words, " to which the officer could be suitably transferred." Officers of the Public Service are graded, and it cannot be said that one is suitably transferred if he is tran fer red  to a vacant position in a lower grade than he formerly held. The meaning intended to be conveyed by the words is that an officer must be suitably transferred having regard to his grade or division. Already a large number of officers have been transferred under the provisions of the original act, and in no case has one officer been transferred in the circumstances which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> fears may arise. </para>

                            <para>- He would probably be suitably transferred in view of the fact that the amount of compensation payable would be based on the salary he was receiving as a Commonwealth officer. I do not know that many men are likely to be transferred under the conditions outlined by the honorable senator. As the agreement affects the officer as a Commonwealth servant, and continues to affect him, although he has become a state officer, regard might be paid to his existing salary and grade at the time of his transfer, but I cannot say definitely that such will be the case. The purpose of the bill is mainly to deal with returned soldiers who have not had the opportunity to pass examinations. I do not think that the circumstances feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> can arise, but if they do a suitable transfer will most likely be a transfer at the existing salary or something approximating to it. -It is not always .possible to get absolute equality. My information is that the meaning of the words " suitably transferred " is a transfer having regard to the division and grade in which the officer was employed. </para>

                        <para>. - This measure deals with a method of raising taxation to which I take exception, but as it is to provide some remissions, I do not know if this is an occasion on which I should protest against an entertainments tax generally. If an opportunity were afforded to abolish this form of taxation, I should move in that direction. If there is one form of taxation more than another which should be left to state governments, it is an entertainments tax. As the present Government is not sufficiently enlightened to go to the one true source of revenue - the values created by the people and given to the land - it naturally falls back on other systems, some of which are objectionable. The Australian workers to-day are so enlightened that if they were asked directly to pay, say, the £36,000,000 which was raised from Customs and excise duties last year out of their earnings, they would object. </para>

As I may not get another opportunity during this session to express my idea of the way in which we should meet our national debt, and as the money to be derived under this bill is to meet some of the interest on our debt, perhaps I may be permitted to suggest how our war obligation could be met without imposing additional taxation upon any one. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Instead of imposing an entertainments tax, I suggest that the Government direct the landowners in Australia to value their land - informing them that a land tax would not. be imposed upon it, but that if they undervalued it, it would be resumed by the Government, if it so desired, at 10 per cent. above their valuation. By this means the value of the whole of the privately-owned lands in Australia could be tabulated, and the Government could then impose a tax on the increased value which' would accrue to those lands thereafter. If that were done the debt would be wiped out in less than twenty years. When I state that in respect of the municipality of Sydney, a comparatively small area, there was, in three years, an increase in valuation, representing an unearned increment of no less than £4,500,000, it will be seen that the application of this principle to the whole if the privately-owned lands in the Commonwealth would result in an enormous revenue for the Government.  I  appeal  to the Minister to drop these petty methods of taxation. I always feel exceedingly sorry for the unfortunate blind man holding out his little tin box for the collection of pennies from a benevolently-disposed people. The position of the Commonwealth in connexion with this entertainments tax likewise inspires pity. Why should the Commonwealth hold out its little tin box for the collection of pennies from all who patronize picture shows, theatres, or outdoor forms of amusement? I rose particularly to express my disapproval of this method of taxation. ]it should be 'beneath the dignity of the Commonwealth to be continually calling upon people to put their pennies into the box in order to help the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I endorse the remarks of my  leader  and protest against the continuance, by the Federal Government, of taxation of amusements or sports. I am opposed to all forms of class taxation. The entertainments tax is a vicious tax for which there is no justification. It was imposed during the war, when the Government was .obliged to reach out in many directions to obtain more money to finance its tremendous obligations. When it was imposed there may have been, and probably was, some justification for it, but there is none to-day, and I was hoping that it would be repealed during the present session. In every community there are two types of the average parents. One denies, as far as possible, all forms of entertainment to their children; the other, on the contrary, endeavours to provide as much entertainment foi' the members of their family as' possible. They patronize picture shows and theatres, and a considerable number of them, being a sport-loving people, regularly attend football and cricket matches, races, and other forms of outdoor sport. For so doing,, they are called upon to contribute to the revenue. If the money that will be lost by the repeal of the tax is required to carry on the services of the Government, the burden should be laid on all sections of the community, according to their means. The amusement and sport-loving section of the community should not be singled out for taxation. I have no objection to the bill, but I protest against the continuation of this unfair system of taxation. </para>

In dealing with this question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the scheme, laid down many years ago by Russel] Wallace. That gentleman, as has been the case with many other statesmen right down the ages, was afraid to tackle those persons who were best able to pay. As a way out of the difficulty, he suggested that those who possessed land should be permitted to retain it, but that from a certain date the added value given to that land by the presence of the community should be annexed for communal purposes. That suggestion has frequently been used to get away from the real question at issue. It is both inequitable and impracticable, as any one who has studied the question knows. In New South Wales there is an excellent system of local taxation. No matter what the location, or size, of an estate, the owner must pay annually towards the local revenue a uniform rate per fi, irrespective of every other consideration. That principle underlies any decent system of land value taxation. It underlies the present progressive land values tax. </para>

                            <para>- I express my en-' tire disagreement with the statements of Senators Hannan and Gardiner as to the proper method of taxation. Personally, I am opposed to the  income  tax altogether, as it is a tax upon industry - a penalty imposed upon the most worthy citizens in order to shelter those who are well able to pay. The benefits of this measure will be almost microscopic. Certain forms of amusement are no longer to be subject to taxation, but the reduction involved is so small as to be scarcely perceptible. I agree with other honorable senators that amusements should be exempted from taxation. I consider that it is wrong to tax a man because he visits a picture show, a theatre, or the races. To the extent that it proposes to reduce taxation, I approve of this bill. In the troublous times' through which we have passed there might have been some justification for the imposition of this tax. The Labour party was responsible for suggesting this method of raising revenue for Commonwealth purposes, although the act was, I think, passed toy a Nationalist Government. This form of taxation should 'be abandoned at the earliest possible moment. Recently we were informed that the revenue of the Commonwealth for the financial year just ended was more than sufficient to cover expenditure. That being the case, one would ha-ve thought that the Government would take steps to reduce taxation. That has been ' done, but only to an almost imperceptible extent. No tax should be levied on a ticket admitting to amy amusement which costs less than 5s. It would be better if the tax were levied on tickets costing 10s. or more. I shall support the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> to repeal the act altogether. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill brings back old memories. This form of taxation was first imposed by a Labour Government in 1916, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> was Treasurer. At that time a big fight was put up against the imposition of this tax on the lower- priced entertainment ticket, and since then some measure of relief has been granted by different Governments. I remember moving an amendment to exempt tickets costing ls., but, unfortunately, I was not successful. The tax has, to some extent; been evaded by amusement promoters charging lid. for admission to their entertainments. T agree with other honorable senators that this is a wrong form of taxation. Why should a few people who organize a dance,  or a bazaar, to assist some charitable object, and who know nothing about this tax, be afterwards brought before a court and fined for not paying it? It is an outrage . on the freedom of the people. I believe, however, that certain forms of amusement are fair game for the taxation authorities People who are prepared to sit all night upon .the footpath to purchase tickets to enable them to gain admittance to an entertainment which may cost them 5s. or 10s., should be taxed to a greater extent than they are to-day. The tax should be a graduated one, and should not apply to any ticket costing less than ls. 6d. </para>

                            <para>- I have suggested1s. 6d. as the lowest-priced ticket which should be taxed. The popular1s. ticket certainly should be exempt. The Minister has given notice of an amendment which, to  a  certain extent, will remove the present inconsistency. I see no provision in the bill to remove  Tattersall's  sweeps from the sphere of taxation. Instead of those sweeps being handed over to  a  State Government to be taxed, they should be exempt from taxation altogether. I remember that when the original bill was introduced some years ago we fought for days and nights over its provisions. At the next election campaign an honorable senator, who is now a state Minister, tried to make the people believe that I was in favour of the imposition of  a  tax on tickets admitting to picture shows. I challenged him  to  resign his seat in the State Parliament, offering to resign mine also, and contest the . electorate with him, but the challenge was not accepted. Although I voted for the imposition of the tax, I endeavoured in committee to have it reduced, but was not successful. This measure of relief, small as it is, will  be  welcomed by the taxpayers. The value  of  this tax to the Commonwealth is very small, and considering the heavy taxation that is levied in other directions, the Government should abolish it. </para>

In any case it will probably not be sufficient to counteract the loss of revenue which will follow if the amendment is carried. The committee should not do anything which would have the effect of destroying the balance of the budget. No one can say that substantial remissions of taxation are not proposed to be made during the current year. The amount which it is intended to remit is greater than many persons anticipated that it would be, and there is disappointment in some quarters because of the generous nature of the Government's proposals, and the fact that they have been so well received in the country. </para>

If carried, it will result in the retirement of many officers who are employed in the Taxation Department, but I presume that  they can be absorbed in other departments. We need not, therefore, have any fears in regard to their welfare. The Entertainments Tax Act, from its inception, has been a source of very great annoyance to the Income Tax Commissioner. It has involved, and it still involves, an immense amount of unremunerative printing and the employment of a large number of officials; but, above all, it is a tax that falls with regularity and unerring accuracy upon the poorer section of the community. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true. We are all aware that many persons attend picture shows and other forms of amusement. Whenever they do so they are compelled to pay the tax that is provided for by the principal act. Sometimes the amount is Id., at other times it is  ½d.,  that each person has to pay. It should never have been imposed. The act was passed on account of the dense economic ignorance of the members of the Federal Parliament at the time. I hope that to-day there is a great deal more enlightenment amongst honorable senators. The Commonwealth has the right to levy taxation in any direction that it chooses. This, unfortunately, is one of the means that it has adopted for swelling its revenue. Many persons believe that the field of income taxation should be entirely abandoned by the Commonwealth and left wholly to the various states. With that I am in complete accord. The relief which this bill proposes to give is so slight as to be scarcely perceptible, but failing the acceptance of the amendment I shall support the measure. It is most humiliating for the Income Tax Commissioner to be obliged to collect a small sum from every patron of a picture theatre. The bill gives us an opportunity to abolish the entertainment tax, and I hope that honorable senators will avail themselves of it. It is quite true that the Treasurer's sources of revenue would be curtailed if the amendment were carried. I think that last year approximately £500,000 was obtained from this tax. But, having regard to the fact that the revenue was greatly in excess of the expenditure, and bearing in mind also that during the current year we may confidently expect to receive a very much greater amount in Customs revenue than was received last year, it can be safely assumed that the Treasurer would not be inconvenienced to any extent if this tax were remitted, as the total revenue would still be more than sufficient to meet the expenditure. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill is supplementary to the Dried Fruits Export Control Bill, to which the Senate agreed yesterday. It proposes to levy on all dried fruits exported a charge which is equal to the levy now raised voluntarily by the whole of the dried fruit producers of Australia. It is estimated that a levy ofd. per lb. on 30,000 tons of dried fruits will provide about £35,000, which should meet the working expenses of the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, and the cost of advertising and marketing the dried fruits. In fixing this charge the Government has been guided by the experience of the Australian Dried Fruits' Association. As honorable senators have already discussed the whole question on the Dried Fruits Export Control Bill, I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything further at this stage. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether he has any information to the effect that those who are directly concerned in the exportation of dried fruits have expressed their approval of the proposal to tax the volume of fruit exported. It is rather a good idea that the cost of administering the bill should be defrayed by those engaged in the dried fruits industry, but it is not quite clear from this bill whether the whole of the cost will be met by the export levy. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that the bill has not been made sufficiently wide to include the whole of the dried fruits of Australia. The other day we passed a very comprehensive measure dealing with the production of butter all over the Commonwealth, but the benefit to be derived from this bill will be confined to practically one section of producers of dried fruits. Overproduction has also been experienced by the people who are engaged in drying apples and peaches in Tasmania, and I see no reason why the machinery of this bill should not be extended to include them. The Minister may assure me that it can be done in the future, but I take this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that another section of dried fruit producers is also in need of the assistance afforded by this legislation. In the course of his marketing scheme, will the Minister keep in view the need for extending help to the people engaged in producing dried apples and peaches ? </para>

                    <para>This bill is being introduced in consequence of a recent judgment of the High Court in the appeal of <inline font-style="italic">Cameron</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Deputy Commissioner of Taxation,</inline> Tasmania. The appellant had returned his live stock at a value which was less than the departmental standard value. The Deputy Commissioner assessed him on the basis of the departmental standard values. The appellant appealed to the court for a judgment that his values were the correct values, and the Supreme Court of Tasmania upheld the appeal. At the same time the appellant's counsel raised the contention that the departmental standard values were invalid and unconstitutional, because the regulations had prescribed different values for the various states. This contention was coupled with another, viz., that if the departmental values were invalid and unconstitutional, live stock could not be brought to account in any income tax return for the period from 1st July, 1917, to 30th June, 1921, because no valid values for stock had, in fact, been . prescribed as required by the act. The points of law were referred by the Supreme Court of Tasmania to the High Court, which upheld them. The effect of the judgment on past assessments was as follows :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Assessments for the years - 1915-6, 1916-7, 1917-8.- Live stock on hand at the beginning and end of each year should be brought to account in the returns at market values. 1918-9, 1919-20, 1920-1, 1921-2.- Live stock on hand at the beginning and end of each year should not be brought to account at any value. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In the first three years the application of market values would operate with great severity on live-stock owners because market values were on the upgrade, and any legal obligation upon taxpayers to return their stock at market values would mean that owners would have paid income tax on the great increases in values which were then evident, notwithstanding the fact that numbers of the stock were actually lost in succeeding years through drought, or other kindred adverse conditions. In the next four years, the exclusion of live stock from the returns would mean that all owners would be thrown upon the cash basis for purposes of their assessments. This would mean that if a breeder of stock sold animals at a high price he would be taxed on the total sale price without any deduction in respect of the value of the stock in the previous year or years. Such a position would have been crippling and perhaps ruinous to many live-stock owners, particularly to those carrying on in a comparatively small way. The Government, therefore, considered it absolutely necessary to take such action as would save the revenue from unnecessary loss through refunds arising from purely technical grounds, and, at the same time, would give live-stock owners the opportunity to have their past assessments maintained or amended to a market value basis for all years; as they might elect. The bill therefore, provides that in respect of all past assessments from 1915-6 to 1921-2, both inclusive, live stock not disposed of at the beginning and end of each financial or trading year, shall be brought to account at market value, if the live-stock owner so elects within four  months after the bill becomes law. If the owner does not so elect, the bill provides that his past assessments shall be deemed to be correct, valid and effectual. Taxpayers who wish to be assessed on the basis of market values are to be required to send written notice to the Commissioner, of their election of that basis within the period of four months mentioned. The bill provides that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron,</inline> who took the case to the court, shall retain the benefit of the judgments of the courts on the particular assessment covered by his appeal, and that he shall have the same right of selection of the basis of his other assessment as the bill grants to all taxpayers. The question has been raised that all live-stock owners, who had objected to their assessments for reasons similar to those in the Cameron case, should also be dealt with in accordance with the judgment of the High Court in that case. It has been pointed out, however, to persons who have raised that issue, that if the bill provided that the judgment of the court must be applied in all of these cases, it would probably cause some, or all, of the taxpayers concerned to pay additional income tax through being thrown on to the cash basis for their assessments. In such circumstances they would be taxed on the whole of the proceeds of their sales without any deduction from those proceeds in respect of the value of the stock sold, which had arisen in previous years when the stock was acquired or bred. It was therefore considered safer, in' the interests of the taxpayers concerned, to limit the judgment of the. court to the assessment which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron</inline> had brought before the Supreme Court of Tasmania in his particular appeal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron,</inline> as stated, will have the same right as other taxpayers to elect whether all his other assessments shall be amended so that his live stock shall be brought to account At market value, or at the values upon which he had actually been assessed. The foregoing information will bring under the notice of honorable senators the fact that this legislation, although it deals with a case in which the High Court has declared invalid a certain method of the Taxation Department, does no injustice to any tone, but may relieve some from hardship and increased taxation. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> placed the facts of this matter fully before the Senate. I should like to know how many persons will be affected by the decision of the High Court. It appears that the act was so vaguely drafted that one taxpayer, who was a little more astute than others, brought the matter before the High Court, and succeeded in defeating what the Government believed to be a valid provision of the act. I am not at all in favour of retrospective legislation. This bill is considered necessary because an act was so carelessly drafted that one taxpayer was able to get the court to support his contention. Instead of endeavouring to validate a wrong, the proper course to adopt was. to make the necessary refunds to taxpayers. I understand that the amount would be fairly substantial, but the sum in question is not at issue. When Parliament passed the measure it was thought that its intention was conveyed in unmistakably clear language, but a taxpayer took his case to the court, which decided that, as he was in the right, ho was to be relieved from paying the tax imposed. If that is so, those who paid the tax, possibly under a threat from the Commissioner, should have the amount paid refunded. I understand certain taxpayers are to be dealt with somewhat differently because they threatened to take action. </para>

                            <para>- I appeal to the Government to introduce an amending bill at the earliest opportunity to repeal this vexatious legislation. Any one engaged in farming pursuits, in raising livestock, and generally increasing the wealth of the community, has sufficient hardship to undergo without being harassed by additional taxation. Thousands of persons actively engaged in these industries find it necessary to employ assistance in order to protect themselves against the Commissioner, who compels them to pay fines every year. I would welcome the introduction of a bill to entirely exempt from income taxation all those engaged in primary production. It seems utterly absurd that persons who increase their flocks and herds should be pounced upon every year by the Commissioner and fined  in proportion to the value of the service they render to the community. The cost of wool, meat, and other products is increased, and everything possible is done to make it uncomfortable, unpleasant, and costly to those engaged in rural pursuits. I do not know how long the Government intend to adhere to this system of taxation'. Fortunately this section of the Income Tax Act was set aside by the Supreme Court of Tasmania and the High Court, but apparently the Government is determined to minimize the effect of that decision as much as possible. The time is opportune' for a review of the position. Commonwealth finances are in a healthy state, and since the revenue from Customs will continue to increase, no matter what may be done, there should be no necessity to tax the incomes of those engaged .in primary production. It is a  mo3t  harassing tax and should not be tolerated for a moment. I am surprised that honorable senators who are, or have been, engaged in primary production, should vote for the continuance of a measure of this description. </para>

                            <para>- That is all I wish at the present moment. The proposal' to tax a primary producer on the increases in his live stock is a pernicious one. Unfortunately we have deliberately laid it down in our legislation that any primary producer who dares to increase the number of his live stock will be immediately pounced upon by the Income Tax Department every year and taxed in proportion to ' the industry he displays in bringing about an increase of his flocks and herds. It is an entirely wrong scheme of taxation. </para>

                    </list><para>It is well known that hundreds, if not thousands, of people who should furnish returns fail to do so every year, and evade the tax. The right system of taxation is a tax on land values, without graduation or exemption, returning to the community the full value given by the community to the land. That is the proper system of taxation. Unfortunately, it has been carefully avoided by this Government. At the present time we are collecting only a paltry £2,000,000 a year from that source, and as a result the Government is obliged to levy a tax on the people who patronize picture shows, theatres, or attend race meetings, and other forms of outdoor amusement. I enter my emphatic protest against the continuance of the system of taxation laid down in this bill. In imposing it we slavishly followed the system which has been in operation for so long in Great Britain. I have looked through the records, and I have failed to ascertain when this infamous tax was first imposed in the Mother Country. It is now one of her main sources of revenue, and, apparently, because it had been imposed it must be levied on the people in Australia. The time has gone by when Australia should follow the example of Great Britain in taxation measures. It has been a complete failure there. The wealthy people are becoming wealthier, and they are certainly not becoming poorer in Australia. It is a most objectionable tax. We go to the trouble of passing legislation to encourage the exportation and marketing of fruit, meat, and other commodities, and then, under legislation of this nature, we make careful inquiries about the incomes of people who engage in the business and tax them accordingly. This is a direct tax upon industry, and would not be tolerated for one moment in a' community in which everyone understood the principles of taxation as laid down by Henry George. Unfortunately, the system of income taxation appeals to a large number of people. In conversation with a gentleman the other day, I said that I felt that the burden of income taxation must fall heavily on some people. He replied, " I had to pay £5,000 myself last year." It is difficult to arouse sympathy in the mind of a person who can afford to pay that large sum as a tax on his income. Usually the exclamation of the person to whom such a remark is made is, "I wish I were in your position." Every £1 that we take from a person or a company by way of income taxation is £1 removed from production. No question is of more importance than that of taxation. Every bill introduced into this chamber - whether to give preference to Canada, to control the export of dried fruits, or to impose a duty on manufactured sulphur - if analyzed carefully, will prove to have been a bill devised to make the other fellow pay. While it is not generally understood, it is nevertheless  a  fact that the moment we take from  a  man, or  a  company, money by way of income tax, we deprive him, or it, of the opportunity of investing that money in directions which would provide employment, and establish new industries, resulting in benefit to the country. I do not agree with the idea frequently expressed that a government can spend money better than an individual can. In some instances a government, or a municipality, may be able to do so, but the people generally prefer to spend their own money. In Sydney, recently, there was a painful procession of people who marched down the street, ten abreast, to hand in their income tax returns to the authorities there. This form of taxation is especially injurious to our primary industries.I ask the Government to consider the hardships endured by stock-owners in the Northern Territory, and the other portions of the Commonwealth, when droughts and other unforeseen calamities overtake them, and to wipe out entirely the provision in the act enabling the commissioner to tax these persons on the increase of their live-stock. </para><para>Amendment negatived. </para><para>Clause agreed to. </para><para>Clauses 2 and 3 agreed to. </para><para>Clause 4 - </para><quote>

                    <para>Until 1921 the salary received by the Auditor-General was £1,000 per annum, but in that year an. additional £500 was placed on the Estimates as an allowance, in view of the decreased purchasing power of money between that time and the time when the salary of £1,000 was fixed. It is thought to be undesirable that the Auditor-General should be dependent for his salary or allowances on an annual vote placed on the Estimates. It is felt that his salary should be fixed by an act of Parliament, so that it will not be subject to annual review when the Estimates are being prepared. That is the only purpose of the bill. </para>
                    <para>Senate Grant. - Is the Auditor-General required to pay income tax on his salary? </para>

                        <para>- I understand that he is. This organization, representing a very important industry, not only in New South Wales, but throughout the Commonwealth, is absolutely opposed to preference being granted to Canadian newsprint manufacturers. It has put forward facts and figures, that I think are so important that the Senate should hesitate before it agrees to include newsprint in these preference proposals. This matter was dealt with at the annual conference of the association held in Perth in October, 1923. The conference was supplied with figures showing the, imports of newsprint by the Commonwealth for the previous five years. Those figures: afford a very clear indication of. the trend of the Australian trade in newsprint. Many persons in Australia are prepared to grant preference to the United States of America rather than to Great Britain. I am not one of them. I should rather grant preference to Great Britain. The action of the United. States of America in imposing a poll tax upon. Australians who enter that country, and its refusal to admit more than a certain quota annually, are to me entirely distasteful, and I would not grant any preference in its case. It may be said that this proposal does not embody the granting of preference to the United States of America. Any one who has studied the matter, however, must have realized that in Canada to-day there are many natives of the United States of America, and a very large proportion of the money invested in paper mills in Canada is American money. Although this is professedly a preference to Canada, actually it is a preference to the United States of America. I am not at all satisfied that Australia will be able to send very many commodities to Canada, and I do not think that we can send very many to the United States of America. The return which I have regarding the imports of newsprint is as- follows :  - </para>

                <para class="block">Those figures indicate to me very clearly that the imports from the United Kingdom are substantially increasing, whilst those from Canada are considerably decreasing. The Provincial Press Association comprises persons who are directly concerned in this matter. They are engaged in the very useful work of disseminating throughout Australia the most reliable news, and their views should be given consideration.

                    <para>That theAustralasian Provincial Press Association adheres to its policy, viz., that, with a view to seeing trade developed with the Mother Country, as well as. in preventing a monopoly of the newsprint trade in Australia, first preference, should be given to British-made newsprint. </para>
                    <para>That for these and following reasons, members of the Australasian Provincial Press Association are opposed to preference being given to Canadian newsprint by the Commonwealth Government. </para>
                    <para>That without affording any benefit to Australian consumers, preference to Canadian newsprint would seriously interfere with, if not destroy, the British newsprint trade with Australia. </para>
                    <para>That preference was given by the Commonwealth Government to help the United Kingdom and its paper industry. If now, preference be given to Canada, Britain will not be able to sell newsprint here. Canada, on the other hand, can always successfully compete in this market without preference. </para>
                    <para>That the present preference to Britain has resulted in an increase of newsprint imports from the United Kingdom of from 14,547 tons in 1921 to 32,011 tons in, 1922. </para>
                    <para>That Britain is able to supply the needs, of the Commonwealth with the whole of its newsprint requirements, and is relying on its nonpaper producing portions of the Empirefor her export market. </para>

                        <para>- Efforts have been made to take the preliminary steps to manufacture newsprint in Australia, and no doubt Australia will later on manufacture newsprint; but, in the meantime, it is dependent on supplies from abroad. Despite all the efforts made in various directions, Great Britain supplied Australia in 1922-3 with £857,564 worth of newsprint - practically half our importations of the article. It is probably quite true that the great bulk of the pulp used by British manufacturers comes from Norway and Sweden. </para>

                        <para>- It comes partly from Scandinavia and partly from Canada; but the process of manufacture is completed in Great Britain. The people who control the manufacture of newsprint took very full advantage of the conditions which existed during the war. Although the price fluctuated to a certain extent, it went up to an enormous figure. It is the opinion of people who are associated with the sale and use of newsprint that 91 per cent, of the capital invested in Canadian mills for the manufacture of newsprint has been provided by the United States of America. As a matter of fact, 95 per cent, of the product of these mills goes into the United States of America. Therefore, while it is proposed to give a preference to Canada, it is actually giving a preference to the United States of America as against Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. He has informed me that 91 per cent, of the capital in the Canadian mills is American capital, and that 95 per cent, of the product of the mills goes to the United States of America. .1 do not suppose that there is any other man in the Commonwealth better informed on the subject than is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shakespeare.</inline> The proposal to give a preference to Canada on the off chance that we can send some of our products to tha dominion to the advantage of our fruit-growers and others, will not have a very far-reaching effect, except that it will seriously inconvenience many people, and at the same time injure the exportation of newsprint from the United Kingdom to the advantage of the United States of America. If any preference is to be given it should be given within the Empire. I do not regard preference within the Empire as the cure for all evils, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. However, the preference proposed to be given to Canada, in the matter of newsprint is really a preference to the United States of America, and for that reason I am not prepared to support the motion. </para>

I am distinctly and completely opposed to the Commonwealth extending trade preferences of any kind to ' the Dominion of Canada, because, on the figures available, Canada imports only lj per cent, of our exported products, while we import 18J .per cent, of Canada's exportable surplus. It is apparently the desire of the Dominion of Canada to extend its secondary industries, and under the proposed agreement we shall give preference to Canada's secondary products, while she will give preference to our primary, products. </para>

                        <para>- I am entitled to express my opinions without interruption, and I remind the honorable senator that this is a solo and not a duet, and his instrument is very much out of tune. I would prefer to be without his assistance. Australia can progress, and our population substantially increase only by extending our secondary industries. In the countries in which secondary industries are established and fostered the population has always rapidly increased, whereas in those countries where agricultural pursuits are chiefly followed the rate of progress is comparatively slow. During a period of 100 years, when" the people of Great Britain devoted the most of their time to agricultural pursuits, the population increased by only a few  millions, but when Great .Britain became a manufacturing .country fah© number of inhabitants increased from 8,000,000 -to 37,000,000 during -a similar period. This clearly indicates that secondary industries are 'largely instrumental in increasing population. If Australia is to progress in the way we all desire, it will be necessary to secure the advice of experts from other parts of the world to assist us in establishing new secondary industries, and to suggest means where'by those already in existence can "be extended. 'Commonwealth and State Governments as well as private firms have sent their officers to other countries to '-become acquainted with the most improved methods of manufacture, and  if  that policy were extended our industries would be developed to such an extent that there would 'be .no occasion to give preference to Canada in an endeavour to obtain markets for our surplus production. To show the difference in the volume of trade between Australia and Canada and Canada and Australia, I may mention that the average value of 'Canadian goods imported annually into Australia over a period .of Eve years was £3, 600., 000., whilst the average value of the goods exported .annually from Australia to Canada .during the same period was only £400,0.0.0. We are seeking additional .markets -for our surplus primary (produce, whilst Canada .is finding .additional outlets for her secondary products. Canada is sacrificing the interests of her primary producers to benefit secondary industries. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Pratten),</inline> in submitting this motion in another place, said., M Our primary producers may expect too much -from the concessions which we have gained from Canada..1" The .words of the Minister suggest that Australian primary producers are likely  to  make a sacrifice dm &gt;order ito improve the secondary industries in Canada. Evidently the Government -are not sure  of  the -outcome of the concessions proposed to 'be granted, er they would .not have .'any $ea&gt;r of what oar primary producers would say. , under the .proposals embodied in the agreement, concessions will actually be granted to America, and not to 'Canada, as many of the manufactories in that dominion are controlled bv American capita-lists. ^Canada is 'to grant Australia preference on fourteen items, and Australia is to grant concessions to Canada on twelve items. According to information at my disposal,, 'Great Britain -takes about 90 per cent, of our -exports of the articles mentioned in the agreement, and although 'Canada takes only an infinitesimal portion .of the remaining 10 per cent. , w.e are to give her preference over the Mother Country. If concessions are to be granted, increased preference .should be .given .to Great Britain, which has done so much to protect and assist Australia. During the war., some of the Canadian industries which we now propose to assist charged excessive prices for some of the commodities we obtained "from that country. Canadian manufacturers of newsprint, for instance, imposed such excessive rates that provincial newspaper proprietors and others found it difficult to continue in business. Notwithstanding the huge profits made at our expense, we are now asked to give additional preference to 'Canada. During the financial yeal' 1921-2, taking the main items in the agreement upon which Canada offers Australia preference, excepting tinned fruits, tinned vegetables, pears, and honey, Great 'Britain purchased £12,900,000 worth, and Canada only £68,000 worth. Canada did not purchase from us .such -products as .lard, cheese, .tallow, dried fruit, .glue, .and beeswax . Most of 'our .importations! of general goods came from Great Britain, and it is evident .that Canada is to be given preference at the expense of .Great Britain. Is it fair to give preference to 'Canada, particularly on newsprint.? .Not only are many of the Canadian .factories .owned and controlled by American capitalists, but Americans <inline font-style="italic">axe</inline> actually regulating the prices of some of -our products, hath primary .and .secondary, in .consequence of the manner in which they manipulate the markets. The firm .of -Swift and Company is operating in Australia, -and controlling the price .of many of our meat products. .According to the figures quoted by the Minister for Trade and Customs, we give preference to Canada to the extent of £200,000 or more per annum, but the value of the preference which Canada gives to Australia,, the Minister said, could .not be estimated - probably because all the advantage is on one side. The .Minister also said that ' the agreement provided .an excellent opportunity fox the entry into a large and profitable market, of which it is hoped our primary exporters will be able to tate full advantage." Although this hope is expressed, it may reasonably be assumed that Canada will derive all the benefit. The most important item in the schedule deals with newsprint. It is well known that British and Australian interests have been endeavouring to establish that industry in Australia with the object of utilizing Australian timber. The Minister, in another place, stated; definitely that he was not in a position to say what advantage Australia would get out of this preference to Canada on. newsprint. He believed that it would not result in an increase in the price but he could not say that, as a result of this proposal, Australia would be able to get newsprint more cheaply than at present. This matter is of very great importance to the Australian people. The preference given to Canada of £2 10s. a ton is very substantial, and, unfortunately, it will seriously affect British trade with Australia  in  newsprint. According to figures furnished by the management of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers the freight on newsprint from Great Britain represents about £100,000 a year to the line. If the preference is effective, and Canada secures the trade, that revenue will be lost to the line, because we have no Commonwealth steamers on the Canadian run, and newsprint from Canada will be shipped to Australia in Canadian liners, which are not always, manned by European crews. Representatives of the paper trade section of the Australian Association of British Manufacturers, in a circular sent to all members of the Commonwealth Parliament, have made an urgent appeal on behalf of the British manufacturers. This is not the association referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> M. Shakespeare, whose name has been mentioned in connexion with this debate, had been sent to Great Britain for the purpose of obtaining agencies for British paper. </para>

Preference to Canada in newsprint will mean a loss to the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers of about £100,000 a year in freight on British paper, audi the advantage given  to  Canada will enable manufacturers there to fight British Manufacturers for the Australian trade. The circular states that there is no truth in the assertion that Canadian competition in the Australian trade will affect chiefly Scandinavian manufactures. As a matter of fact Canadian paper will come into competition with the British paper, and because of the advantage given to Canada, the Motherland, which has done  so  much for the dominions, will be unable to retain the trade. Altogether this is a  very  high-handed proposal, which will not meet with the approval of the people of Australia. They should be consulted by referendum. This is one of  the  most important, subjects that could engage their attention, and they should certainly have an opportunity to voice their opinion in a constitutional manner. Since the Government has not the confidence of the people, it has  no  right to enter into an agreement of this nature. The circular states further - </para>

                        <para>- Am ' I to understand that this statement made by the paper trade section of the Australian Association of British Manufacturers is incorrect? It is stated definitely that representatives of the association have not had an opportunity of appearing before the Tariff Board. If that is correct, then the report of the Tariff Board can have no value. We are further informed by the association that, in respect of the assertion that British newsprint is 65 per cent, foreign material, if an inquiry be held, evidence could be submitted to prove that Empire materials and wages represent 80 per cent, of the United Kingdom selling price of the product. If the statement of the association is not true, the Minister should deny it. The circular contains the following paragraph: </para>

                <para>I do not connect the expression " political blackmailers " used by the Prime Minister with matters of trade preference to other countries. I am firmly of the opinion that when he made use of that term he was referring to the Country party, which was forcing upon the Government legislation for which there was no warrant. If the association of British manufacturers considers that the term was used in connexion with trade preference, T do not agree with it The circular continues - </para>

                    <para>Co-operation has been initiated between England and Australia for the manufacture nf  newsprint  in Australia. Australians are now on route to England to secure necessary technical help and capital. If, unheard by Tariff Hoard or any one else, the British paper trade (in " news," in printing papers, and in writing papers) is to be caused irremediable damage iti favour of Canada, then the seeking of suggested capital in England for extension of Australian paper making will be prejudiced very seriously. </para>

                <para>Here, again, we see evidence of the " clutching hand," which this time is working on behalf of the paper mills in Canada. Those mills are practically the property of residents of the United States of America, who. know that the introduction into Australia of  £10,000,000  of British capital to make paper from Australian-grown materials would mean the loss of their trade. They have succeeded in obtaining, from an Australian Government, a guarantee against any losses which they might incur in fighting the British investor, who is endeavouring to advance the interests of Australia by manufacturing in this country the newsprint which we . require. This association will not appeal to me in vain to do anything that I can to prevent these outside interests from operating to the detriment of Australia.  I  am an Australian, and believe that everything that can be manufactured in Australia should be manufactured here. Let us put up the same" barriers that Canada has erected against the importation of manufactured articles into her territory. She has created high tariff walls, which effectually debar the entry into her country of Australian iron and steel. All machinery and other goods which Canada uses, and which require iron or steel in their manufacture, must be made of Canadian steel. In Australia we have some of the finest steel in th, world, but because of the barrier set up by Canada, none of it finds an entrance into her territory. The whole of the iron and steel work required for the North Shore Bridge at Sydney should be manufactured in Australia. It will, however, not be made here, but will be imported from another country, in opposition to the desires of the people of Australia generally. In South Australia we have a great mass of iron ore, which- would meet our requirements for hundreds of years; and at Newcastle, in New South Wales, we have great works close to the coal-fields which can produce all the  steel  that is required in Australia. Why do we not make better use of these iron deposits and factories? It  is  because of these foolish preferences that we give to manufactured articles from other countries. People who desire to invest their money in industries in Australia will not do so unless they can see a reasonable return for their investment. In connexion with the construction of a cruiser for the Australian Navy, the Government said that if it would cost  £1,000,000  less to purchase the vessel from Great Britain or Japan than to build it in Australia, it should be purchased there. The  £1,000,000  that would be saved by purchasing the vessel outside Australia  would be lost to this country in other ways. The money would have to be borrowed, and for the first year we should have to pay about ?126,000 for the right to use the credit that would be granted to us. We would receive no money, but bank credit only. Instead of being paid in gold, we should have to take goods in payment. We cannot demand gold, yet the United States of America not only demands it, but gets it. The cause of the slump in British manufactures is that her gold must be exported across the Atlantic. If we were to say that every steel article required in Australia must be manufactured in Australia, from Australian steel, we should be doing something to advance the secondary industries of this country. We should follow the lead of other nations which have prohibited in their territories the use of any manufactured goods but their own. Unless we do that, we shall have no chance of competing with them, and Australia for all time will be a "wood and water joey" for the other countries of the world. To maintain her place among the nations of the world, Australia must strike out in the direction taken by other countries. </para>

I have, in the interval, perused the report, and it clearly shows that the board is absolutely opposed to the granting of this preference. We can trade with Canada only in currants and raisins, and om the price that the Canadians are receiving in the United States of America for their currants and raisins, that trade is absolutely of no use to Australia.

                    <para>The defeat of Imperial preference meant a win for American paper interests. Their representatives in Australia would now be able to bring off a successful deal. Their agents, A. L. Dawe and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Willison, had been in close consultation with the Australian Government, and cables from Australia to Canada indicated that the result of the mission had been favorable, and that the Australian Government would not delay working out the commercial treaty with Canada. </para>

                <para class="block">That clearly shows who is going to benefit. The granting of preference to Canada in respect to paper practically means giving a concession to America. A commission from a great British paper-making factory visited Australia. It was accompanied by experts in the business. It inspected the Tasmanian timbers to ascertain whether they were suitable for pulp-making. Its report was  couched  in favorable terms. The Tariff Board informed it that there would be no interference with the British trade. On its return to England, the paper-making works were enlarged in anticipation of the trade that it was expected would be done with Australia, and arrangements were also made for the establishment of a factory in Tasmania. If this preference is given to Canada, 26,000 British workmen will be thrown out of employment, and a sm'aller number will obtain employment in Canada. Since the war, every country has been responsible for overproduction of almost all commodities, and the world's markets to-day are so crowded that preference will confer no benefit on Australia. Australia can grow as good a prune as any country in the world, yet the value of its imports of that fruit from Canada ' is almost ?'1,000,000. Raisins and currants are the only fruits that we can send to Canada. Reciprocal trade means that each country shall be placed as nearly as possibly on an equality in its interchange of exports and imports. That will not be the case with Canada and Australia under this agreement.

                    recently stated publicly that -while dn i Cam ada as a delegate to the Empire Press Conference, he visited the paper -making districts, . and was informed that (the &gt;prdce of newsprint f.o.b. mills, was -3| cents per . lb. He asked for paper,, and the reply was that the . mills did not . supply  any now,, but . that the selling was &lt;gi-ven ; to another . company, and that the . price  would -be . a little more than -the 3£ cents. When -he -went to the Canadian Export (Company, which was -the selling company,  he was informed that the price would be
                    <inline font-style="italic">: &amp;i</inline>
                    cents. He asked who was the Canadian . Export Company., and he was assured that it was the mill-owners under  another name. In the course of conversation he discovered that . 3$ cents w.as a big . price at the mills, but that they should not -ask for more, because the mill  employees would come out -for higher rates and the taxation would be heavy. Therefore- . they floated the -Canadian Export Company. On inquiry he found that the selling price was . 6$ cents ; but he was told that they could not sell -to Australia, and that lie would have to go to the packing company to obtain . supplies. He found that the packing company was . the same people under still another name. He was also told that the price for export to Australia was 12$ cents.

                    . a trade . journal, on 21st April, 1921, stated that of 50,000 employees engaged in the paper making industries '26,000 were out . of employment, and 1-6,000 were working half -time. It is well known that the British paper-makers give to their employees better conditions than axe enjoyed -by 'the workmen in Canada. They have made big profits, but a certain amount of those profits has been used for the benefit of -the workmen,, in the erection of model houses . and the establishment of model villages. The Yankee trust does not treat its employees in . that way. Australia should give preference to the British manufacturer . and the British workman. It is claimed that we could not exist as a nation without the protection of the British guns". Let us, then  make some return for that service. An ex-Prime Minister of Australia has said that by fjh'is preference it is intended to stab Britain in the back. I do not want to do that, . and I do not think that any other 'honorable senator does. If our actions are directed towards keeping the British workmen

That will . enable -us to build up our population rapidly and provide us with , a sufficiently large force to place in the . field should the necessity to do so arise. We are all agreed . that Australia's empty . spaces . should be filled. We shall not help to fill them if we continue to give large orders to other countries for manufactured -goods, and allow those countries to reap the benefit of the money that is raised in Australia. Unless an -outlet is found 'for the over-production that has -taken place throughout the world, the 'land that is now being utilized for primary production would have to be devoted to something else. We should build up -our population try manufacturing as much as possible in Australia, and keeping our workmen constantly employed.

                        <para>- While I was in Canada three deputations waited on me. I discovered that there was af eeling there that Australia had not played the game, and when I returned I made exhaustive inquiries into the position. I found in the files nothing to the discredit of Canada, but a great deal that did not reflect credit on certain people who have filled Australia with propaganda. Before we imposed a duty of £3 a ton on newsprint, Canada was doing a very large trade in. newsprint with Australia, but after the imposition of the duties that trade necessarily passed to Great Britain. It is just about time honorable senators realized the position. The newsprint manufacturers of Great Britain enjoy a preference of £3 a ton on the paper they send to Australia. A careful search of the figures shows that although Australia has given Great Britain a preference of £3 a ton on newsprint, no less than 170,000 tons of newsprint is imported into Great Britain each year, free of duty. </para>

In our efforts to find markets for Australia's primary products we have entered into this agreement with Canada. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> says the matter has been hurried. As a matter of fact, negotiations have been in progress for years. I think it is four or five years since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> visited Canada on the very same mission that I recently undertook,and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robb,</inline> the then Canadian Minister for Customs, paid a visit to Australia with the same object in view, and spent six months here while the last federal elections were in progress nearly three years ago. Therefore, the matter has not been hurried; on the contrary, every care has been exercised. Surely it is no sin to trade within the Empire. The policy laid down by theImperialConference was that everything possible should be done to develop trade within the Empire, and, although this agreement with Canada is merely carrying out that policy, the Government is condemned by honorable senators opposite. The longer I am in this Parliament the more I come to the conclusion that any old stick is good enough to whack the dog with. In submitting this motion I said that Canada had a certain trade with Australia, and that Australia's trade with Canada was in the nature of a gamble. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon</inline> certainlysaid that he did not think that we would ever be able to compete in the Canadian market, but he was not making allowance for any concession of1½d. a lb. in duty. That1½d. a lb, on raisins will make all the difference It will give Australia the opportunity to hop in and secure a share of the Canadian trade. TheGovernment has done nothing but what it considers is in the best interest of Australia. It had to secure markets, and when it had the opportunity to secure reciprocity with Canada it at once took steps to bring it about. When the Prime Minister and I were in Great Britain fighting for preference for Australia in the British market, did those people who represent the British newsprint manufacturers, and send printed documents to honorable senators in opposition to this reciprocal arrangement with Canada, do anything to assist us in our fight? We did not find any one very anxious to help us. to secure preference for Australian goods in Great Britain. The Government has been obliged to enter into this reciprocal agreement with Canada in order to secure markets for the production of the flesh and blood of those who refused to give us preference in Great Britain. I cannot mention the number, but there are many ex-British soldiers who have settled in Australia, and are having a very trying time. Yet Great Britain has refused to extend a preference to the dried fruits they produce. I know the day is not far distant when that preference will be secured. </para>

                        <para>- But the Australian Labour party has not done very much to help Australia to get it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> says that the only thing to do is to people Australia. I was delighted to hear him say so. We must people this country, but we must also market the stuff the people produce. If we are to relieve the position in Great Britain, where there is a surplus population of 2,000,000, we must find markets for the increased production that must follow in Australia. Speaking on the second reading of the Dried Fruits Export Control Bill, I said that it would be a long time before Australia could produce sufficient to meet Great Britain's demand for dried fruits. I was told that if we had no markets for the people we were placing on the land we ought to stop production. If we stop production we shall not hold Australia. It is a certainty that we cannot hold this country unless we develop it. Within the last few days we have seen the writing on the wall warning us to be careful, and warning us to people this country. This we can only do by developing it. But if we take people from Great Britain, and settle them on the land in Australia, the Old Land must do its share by giving preference within the Empire. We cannot push on with our production without finding markets. During the last few weeks we have done a great deal to find them. Great Britain has nothing to complain of from Australia's attitude. The preference we give to British manufacturers is worth £8,000,000 a year. Honorable senators opposite speak as if we were asking for an increased duty on dried fruits that would serve to increase the cost of living in Great Britain. We have not done so. Honorable senators opposite seem to have lost sight of the fact that Great Britain is not a free-trade country. We pay a duty of £1 13s. 8d. a ton on the currants, and £7 a ton on the sultanas and lexias we send to Great Britain. The Prime Minister did not ask Great Britain to impose a higher duty on dried fruits. He asked that the existing duties should remain, but that dried fruits produced within the Empire should be admitted to Great Britain free of duty. He was not asking for too much. We shall have to find a market for 32,000 tons of dried fruits. Personally, I think that if they are carefully marketed in Great Britain they can be disposed of. The market is there for them. I have already given the figures of Great Britain's consumption, to which the quantity we can supply is a mere bagatelle. </para>

                        <para>- No. I have already explained that it was never intended by Australia that cars made in the United States of America should come into Australia at a lower rate of duty than was imposed on Canadian cars, but owing to the " domestic value " tariff regulations that anomaly has existed.. It has now been remedied by a reduction in the duty so far as Canada is concerned. To that extent preference within the Empire has been accomplished in the reciprocal agreement, which the Senate is now asked to confirm. When a deputation waited on me in Ottawa, I asked them if they took exception to the preference given by Australia to Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson,</inline> the leader of the deputation said, " No, we admire it." There was openly expressed admiration from the representatives of the manufacturers of Canada at the stand Australia had taken in giving preference to Great Britain. They did not ask that we should remove it for their motor car trade. They were prepared to admit that they wanted the trade kept within the Empire. Their attitude was quite foreign to the attitude that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> would seem to think they take up when he talks about the United States money invested in Canadian manufactures. </para>

                        <para>- I could easily do so. I do not blame a man for " pushing his own barrow," but I think honorable senators should know that the gentleman who is so concerned in the question of newsprint is an interested party, and that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> statement he has made is an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> one. As a representative of the Commonwealth, it was my privilege to interview those engaged in the newsprint trade in Canada, and when I returned from that country I was able, from the information with which I had been supplied to make further investigations into the whole matter. In my official capacity I studied the whole subject, and came to the conclusion that a totally wrong impression exists in the minds of many people concerning the Canadian newsprint manufacturers. I have quoted the tonnage of paper imported into Great Britain free of duty, and the fact that Canada has been paying an import duty of £3 per ton on newsprint sold in Australia. The ramifications of these commercial transactions are of such an extent that it takes one considerable time to fully investigate and digest them. Notwithstanding the preference which is being extended to Canada on newsprint, I believe that Great Britain will still continue to do a considerable volume of business with Australia in this commodity. The paper pulp used in British manufactories is not of British production, but is imported from Scandinavia. Under the agreement, we are not extending any preference to Canada, but merely placing her on a basis of equality by allowing importations from Canada to come into Australia at the British preferential rate. </para>

                        <para>- British workmen are engaged in the factories. Apparently some honorable senators are under the impression that Canada is being used as a backdoor for the export of motor cars, newsprint, and other commodities manufactured in the United States of America. I visited a number of the works, accompanied, in some instances, by Ministers of the Crown, and concluded that the establishments were legitimate Canadian, concerns, and that the goods being exported to this country were of Canadian manufacture. Under the present rates of duty, an American Ford car can be brought into Australia for £1 14s. 8d. less than a car of the same make manufactured in Canada. By granting the preference embodied in the agreement, Canada will be able to compete with the United States of America on terms of equality. At present, Canada exports annually approximately £5,000,000 worth of goods to. Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No. Our export trade to Canada is valued at only £300,000. It will therefore be seen how difficult it was to enter into reciprocal trade arrangements when there was such a difference in the value of the goods exported from the two countries. Commodities of material value to us are of equal value to Canada, and Canada can increase her trade with the Commonwealth without any great harm being done to any one. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot, at the moment, give the retail prices in Canada of the articles specified in the schedule; but if any honorable senator cares to call at the office of the Department of Trade and Customs, I shall submit samples and prices of certain commodities I purchased at Ottawa, Montreal, and other Canadian cities. I believe sultanas are sold at 1s. 4d. and currants at1s. 2d. a lb. There is, of course, in Canada, as there is in other countries, a great difference between the wholesale price and that which the consumer pays. I followed up a line: of currants purchased in New York at 4¼d. a lb. wholesale, and ascertained that they were retailed at1s. a lb. The wholesale price of our currants in Canada, after allowing for duty, would be about 5½d. per lb. California will, of course, be our strong competitor, and. Australian producers must pack and market their goods in the best possible manner if they are to successfully compete with the Californian produce. The Californian producers will not lose their market if they can help it. </para>

Although we have given Canada the British preference rate on newsprint, if, in keeping with our protective policy, we can establish a paper-manufacturing industry, the Government will not hesitate to impose an additional duty on. British importations-. Canada would then bo placed on the same basis as Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, to the difficulty of securing, within the limit allowed by the act, tenders for the erection of homes for returned soldiers. The trouble is, no doubt, due to the increased cost of materials, and probably also to the increased cost of land. Widows and relatives of deceased soldiers are. being very seriously inconvenienced on account of the excessive costs of transfer and other legal charges. A case came under my notice recently of  a  widow who had lost two sons at the war. Desiring to become the owner of a war service home she. purchased a small block of land. Unfortunately for her, as it was under the old title in New South Wales, she was obliged to pay a preliminary fee of £3 and subsequently additional fees amounting to £11 18s. for the transfer of the, land from the old title to the Torrens title.  Her  case is typical of many others in New South Wales. One would have thought that the legal fraternity, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockmam</inline> is a shining example, would be satisfied with £1411s., but a further demand for £7 15s. 6d. has been made by the War Service Homes Department. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows very well that in the early days the South Australian lawyers did all they possibly could to prevent Torrens from putting through his title, and since then no effort has been spared by them to make the transfer of land as costly as possible. They charge £3 3s. for about five minutes' work. </para>

                        <para>- I shall certainly do so, because, in my opinion, the demands made are an outrage of the first order. The fees are exorbitant. I know what I am talking about, because the widow to whom I refer placed the matter in my hands, and I paid the fees on her behalf. This kind of business brings the department into disrepute. Many other matters in connexion with war service homes should also receive attention. The foundations for cottages are strong enough to carry palatial buildings. This, of course, means additional cost. </para>

The widow whose case I have mentioned has not yet secured her home. This delay is unreasonable. The whole business ought to be inquired into and action taken to ensure the transfer of land at a more reasonable rate. It appears to be the policy of the administration to "harass and fleece and inflict injury upon any one who attempts to become his own landlord. Legal charges, registration fees, stamp duties, and other charges are unreasonably high. </para>

                        <para>- I do, indeed. I have repeatedly mentioned what, in my ©pinion, is the best method to raise revenue. To secure war service homes for soldiers and their dependants we have at times voted considerable sums of money, and it is unfair that anything should be done to prevent the expenditure of that money in the best possible way. I say nothing against the gentlemen who are administering the act, but the fees that I have mentioned are excessive and should be reduced. I hope, also, that steps will be taken to make land available for these people in suitable localities, where transfers can be effected at a much lower cost than at present. </para>

                    <para>. - As I have already stated, no legal fees are charged by the department. Any fees that have to be paid are to meet charges made by the states. I understand' that in connexion with some war service homes, where the department had the mortgages, the state of New South Wales, until recently, charged mortgage fees in addition to the fees for the transfer of the land. The present New South Wales Government has agreed to forgo all charges in connexion with mortgages, which action will result in some relief being granted to those persons who acquire war service homes. The delay in connexion with the titles occurs only where the land is held under an old-fashioned title. It takes some time to convert those titles into Torrens titles. I have here a statement showing the cost of war service homes in the different states, both as to the cost of the land and the construction of the houses. In New South Wales, the cost last year averaged £814 9s. 4d. In Victoria, the houses built by the commission averaged £767 12s. 4d., which price included the value of the land. Those built in Victoria by the state savings bank cost £802 13s. 5d. In Queensland, the cost averaged £704 5s. 3d. ; in Tasmania, £785 6s. 9d. : in Western Australia, £768 16s. 5d. ; and in South Australia, where they were built by the state savings bank, the cost was £699. The average for the Commonwealth last year was, for construction only,- £703 9s. Id., and for land and construction, £763 3s. 2d. When we take into consideration the cost of homes generally, throughout Australia, it will be seen that the homes built for returned soldiers were constructed at a very moderate cost. With respect to the particular case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> if he will give me the name of the person concerned, investigations will be made forthwith.  </para>

                    <para>. - The sum of £4,000 is set aside for (repairs and maintenance to the Royal Military College at Duntroon. In the past money has been voted for work at the college, but the commandant has not been given the opportunity to spend it on the college as the money has been expended in other directions. The result is that the college to-day needs money to maintain it in a proper state of repair. I ask the Minister if this £4,000 will be at the disposal of the commandant of the college, under the direction of the military board, to be spent as intended when placed on the Estimates. The joint committee of Public Accounts, in the course of its inquiries, ascertained that, not only in connexion with the military college at Duntroon, but also in the case of the Jervis Bay naval college, money voted by Parliament for special purposes was expended in other channels. </para>
