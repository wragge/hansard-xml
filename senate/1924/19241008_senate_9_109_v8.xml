                <para class="block">In doing so, I must admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> foresaw more difficulties than some of us did when this measure was last before us. This amendment is one to which he then asked us to agree, but at that time I could not see my way to do so. Since then however, the matter has been further considered, and it is now found impracticable to adhere to the attitude I then took np. The exemptions in the consequential amendment made in another place apply mainly to butter aud cheese shipped to Java, Singapore, China. Japan, aud the Philippines. It is understood that these sales must be made forward on very short notice in order to meet the competition for this business. Any delay on the part of the board or others interested in the business might impoverish the Australian trade. Australia is now doing a large proportion of the trade in butter and cheese in those places. After a thorough scrutiny of the position, it has been found desirable to agree to an amendment on the lines which the honorable senator suggested last week. </para>

                    <para>. - I am never anxious to say, " I told you so." Evidently there is a difference of opinion between the Prim© Minister and the members of the Country party in his Cabinet. At first the Prime Minister got the best of the position, but in this chamber the Country party succeeded in carrying an amendment. Now a compromise between them has been effected. Believing that the amendment of another place practically gives effect to my desire that there shall be  no  interference with the legitimate trade with the East that has been built up by a reputable firm of butter exporters, whose trade mark stands for all that is good, and that they will be able to conduct their business without applying to the board for a licence to do so, I have nothing further to add. </para>

                    <para>. I think that I understand the reason which actuated the Minister in moving that the further amendment made by the House of Representatives be agreed to. When the original bill was before another place, there was a disposition on the . part of a majority of the members there to exempt those who were engaged in the tinned butter export trade from the provisions of the act. It was not thought desirable that they should have to approach the board to obtain a licence to continue the business in which they had been engaged for years. With a view to overcoming the difficulty, and to place them outside the control of the board, the words " to Europe " were inserted in another place. No sooner had it gone through in that form than it was felt that the bill would become ineffective, because those who desired to export butter to Europe would first ship it to South Africa for transhipment to Europe, and thus defeat the object of the bill. For that reason the Minister in this chamber moved to strike out the words " to Europe," with a view to insert in lieu thereof an amendment, which would give those engaged in the tinned butter export trade the right to conduct their business without obtaining a licence from the board. I voted to strike out the words " to Europe " when the bill was before this committee, but when they were struck out the Government apparently was not disposed to seriously entertain an amendment to give those engaged in the industry that which another place is prepared to give them. </para>

                        <para>- No division was taken. The bill has come back to the Senate in a form acceptable, not only to those exporters of tinned butter who wished to be free of control by the board, but also to those engaged in the export of fresh butter to the East. I do not object. I merely wish to show the roundabout way in which the Government proceeds with its business. The proposal in its present form will, I am sure, meet with the approval of many business people who believe that the bill, as it left the Senate, would have seriously prejudiced their interests. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like a little further explanation from the Minister with reference to the amendment passed by the Senate, and which was disagreed to in another place. What safeguards have been inserted to prevent consignments of fresh butter shipped to, say, Singapore, from being re-consigned to Europe, and thus avoiding the provisions of the bill? Why should butter consigned to the East be exempt from inspection? It is all very well to say that reputable firms in Sydney have established a good connexion with the East. If they are exporting high-grade butter, there should be no objection to the provisions of the bill being applied to them. </para>

                    <para>. - I think I can best reply to the honorable senator's inquiry by stating that the board will watch trade with the East very carefully, and if at a later date it is thought necessary to introduce legislation to bring that trade within the provisions of the act, no doubt that will be done. The Government realizes that many difficulties will confront the board in organizing the dairy produce export trade, and it lias decided that there shall be no interference for the present with the trade between Australia and the East. With regard to the possibility of re-consignment from Singapore to Europe, I can only say that the activities of the board will be of such a character that if there is any attempt to evade the provisions of the act the necessary amending legislation will be introduced. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment which the other House has struck out of the bill was inserted in it, at my instigation, by this committee when the measure was previously before us. The case that I made  out was so strong that the Minister, who i3 now urging the committee not to insist upon its amendment, agreed to its incorporation in the bill, thus removing the necessity for stressing the desirability of having upon the executive a representative of the selling interests. I do not wish to precipitate a dispute on a matter of this kind, but I still feel that it would be in the best interests of the general scheme for the marketing of our dairy products if the executive were as representative as it is possible to make it. If the impression is that the other interests would not secure proper representation were a representative of the selling interests to be  placed upon the executive, I point out that that body could be enlarged. After all, the executive will do the work arising between the infrequent .meetings of the board. I therefore urge upon the Government the desirability of enlarging the executive in order to give representation to the selling interests without prejudicing the cooperative interests. </para>

With such a huge undertaking it cannot be expected that the conditions will be ideal from the commencement.

We should not cramp the  board in its appointment of an executive. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> the assurance that any variations that are thought to be necessary will be given very careful consideration, and, if necessary, fresh proposals will be brought before the Senate. The Government is prepared to trust the board to appoint the very best executive. It is quite outside my province to give an assurance that any particular interests will be represented. </para>

I merely rose on Friday with a view to obtain the fullest information as to the policy of the Government in relation to the statistical work now being performed in most of the states. We were told on Friday that the Commonwealth Government had entered into an agreement with the Government of Tasmania which would result in a saving to both the Commonwealth and the state. ' If I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> correctly the greater part of the statistical work now undertaken by the State of Tasmania will in future be carried on by the Commonwealth Statistician, and the preparation of minor statistics of more or less importance to the state will be undertaken by the state. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> also  said that some of the officers now engaged in the statistical branch of the state service would be taken over by the Commonwealth. I am anxious to learn whether those who are thus taken over will automatically come under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, and secure all the advantages now enjoyed by permanent officers of the Commonwealth Service. </para>

                    <para>. - This bill affords me a favorable opportunity to state some of the basic objections to the taxation of incomes. It was in 1915 that the Commonwealth Parliament first decided to impose this form of taxation, and since then, Parliament has passed at least eight or nine amending bills. Although this tax was first imposed in war time, its unfairness has, to some extent, been recognized, because most of the amending bills have had as their objective the reduction of the amount extracted from the taxpayers. By one amendment moved in the Senate, and subsequently agreed to by the House of Representatives, taxpayers were relieved of the liability to pay taxation upon the value of the homes they owned and occupied, and that excellent proposal has probably had the very good effect of reducing the amount of revenue received from income taxation, by something in the vicinity of £2,000,000. According to a statement placed in our hands some time ago, it is estimated that the income tax will yield £11,057,489 this year despite all the amendments to which Parliament has agreed. One of my objections to the taxation of incomes is that it is a direct levy upon industry. The individual or company rendering the greatest service to the community is penalized to the greatest extent. It is an entirely wrong system of taxation, and for that reason, if for no other, I should ask the Senate to reject the bill. I realize, however, that this form of taxation is favored by a large volume of public opinion, not only in Australia, but elsewhere, and that all that one can do is to attempt to minimize its defects. Another serious objection to income taxation is its excessively inquisitorial character. I deny the right of any one to inquire into people's affairs to the extent to which they are inquired into by those entrusted with the collection of the Federal income tax. I do not wish it to be inferred that I claim that any officer of the Taxation Department discloses to the public the position that any taxpayer occupies, but, as a matter of fact, there is a considerable number of persons engaged in the Taxation Office, who have access to papers disclosing the private affairs of taxpayers. Income taxation can be evaded to a considerable extent. In fact, it lends itself to evasion. It is an easy matter for the Income Tax Commissioner to ascertain exactly what is earned by a man on a straight-out salary, but men in business, or men engaged in casual work can, and in my opinion do, defy the Commissioner to properly assess the amount of tax they should pay in proportion to their incomes. I do not blame them. Those who can escape paying so nefarious a tax ought to be permitted to escape. </para>

                        <para>- It is a bad law when it immediately pounces upon any one who dares to render a service to the community, and penalizes him in proportion to the value of the service he has rendered. It is an excessively stupid method of taxation that should not be tolerated in a civilized community, especially when, without much effort, we could find other means of raising revenue that would fall fairly and squarely on everybody. It has a tendency to induce people to make statements which are npt strictly in accordance with facts. I do not suppose any one knows the exact number of officers who have left the Land and Income Taxation Department to set up in business as taxation experts, merely because they have seen the weaknesses nf the act, and the possibility of conducting a lucrative business in showing victims how they can escape taxation. Measures of this kind which lend themselves to proceedings of this description should not be countenanced. Taxation ought to be so simple that every one would know exactly what he had to pay. [ do not think there is one member of this chamber or more than one or two honorable members of another place who, without the aid of the ready reckoner supplied by the Commissioner of Taxation, and the assistance of some of those costly calculating machines to which reference has been made, are capable of correctly ascertaining the taxation payable by a person receiving income from property and from personal exertion. The.  Commissioner of Taxation states in his report that he was obliged to send to Switzerland for a number of costly calculating machines to assist his officers in unravelling some of the intricate problems which arise in assessing taxation on the basis provided in our taxation laws. It was never' contemplated that any such  equipment  would be required to calculate the income of companies or individuals. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly the machines are' necessary to do what is desired, but they are highly unproductive, as we are informed by the Commissioner that, although he bad to import costly calculating machines - there is £8,000 worth in the central office alone - the benefit to the revenue is negligible. Could anything be more foolish or ridiculous than to have an act upon the statute-book which involves the provision of expensive machinery and highly skilled labour merely to unravel problems which when solved do not result in any benefit to the Commonwealth ? Pro visions which involve unnecessary expense are not only valueless, but a hindrance in effectively carrying out the act. Another exceedingly objectionable feature of the bill is that which illustrates the persistency and determination of the Go,vernment in continuing their fatuous idea of taxing farmers and dairymen in proportion to the increase in the number and value of their live stock. A Dairy Produce Control Board has recently been established to enable producers to obtain higher prices for their products, but after doing that, and providing for an exemption in proportion to the expenditure incurred on wire netting, dairy farmers and stock-owners are to be taxed in the way I have mentioned. A sheepbreeder, who is continually investing capital in his. business and who increases the value and number of his sheep will- under the provisions of this bill be pounced upon by the Commissioner of Taxation. This method of taxation is entirely wrong, and should be abandoned. It was my intention to quote from Henry George's <inline font-style="italic">Progress and Poverty,</inline> and to set out the proper canons of taxation, but in order to assist the Government to expedite business, and at the request of my leader, I shall be content on this occasion to refer honorable senators to four brief paragraphs on page 2S0 of the publication I have mentioned. It is necessary to keep the facts set out by Henry George as prominently as possible before honorable senators, so that possibly at a later date they will support a proposal to at least give partial effect to the principles he has outlined. One or two provisions of the bill are worthy of commendation. The proposal to increase the exemption from £200 to £300, although it is in conflict with the platform of the Labour party, is one which I shall support, because I feel sure that as soon as the members of our party meet in conference they will recognize that on account of the high cost of living and other factors, the amount of exemption embodied in our platform is altogether too low. I should like to see the exemption substantially increased, and I would not object to the amount being raised to £5,000, as is provided in the Land Tax Assessment Act, provided the exemption in that act were reduced to £300. When the bill is in committee it is my intention to move to delete those clauses, which impose taxation upon increases in live stock. It will be remembered that I submitted an amendment to that effect on a previous occasion, but it was then thought unwise to accept it. It would simplify matters considerably if the Commonwealth Government retained the whole of the revenue from customs and excise, and ceased collecting income taxation. If they did that they would not be the collecting machines for the states. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of Customs duties, in the collection of which a large number of officers are employed. Prom the revenue derived in that way we hand over to each of the states 25s. per head per annum. It would be better to delete that provision of the law, and retire from the field of income taxation. There is another matter which also should receive our attention. It is not proposed to alter the present exemption of £40 in respect of children under sixteen years of age. Considering the high cost of living and the heavy rents which have to be paid, that amount should be substantially increased. In committee I shall move to increase it to at least £60, with an additional £100 for a wife. If that were done, it would mean that the exemption would be increased to a little beyond the Government's intention. The position to-day is altogether different from what it was when the then Government introduced a bill to tax incomes, and made the exemption £156. By very slow degrees that exemption was raised to £200. It is now to be £300, but it should be higher. Because of the majority behind the Government, I do not suppose that it would be of any use to move that it be increased. There are other proposals in this bill which should be struck out.

Bonus shares granted from a reserve fund are really paid out of capital, and at this stage it is not competent for the Senate to tax capital. Incomes transferred from a profit and loss account, or reserve fund, on which tax has been paid, is capital. That has been admitted time after time in connexion with the War-time Profits Act. It is quite in opposition to section 55 of the Constitution to tax capital in this way, but no doubt other bills could be introduced under which capital could be taxed. Generally speaking, the effect of this amending bill is in the right direction, bub it does not go far enough. Apparently, its net effect upon incomes obtained from property and from personal exertion will be as follows: - </para><para class="block">
                    <graphic href="109332192410081_8_0.jpg" />
                </para><para class="block">Personally, I disagree entirely with the system of taxing property at a greater rate per £1 than income derived from personal exertion. A man who invests money in property generally employs labour, and benefits the community, but because he does that he is penalized. If a man builds cottages, which are needed to meet the requirements of almost every township, and certainly every large city, throughout Australia, and obtains his income from his tenants, he is compelled to pay more taxation on that income than if he derived it from personal exertion. </para><para class="block">The reason for that is that Parliament, as a whole, is deadly hostile to any person who attempts to escape from his landlord. Parliament believes in the citizens of this country paying their rent regularly, and is opposed to their owning their own homes. Consequently, if a person builds homes for others to buy, he must pay heavier taxation. The result is that many people are prevented from owning the homes in which they dwell. That -is a wrong attitude to adopt. As I do not suppose that any amendment to make the same rate apply to incomes from personal exertion and from property would receive the approval of this chamber, I may not move in that direction, but such action should be taken. I look upon the man who 1 invests money in an industry as one who is assisting his country. Companies, such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and many others which could be mentioned, employ much labour, and pay large sums of money in wages, and, undoubtedly, tend to increase the wealth of the country. Yet Parliament employs a skilled Commissioner, with an army of officers under him, as well as costly equipment, to watch those companies most carefully and see that they do not evade payment of their taxes. The more a man does to develop the country, the more he is penalized. That ia a wrong system of taxation, but I have no hope of its being altered while the present Government remains in power. I am glad to accept the small reductions which have been made, and only regret that they do not go farther. I have received numbers of communications from different classes of citizens, all of whom appear to be opposed to certain sections in the present act. Those engaged in the gold-mining industry in Western Australia are asking that in this bill they may be granted considerable concessions. If I had my way, I should give them all they desire, and a great deal more. We should now, as far as possible, reduce this taxation, and at the earliest possible moment wipe it out altogether. At present, that appears to be impossible, but when the bill reaches the committee stage, we should do all that we can to remove taxation from those who are doing something to assist the industries of this country. There are large numbers of unemployed in our midst today, but if a man dares to employ them he will, under this bill, be fined for doing  no.  With things as they are, I am only surprised that there are not more unemployed in Australia. I know that many people think that the income tax system is right. Their minds have been saturated with the poison of so-called economists, such as Adam Smith, and John Stuart Mill, and men of their type, whose opinions have been set aside and exploded by Henry George. Many people do not agree with Henry George. They have a great desire to fleece the public, and, apparently, Parliament is in the right mood to continue to perform that operation. Personally, I am not. In this bill we have an opportunity to do a real service for the working community of this country. I mean not only those who work manually, but also those who devise schemes and lay themselves out for the continuance of enterprises to employ large numbers of people, and generally to assist in the development of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, under this legislation, these are the people whom we seek to penalize, but when we reach the committee stages of the bill I shall endeavour to secure certain amendments' to various clauses so as to minimize as much as possible the effect of the measure. </para></speech>

                        <para>- I hope that the very few comments which I shall make with reference to the bill will also be lucid and logical. The majority of the members of this chamber are anxious that the work ahead shall be accomplished in the shortest possible time, and, but for the fact that an important principle is involved in the bill, I should not have intervened in the debate at all. From time to time in this chamber I have expressed very definite views concerning retrospective legislation. I do not approve of it. I have always  strongly condemned it, and I take up the same attitude to-day. It is a fundamental principle of all British law that there shall be no <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> legislation ; that when a law is put upon the statute-book all subjects of His Majesty shall know definitely what that law is, and how they are to comply with it. If we admit this pernicious principle of retrospective legislation, no person in the community will know where he stands, because an act done to-day and allowed by the law may, to-morrow, under amending retrospective enactments, be illegal. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the law to-day. This amending bill proposes in clause 4 to alter the wording of that section of the act very considerably. When introducing the bill in another place the Treasurer remarked that these amendments were merely explanatory of existing legislation. I remind the honorable gentleman that it is not the function of Parliament to explain its own measures. We have established courts for that purpose, and it is the quintessence of absurdity for the Treasurer or any one else to say that words or phrases in certain legislation are to be interpreted in a certain way. Parliament meant what it put on the statute-book, and nothing else. What the official responsible for the drafting of legislation intended, or what the Government had in mind when the bill was passed, does not matter in the slightest degree. The only thing that matters is the actual wording of the enactment. It must be accepted that Parliament meant what an enactment provides, and nothing else. If we depart from that principle, heaven alone knows where we shall get to. If it were possible for members of the High Court to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to find out what each individual member said or thought about legislation under review there would be hopeless confusion. But, of course, the judges of our courts can be guided only by certain principles. They cannot depart from the enactment itself. Therefore, we are driven to the conclusion that Parliament meant what it put on the statute-book, and that only. The Treasurer has stated that what is now proposed is an explanation of what we have already done. It is proposed in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of clause 4 to omit subparagraph ii which I have just read, and substitute for it something entirely different in these words - </para>

                <para>Any one who tells me, as the Treasurer told honorable members in another place that this is merely an explanation of paragraph ii of section 16 is not stating the position correctly, for it means something entirely different. It changes the whole principle of the act for a start. But since my purpose is not to occupy the time of the Senate at great length, I shall not further stress that point, but will now deal with some of the effects of the proposed amendment. If a company has accumulated profits since 1914, and under the existing law has distributed those profits, except in certain cases, such distribution is not liable to income taxation. </para>

                        <para>- No. I mean distributed in the form of bonus shares. If such profits were distributed last week as bonus shares they were not liable to pay income taxation as the law stands to-day. But if this bill goes through unamended, any such distribution made last week or last year will, by virtue of this enactment, be liable to taxation. In other words, as I have endeavoured to show, this bill contemplates retrospective legislation. If it were proper and lawful under the existing law for companies to distribute accumulated profits in the shape of bonus shares without having to pay taxation, those companies should not under the provisions of this bill be called upon to pay taxation, because if the companies had retained their accumulated profits or used them as capital they would not have been called upon to pay income taxation upon them, nor would the people into whose hands they had passed. Now we propose that certain actions, which are allowable under the law to-day, shall not be allowable under this amending legislation. The principle is wrong. It may be perfectly right for Parliament to say that all future distributions of this kind shall pay income taxation. I should have no complaint to make if the Government brought down such a proposal as that, but it is wrong to penalize individuals and companies for having done what the law allows them to do. This pernicious principle should not be tolerated by the Senate. There is a good deal more that I could say on this matter, and on the principle underlying it, but I think I have said sufficient to convince honorable senators that the proposal is very improper. As soon as I had studied the bill I interviewed the Prime Minister and certain members of the Government. </para>

I am quite sure that the Minister will say that the explanation is that the assessments that are made this year will apply to the financial year that has just closed, and to that extent they are all retrospective. There is, however, a fundamental difference. Under paragraph ii of sub-section <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 16 of the principal act, it was lawful to do certain things, and in many cases those things were done, because they were protected by the law as it then stood. Now it is proposed to. tax, not merely income, but also sums of money that have been allowed to accumulate, and which can be still kept in their accumulated form. It is perfectly legitimate to apply retrospectively for one year, assessments of incomes that aTe definitely described as incomes in existing legislation. But it is entirely' wrong to assess retrospectively when the definition of " income " is altered to include that which has not formerly been regarded as income. For that reason I strongly object to the retrospective aspects of this bill, and I give notice that in committee </para>

                    <para>. - I do not make any apology for giving to this bill the attention that I think it deserves. Any suggestion that we should rush legislation through without the fullest consideration merely because we are hastening towards the end of the session does not appeal to me. This measure should have been presented to us much earlier. It is not fair that honorable senators should, in the last days of the session, have thrust upon them such an important measure. It is practically impossible for us to give to it the earnest and serious consideration expected of us by those who sent us here. I have been obliged to devote the whole of the week-end to an investigation of the provisions of the bill. I am more than amazed at certain of its features, and I am. astonished that the Government has made no attempt to rectify certain abuses that were discovered in the administration of the principal act. The- bill should have been introduced at a time when it would have been possible for adequate consideration to be given to it, not only by honorable senators, but also by those whom it will affect, in order that they might make representations for its improvement. Be.presentative government necessarily means the representation of those who elect members to this Parliament. If legislation of such importance is introduced at a time when it is impossible for those whom it will affect to place before us their representations the very principle of representative government is attacked. This bill is of a type to which the Senate of recent years has become rather accustomed. From time to time amending income tax legislation is introduced, not so much with the object of establishing new features as with the object of remedying certain defects in the existing legislation or peculiar phases of administration. Of course, I know it is to be expected that the administration of any act imposing direct taxation must cause a certain amount of dissatisfaction to those who have to pay the tax. The present administration of the Income Tax Act, however, because of the feeling of uncertainty and insecurity which it creates in the minds of all  sections  of the community, has led, not only to dissatisfaction, but, also, in many respects, to absolute consternation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has told us that the necessity for certainty in the law is absolutely fundamental. He has told us that, under British law, the subject should be certain that, if he acts on the law as it exists, it will not be made a trap for him. When it is proposed to alter the law by an unfair retrospective amendment, in add it on  to new restrictive provisions such as are contained in this bill, the consequences must be very serious for a large number of taxpayers who have exercised their rights under the existing law. We are informed that one of the purposes of this bill is to make the act clearer, but, in the opinion of those most vitally concerned, it causes increased difficulty in its construction, and renders inevitable increased cost in administration. Further than that it is considered that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has so fittingly called <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> legislation is not only contrary to all our ideas of justice, but actually has a tendency to prevent the carrying out of desirable commercial operations involving au  increase  of capital, with a consequent extension of business and development, leading to subsequent national progress. The Commissioner of Taxation has represented to the Treasurer that this bill is merely explanatory of the meaning of the sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-3 which it proposes to amend. It is clear that it is not so with respect, at least, to certain of the provisions amending section 16 of the principal act relating to dividends and bonus shares. Those amendments are contained in clause 4, paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of the bill, and are, by clause 16 (1) of the bill expressly made retrospective to include assessments on income of the year 1st July, 1921, to 1st July, 1922, and of subsequent years. I propose to examine these suggested amendments very briefly, and to show to the Senate that vital alterations are being made under cover of what is said to be merely an explanatory measure. I shall deal with the amendments in the order in which they appear in the bill. It is obvious that the amendment in clause 4, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> proposes a material cutting down of the exemption at present existing. The expression ' ' capital assets ' ' is much wider than " assets which were not acquired for the purpose of resale at a profit." Furthermore, this amendment will enable the commissioner, if any resale of assets at a profit has been made, to put the taxpayer to considerable expense in fighting an incorrect assessment. Section 16 <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> ii, as it now stands, exempts from taxation the value of shares issued in consequence of the capitalization of all profits " other than profits being assessable income," which the company is liable to include in its return for the purposes of " its current assessment." Clause 4, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of the bill includes all profits derived subsequently to 1st of July, 1914, capitalized and distributed by a company to its members or shareholders iu the form of shares to the extent of their paid-up value, unless such profits come within one or more of the exemptions 1. 2, 3, and 4 of clause 4, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">Ji.</inline> Putting it another way, under the existing section 16 <inline font-style="italic">S</inline> ii the shareholder is only liable to tax on such of the capitalized profits of the company, distributed in the form of bonus shares, as are " taxable income of the company for the year in which the shares are distributed, or taxable income for the year preceding the year of distribution " of the shares. The proposed new sub-section 16 <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> makes all capitalized profits of the company, derived at any time after 1st July, 1914, and distributed as bonus shares, taxable income of the shareholder, save such of those profits as fall within the limited exceptions set out in sub-paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of clause 4, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h.</inline> I mention this to bring home the point so effectively made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> when he was speaking of bonus shares, and the unfairness of the ' present proposal. This amendment completely reverses the principle underlying the section as it stands, namely, that all profits not expressly made taxable are exempt, by providing that everything not expressly exempted is taxable. This is a vital alteration, and cannot by any stretch of imagination be regarded as merely explanatory. That this is not merely a machinery measure, but is an actual substantial cutting down of the existing exemptions, and an extension of the shareholders' liability to tax on bonus shares is the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon, K.C., whose opinion thereon has been obtained. He advises that by the omission of paragraph of clause 4 from the operation of section 15 (1) of the bill, which is the retrospective section, the retrospective effect is only reduced, and not eliminated, because paragraph 4 of clause 16 makes the amendment 4 <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of the bill apply retrospectively to assessments of income derived during the year commencing the 1st July, 1923, and after.' The result is that bonus shares which have been distributed under the existing act between the 1st of July, 1923, and the commencement of the bill are retrospectively included as part of the shareholders' assessable income, and are taxable so far as they do not fall within the exceptions to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of clause 4. I consider  that an unequivocal amendment should be added to clause 16, expressly stating that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> of clause 4 shall not apply to the paid-up value of any shares distributed before the date of the passing of the bill, and not then subject to income tax under section 16 ii of the principal act. Numerous companies after taking counsel's opinion on the existing law, have capitalized the whole or part of their profits, not being assessable income liable to be included in their returns for. the purposes of their " current assessments " - that is, for the year of distribution, or for the year preceding the distribution, and have distributed such capitalized profits to the shareholders in the form of paid-up shares. These shareholders have accepted the shares relying on the existing law that they were not liable to pay tax on them. If the amendments under clause 4 paragraph <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> are intended to be merely explanatory, then they should be modified so as to have that effect only, and in any event, an express provision should be included in the bill making it quite clear that shares which have been issued by any company to its members or shareholders prior to the date of the passing of the proposed bill, and which were not then taxable in the hands of the shareholders, are not made liable to tax by the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has already intimated that he intends to move an amendment to give effect to the objections he has to this part of the bill. I also intended to move an amendment for the same purpose, and if his proposal does not suit me I shall move another. I quite agree with the honorable senator when he describes this proposal as being the introduction of a " pernici'ous principle of retrospective legislation." If a law is wrong, then Parliament should certainly amend it, but to cause those who acted in all good faith under the legislation as Parliament has passed it, and as they found it, to suffer by retrospective action, not only outrages one's sense of justice, but also establishes a very dangerous precedent, that some succeeding Government may feel tempted to act upon with disastrous results to our commercial prosperity. I am not referring particularly to my honorable friends opposite. Governments come and governments go. Retrospective legislation is repudiatory  legislation, and should not be tolerated for one moment. </para>

                        <para>- It has done so i.n this respect. Now I pass on to another aspect of this  repudiatory  legislation, as I regret to have to term it, affecting an industry to which it is not proposed to give relief under this bill, but which in certain respect is, in my opinion, as fully deserving of relief as any of its other allied industries. I refer to the coal-mining industry. Under this bill gold-mining companies are very properly, and for the purpose of assisting the industry, exempted altogether from income taxation. Under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915, section 18, paragraph i, it was provided that "the total amount of calls paid in the year in which the income is derived shall be deducted in the case of calls on shares in a mining company or syndicate carrying on mining operations in Australia." This action was taken with a view to the encouragement of all mining, coal mining being included. The Parliament of that day very properly realized that abundant supplies of coal at a reasonable price were absolutely essential for our industrial development. Honorable senators will note that this deduction could only apply to those coalmining concerns which not only did not produce a profit, but found it necessary to make calls upon their shareholders from time to time for the provision of working capital. These non-profitable mines employed some thousands of workers, and distributed in wages a very large amount of money each year, with a consequential benefit to many other industries. The payment of calls is not at any time .a pleasing matter to shareholders, but when _ these calls were allowed as a deduction under the Income Tax Assessment Act, hundreds of shareholders were content to carry on, hoping that sooner or later the mines in which they were interested would show a profit. Consequently the work of developing these mines went on. But in October, 1922, an amending Income Tax Assessment Act was passed, section 23, subsection i of which limited the deductions allowable to "so much of the assessable income as is paid in calls on shares in a mining company or syndicate carrying on mining operations in Australia for gold, silver, base metals, or rare metals." Honorable senators will note that the word " coal " was left out, without dating such omission back, to say 1st July, 1921, which action should have been taken in lieu of notice by the Government of its intention to depart from the moral agreement with all coal-mining concerns. As a result of this action considerable hardship has resulted to those shareholders who paid calls believing they could deduct them from their income tax returns. Let me, without mentioning any names, give to the Senate the particulars of one case which has come under my notice. The taxpayer concerned has stated the facts as follows: - On 31st March, 1921, I was  chairman  of a coal company which had made a profit in the form of development underground and plant, but not in actual money. Tn June, 1921, a dividend was declared, and on the same day a call was made payable with which to pay the dividend - </para>

                    <para class="block">As I was the largest shareholder my dividend came to £3,23S <inline font-weight="bold">Ms., and</inline> my call to £3,230 12s. The company was registered under the New South Wale's Sio Liability Act, which provides that calls are payable on the second Wednesday of the month, and that notice of call must' be given. Therefore, dividend and call were made payable on 13th July, 1921, little dreaming of what legislation was going to be passed in October, 1922, fifteen months afterwards. On 13th July, 1021, 1 received a cheque for the difference, namely, £8 2s. In my return for my income from 1st July, 1921, to" 31st June, 1922, I included the £3,238 dividend as income, and deducted the £3,230 call in accordance with the law as it stood on 30th June. 1922. The Taxation Department, whilst  gladly assessing me in May, 1923. for taxation on the dividend, refused to allow me to deduct the call, and claimed an additional £1,0SC. which I refused to pay. One of the grounds for my objection was that it amounted to repudiation on the part of the Commonwealth Government, and that such repudiation was against public policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hulme,</inline> the then  Deputy  Commissioner, classed it as one of the hardest cases he had ever known, and stated that had I received the £8 2s. on 29th June, 1921, I would not owe the department £1,086, but as I received the £8 2s. on 13th July, 1921. I did owe the department the sum named. In support of this contention, ,he cited Act No. 37, assented to on the 18th October, 1922, relying on section 13, subsection 1 in conjunction with section 32, subsection 2. For eighteen years I have employed a large number of men in coal mining, and after deducting gains from losses my net loss has been considerable. But losses from errors of judgment don't hurt like this £1,086. The men have, generally speaking, given me a fair deal. I look to the Government of Australia to do the same. </para>

                <para class="block">This taxpayer made every possible protest against the injustice which he very properly ' felt he was suffering under, but, failing an amendment of the act, it is impossible for relief to be afforded in his and other similar cases.. The effect of the Government's action in excluding calls paid in coal-mining companies as a deduction under this section of the act has had a more disastrous side from the stand-point of national development than its effect upon individual citizens. It has largely been the cause of a number of coal mines shutting down altogether, and it has certainly had the effect of preventing the opening up and the  successful  development of many others. Consider the effect of this upon employment, and industry. With these facts before him the Minister should accept an amendment, which I shall move, allowing the deduction of calls paid in coalmining concerns. More especially should he be willing to' do this when wo remember that the Income Tax Assessment Act has given this relief to coal's great rival - oil.

                        <para>- No. The honorable senator knows that I am referring to those persons who pay calls to companies or syndicates which are not making any profits. Those making profits are liable to taxation, and my proposal is not intended to relieve them from taxation. All I wish to do is to relieve taxpayers to the extent of the calls paid, and that is a proposal which I think should receive the support of the Senate. These companies are endeavouring to develop new mines, and open up new coal-mining districts, as is being done in Queensland and other states. The shareholders should be relieved to the extent of being allowed to deduct from their income the amounts paid in calls to such companies. This would assist in developing an industry, which", I am sure, every honorable senator will admit should be encouraged. </para>

                        <para>- lb is. Originally calls paid to coal-mining companies were excluded from the provisions of the act, and, acting upon that provision, men with money were induced to invest capital in new districts, and provide employment believing that calls would be exempt from taxation. The act was subsequently amended to exclude coal mines. It is now proposed to exclude gold and other mines, but what is the value of any promise by this or any other Government if, after persons have been induced to invest money in the gold-mining industry, a Government is able to repudiate a promise made a year or two before ? In spite of what is now being done, it may be possible in a year or two to tax the gold-mining industry almost out of existence. It is the duty of a Government to honour its promises unless there is some clear justification for departing from the obligations into which it entered. The Government was entirely wrong in repudiating its original legislation. We now have the opportunity to give the necessary relief to companies already operating, and to encourage the development of new coal-mining fields. </para>

                    <para>Some of our members, and several of our clients, are very much aggrieved at not being allowed to deduct from their federal income for the year 1st July, 1921, to 30th June, 1922, calls on coal-mining shares actually paid during that year. Acting in all good faith, and with the Commonwealth assurance dating right back to 1915, that they would be able to deduct calls paid on any mining company's shares, they assisted in the development of one of the natural resources of this Commonwealth, viz.. coal-mining. Act No. 2 of 1901 Interpretation of Acts Act, section 8, clause (c) clearly sets out that no repeal of a former act can affect any right or privilege acquired under any such act, and existing at the time of the repeal. My committee, therefore, considers that the rights and privileges of former acts are certainly preserved until 30th June,. 1922, inclusive. Your Crown Law authorities are endeavouring to make your amendment of Income Act of 18th October, 1922, deprive taxpayers of their rights and privileges, and make this Act No. 37 of1922 retrospective to 1st July, 1921. My committee submits that this would be manifestly unjust, and that upon it being pointed out to you it would be your wish to rectify same, if, by your amendment of act, such rights and privileges have been affected. Leading counsel in this state take the view that your Government cannot legally deprive taxpayers of such rights, and my committee does not for one moment think you had any such intention. Banks, insurance and trading companies are carrying on their business to-day, and adopting policies for the future based on their rights and privileges and obligations under existing acts. Is it conceivable that any Prime Minister or Treasurer would, in sixteen months' time, endeavour to introduce retrospective legislation that would make what such companies are legally doing to-day illegal? My committee trusts you will givo this matter very serious consideration, and bring in an amendment of Act 37, 1922, so as to make calls on coal-mining shares deductible in the same way as you brought in Act No. 27 of 1923, section 14, making calls on oil shares paid since 1st July, 1921, deductible from federal income. </para>

                <para class="block">This puts the matter very clearly, and, in my opinion, advances unanswerable arguments. I have dealt with what appears to me to be the most important amendments required in the bill. In addition to the amendment which I have foreshadowed, there are certain other minor, but essential amendments, required in clause 7, which is to amend section 21, and also in clause 10 which is to amend section 25 of the principal act. I trust the Government will give serious consideration to the protests which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brookman</inline> and myself with respect to retrospective legislation. If we continued to pass such legislation, our acts will be of very little value, because any undertakings into which we enter, or promises we make, can be repudiated by succeeding Governments. In such circumstances, the confidence of the commercial, manufacturing, and industrial sections of the community would be severely shaken, and it would be impossible for Australia to progress. In committee, I trust I shall have the assistance of honorable senators in rectifying some of the anomalies to which I have drawn attention. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny's</inline> reference was treated flippantly. It is too serious a matter to be treated in that manner. Instead of being treated flippantly, it should receive practical support from every honorable senator. In another place an effort was made to get all medical expenses incurred by any person in Australia freed from taxation under this bill. Honorable senators know that when sickness enters a home it is a very serious matter. Our public hospitals are {overcrowded, and the fees charged by private hospitals are not what they were in pre-war days. I do not say that they are unjust, but they are undoubtedly very heavy. We know, also, that the fees charged by doctors have increased, as have also the charges made by chemists. Any person who finds it necessary to pay large sums of money in medical expenses should be allowed a deduction in respect of his income tax, no matter whether his income be large or small. Last season we exempted all homes from taxation. There was no differentiation between the humble ' cottage of the poor and the palatial residence of the rich. Nor should" we differentiate when it is a matter of sickness. In another place it was suggested that the exemption should be £800, as in the State of Victoria, but in this bill the exemption is £600. We should treat medical expenses as we treated homes, and exempt them altogether, irrespective of income. </para>

                    <para>. - Like previous speakers, I dislike retrospective legislation, but in regard to this measure I shall suspend judgment until I hear the Minister's explanation. I know that the Government has given long and careful consideration to this bill, and that it has had the benefit of the advice of the taxation officials. I know, also, that there have been evasions of taxation, and that this measure is largely to tighten up the present legislation. I could not follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> with regard to calls in mining companies. If there has been any breach of the act in that respect, the matter should be remedied, even if it means retrospective legislation. Calls are made by companies for the purpose of paying up their share capital and to enable them to carry on. They should, therefore, not be exempted from taxation. If calls are now free from taxation, I consider it is wrong, and that they should be included in the taxable income. </para>

                        <para>- It was not right to do so. At present we have too many academic deductions. If we had a clear-cut tax on all income derived during the year, and there were fewer deductions and a lower scale of charges, we should not have all the litigation that we have now. There is a good deal of merit in the bill. I consider that the deduction for depreciation is a step in the right direction, which will, no doubt, be appreciated by the people concerned. The clauses dealing with cases of hardship will also provide great relief to people in straitened financial circumstances. The provision for exemptions in connexion with gold-mining is also a right one. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that question now. I maintain that calls are capital, and should not be exempt from taxation. I appreciate the exemptions provided in this bill for certain gold-mining companies, and in committee I shall endeavour to have the principle extended to include companies mining for gold and copper, so as to embrace certain concerns which are producing a great deal, but which have been running at a loss for some years. I refer particularly to the . Mount Morgan Company, the figures for which I furnished the Senate a few days ago. For four years shareholders in that company have received no dividends. The company is paying away large sums of money in wages, and its operations during the last three years have resulted in a loss of £110,000. Mining' companies like that, should, I think, be put on the same footing as gold-mining companies in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- No. An income tax bill deals with income earned by the taxpayer in the year preceding the passage of the measure. Therefore, in its operation it is always retrospective. It may so happen that a man, in one year, may have an income of £1,500, and in the following year have no taxable income at all, yet in the second year he will be called upon to pay income tax on an income of £1,500 earned in the previous year. </para>

                <para class="block">Then it goes on to state that where a company distributes to its members or shareholders any undistributed income accumulated prior to 1914 the sum so received by the shareholder shall not be included as part of its income. It further provides that the face value of shares distributed by a company to its members or shareholders, in consequence of the capitalization of the whole or any part of the assessable income of the company, shall be liable to taxation, but there is a proviso safeguarding the taxpayer from double taxation. What Parliament  intended, and thought it had done, was to ensure the taxation of certain profits of companies. It was thought that, as it was taxing the citizens of the Commonwealth on income derived from personal exertion or property, it was only right that it should also tax those persons whose income was derived from the investment of capital in companies. Does any honorable senator suggest that such persons should be exempt? </para>

                        <para>- I can imagine what kind of reception they would get from their electors if they endeavoured to justify the exemption from taxation of persons who had their money invested in these concerns. The directors of a company, I remind honorable senators, do not always distribute its profits. They place a certain amount to reserves, and after a time they may decide to " carve up the melon " - in other words, to distribute the accumulated profits in the shape of bonus shares, and thus evade taxation. Are two sets of shareholders to be treated differently ? If a company distributes its dividends annually, the profits are included in the income tax returns of taxpayers, who have to pay. taxation upon them. At present, if another company pays its profits to reserves, and subsequently distributes them as bonus shares, its shareholders escape income taxation on those profits. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The principal act, passed in 1914, deliberately excludes all profits undistributed prior to that year. ' Parliament, however, intended that profits should be assessable, whether paid as dividends annually or accumulated for several years, and then distributed in the shape of bonus shares. </para>

We are now proposing to close up that loop-hole, and to make absolutely sure that the intention of Parliament shall be given effect. I feel quite sure that certain honorable senators are confusing this bill, and the reason for its introduction, with another measure dealing with lessees, whose position in regard to income taxation was the subject of a High Court judgment. The principle in this bill has never been before the High Court. The High Court has never decided that bonus shares are not liable to taxation, but we have ascertained that, unless the law is amended, as proposed in this bill, certain bonus shares will escape taxation, whilst the holders of other bonus shares will have to pay. Is it not right, in the circumstances, that all holders of bonus shares should be ou an equality ? </para>

                        <para>- We all know that  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is opposed to the whole principle of income taxation. The object of the bill is to prevent the intention of Parliament, from being defeated. In committee I shall give information on the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> I ask honorable senators to dismiss from their minds any idea they may have that this bill is more retrospective than is any other income tax measure. It is true that it will amend the law this year, and that the amendment will apply to last year's assessments; but that is not different from the principle which underlies other income tax bills. I shall now deal with the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> I understand that, at a certain period in the history of our taxation law, a taxpayer was entitled to deduct from his income calls paid in respect of shares held in a coal-mining company. In 1922, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> was Treasurer, an amending bill was brought down which took away that right. That provision, of course, had a retrospective effect; it was passed in 1922, but it applied to the income that the taxpayer received in 1921. </para>

That is always the hardship that is experienced when there is a change in the law by which there is taken away some privilege that the taxpayer previously enjoyed, because the tax is assessed upon the income earned in the year prior to that in which the legislation is passed.

                    <para>. - This clause is necessary because the repeal of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1921 took from the Commissioner the powers that he held under that act, and it is impossible for the department to issue an assessment for any of those years. Some taxpayers have, wittingly or unwittingly, escaped payment of taxation for some or all of those years. If in the year 1916-17 a person should have paid income tax, but did not do so, why should he be allowed to escape? By the legislation of that year he was rendered liable to the payment of taxation. Only in that sense is the clause retrospective. I am sure that honorable senators do not desire to give evading taxpayers the power to continue to with1 hold payment. </para>

He now has the opportunity to give practical effect to the sentiments that he expressed. I am not prepared to give to the Commissioner the power to go back for nine years to collect income tax. The Government was not greatly concerned about collecting land tax from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman. If it devoted a greater amount of attention to him and similar big land-holders, and less to the poorer taxpayers, the revenue from direct taxation would be largely increased. </para>

                    <para>. - I have heard several stirring orations regarding retrospective legislation from Senators Drake-Brockman, Benny, and others, but, as those honorable senators did not call for a division on the motion for the second reading of the bill, I at once came to the conclusion that their protests need not be taken seriously. If legislation has been enacted expressing clearly the intention of Parliament, and if certain people afterwards find a loophole in it, I think it is a most excellent idea, not at all savouring of retrospective action, to introduce another bill to restore the position as it was intended to be. It is only common sense to make good any weakness in legislation. That is quite different from passing a bill and calling upon people to pay something which they never anticipated having to pay,nd for which they had made no provision. I do not like refraining from voting with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> against this clause, but I realize that if this clause is struck out there will be difficulty in collecting income tax from people who have evaded their liability to pay the tax. I thought at first that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> had made out a good case, but I changed my mind when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> reply, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> did not call for a division on the second reading I thought he would go no further. When he was not prepared to put up a fight to reject the bill on the second reading, I thought that he thereby accepted the principle of retrospective legislation, and therefore I am not prepared to support him in putting up a fight in regard to petty details in committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that the Government cannot accept the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> probably has in mind the Mount Morgan mine, which is a gold and copper producer. If the mine is making a loss, the amendment will not affect it. The Government's idea in proposing the amendment in the bill is to try to stimulate the gold-mining industry, which is ab a low ebb. Of course, there are many other worthy industries also in need of stimulation, but if we tried to give every industry exemption from the payment of income tax, heaven only knows where we should end up. Possibly we should end up by having an Income Tax Bill that would produce' no revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but we think that we cannot afford to go any further than the exemption of gold-mining companies. The Mount Morgan mine was at first a gold mine which incidentally produced copper. I do not know whether it has passed that stage now, and has become a mine which is principally producing copper, and, incidentally, gold. If its principal output is gold, and it makes a profit on its operations, it will not pay the income tax. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not moved this amendment because the Mount Morgan mine is losing money.  I realize perfectly well that the company cannot secure relief even under my amendment; but the time may come when it will earn a profit, otherwise the mine will have to be closed down, and thousands of men, women, and children now depending on it will be obliged to seek other avenues for earning a living. What I hope to obtain is some relief for the mine when it resumes the payment of ' dividends. It was originally a gold mine, but in the course of years it became a copper-gold proposition. In the last five years it has produced £1,578,539 worth of gold, and £2,021,444 worth of copper. It is, therefore, not a fifty-fifty copper-proposition, but I consider that it is as much entitled to an exemption as a gold mine may be. </para>

                    <para>. - Gold mines and copper mines cannot be considered on the same basis, as during the war the gold producers were not allowed to sell their products in a free market. To use a technical term, the price of gold was "pegged," as it could not be sold at other than a fixed price. The copper producers, on the other hand, were able to derive full advantage of the higher prices ruling during the war period. The Government cannot, therefore, accept the amendment in its present form. We recognize, however, that there are some mines in the Commonwealth, which, although chiefly producing gold, are also producing large quantities of copper, and which did not derive the full benefit from their output of gold. If the honorable senator will amend his amendment to provide that at least 40 per cent. of the value of the product of such mines is gold, the Government will accept it. We cannot accept an amendment exempting mines producing gold and copper regardless of the value of the product, as I understand nearly all copper mines produce some gold, and if the output were only 1 per cent. of copper they would benefit. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to test the feeling of the committee by moving the deletion of all references to the value of live stock. I do not know whether it is due to the fact that I have had personal experience in mixed farming, or to my inherent opposition to income taxation in any shape or form, or to both, but I strongly object to taxation being imposed upon the value of live stock. I do not know how any one can favour the imposition of this form of taxation upon persons who render such a signal service to the country. After supplying producers with imported wire netting practically free of duty, and exempting payments for  wire netting  from taxation, we penalize them by imposing a fine in proportion to the service they render to the community in increasing their flocks and herds. In the early pioneering days certain persons chartered a vessel in order to bring stock to Australia, and although everything possible .has been done to preserve and improve the breed of stock, we are taxing those who increase their flocks and herds instead of raising taxation from the proper source. When the Government and their supporters persist in imposing such taxation, I am entitled to point out the error of their ways, and to endeavour to get them to view this question from the same stand-point as I do. If my amendment were accepted the revenue would be reduced by a few million pounds a year; but that would not matter, because, according to the latest figures, we are likely to again have a substantial surplus.

Assuming that we tax live stock, there are two ways of doing it. To tax the income derived from the sale of such stock would be a distinct hardship to the taxpayer. </para>

                        <para>- We are providing for an assessment. This reform was asked for by the stock-owners themselves, and was put in to relieve them from having to pay in the one year a tax on the sales of their live stock. It is obvious that it is in the interests of the taxpayers, because it lightens the burden of taxation. Each year they return the market value of the increase in their flocks and herds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> says that we should not tax that income. The biggest incomes in Australia to-day are probably received from men who own large flocks of sheep. Because of the present high price of wool, the pastoral industry is probably our most profitable industry. </para>

If income taxation is fair, as the committee evidently believes it to be, it is only a question of the way in which it shall be levied. The act, as amended by this bill, is distinctly in favour of the stock-owners, and is an equitable means of taxing his income. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> in his desire to eliminate paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> but I ask the Minister whether he has considered the South Australian method of dealing with live stock? Under that system, the stock-owners, in submitting their returns, value their stock at a certain amount, and when they sell them they are taxed on the difference between that assessment and the amount received. That is not only a fair method, but it is a simple one. It is a most difficult matter to deal with live stock and its fluctuating market value from time to time. In South Australia it does not matter whether the value placed on his stock by a stock-owner is a fair one or not. A man may, if he so desires, value his sheep at 10s. each, but if he sells them for 30s. each, the difference is taxable income. That method is much simpler than the method at present obtaining under Commonwealth legislation. </para>

I have a painful recollection of a 30-hour sitting when we discussed this, matter on the Estimates last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has placed his finger on a grave injustice to the people of Australia. He says that this stock is not ours, but I say  that it is, as the community holds many millions of sheep and cattle. I look at this as a tax upon capital, and not upon income. A man's stock is his capital, and should not be taxed. </para>

                        <para>- The whole sheep does not become income. When a person sells an engine, he is not charged income tax on the price received, but only on his profits during the year. The case of the primary producer should be dealt with fairly. Under this form of taxation grave injustices are perpetrated. Some time ago, at a place where I was staying, a man lost 50 head of sheep in one night. If a week or two before he had included them in his return, he would pay tax on something from which he received  no income. I have read of men who have lost hundreds of cattle in one night because of their eating noxious weeds. Is it fair to tax a man upon cattle that never produce any income? </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> knew as much about dairying as he does about sugar, he would understand that calves get very little milk. After three days the best they receive is skim milk. I realize that on a dairy where from time to time there are considerable numbers of young calves, an enormous amount of work is involved in rearing them. But why should we treat live stock as if it were income, when it is really capital ? </para>

                        <para>- How are we to know whether a man who disposes of his stock derives any profit from them ? Take the case of a man who three months ago sold 100 sheep for 30s. each. To-day, if he wants to stock up again, he may, because of the good rains which have fallen, have to pay <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> a head for the same class of sheep. Yet on the sheep that were sold he would have to pay income tax. From one end of Australia to the other there is an outcry  against the injustice of taxing the capital of the farmer and the grazier. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that we should legislate to suit the graziers or any one else. I am quite sure that the Minister would not consider the passing of legislation to suit me. I could bring a grave indictment against the department in regard to my own experience. I am allowed to deduct only £100 a year for expenses in connexion with my official position, and I have no appeal. No doubt' we could greatly multiply such grievances and show that thousands of people are not getting a fair deal. I think, however, that there should be no more difficulty in dealing with live stock than with the ordinary stock of a merchant in a warehouse. The returns should disclose the- real position. I am satisfied that thousands of small live stockowners who never show a profit on their live stock transactions are called upon to pay taxation. As far as values are concerned, we all know how rapidly they change and how sheep worth to-day, say, £1 a head, may within a few months increase to £3. If only we could induce the people to stock up this country and provide fodder as a stand by in times of  drought, we should be doing more to increase the wealth of the Commonwealth than by inducing people to start small businesses in competition with others who are well established. Whether or not we have a majority I shall vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> amendment. I am quite sure that thousands of people are wondering year after year why this injustice is put upon them. </para>

                <para>I have to advise that the following resolution was carried at a meeting of my executive on the 25th ult. :  - " That the executive take steps to have the necessity for including the returns of live stock in dairymen's income tax returns abolished." </para>
                <para class="block">This merely affirms a previous resolution, as my executive has consistently advocated this course for a number of years. 1 have not the least doubt that the general secretary of the union referred to faithfully represents the views of the Primary Producers Union. Nearly every measure brought in by this Government during the present session has been ostensibly for the assistance of some branch of Australian industry. I remember being called upon recently to vote for a subsidy for the manufacture of sulphur. Other measures brought before the Senate have included bills to provide bounties on the export of dried fruits, on the manufacture of white spirit from grapes, and on the export of meat or live stock to the East. In times of drought we affirm the desirableness of providing cheap railway freights for starving stock. Then when our primary producers get out of their difficulties, and set about increasing the number of their live stock, we employ a huge organization known as the Income Tax Department to devise legal schemes to extract as much as possible from those who work, " from jackass to jackass." This business should be stopped. If we pass the bill in its present form we shall never be able to say truthfully that we are anxious to increase the number or quality of live stock in Australia. I disagree entirely with my leader when he says that " we " own the cattle, sheep, and other live stock in Australia. It is a misuse of terms to speak of " our" stock, " our" wheat, or " our " country. As a matter of fact, some of us are only allowed to live by paying rent regularly every Monday morning. My amendment seeks to give some real, tangible, and permanent relief to a very deserving section of the community. </para>

The fact that "capital assets " were excluded show that under the principal act there was no intention to tax anything iri the nature of capital. This provision appears to go considerably further. We have been told that these amendments are proposed with the object of making the act clearer. They will probably result in greater confusion. If the courts were asked to give an opinion, they would hold that it is not an income  tax act at all, and the Government would find itself in the same difficulty as it did when it attempted to tax profits arising from the sale of leaseholds. </para>

I understand that the courts have held that profits arising from a sale are subject to income tax if the thing sold " was acquired with the intention of re-selling at a profit. We are merely endeavouring to bring the law into conformity with that judgment of the High Court. The governing factor is the purpose for which the asset was acquired. Surely " trafficking" means buying and selling? </para>

                        <para>- Apparently the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> is that, if a man buys something costly once a year, and sells it the day after he buys it, even though he bought it with the object of selling it, he should not be taxed; but if, on the other hand, he buys half-a-dozen or a dozen things for the purpose of making  a profit, he should be taxed. I cannot see  why  every such transaction should  not  be taxed if  the  purchase is made with  the  intention of selling at a profit. The number of transactions does  not  affect  the  fact  that  it is trading. I think it is safer to stick to  the  words at present in  the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I think  that  if  the Minister  consults  the  Commissioner he  will  find  that  I, carrying on business as a solicitor, am taxable in regard to  any  profit  that  I make  from that  business;  but  if I saw a piece of land down the bay which I thought would be suitable for the erection of a weekend residence, and bought it, I would not be trafficking if I re-sold it at a profit in  a  year or two, even though it had been bought for the purpose of re-selling at some future date. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the case. If one purchases a block of land or a house a deduction from one's income is not allowed. If that land is sold at a profit, the extra sum realized is not income, but an accretion to capital, and should not be taxed. Those who make a practice of buying and selling land or houses are taxed on the difference between the buying and the selling price. It is then their business from which they derive their income. There is the further point that if it is the intention of this bill to tax transactions of that sort, such action will be constitutionally invalid, because it will be an attempt to tax capital. </para>

                    <para>.-' I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has failed to understand the meaning of this provision. He wandered away from the intention of the clause, and dealt with a supposititious transaction. The object of the clause is to clearly define what assets shall be taxable when the profits from their sale are divided amongst shareholders by way of bonus shares or dividends: The original section provides that profits arising out of the sale of capital assets are not liable to be taxed when they have been distributed in the shape of a dividend or bonus. The clause in the bill is clearer. It gives the Commissioner of Taxation power to collect the tax where assets have been divided after their sale if they have been acquired for the purpose of re-sale at  a  profit. I think the Commissioner should have that power. </para>

                    I am sure that it is not the intention of the Government to impose a tax on capital assets or on what may be legitimately described as an accretion of capital assets. If a man makes a habit of buying land and selling it at a profit, and every time he buys land does so with the definite purpose of selling it as early as possible at a profit, whatever he derives as profit in that way may be correctly described as income.

It is possible, however, under the clause that a man who acquires land or other assets, and hopes in due course to make a profit, may be described as one who has acquired the land or other assets for the purpose of re-sale at a profit. I think the intention could be made clearer by employing the words " trafficking in such assets." </para>

It could not be said to be trading or trafficking in that land.

                    <para>. -  This is a subtle amendment, and I have no doubt the honorable senator ha? moved it with the best of intentions, but I am informed by the Commissioner of Taxation' that it would entirely defeat the object of this portion of the bill. The amendments to paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> axe necessary for the effective operation of the amendments proposed in section 21 of the principal act. The paragraph which is being amended relates to the assessment of taxpayers, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> company shareholders, , in respect of their dividends ; the object being to exclude the dividends if the taxpayer pays at ls. or less, and to give the taxpayer a rebate of ls. in the £1 where his rate exceeds ls. If a company were a shareholder in another company and its income consisted entirely of dividends from that company, it would not be a taxpayer, because its rate of tax would not exceed1s. in the £1. This fact would interfere with the application of section 21 of the act to the shareholders of the holding company in respect of any additional profit which the primary company might have distributed, but which it withheld from distribution. That indicates the clanger of the amendment; and, as I am sure the honorable senator does not wish to defeat the object the Government have in view, I trust he will not press it. </para>

No person should be called upon to pay a tax on expenses incurred by reason of sickness in his family.

                        <para>- Notwithstanding the promise of the Treasurer, the amount of taxable income in respect of which the deduction is to be allowed is only £600. No amount should be stipulated. Sickness overtakes all sections of the community, and many persons incur very heavy medical expenses. I do not say that they are unjust, but they are undoubtedly very heavy. By taxing the unfortunate person who is called upon to pay these expenses, as well as those who receive the fees, we are placing a double tax on the community. Last session we exempted from taxation a person's home, whether small or large. If that was a legitimate exemption, medical expenses have a greater claim to exemption. I appeal to the committee to assist me to carry this amendment, to which I hope the Government will agree. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley'</inline> bias moved this amendment. If we are to exempt medical expenses from taxation, that exemption should he general. There is no way by which we can avoid these expenses, which may occur at any time. The case is different from fees paid for admission to amusements, which are in the nature of luxuries. When sickness comes, deep inroads are often made into a man's income. I can see no reason for limiting the clause to a person whose income does not exceed £600. A man may receive £610, and not be exempt, yet he may be called upon to pay £200 for a single operation. I have pleasure in supporting the amendment. </para>

Only two states - Victoria , and Western Australia - provide for any deduction for medical expenses. Already the Government has agreed to the taxpayers being relieved of taxation to the extent of £2,000,000. If we give way to every consideration of sympathy it will upset our budget calculations.

That deduction was made because it was recognized that it was wise for a man to make provision for his wife and children in the event of his death. If it is wise to encourage a person to insure his life, it is also wise to encourage him to retain his health and strength so that he may live longer, and thus for a greater period be a taxpayer. From a purely selfish point of view, it is desirable that every encouragement should be given to taxpayers to obtain the best medical attention possible for themselves and family. </para>

                        <para>- A man whose taxable income is over £600 is liable to be' called upon to pay heavier medical fees than a man whose income is much less. The financial position of the patient is taken into consideration by medical practitioners. I know of cases where men with incomes of more than £600 per annum have had such heavy medical expenses that they have really in some years received no income at all. The limitation of £600 does not seem to be justified. If we could ensure to the man whose taxable income is £650 that he would obtain medical attention at the same rate as the man whose income is £300, I should not adopt this attitude ; but I know that medical fees are charged according to a man's ability to pay. To increase the amount of the taxable income, to which the deduction should apply, beyond £600. would not make much difference to the department. It would afford relief to many deserving .cases. Quite a number <inline font-style="italic">rf</inline> persons whose taxable income exceeds £600 a year are, through unfortunate circumstances due to illness in the family, in grave financial difficulties, and should have relief. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope the committee will adopt the amendment. The Minister has put up the plea that a man with a taxable income of £600 is in a pretty good position, and should not receive further exemption. I remind the committee that a deduction of £50 is allowable to all taxpayers for each child under the age of sixteen years. Why should not we extend the same relief to all taxpayers, irrespective of income, in connexion with medical and surgical expenses incurred on behalf of their wives, and children under the age of 21 years? Sentor Findley has reminded us that, irrespective of income, a deduction is allowable in respect of a taxpayer's home. Formerly the Government levied 5 per cent. on its capital value but now every home is free of federal taxation without regard to the taxable income of the owner. There is another profession to which so many people in Australia pay tribute. I refer to dentists. Taxpayers' should also be allowed to deduct dental fees. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> I am surprised that the Government did not agree to it forthwith. It is extraordinary that deductions should be allowable in respect of agricultural implements, machinery, utensils, and rolling-stock, and not for a man's wife and children. Under the law as it stands, if a man is the unfortunate possessor of a taxable income exceeding £600 a year, and if through misfortune his medical expenses for any financial year amount to £750, he is not entitled to deduct one penny. If, on the other hand, he is the fortunate owner of a Ford traction engine, and spends money on its repair, he is permitted to make a deduction. Obviously, the Government regards a Ford traction engine as of more value to the community than the wife or children of a taxpayer. It is scandalous that the Government should, in the matter of deductions, place beasts of burden, and rolling-stock, utensils, and machinery, before a taxpayer's wife and children. Our duty is to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> amendment, and insist on deductions being allowable in respect of medical expenses for the wives and children of taxpayers. . </para>

                    <para>. - This clause amends section 24 of the act by increasing the amount of income exempt from income tax from £200 a year to £300. It does not go far enough. It is not generally known that when a taxpayer's income reaches a certain amount the exemption ceases to be operative. The salaries of the Governor-General and of all the state Governors are exempt from taxation. Many people are of the opinion that members of the Federal Parliament are not called upon to pay the federal income tax. That is a mistake. </para>

He knows exactly what we are getting, and we have to pay accordingly. The federal land tax provides for an exemption of  £5,000,  whether an estate be worth  £50,000  or  £500,000.  Under the Income Tax Act of New South Wales every taxpayer has an exemption of  £250  no matter what his income may be. It is a popular, but erroneous opinion, that the federal exemption of  £200  applies to all incomes. Section  24  of the principal act, however, clearly lays it down that such is not the case. It provides - </para>

A simple calculation shows that when the income of the victim reaches a certain amount he or she does not get the benefit of any exemption. In my opinion every taxpayer should be allowed an exemption of  £300.  There does riot appear to me to be any tangible reason for its gradual extinction. I know that it is a part of the general propaganda that was foisted upon Australia by Knibbs and Company, under the Income Tax Assessment Act, with its multiplicity of curves and other eccentricities. i It ought to be abandoned so that the taxpayers would know exactly what they had to pay. The majority of honorable senators, if asked to do so, could not figure out what the tax should be upon a specified income. That ought not to be the case. I do not offer any objection to the raising of the exemption from  £200  to  £300,  but I wish to see whether the omission of the provision which enables the Commissioner to apply the vanishing principle is favoured by the committee.

A person whose assessment is reduced so that he becomes entitled to a refund of any amount paid by him in excess of the amount of tax properly payable by him, shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the amount of the refund, interest at the rate of Six pounds per centum per annum on the amount of the refund calculated from the date when the person paid the amount to be refunded until the date when the refund is made to him.'

                <para>Cases have occurred in which the taxpayer has been compelled to pay the amount of tax demanded from him before he could appeal against . his assessment. When the appeal has eventually been heard, and it has been proved that his assessment was too high, a refund of a portion of the amount paid by him has been ordered ; but in many cases this refund is made a considerable time after the demand of the department for the payment of the tax has been met. It seems to me only reasonable that when a taxpayer's money which has been held for any length of time is returned to him, it should be accompanied by a certain amount of interest. The Royal Commission on Taxation in its third report, dated 1922, recommended as follows :  - </para>

                <para>The Taxes Management Act of Great Britain, 1880, makes provision that in  the event of the amount of the assessment being altered by an order or judgment of the court, the difference in amount, if too much has been paid, is returned to the taxpayer with such interest as the court may allow. Backed up by the opinion of the royal commission and a provision in a British act, I think I am justified in submitting this new clause. It is only a fair request that when a taxpayer's money is held by the department for any considerable time the department should pay a reasonable rate of interest on it. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is correct in saying that the royal commission had made a similar proposal to his, but the Government, having considered the matter, decided not to accept the recommendation for the following reasons: -  fi). The Parliament has authorized the Commissioner of Taxation to permit taxpayers to delay payment of tax if the circumstances reasonably justify, that course. The Commissioner does not charge interest on the outstanding tax or make the payment of interest a condition of the extension of time to pay. (2). The law imposes a penalty on any taxpayer who underpays tax through the omission of income from his return, but authorizes the Commissioner to waive the penalty, wholly or in part, if he thinks the circumstances warrant that course. </para>

                <para>The Commissioner does not impose the penalty in any case in which the taxpayer brings under the notice of the department the omission of income, and in many other cases the Commissioner waives the penalty if the taxpayer gives  a  reasonable explanation. </para>

                    amendment makes no similar distinction, but would require payment of interest on all refunds, even though the overpayment may have been due to an incorrect return lodged by the taxpayer, as is the case in the great majority of instances. Even if. refunds may arise from judgments of the court, interest is not more properly payable by the department than would be the case if the department sought to charge a penalty on taxpayers who may have underpaid because of a judgment of the court showing that more tax could have been demanded. There is one such judgment now operating in that way in connexion with the War-time Profits Tax. In the early days of federation, when it was assumed  that federal legislators were taxable in the state in which they resided, I made an overpayment of income tax to the State Government of

                <para class="block">Victoria, but it was my own fault. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> amendment had been the Victorian law at the time, I would have been paid interest on an overpayment for which I was solely responsible. I ask the committee not to accept the amendment. The taxpayer is not charged interest, and I do not think it is fair that in the case of a refund the Government should be put in a worse position than the taxpayer who has been found by the court to have underpaid his tax. </para>

                    <para>. - A person from whom a large sum is demanded by the department derives very little satisfaction in knowing that as. an offset against the amount he has been temporarily overcharged, taxpayers who have not paid their taxes have been penalized. I have before me particulars of an appeal in which £2,0291s. 6d. more than could legitimately be demanded was held by the department for a considerable period, and, although, this amount was not available to the appellant until a decision was given in hie favour, no interest was paid. There may be many similar cases, although the amounts involved may not have been so large, but it is not fair to take sums in excess of the legitimate tax, and then decline to pay interest. I inadvertently omitted to state that the Roy al Commission on Taxation recommended, in addition to what I have already quoted, that interest should be added to overdue payments, and if the Government will submit an amendment in that direction, I shall support it. I trust the committee will agree to my amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> because I, too, know of cases in which the department has held fairly large sums for over two years. I think, however, the honorable senator should be satisfied in protesting, which may have the effect of expediting departmental procedure. To pay interest in these cases would be to establish a precedent in departments such as the Department of Trade and Customs, which, I think, would be dangerous. </para>

Where  under  any  contract  agreement or arrangement  made or  entered  into  in writing or verbally, either before or after the commencement of this  act,  a  person  assigns, conveys, transfers  or  disposes of an income-producing  asset on  terms  and  conditions which include  the  payment for  the  assignment, conveyance, transfer  or  disposal of  the  asset  by  periodical  payments which, in the opinion of the Commissioner,  are really in  the  nature of income of  the  person assigning, conveying, transferring or disposing of  the asset, that,  person  shall be assessed to pay  income tax upon those periodical payments.'" </para>

                <para class="block">The practice is rapidly spreading of producing assets being sold to companies incorporated expressly for the purpose of taking over assets. The selling price of the assets is fixed by the vendor at an extraordinarily high figure. In one or two cases which have come under notice the selling price in each instance has been fixed at slightly less than £500,000. The terms of payment to the vendor are extended and obviously fixed so that he will continue to receive, in the form of instalments of purchase money, at least the same amount that he would have received as income had he retained the source of income to himself. That is an ingenious method of defeating income tax. The law would treat that as a sale of an estate, whereas it is nothing of the kind. It is passing the estate on to a company which guarantees to the man proceeds equal to his present income from it. To defeat this attempt to evade the act it has been found necessary to introduce this new clause. </para>

                <para class="block">In my second-reading speech' I explained why this amendment should be accepted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has since answered at some length the arguments I then put forward, but I do not think that he has placed before the committee much that necessitates any comment at my hands. I merely reiterate that I, personally, am against all retrospective legislation on principle. I am opposed to this retrospective legislation for the same reason. There are one or two aspects of the matter to which I desire to refer. If these profits which it is now proposed to tax had been distributed on the 30th June, 1922, they would escape taxation under this clause, but if they had been distributed on the 1st July, 1.922, they would be taxable. If the law said that on the 30th June, 1922, these profits were not taxable, and, in accordance with the law, they were distributed, they should not now be subject to taxation because they were distributed one day later. If they were distributed yesterday, and the law then allowed them to be distributed free from taxation, we should not say to-day that what was rightly done yesterday was wrong. The principle is perfectly clear, and I distinguish between it and the ordinary retrospective effect of income tax legislation, because by this bill we are creating a new source of income taxation. Something which never before has been income we now say shall be income. We are perfectly justified in saying that from to-day it shall be income, but we are not justified in saying that past payments in this regard shall be regarded as income for the purpose of taxation. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> amendment is accepted we shall say that in all other classes of income a person shall pay income tax this year on the income he derived last year, but that in regard to this particular form of income that will not be the case. </para>

                    <para class="block">Gome in every income tax act. If the amendment is agreed to there will be no taxation of last year's income in respect of this particular class of income. Not until the assessments for 1924-5 could this class of taxation be levied. If that were the case, it would enable shareholders in a company, either private or public, to escape income tax on any bonus shares issued to them at any time out of profits derived by the company during the financial year 1922-3. It is to be noted that the company would be assessed on those profits in the year 1923-4, and it would be liable to pay income tax at1s. in the £1 on those profits. The shareholders would, of course, receive a. rebate of1s. in the £1 on any cash dividends received by them from the company, when their individual rates of tax exceed1s. in the £1. But it must be remembered that section 21 of the act might be found to be applicable to the company, because it might not have distributed a reasonable proportion of its profits, and because its actual cash dividends may not amount to two-thirds of the profits. The Commissioner would then proceed to apply section 21 of the act to the company, with' the object of securing payment from it of the additional tax which the shareholders would have paid, if a further distribution had been made as determined by the Commissioner under section 21. The company might then argue that it proposed to make an additional distribution by way of bonus shares, and if the proposed amendment in the paragraph were made, it would then contend that, as those bonus shares would be exempt the Commissioner should not claim payment by the company of any additional tax under section 21. It was because of this position being a probability, that the Government inserted, sub-paragraph 3 in paragraph h  of clause 4. An examination of subparagraph 3 will show that the shareholders of the company are to be entitled to escape tax on bonus shares which are distributed to them out of one-third of the company's profits, upon which the company will have paid tax at1s. in the £1, and which are not to be subject to any additional tax in the hands of the company through the operation of section 21. This sub-paragraph necessarily mentions the year in which the income is derived by the company, whereas sub-paragraph 2 refers to an assessment year, that is the year in which the company pays the tax. The proposed amendment to sub-paragraph 2 would not be fair to the revenue or to other taxpayers generally. It cannot, therefore, be accepted by the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I had. hoped that the Minister would accept this amendment, as unless some such amendment is made, considerable difficulty will be experienced. It often happens that shares are the subject of settlements whereby the income arising from the shares is given to one set of persons and the corpus to another set of persons. It has been held by the courts that when bonus shares are issued they become part of the corpus. In cases like that, what will happen if trustees are compelled to pay income tax on those shares? It will be possible in the future for trustees to make arrangements to meet such cases, but where the distribution has been made, and have become part of the capital, who will be assessed for that income? </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order. I submit that the honorable senator is not in order, because his amendment does not amend any section of the principal act. The honorable senator has missed his opportunity. An amendment to an amending bill of this kind must either be to insert a new clause, following some clause of the bill dealing with a specific subject, or it must amend some section of the principal act. </para>

We amended the principal act at the instigation of the Government in 1928 by exempting from taxation calls paid on oil shares. ' The Minister, in reply, made a good deal of the fact that whilst I had condemned retrospective legislation, my own proposal, now before (he committee, was exactly in the same category. </para>

My amendment will not affect the big mines, because they are dividend-paying propositions, and come under the ordinary provisions of income tax law. It will apply more particularly to mines in other states than New South Wales, where,  generally speaking, such concerns are well developed and are working efficiently. In the other states, however, serious difficulties are being encountered in the early stages of mining development, and as it is not likely that many of the ventures Will be showing a profit for some time to come, the capital required for their development is being obtained in calls. The money passes from the control of the men who own it, and is being used for the payment of wages to coal miners employed in the development of what may be, for some time, unprofitable ventures. </para>

                        <para>- I pointed out in my second-reading speech that many persons were induced to invest in mining ventures by reason of the fact that, under the original act, coal-mining shares were exempt, and that a definite promise was given that this exemption would 'be continued. This amending bill repudiates that undertaking, and as a result those investors have not had a definite warning, and have had no opportunity whatever to get rid of their investments if they wished to, or to refrain from putting in additional capital. My object is to give to them that due notice which, should have been given, by the Government when it brought down this amending legislation. The amendment provides merely that those who made investments on the definite undertaking that calls would be exempt shall be placed in as good a position as they would have occupied had warning been given to them that the exemption was to be withdrawn. I think it is a perfectly reasonable proposition. It will be in the interests of the small men in the industry. The action of the Government had the effect of closing down a number of mines, and if it is now reversed other mines will be opened, greater employment will be provided, the production of coal will be larger, and possibly the price of coal to other industries will be lowered. </para>

                        <para>- All this talk about assisting the struggling miner, to enable him to prospect for coal, is beside the question. It is intended to meet the case of some persons who were assessed in respect of income earned in the year prior to that in which the act came into force. That is always the case with income tax legislation. Three years later we are asked to go back, and for that particular year make an exception in the case of these persons. Why should we? If it is right to except that year, it is right to except every year. This is retrospective legislation of the worst kind, and I ask the committee not to agree to it. </para>

Its value is as great, in the direction of providing employment and aiding our other industries, as is mining for oil or rare minerals. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> will make the principle of general application, I cannot see why the Ministry should oppose it. I shall have great pleasure in supporting it. Recently, one of the few coal mines, that we have in Victoria was closed down, after £12,000 had been paid in calls. If some slight encouragement had been given in the way of a remission of income tax, that mine might have carried on for a year or two longer, and provided employment for many miners. </para>
