                    <para>I am not prepared to answer that offhand, because, obviously, it does not come within the purview of the Home and Territories Department. But inquiries are being made to ascertain the facts. The next question is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Was it upon the tender of the Boucaut Bay Co. that the <inline font-style="italic">Huddersfield</inline> was chosen to receive a Government subsidy for the Northern Territory service? Upon what date were tenders called, and upon what date were they accepted? Was the offer of the <inline font-style="italic">Huddersfield</inline> accepted at &#163;5,000 per annum, and was the subsidy proposed, then, or at any time, varied in amount? If any increased subsidy was granted, how much of the annual mileage which tenderers were asked to guarantee had been covered? How much mileage had been covered when the vessel left on the <inline font-style="italic">Douglas Mawson</inline> expedition ? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The reply to that, compiled from the departmental files, is as follows: - Tenders for the coastal shipping service of the Northern Territory were called for by public advertisement on the  12th  December,  1923,  the closing date being fixed for the  7th  January,  1924.  The acceptance of the tender of the Boucaut Bay Company Limited, to carry out the service with two vessels, for a subsidy at the rate of  &#163;6,000  per annum, was approved by Cabinet on the  14th  March,  1924.  There was no variation of or increase in the rate of subsidy. The company had submitted two alternative tenders, one for the employment of one vessel for a subsidy of  &#163;5,000  per annum, and the other for the employment of two vessels for a subsidy of  &#163;6,000  per annum. It was the latter tender that was accepted. The <inline font-style="italic">Huddersfield</inline> had undergone a satisfactory speed trial, under the supervision of the Commonwealth Navigation Service, prior to the acceptance of the tender. The tender was accepted conditionally upon a clean certificate being issued by the Commonwealth Navigation Service and upon certain improvements in the vessel&#39;s accommodation being effected. These conditions were duly complied with. At the date on which the <inline font-style="italic">Huddersfield</inline> sailed from Darwin with the relief expedition, that vessel had not carried out any voyages under the coastal shipping service agreement, but a number of voyages had been made by the contractor&#39;s second vessel and another vessel chartered by the contractors. Particulars of the mileage covered on those voyages are being obtained from the Administrator. It is understood that the Elcho Island Naphtha Petroleum Company, which comprises about60,000 shareholders, holds  250  shares in the Boucaut Bay Company Limited, but that these shares were not allotted until after the latter company had secured the coastal shipping service contract. I now come to a matter that is very much more serious; not because a direct statement is made, but because the obvious inference intended to be conveyed is of a grave character. The paragraph asks - </para>

                        <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> also states that it has ascertained that Captain Walter L.  Smallhorn,  clerk in charge of the Northern Territory Affairs Department, resides in Coppin-street, East Malvern. The Melbourne telephone directory gives the address of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as Park-street, South Yarra. The addresses of the Elcho and Boucaut companies are 440 little Collins-street. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I say that the inference intended to be drawn is that the shares held in the name of &#34; Pearc&#169; &#34; are held by me or by somebody acting for me, or by relatives of mine. I wish to inform the Senate that Percy Whyte Pearce is absolutely unknown to me. He is not connected with me or with my wife in any way, and he is unknown to both of us; but I have already set afoot investigations to discover who he is, and whether he is in any way connected with a Commonwealth department. The name &#34;Elizabeth Maud Pearce&#34; should . be &#34; Eliza Maud Pearce.&#34; That is the name of my wife, who has 50 shares, paid up to 10s., in the Elcho Island Oil Company, called in the newspaper article the Elcho Island Naphtha Petroleum Company. Those shares were purchased in December, 1923 . Inquiries are being made by the department to ascertain when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smallhorn  purchased the shares that are registered in his name, and under what conditions and for what consideration they were purchased. I am not yet able to make a statement regarding those shares. But in regard to the shares held by my wife, I want to say that they were purchased by her before either she or I had any knowledge of even a proposal to form the Boucaut Bay Company, or of any possible connexion between that company and the Elcho Island Oil Company. It appears from the newspaper report that these two companies during or after their formation agreed to an exchange of shares. According to the information in the pos- session of the department, the Elcho Island Oil Company comprises 60,000 shareholders, and it holds 250 shares in the Boucaut Bay Company. According to the newspaper article the Boucaut Bay Company holds 2,500 shares in the Elcho Island Oil Company. But those shares were not allotted until after the Boucaut Bay Company had obtained the shipping contract. Of course, the inference intended to be conveyed in this article is that these shares were not obtained in the ordinary way, by purchase, but that they were a gift to enable that company to obtain the shipping contract. If that is the inference intended to be conveyed in regard to the shares held by my wife, I stigmatize it as a lie and a slander. I wish that the Standing Orders would permit me to use even stronger terms. If this newspaper had had the courage to put the matter in such a way as to say plainly what it evidently wishes the public to infer, I should have had a remedy which would enable me in any court of law in this country to prove my bona fides. I should then have put this newspaper in the position of having to defend in a court of law the inference behind which it has sheltered itself in this cowardly way. The matter of the shares held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smallhorn  does not come within my knowledge, but I met the secretary of the. department this morning, and drew his attention to the statement, with the result that inquiries are now being made. I may say, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smallhorn  is in charge of a branch of the Home and Territories Department which deals with Northern Territory administrative matters, whereas the relations of the department with the Elcho Island Oil Company are dealt with, not by that branch, but by the Lands Branch , with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smallhorn  has no connexion whatever. The licence to this Oil Company was issued through another officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hicks,</inline> who is the senior officer in charge of the Lands Branch. It is also only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smallhorn  to say that the recommendations made to me in regard to the shipping contract were made by the secretary to the department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLaren,</inline> and these recommendations were made only after trial and survey, and examination of the ship by the officers of the navigation staff, who satisfied <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLaren</inline> and myself that they had given a certificate which would enable us to recommend the contract to the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">In the committee stage, when through a misapprehension I withdrew this amendment, I partly indicated that I considered the power given by paragraph c absolutely unnecessary. I have now to add that I consider the paragraph irrelevant to the bill. If it were a measure to constitute a commission to inquire into matters of industry and commerce generally, such a paragraph might rightly find a place in it, but it is quite irrelevant to a bill which is merely for the creation of a Tariff Board, and for the definition of the powers to be conferred on that board, having always in mind the fact that the powers conferred are to be exercised only in connexion with tariff matters. During the first part of this session this board had to approach Parliament to allow its numbers to be increased so that it would be in a better position to deal with all the work placed upon its shoulders. That being the case, if we place still further work on its shoulders, what is it to do? The paragraph should not find a place in the bill, nor should inquiries of the sort alluded to be within the scope of a Tariff Board. It is altogether distinct from its functions, and if the Government wish to obtain information on these more or less general subjects which have nothing to do with the tariff, they should appoint some other authority. I have yet to learn that the gentlemen comprising the board, well acquainted as they are with tariff matters, have any special qualifications for the duties sought to be conferred upon them under this paragraph. For these reasons, which are brief but cogent, I have moved that paragraph c be left out. </para>

                        <para>- If that is so my amendment is in order, and I shall be able to say all I desire at this stage. On a recent occasion, when this matter engaged the attention of the Senate, evidence was submitted by various organizations to show that the proposal contained in this clause enables the board to hold its meetings in private, and to quietly, effectually, and permanently ruin the businesses of certain citizens. No attempt whatever was made by honorable senators opposite to disprove the arguments which were then advanced. I intimated that the paper-box manufacturers, those engaged in the printing trade, the members of the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce, and the members of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, had a strong objection to the present method of conducting inquiries. Doubtless the people of the Commonwealth are pledged to high duties for a considerable period, and the supporters of a protectionist policy favour such a procedure. merely to make certain that the bulk of taxation shall be raised from duties on imported goods. </para>

                        <para>- I am doing so, and am endeavouring to convince honorable senators of the necessity for all&#39; inquiries conducted by the board being held in public. Only recently I stated that at least four manufacturers in New South Wales were compelled to discontinue the particular businesses in which they were engaged owing to the action of the board. Just imagine a board having the impertinence to allow certain goods to enter the Commonwealth free of duty for only one day. Proper notice of such action should have been given to the public to enable every one who so desired the opportunity to import free of duty the goods they required. Whether the duties imposed be high or low, they should be fixed by Parliament, so that the interests of every one may be safeguarded. If that were done, every one would know the penalty to be paid by those who. dare to import from countries in which low wages are paid. Why should prospective or present manufacturers have the right to confer in secret with the board and suggest the imposition of higher duties? Under the tariff it is distinctly provided that importers of motor cars shall pay import duties ranging from &#163;50 to &#163;70 on each car, which means that the price to the purchaser is increased to that extent. Those who purchase motor cars realize what they are doing, and objectionable as the duty is, it is not nearly so objectionable as is this system under which one is suddenly confronted with the fact that higher duties have been imposed as the result of recommendations made by the board. The same position arises whether the goods dealt with are motor cars or pianos. I am informed that a certain religious denomination intends to import a very large bell, costing probably &#163;3,000. </para>

                    <para>. - If anything in the bill should be retained it is the paragraph under discussion. I understand that, when I was speaking yesterday, some disappointment was felt by several honorable senators opposite because in my references to the earlier speeches of certain honorable gentlemen concerning this measure, I singled out ex-Senator Pratten, now Minister for Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> and the Government Whip in this chamber, . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> I entirely overlooked opinions expressed previously by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> now an Honorary Minister in this Government. I also ignored <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> and failed to take note of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> had said. I propose now to make good that omission. Appropriately enough their remarks on a former occasion had to deal with this identical section of the act, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> did not employ language quite so strong as that used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> yesterday, his views, nevertheless, were emphatically expressed. It appears that the board went to Queensland to inquire into the sugar industry. </para>

I refer to the general principle, and our experience of protection. Ex-Senator Earle, as I have shown, declared that all members of the board were good protectionists.

                    <para>I intend to make some reference to statements in the report of the Tariff Board, which, to me, is a most surprising document. When the proposed duty of l?d. per pound was referred to the board, I thought it would make an exhaustive inquiry before reporting to Parliament; but, so far as one can gather from this document, the only investigation the board has made has been to read the report of the two Royal Commissions one of which inquired into the industry in1911-12, and the other in 1919. The only quotations made from those two reports are portions that tell against the industry - </para>

                        <para>- To me the speech which the honorable sena.tor delivered yesterday differed greatly from that which he delivered in 1922, and there is now also a difference in his attitude towards the board. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> will do what he wants to do by striking out paragraph c. If the board is to conduct inquiries, no legislative barriers should be placed in its way. It might happen that the information required could be obtained in the very place which this amendment would prevent the board from visiting. Although, on general principles, I am prepared, as Leader of the Opposition, to do anything to harass, to annoy, and to upset the Government, I am not prepared to mar further a bill that is already bad. This bill is bad, because it embodies the principle that interference in the management of business is to be allowed. Under that principle an industry may find that its arrangements for the conduct of its business are upset by a decision which it has never anticipated. Let me imagine a private business making arrangements for the supply of a certain quality of any given material - cardboard boxes, for example. It bases its estimates upon the existing tariff. Then some person who is disappointed at not having been given the tender makes the charge that the material used by its successful rival is being dumped into. Australia. </para>

I admit that that was within the scope of the tariff. It also very carefully investigated the question of forming wheat pools - including, I think,, a pool in Western Australia. Is there any objection to this provision remaining in the bill ? </para>

                    <para>. - It cuts me to the heart to refuse a request that is made in such a delightful way, and with that engaging smile that illumines the features of the honorable senator. But I cannot now, any more than I could when I moved the amendment, see that these duties pertain to the board. I do not intend to withdraw the amendment, because I consider that the paragraph is irrelevant to the bill, and it means the engagement of these gentlemen - who, we are informed, are so busy that they scarcely have time to turn round - upon work that does not rightly belong to them, and has no connexion with the tariff. I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that there is a whole army of civil servants available to do this work at any time without extra remuneration. </para>

                        <para>. - The methods by which the affairs of the Commonwealth Territories are administered make one wonder whether one is still living in the dark ages. During my recent visit to the tropics I had no opportunity of making myself familiar with any considerable portion of those Territories, and, therefore, my personal knowledge of them is necessarily limited. It is somewhat interesting to take a glance at what has happened in recent years. It will be remembered that when, in 1883, the Queensland Government took the far-reaching step of annexing the whole of the southern coast of New Guinea from the 141st meridian right to East Cape, for some reason which has never been explained to me, but which was probably due to the secret diplomacy then so prevalent in Europe, the British Government disallowed the annexation. Fortunately, however, wiser counsels prevailed in 1884, during which year, Great Britain decided to establish a protectorate over the southern coast of </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">New Guinea from the 141st to the 151st meridian. True to British traditions, having proclaimed itself a protector of the natives, Great Britain a few years later proclaimed the Territory as a British possession. I invite attention to what the British Government did at that time. It did not do what the Australian Government has done in connexion with the Mandated Territories. It gave the white residents of Papua a semblance of local government by appointing a lieutenant governor, an executive council, and a legislative council, and, furthermore, that most necessary and appropriate adjunct, a Native Regulation Board. I suppose that Great Britain was influenced to do this by its experience in America. When the people of England attempted to enforce upon the American colonists certain laws which were distasteful to them, the colonists were strong enough, numerous enough, and determined enough to declare that they would tolerate no interference in their government. The insane attitude taken up by Great Britain at that time lost to the Empire, presumably for all time, the whole of the country which now forms the United States of America. The form of Government granted by Great Britain to British New Guinea would not appeal to the average Australian, who insists, very properly, upon full adult suffrage, and although it may not be wise at the present time to confer full adult suffrage upon the aborigines of New Guinea, I hope that at the earliest possible moment the white people of Papua will have the same voice in their government as is permitted to the people of the various states of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that the population is now in the neighbourhood of 2,000. According to the last figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician there were 1,264 white people in Papua on the 4th April, 1921, and on the day on which the census was taken the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Mataram</inline> was in Papuan waters with 79 passengers and crew. The point I make is that the moment the British Government proclaimed British New Guinea as a British possession, it gave the country some form of local government, a step which we have not yet  taken in connexion with our Mandated Territory in late German New Guinea. Under the Papua Act of 1905, the Commonwealth accorded to the residents of Papua some form of local government, and now this amending bill proposes, very properly, to give those people additional representation. They reside in a country considerably larger than the State of Victoria. Men who have visited Papua assure us that it is immensely fertile. We are occasionally informed that oil has been discovered there. We know that there are excellent timber resources in the Territory, and that some of its rivers are possibly as large as all the Australian rivers put together. For instance, the Fly River, which has not yet been fully explored, is a considerable stream. Lieutenant-Governor Murray is probably one of the best men who could be secured to fill the position he holds. I do not think we have heard any complaints about his administration. I am pleased to see that the principles advocated by Henry George, to which I occasionally make reference in this chamber, are in operation in Papua. No land can be alienated in fee simple. The rental of the leases is assessed on the unimproved capital value, and is subject to re-assessment at fixed periods. It reads like a paragraph or two out of <inline font-style="italic">Progress and Poverty.</inline> Unfortunately, the ideas that prevail in the Commonwealth in regard to Customs duties and taxation are also in operation in Papua, but I am hopeful that with an extension of the franchise even they may undergo some modification&#39;. According to the last figures, which are two years old, the. amount of Customs and excise duties paid in Papua is &#163;53,196, while the land revenue amounts to &#163;6,682. The land revenue is thus approximately one-ninth of the total Customs and excise revenue, whereas in Australia the &#34;owners&#34; are treated more leniently, for we collect only. &#163;2,000,000 from them as against &#163;36,000,000 collected from Customs and excise duties. I am pleased that the Government proposes to increase the strength of the Executive Council in Papua, and afford increased, representation to the white residents there, but I am at a complete loss to understand why it persistently refuses to extend the- same concession to other Australians who are situated just across the mountains of Papua. That, however, is another  question on which I may have something to say at another time. Meanwhile I welcome the additional representation proposed to be given to the white residents of Papua. The proposal does not go far enough. If the white residents of our Territory were given full adult suffrage they would merely secure the same rights and privileges that are accorded to the white people of the Commonwealth, and when the bill reaches the committee stage I shall ask honorable senators to widen the franchise applying in Papua. The time has completely vanished when any intelligent community should continue to limit representation in this way. Every white man and woman in Papua should have the opportunity afforded to every mau and woman in Australia. The residents of the Territory are undoubtedly of that most enterprising and virile type of people who are prepared to go into the wilds and do the actual pioneering work, and yet we are npt willing to extend to them a form- of government we ourselves enjoy. It is strange that those who have only been quite recently enfranchised should be most reluctant to extend the franchise to others. What is there about the Papuan white residents that we should be afraid to entrust them with the right to govern themselves? They are of exactly the same type that is to be found in the various states, and although all sorts of disasters were predicted when the franchise in Australia was widened to adult suffrage, nothing serious happened. Even in Great Britain there are tens of thousands of people who have no voice in the government of the country. In Australia, where some consider the franchise to be on a fairly liberal basis, there are persons who are justifiably prepared to advocate that all males and females attaining the age of eighteen years should be allowed to exercise the franchise. If we are willing to accept young men of eighteen years to carry arms in defence of our country we should allow them to have a voice in its government. I do not intend to oppose the bill, although the proposal of the Government in this instance is quite inadequate, but I shall endeavour in committee to move certain amendments, which, if agreed to, will considerably liberalize the franchise. </para>

In the opinion of some people the various Legislative Councils throughout the Commonwealth are excrescences, established and continued mainly with the object of opposing up-to-date legislation. Queensland is the only state which has mustered sufficient courage to abolish what is generally considered a useless branch of the legislature. Although the business in that state is all conducted in the one chamber, everything appears to be proceeding satisfactorily. </para>

As the white residents of Papua are intelligent, determined, virile, and worthy citizens they should have the right to elect the Legislative Council. Following very slowly upon the action taken by the British Government years ago, Parliament is now being asked to slightly alter the system of electing the local Assembly. </para>

                        <para>. - The committee will agree with me that the time has not yet arrived when we can introduce such a system in  the Territory, with a small white population scattered over an area which, as the honorable senator stated, is practically as large as Victoria. There are only 1,100 white residents. If the suggestion were adopted we should have to establish a complete electoral system, and appoint returning officers and other electoral officials. On page 652 of the <inline font-style="italic">CommonwealthYearBook</inline> of 1923, the white population of Papua in 1922 is shown as 1,104, made up as follows: - Government official employees, 132; commercial pursuits, 150; shipping, 124; tropical agriculture, 266; missionary work, 144; and mining, 159. Apart from the Government officials there are five groups of persons following different avocations, and it will be seen that there are five non-official members who represent the groups I have enumerated. We especially provide that the missions shall have one representative. The Lieutenant-Governor takes care that the persons appointed are thoroughly representative of the various sections of the people, and so far there has been no complaint about his choice. The time has not yet arrived for the establishment of an elective system for 1,100 people, scattered as they are over that vast territory and living in isolated places. It would be ridiculous to require the administration to set up an electoral system, with all the necessary machinery, but the time will come, and we hope speedily, when, as a result of development in Papua, we shall have an elective body to govern the people there. British history shows that the line of development is first a Crown colony with a Governor, then a nominated legislative council, then the inclusion of a certain number of elected representatives, and, finally, when there is a compact community, a full electoral system. The fact that we are nob providing this electoral machinery for Papua now does not suggest that we believe the people there to be less intelligent than people on the mainland. Up to the present there has been no demand for it. The people in Papua realize that it is not yet practicable. The same remark applies to the mandated territories. We hope shortly to bring forward a proposal for local self-government. Colonel Ainsworth&#39;s report indicates what should be the first step. His recommendation will receive the earnest consideration of the Government, but obviously we cannot establish a complete electoral system in a primitive community. I ask the committee to accept the proposal in the bill as the first step. </para>

                        <para>. - This is one of the most important measures that has come before the Senate. Without pretence, it is designed to relieve the Amalgamated Wireless Company of obligations entered into by it with the Commonwealth Government. Some years ago a company was formed, with a capital of &#163;1,000,000 in 1,000,000 shares, of which the Commonwealth Government took 500,001 shares, so as to have a. majority on the share register. Seven directors were appointed, three by the Commonwealth, three by the company, with a  chairman  to be elected by the other six directors or appointed by arbitration. Although the Amalgamated Wireless Company was apparently an Australian concern,, it was really linked up with the Marconi Company. Need I remind honorable senators of the suspicious circumstances surrounding wireless negotiations in. recent years, not only in Australia, but also in Great Britain? In the Mother Country the reputations of a number of men were impugned, and what happened in Australia showed clearly enough that the influence of the wireless combine was powerful and far-reaching. Many years ago the Commonwealth Government had presented to it a wireless patent system which was operated for some time under the direction of Father Shaw. Shortly afterwards the Telefunken Company brought an action against the Commonwealth for an infringement of its patent rights. Then the Marconi  Company became linked up in the action, and finally the latter was left to continue the fight. When the case came before the High Court, that tribunal declared that, as it was a highly technical dispute, independent evidence of a technical character was necessary to enable it to decide whether the Commonwealth system was an infringement of the Telefunken or Marconi patents. In my judgment all these &#34;companies are in reality the Marconi Company operating in different countries. The Marconi Company, as I have said, took action for an infringement by the Commonwealth Government of its patent rights. That action came before the High Court of Australia, which - decided that it must have information from an authoritative and competent source. The gentleman selected - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Swinburne - was, perhaps, one of the highest authorities in Great Britain. He came to Australia. He inspected the Commonwealth system of wireless. He could not wait for the trial, but he left sworn declarations stating that the Commonwealth system was not an infringement of the Marconi system, but was a 33 per cent, better system. Had those sworn affidavits been placed before the High Court the case would have been at an end, and the Marconi Company would have had to pay the whole of the expenses, including those incurred in bringing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> from England to Australia. But what happened? On the 5th September, 1914, the Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook was defeated at the polls, and on the 17th September, 1914, the Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher took office. In the interval between the 5th September and the 17th September, the retiring Government, through its Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> entered into an agreement with the Marconi Company, agreeing to pay to that company &#163;5,000 for certain patent rights, each party to defray its own costs in the action. The Minister has access to the files, and he can correct me if I am wrong in saying that that agreement was finalized after the defeat of the Government, and whilst it was in possession of tha sworn affidavits of the expert who was sent from Great Britain. I can imagine the excuse being put forward that we received certain concessions from the company in that they handed over to us their patent rights. To that I say that the Commonwealth Government paid to the Marconi Company &#163;5,000, and bore its share of the expenses - which the company would have had to bear if the case had been carried to a conclusion in the High Court - in return for patent rights that expired within six weeks. That is one of my earlier recollections of the Marconi Company in its dealings with Australia. No term was fixed by the agreement that was entered into by the Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> In 1921, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> brought before Parliament an agreement which he wanted Parliament to pass towards the end of the session. The proposal was fought, and eventually the agreement was referred to a parliamentary committee, of which the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was a member, and upon which there were members of the National party, the Country party, and the Labour party. The committee rejected the agreement and submitted a fresh one, which was signed in March, 1922. By clause 5 of the agreement the company was obliged - </para>

Although two and a half years have elapsed since the signing of that agreement, the company has done nothing in the way of carrying out the covenants to which it agreed. I want honorable senators to realize that if they pass this bill they will put that agreement out of existence. The Commonwealth Government, on the other hand, has paid to the company under the agreement &#163;112,000. I should like the Minister to tell honorable senators what the Commonwealth has received in return for that sum. I assert that the company has not done anything that it covenanted to do. It has taken over all our wireless systems, and the whole of the money that we agreed to pay under the agreement. Under clause 7 of the agreement, the Commonwealth has paid to the company &#163;139,959, while the amounts that have been paid to the Commonwealth by the company total &#163;51,000. The Government, therefore, is &#163;88,000 out of pocket at the present time. The company has failed to observe its part of the contract, as the schedule to the bill will show. It reads - </para>

I want from the Minister a very definite statement, setting out why such a huge sum of money was paid to this company when there were such good reasons, as he has advanced, for withholding payment, as the contract could not be carried out? Why has the company been permitted to call up the capital to the extent I have mentioned, and yet do nothing to perform its part of the contract? The representatives in Australia of Amalgamated Wireless Limited assured us that it was the easiest thing in the world to secure a licence to erect high power stations in Great Britain. </para>

                    <para class="block">Amalgamated Wireless Limited entered into an agreement with the Marconi Company for the erection of these stations, and received from that company the necessary guarantees. Successive British Governments, however, have opposed the efforts of the Marconi Company to secure the control of wireless in Great Britain. The company failed to secure a licence to erect stations in Great&#39; Britain. That fact alone should make the Senate pause before it releases the company from its obligations. To my mind the matter is so important that the Minister should withdraw the bill. He should immediately stand up and say that, in view of the conditions that obtain in Australia today, we should await further information before we pass a bill that will relieve this company from its obligations under an agreement into which it entered two years ago. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad that it has been and is a stumbling block. Wireless is so important that it should be kept out of the control of private companies, even though a dominion as great as Australia is a shareholder in one of those companies. I do not think that I need argue the matter at very great length. The Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, which was appointed in Great Britain this year, recommended that the state, through the post office, should own all wireless stations in Great Britain for communication with the overseas dominions, colonies, -protectorates, and territories. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> just now asked, &#34; What is the use of having a high-power station in Australia if the company cannot obtain permission to erect a high-power station in Great Britain ?&#34; I take it that the British Government itself will erect the stations in&#39; Great Britain. The main point is that because the British Government has not granted the concessions that the company maintained it could obtain, it wishes to be relieved from the obligations that were imposed by an agreement into which it entered. </para>

                            <para>- I know that there has been a good deal of press talk about the extraordinary possibilities of the beam system, but there is really nothing in it. Any one who has gone deeply into the matter will realize that it is akin to the propaganda that is indulged in when companies are being floated; there is nothing deep behind it. I do not think that honorable senators will regard, as facts, the statements that appear in newspapers and magazines in reference to the beam system. The great success of that system exists only in the imaginations of the gentlemen who write the articles in newspapers and magazines. I understand that the beam system is chiefly effective during the hours of darkness. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking as an expert, but having given the matter some attention, I think that it would be a mistake to place too much reliance on a system that has not- yet been proved to be a success. Further than that, the most ardent supporters of the beam system admit that it will operate only within the hours of darkness. Accepting the assurance of the Minister that the system is effective for one hour before and after darkness, how can there possibly be communication for seven hours a day between Great Britain and Australia, since when it is dark in Australia it is daylight on the other side of the world ? There seems to be no limit to scientific achievement in the matter of wireless communication, but all that we know at the present time is that the beam system has very little to recommend it. Certainly there is not sufficient in it to justify us in entering into a further agreement with this company, which, in its desire to be relieved of its responsibilities under the first agreement, now seeks to dazzle our eyes with the supposed wonders of the beam system. I regard the Marconi Company as an exploiting concern, whose whole history, if laid bare, would damn it in the eyes of any Parliament. It is a history of corruption and log-rolling. It has used Parliaments for its own ends, and because of that I am most reluctant to have anything to do with it. I shall, therefore oppose the bill, since it would relieve the company of the obligations it accepted two- and a half years ago under the first agreement. The one thing of which we are sure is that the company has drawn to the fullest possible extent on the money that the Commonwealth Government was required to advance. It has left the Government &#163;88,000 on the wrong side of the ledger, and in return for that sum it has done nothing that it undertook to do. The company should be regarded with suspicion. Its history justifies us in treating it as a company that cannot be given credit for honest dealings. I cannot forget the previous attitude of the company towards the Commonwealth when it endeavoured to prevent the establishment of an Australian system, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> the expert from England, declared to be 30 pea- cent, better than the Marconi system. The company&#39;s whole attitude should make those who desire to protect the interests of this country refuse to enter into any agreement with it. The patent which Australia received for &#163;5,000 expired after six weeks, and all the other patents had then expired, or were expiring, when sold to the Government. The proposed new agreement is most objectionable, since it will place the load of responsibility on the Australian taxpayer, and put the profits into the hands of this foreign company. </para>

                        <para>. - I am opposed generally to the agreement. I intend to draw the attention&#39; of the Senate to a number of facts with which it should be acquainted. The beam system of wireless telegraphy, which it is proposed to adopt, is put forward as something quite novel. Let me say that I have before me a patent specification that was taken out by the Marconi Company in 1917, when a patent was refused. This specification states: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This invention relates to an improvement in wireless telegraphy and telephony, and is based on  rellection  phenomena. By means of it the waves can be directed and confined to a predetermined direction, and reception can also be limited to waves proceeding from one direction. The advantages are as follows: - (1) Greater range of transmission; (2) Greater freedom from interference between stations working in the vicinity of each other; (3) The possibility of accurately determining the direction in which a transmitting station lies; (4) A lessening of all disturbances caused by the natural electrical perturbations of the atmosphere. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have quoted the principal part of the specification. Application was made on the 2nd May, 1919, in Australia, by the Marconi Company, for &#34; improvements in reflectors for use in wireless telegraphy and telephony.&#34; The description furnished by the company contains the following paragraph: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The invention relates to improvements in reflectors used with transmitters and receivers in wireless telegraphy and telephony. The use of a reflector for directing the energy of a wireless transmitter in any desired direction has been many . times suggested. The advantages to be expected from thus directing the energy in the desired direction (such as increase of range, avoidance of interference of all kinds, and comparative secrecy) are so great that it is rather surprising that since the early work of Hertz and Marconi, no practical results have been obtained by the use of reflectors. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I would point out that the English patent was refused on the ground of want of novelty. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Oliver</inline> Lodge, in 1910, I think, had been conducting a great . many experiments in relation to parabolic reflectors for the purpose of transmitting low amplitude waves. I understand that they were working from below 10 metres. Under the present system it is proposed to use waves of 100 metres. The position is that the beam system is not new, but was known prior to the appointment by this Parliament of a committee to go into the subject of the wireless agreement that was submitted to Parliament in 1921. It is remarkable that there was no mention made of this invention at that time. </para>
                    <para>Members of the Parliamentary Committee will remember that, during its investigations, the matter of the elimination of statics received very serious consideration, and caused a good deal of doubt in their minds. The Marconi people boldly declared, &#34;This can all be obviated. The easiest way is to introduce the Levy filtering device.&#34; It was said that this would eliminate statics, and do away with fading, so that we could easily secure the transmission that was desired. The committee, at that time, had the good fortune to have before it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Snoaden,  who had just, come from London. He took the wind out of the. Marconi Company&#39;s sails by saying that the Levy device had been offered to the Radio Communication Company, which had refused it because, on being tested, it proved quite inefficient. Naturally the Marconi Company denied that the device was of no value; but when the agreement was signed, this device passed into the limbo of forgotten things. </para>
                    <para>When the committee began to look into the first agreement, it found several points&#62; to which it took serious objection. &#39; My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> pointed out, in particular, that, under (he agreement originally proposed, the Amalgamated Wireless Company was to take over the whole of the shore stations belonging to the Commonwealth for nothing. This only needed enunciation to enable every member of the committee to realize that the company was taking advantage of the Commonwealth. After due deliberation a sub-committee was appointed, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman, Mr. Brennan,</inline> and myself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> drafted a clause which became clause 6 of the agreement, as recommended by the Parliamentary Committee. This clause states -  </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The sites, buildings, masts, plant and other assets of the stations, to be taken over by the company in accordance with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(h)</inline> of clause 5 of this agreement, shall he taken over at a valuation to be made by a committee including two representatives of the company and two representatives of the Commonwealth, with an independent  chairman,  to bc agreed upon by the other four representatives or a majority of them, and in default of agreement to be determined by arbitration- in the manner provided by clause 20&#39; of this agreement; the basis of valuation shall bc the value of the assets for the purpose of supplying the new service to bo undertaken by the company in pursuance of this agreement. The amount of the valuation shall be credited to the Commonwealth in part payment for the 500,001 shares to he allotted to the Commonwealth, and shall be deducted from Che last payments of capital to be made by the Commonwealth. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That committee has not functioned. The Government, so I am given to under- stand, has time after time appointed its representatives, but the other side say, &#34; We are not in a position to carry on.&#34; They have never carried on. There has not been a valuation of these assets, which are worth between &#163;150,000&#39; and &#163;200,000. Three years have passed, and practically nothing has been done to the shore stations erected by the Commonwealth from 1912 to 1914, in which year the last was erected. </para>

The position is becoming almost a scandal. These people declared that the shore stations were worth nothing; - that they could not function; but as a result of careful inquiries this afternoon I find that the company continues using them, although practically nothing has since been done to any of them.. The Government do not know definitely what the company is prepared to pay for them. If the agreement was worth anything, this matter should have been settled long ago. I do not say that the company should by now have made any payment for the stations, because the intention was that the amount to be paid should be deducted from the last payment due by the Government to the company. However, the company has strung on the Government and the departments until I do not think that at the present time any one in the Commonwealth Service knows what the actual position is. It is a state of affairs that should not be continued. When we were considering the original agreement the proposal was - </para>

At the same time it was agreed that an independent member of the board should be appointed by the vote of the representatives of both parties. But when it was proposed to elect to that position a certain gentleman closely associated with Amalgamated Wireless, the Government were definitely told by many of their supporters that such a choice would not be agreeable to them; and, as we all know, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> to fill the gap for the. time being, took the position. If not in a legal sense, at any rate, in a moral sense, Amalgamated Wireless has practically ignored the agreement. I do not want it to be supposed that the representatives of the Government have not agreed to everything that has been done, but I suggest that the agreement has not been carried out in the spirit in which members of the committee of Parliament expected it to be carried out.

First of all we had an agreement placed before us, in the dying clays of a session, which we were told must be put through very speedily, so that Ave should be right up to date in wireless. Three years have passed since then, yet nothing has been done. Now we have before us a proposition to accept something which is said <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be an absolutely new development in wireless, whereas, as a matter of fact, it was refused a patent in 1917, and had been known for many years previously to experts. One clause of the agreement between the British Government and Marconi provides - </para>

The company shall not, without the like consent, accept any tender other than the lowest. </para>
                    <para class="block">The whole position is safeguarded in the British agreement. The British Government has been very careful in dealing with the Marconi Company. I am not saying a word against the Marconi people, but, naturally, they are out to make as much as they can. </para>

That company had a capital of &#163;1,000,000, of which &#163;500,001 was contributed by the Commonwealth Government. The understanding was that certain services were to be supplied, and undoubtedly the special transmission rates promised constituted an attraction to the <inline font-style="italic">people</inline> of Australia, since they were considerably lower than those, being charged by the cable companies. This appeared to the business community to be a good thing. The business community is still waiting for it.

How much does the Amalgamated Wireless receive? That is &#34; a question which perhaps the Minister can answer. If he looks into the matter he will get a surprise. </para>

                            <para>- What is the present position? The beam system is still in the experimental stage. Marconi, in a lecture which he delivered, stated that he transmitted a message to Australia, not by the beam system, but by short -waves. The Government receives all its information, or practically all of it, from the Marconi source. We have a broadcasting business here, but how is it carried on? What is the amplitude of the wave at which we broadcast? It is 1,100 metres. Those who have any knowledge of the science know that the greater the amplitude of wave length the greater the static. In broadcasting, say, to the back-blocks, the work may have to be done through ai&#62;. atmosphere highly charged with electricity, and, using a long wave, the statics in the summer time would interfere with communications. The wave length generally recognized for broadcasting purposes is about one-third of that on which broadcasting is conducted in Australia. Broadcasting here has passed through a tumultuous sea, and nothing ha3 been accomplished. I have looked carefully through the agreement to find if any provision has been made in it for its termination. </para>

                            <para>- But how can the agreement be terminated? There would be difficulty in terminating it. Already difficulty has been experienced by the department. It did not know where it stood under the old agreement, and the position to-day is equally unsatisfactory. The Government did not understand the position under , the old agreement. I am willing to take a certain amount of blame - we all must - but we anticipated that the legal &#34;trimmings &#34; would be sufficient to enable the agreement to be terminated without the company being compulsorily wound up. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, if the Government want to pay the cost. I do not intend to discuss the legal aspect of the question, but merely to state my opinion on the proposal as submitted to the Senate. The Commonwealth was well advised in the early days. When, on the 2nd September, 1905, the first Wireless Telegraphy Bill was introduced, the Minister in charge of it said that its main object was to make a government monopoly of wireless telegraphy in the Commonwealth. If that course had been continued, the Government would have done well. We have gone a long way beyond that. In other countries progress is being made, but in Australia we have not a board of experts, or even a single expert who can be regarded as an authority on wireless telegraphy or telephony. I can hardly imagine a subject that is more vital to the Commonwealth than that under discussion.. In 1854the first patent was granted to Lindsay, of Dundee; who took out a patent for transmitting telegraph messages through and across water without submerged wires, the water being available as a connecting and conducting medium. He carried out successful experiments across the Tay River. In 1872 a patent was. granted in the United States of America to Mahlan Loomis for the utilization of natural electricity from elevated points for telegraphic purposes. He carried out several successful experiments on the Blue Ridge mountains in Virginia, but he had to discontinue his experiments owing to the lack of funds. Inventor after inventor has come into prominence, and to-day we are dealing with a force far exceeding in wonder and extent any power of the gods of mythological renown. Attempts are being made to improve wireless telegraphy and telephony. What have we done? We appreciate the vastness of this great continent. We realize to the full what wireless telegraphy and telephony mean. We are constantly advising residents in the cities to settle in the country. Here is a means by which we can assist to make rural life more attractive. But we are not doing anything to avail ourselves of it. The progress being made in Australia in connexion with this branch of science is on all-fours with the position in regard to the Institute of Science and Industry. </para>

                    <para class="block">Little or &#39;nothing is being accomplished. Those who are in close touch with the extension of wireless telegraphy realize that wonderful strides are being made in other parts of the world. In Paris to-day photographs of definite thoughts and the human emotions are actually being produced. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Baraduc,  of the College of France, has obtained a number of these photographs. He has succeeded in photographing the dynamic action of thought. From this, it appears that the emotions send out definite vibrations not unlike radio impulses. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If a record could be taken of the impressions in the minds of some of those associated with this matter, quite a number would be embarrassed. Radio engineers have been experimenting with a reasonable measure of success with the radio compass, which will go a long way towards reducing, the yearly number of catastrophes due to fog. In experimenting on the &#39;  thermyonic  valve, General Squires was able to transmit the actual beating of the human heart to a physician many miles away. There are shore stations that will materially aid in responding to wireless- calls for medical advice. In one case, a shore doctor stationed several, hundred miles away heard the heart-beats, of a man lying, unconscious on a ship out at sea, every beat  being  clearly transmitted. We are doing little or nothing in the. Commonwealth. We have not. even a laboratory in Australia in which- this work can be carried out. Our position in connexion with wireless, is closely approaching a scandal. We are allowing year after year to pass in idleness while the rest of the world is marching on. A parliamentary committee was appointed in 1922, and we were under the impression that some progress would be made. To-day we are asked: to ratify an agreement to erect -a station under a system which, in 1917, was considered obsolete. Surely we are not going to allow this to be done. I intend to- move that a committee be appointed to inquire into. the. agreement, and submit, a. report to the Senate before the bill is passed. It. is said that under the beam system most of the work of transmission has to be done during the hours of darkness. There are only about two and a half hours of twilight in which transmission can be undertaken. We should be in a position to control the traffic, otherwise we shall be authorizing the erection of a station at an enormous cost, the service from which can be only supplementary to that provided by the cable companies. We need something more than that. I move - </para>

                        <para>-.. - We have all listened with great interest to the speech . delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and we feel indebted to him for the valuable information which he has given, and for his criticism of the measure. But whilst we may agree with a good deal of his scientific criticism, we should pay regard to the whole of the circumstances that influenced the Government in shaping its policy as; outlined in this bill. Perhaps it is because Australia, to some extent, lacks- expert advisers in wireless developments that greater progress with wireless has not been made in this country up to the present. In. the absence of this experience and expert advice, it must, I think, be admitted that the Government was wise in not persisting in the development of wireless as a purely governmental activity. A certain amount of criticism was levelled at the first agreement when it came before another place, and, as a result, it was referred to a committee, including two members of this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> both of whom rendered extremely valuable service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> because of his scientific knowledge, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> because of his knowledge of legal contracts, materially assisted in safeguarding the interests of the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- We should- be perfectly fair in any review of the position: Any honorable senator who took even a passing interest in this question will remember that the. agreement stipulated that the Amalgamated Wireless Company had to erect a high-power station in Australia to .communicate with a reciprocal high-power station in Great Britain. The company had to erect and to work a high power station in Australia, but the contract did not become operative uut.il the company had also obtained a licence  to  erect and work a high-power station in England. </para>

                            <para>- It is correct  to  say that effect could not bo given to the contract until the company obtained a licence from the British Government to operate a high-power station in Great Britain. As a member of the Government at the time, I have a distinct recollection of the correspondence on the subject with the British Government, and of the steps taken at the Imperial conference to induce the British post office authorities to issue a licence to the Amalgamated Wireless Company. Under the agreement, the Amalgamated Wireless Company undertook, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline></para>

I cannot understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> interjection that my statement of the position was not quite correct. It is a fact that the agreement could not be operated until the company obtained a licence from the British Government to operate a high-power station in the Mother Country. Any delay that occurred was due not to indifference on the part of the Australian Government, but entirely to the fact that the company could not obtain .the licence from the British Government. Now, however, the British authorities have agreed to allow the Marconi Company to erect a beam station ia England. </para>

In Australia we have no technical advisers on wireless comparable with men whose services are available to Governments in Great Britain and other parts of the world. We now come to the constitution of the directorate of the company. There again the Government was unfortunate. Difficulty arose over the selection of an independent  chairman.  This was overcome by <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr. Hughes</inline> taking the position. The three directors representing the Government were selected from gentlemen in the front rank of the business world; but, unfortunately, they had no knowledge of wireless, so that, whilst they were animated with the desire to do the best in the interests of the Commonwealth, lacking expert knowledge of wireless developments, no doubt they had to accent the views put forward by the representatives of the company. The bill dons not end the original agreement which. :i* </para>

                            <para>- That may be a reason for the postponement of the bill. On the question, both of postponement and of reference to a select committee, I first of all make the affirmation that no select committee of this Senate could answer that question definitely and absolutely. Not even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> with all his special knowledge, can answer it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would be the last to claim that he could. Let us consider the risk that the Commonwealth is taking. First of all, it must be understood that the company will have to take a risk equal to that taken by the Government; that is to say, the private investors who have put their money into the company, and who have their representatives on the directorate, must find &#163;1 for &#163;1 towards the cost of erecting this station. Assuming that the station cost the amount estimated, and the Commonwealth risked &#163;60,000 in the event of failure, the shareholders and the directors who represent them would run an equal risk of losing &#163;60,000. </para>

                            <para>- I can deal with only one point at a time. My first point is that, if there were a total loss, the private investors in this company would lose as much as the Government. Therefore, the directors who represent them are not likely to enter into a contract with the Government for the erection of a beam station if there is a likelihood of their losing their capital. This beam system has been and is being tested, and its capabilities have been published throughout the world. </para>

It is not claimed for the beam system that it can keep up communication during the whole of the 24 hours, but it is claimed that it can operate continuously for seven hours. It has also been demonstrated that, under the beam system, messages can be dispatched one and a half times more rapidly than they can under the high-power system. </para>

                            <para>- Although, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out, the beam system cannot operate for 24hours, a greater number of words can, nevertheless, be sent in seven hours by that system than can be sent in 24 hours by the high power wireless system. Another point is that the cost per word under the beam system will be one half of what it was to be under the principal agreement for a high-power station. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted from the contracts that have been entered into between the British Government and the Marconi Company for the erection of a station in Great Britain, and the conditions under which the British Government will take over that station if it is a success. The honorable senator remarked on the absence of similar provisions from this agreement. The reason for that is that this agreement is to be followed by a contract for the erection of the station, and in that contract such of those provisions as are suitable to Australia will be embodied. </para>

                            <para>- That was the allegation, but it has no bearing upon my point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> objects to the bill because the provisions inserted by the British Post Office in its contract do not find a place in this agreement. My reply is that the proper place for those provisions is in the contract that will subsequently be entered into between the company and the Commonwealth for the erection of a station. The absence of those provisions from this agreement is not a reason for delaying the bill, or for referring it to a select committee. What useful purpose could be served by a select committee, when the principal agreement has already received the criticism and approval of a. very capable committee consisting of members of both Houses? The only alteration that has been made in that agreement is the substitution of a beam station for a high -power station. </para>

We have received information regarding the beam system from England, where it has been experimented with. In England there are, perhaps, some of the best wireless experts that are to be found in the world. The Postmaster-General was authorized by the Government to obtain the best possible expert advice there, and he has advised the Government that it would be on safe ground if it entered into a contract of this kind. </para>

Nobody who reads the agreement will fail to see that there must obviously be a. contract. Clause 3 of the agreement as set out in the schedule reads - </para>

Assuming that the British Government adopted the same attitude in regard to the beam station as it did in regard to the other, we should have the alternative of communication through Canada.

                            <para>- I claim that the quickest way to achieve that end is to pass the bill now. If we referred it to a select committee, no headway could be made during the remaining two or three weeks of the session, and we should have to wait until Parliament reassembled. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to withdraw his amendment. The Government has nothing to hide, and, unless the bill is passed immediately, there will be a delay of probably six months before the proposal can be again brought forward. I assure the honorable senator that every step will be taken to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth in the provisions drawn up under the agreement. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no intention to endorse the provisions of the old agreement or the action taken in connexion with it, nor do I think that the present bill is incapable of amendment. One amendment that has been suggested seems to be vital, if there is anything in the objection that has been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> as to the power to terminate the agreement should it be deemed desirable to do so. There are other features of the bill that require careful examination. I was pleased to hear from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that if the Senate agrees to the bill as if stands, or as it may be amended, it is not the intention of the Government to rush into the agreement with the company without having a further opportunity of considering certain aspects that have arisen since the agreement was submitted to Parliament.The assurance given by the Minister has confirmed me in the view that I hold, that in all the circumstances it is advisable to pass the bill, making such amendments in committee as may be found desirable. I regret that unworthy insinuations have been made by those honorable senators who, for various reasons, have seen fit to oppose the measure. It has been suggested that the parties to the agreement other than the Commonwealth Government have not acted in a straightforward manner, and that in certain circumstances they are not to be trusted. Such insinuations are unwarranted. I propose to examine the arguments used against the bill, and to consider whether the objections taken will bear careful examination.  I am not a wireless expert, and in that respect I should like to be able to accept the guidance of my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who has a wide knowledge of the subject now under consideration. With his scientific mind he is able to visualize the whole project, but it is incumbent upon every honorable senator to endeavour to grasp the problems that the measure presents. I have spent several days looking up the records in order to inform my mind on this subject, and as far as my investigations have gone they lead me to a conclusion entirely different from that arrived at by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> Although the arguments he used against the bill and against the beam system may be regarded by him as practically unanswerable, there are other authorities who take a different view. </para>

                            <para>- That is one argument, I admit. It has been stated that the Commonwealth Government has enabled the Marconi Company to obtain control of wireless in Australia for its own private ends. I have no interests hi the Marconi Company; I wish that I had. Nevertheless, I have the greatest admiration for the inventive genius of the founder of the company, and for the com.mercial organization that has enabled it to do the magnificent work it has done in the interest of mankind. I realize, of course, that no private company carries on its operations from purely philanthropic motives, but this company, iri common with many others, has conferred on mankind* a very great service. The inventive genius of this company and its organization have enabled Great Britain to lead the world in wireless development. It is an advantage, and not a disadvantage, to Australia that we should  have placed at our disposal the inventive genius and capacity for organization of this company in an undertaking such as that upon which we propose to embark. We do not want the second best in Australia; we want the best available, and naturally we must assume that the best can be had only from the company which has made the greatest measure of success. Above all other companies it has led to the  popularizing  of wireless, and by reason of the inventive genius of those in control, has done much to make it a commercial feasibility, and, in fact, to bring it into everyday use. Amalgamated Wireless has been described as a &#34;pup&#34; of the Marconi Company. The facts are that the Commonwealth Government holds a majority of the shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and thus is able to control the policy of the company. The Marconi Company holds only 200,000 shares out of a total of 1,000,000 shares in the company, so that it does not even hold a majority of the shares privately held. This was the position before the agreement with the Commonwealth. The Marconi Company is not represented on&#39; the directorate, and I am informed it has never attempted to control or even influence the policy of the company. On the other hand, its capital and technical experience and resources have been freely available for the development of wireless in Australia. The charge has also been made that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless, has been endeavouring under this agreement to sell to the Commonwealth, in the interests of hie company, something which is worthless. That is an unreasonable and absurd proposition. I am particularly interested in the attacks made upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> because I know him well, and I have recently had an opportunity to see the work he and his company are doing in Sydney.  The attacks made upon him are entirely unwarranted. He is an Australian. He is a man of magnificent capacity in a great many directions, and is one of the recognized wireless experts of the world. He has had nineteen years&#39; experience in wireless, gained in Great Britain, America, Canada, and other countries. On several occasions he has been entrusted with the erection of wireless stations in Great Britain, America, and other places. This gentleman, with such wide experience, whose word is impugned by those who say the beam system is no good and cannot be worked, has said that it is not only feasible, but also eminently practicable, and will give better results than would have been achieved by the high power station provided for in the original agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> is a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers, which fact places his scientific qualifications beyond question. He has patented a great many wireless inventions in a number of countries. I mention these facts because I want to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> as perhaps the greatest authority on wireless we have in Australia to-day. In conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marconi</inline> he has carried out certain tests of the beam system. There is no warrant for the suggestion that his testimony in regard to these tests cannot be relied upon. I cannot conceive what purpose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> would have in being untruthful, and, in any case, if his testimony is disputed, Marconi and wireless investigators in other countries must also be charged with conspiring to deceive the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> has been instrumental in building up a great Australian industry. Amalgamated Wireless now employs 800 persons, who are paid &#163;150,000 annually in wages. The factory belonging to the company is splendidly equipped, and can produce almost anything required in- connexion with wireless apparatus from a small screw to a 5-kilowatt broadcasting transmitter. </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth holds the majority of the shares in one of the finest factories in Australia to-day. The workmanship is of the highest quality, and I am informed that the apparatus used for wireless broadcasting which was made at the company&#39;s works is equal to anything in the world. This industry has been organized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> without importing men from overseas, although several Australians have been sent to other countries in order that they might equip themselves still further in their knowledge of matters pertaining to wireless. I think that the whole of the staff is composed of Australians who know Australia&#39;s needs, and are therefore better fitted to equip and maintain suitable stations for wireless in Australia than any one could possibly be coming from another country, and not possessing the knowledge of Australian conditions which these men have. It has been said that Amalgamated Wireless has been operating solely in the interests of the Marconi Company. If that were so, would it not have encouraged the importation of material from overseas instead of creating a big local industry? Everything that could possibly be made in Australia has been made here. Had Amalgamated Wireless been a mere &#34; pup &#34; of the Marconi Company, everything that could possibly have been imported from Marconi factories in other countries would have been so imported. The fact that all this material has been made locally goes to prove that Amalgamated Wireless is a bona fide Australian company out to enhance Australian industry, and build up something of credit, not only to itself, but also to the Commonwealth. If Australia becomes a great wireless centre in the Pacific, linking up Asia with America, it will be due largely to the indefatigable energy and enterprise of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk.</inline> Amalgamated Wireless has been accused of non-compliance with its obligations under the previous agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out that it could not comply with some of those obligations because the British Government would not grant it a licence. If that licence had been granted, a station would have been erected in Great Britain, and would have been in operation by now. The refusal of the licence absolves Amalgamated Wireless from all blame. </para>

                            <para>- The attitude of the British Government towards the agreement between Amalgamated Wireless and the Commonwealth Government is not a new development. When the dominions were fighting for what is now known as the Pacific cable, the British Post Office said that the ocean was too deep to lay a cable successfully in it to establish communication between Australia and Canada. The arguments it adduced were backed up by all the scientific authorities tha Post Office could get hold of, and the Canadian gentleman who was pushing, the business through- had to fight for years against some, of the most difficult opposition one could imagine. Now, however, the British Post Office declares that cables are good enough, and wireless communication with- Australia, is unnecessary. It has still the same old stick-in-the-mud mind that it had when the dominions sought to establish their own cable communication. I am not at all surprised that it is in opposition to the present wireless proposal, and I have no doubt that the time will come when the British Government will consent, more readily than it has hitherto been prepared to do to the establishment of the beam system, of communication.  Although  objection is raised, in Great Britain to the granting, of a concession to private enterprise to establish communication with the dominions, the British Government has seen fit to associate itself with the Pacific Cable Board and many other organizations and institutions I could mention. Therefore, I do not think it can adhere to its present attitude towards the proposal of the Commonwealth Government. The outstanding fact is that the Amalgamated Wireless Company is not to blame for its failure to carry out the contract originally entered into. A comparison has been made between the contract price of the beam system to be erected by the Marconi Company in England, and the price mentioned in the new agreement between the Amalgamated Wireless Company and the Commonwealth Government. An amazing amount of ignorance has been displayed on this matter. The English price referred to is for one station for communication with Canada. The Australian organization will comprise practically three stations; one for communication with Canada, and two for communication with England in two directions. The difference in price is thus easily accounted for. Another .misleading statement is that the Government has relieved the Amalgamated Wireless Company from an obligation to secure guarantees, for the high-power station, but no such guarantees are stipulated - in respect of the beam station. This is not the case. The new agreement in clause 3 <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> specifically provides for such guarantees, which must be approved by the </para>

                    <para class="block">Commonwealth representatives on the board of directors. The position in. this respect is precisely the same as previously. The Commonwealth is, however, now taking far less financial risk, as the cost of the new station will be less than one-fourth the contract price of the high-power station. Another unjustifiable complaint is that the loss on the coastal radio stations- has not been removed. It was expected that this would be accomplished only when the main trunk and feeder stations were erected, the coastal stations working in with the general, system. As a matter of fact there has been a reduction of the loss. It has been.&#39; assumed by those in opposition to the bill that, the Government has recklessly pledged itself without adequate, inquiry to a new system of wireless which is&#39; still very much in the experimental stage and without adequate safeguards, financial or otherwise. There is not the slightest justification for this line of criticism. In one sense, of course, the beam system qf wirel&#39;ess for communication between Australia and England is still in the experimental stage. Until stations are erected in both countries and regular communication is conducted on a commercial basis, it cannot be said that we have passed the experimental stage. It was precisely the same with the high-power stations. All that the Government could do was to satisfy itself that sufficient technical evidence existed . to justify the adoption of the new system. That is the important point. If that existed, then obviously the far lower cost of the stations, the higher speed, secrecy, and other advantages would make its acceptance certain. I propose to show that, the. Government had ample technical evidence to influence its decision. That being so, there was no other course to pursue but the one authorized by this. bill. It would have been a serious breach of duty for the Government to proceed with the erection of a station costing nearly &#163;500,000, when a station costing &#163;120,000 might be sufficient. It would be folly to adhere to a system likely to be obsolete in a short period, when a new system is available offering advantages which the old system does not possess. </para>

                            <para>- They are experimenting with the new system, which they anticipate will supersede the old. As the wireless experts in this Parliament have expressed their opinions of the beam system, it may be desirable to pat; on record what the inventor has to say about it. I have a number of extracts which I propose to read, which seem particularly apropos ais this stage. The greatest opponents of the bill would not insinuate that Marconi, would in any way jeopardize the very high reputation he holds by being associated with an agreement such as this unless he believed that the system was a practical one. In a paper read before the Royal Society of Arts on the 2nd July,, 1924, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marconi,.</inline> G.C.V.O.1LL.I).,  B.Sc, a vice-president, of tha society, gave an account of the experiments undertaken by him over long distances by short wave directional, wireless, telegraphy, otherwise known as the beam system. He pointed, out that the study of short electrical waves dates from the time of the discovery of electric waves themselves,, that is, from the time&#39; of the classical experiments of Hertz and his contemporaries over 30 years, ago. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marconi</inline> first went to England in. 1896, he employed a beam system,, with short waves and reflectors.. The progress made with the long-wave system was, however, so rapid, comparatively easy, and spectacular that it diverted research from the short waves. During the war Marconi renewed his1 experiments with the short waves, and in 1916,. in; Italy, he conducted a number of tests with the view of minimizing interception by the enemy. Between that year and 1922 successful investigations with the beam system were conducted  by Marconi and his assistant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> S. Franklin.. The results were communicated, to the scientific world in a paper read by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Franklin</inline> before the Institution of Electrical Engineers on the 3rd April, 1922, and in a lecture by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marconi</inline> before a joint, meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers in New York on the 20th June, 1922. I refer to those lectures honorable senators who may be under the impression that the beam system is an entirely new idea which it is proposed to thrust upon this country without adequate in.vestigation.

                    <para class="block">Society of Arts, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marconi</inline> described his more recent experiments with the new system. In April,. May, and June, 1923, he carried out a series of long-distance tests- between a small experimental transmitting station at Poldhu,  in Cornwall, and a receiver installed on his yacht, <inline font-style="italic">Elettra.</inline> Marconi and his- assistant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> A.. Mathieu, were on the yacht, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Franklin</inline> was in charge- at Poldhu.  These tests were conducted under unsatisfactory conditions and with incomplete apparatus, especially at the receiving end. The. wave length used at  Poldhu  was 97 metres,, and the transmitting power was approximately 12 kilowatts, as compared with. 24,000 metres and. 8QQ kilowatts in the case of a high-power station. Marconi was able tq  record  the. most satisfactory results up to 2,330 nautical miles from  Poldhu,  the farthest distance the yacht sailed.. He pointed out that no receiving reflector could be employed on the yacht, and it was obvious that the strength of the. received signals, and the ranges covered must have been, considerably less than could have been obtained had it. been possible to use a fixed receiving station equipped with a. suitable reflector. </para>

                        <para>Bather to my surprise, I must admit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> T. Fisk, the managing director of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australia) Limited, reported to me that &#39;he could receive the Poldhu  transmissions at his house in Sydney every day perfectly well from 5 to 9 p.m., Greenwich time, and also that he had received them between 6.30 and 8.30 a.m., informing me also that for most of the time the signals were clear, steady, and strong on an improvised receiver consisting of a two-stage high-frequency tuned plate and grid with one rectification-. He also added that he had read every word that was sent, and that the signals were better than those he had yet received from the high-power station at Carnarvon. These experiments with Australia were continued during the month of May, consistently good results being obtained at two receiving stations situated in the vicinity of Sydney. It seems obvious, if we consider the- position and altitude of the sun, that during the morning period the waves travelled from England to Australia starting in a westerly direction, across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, along the longest route, which is, approximately, 12,219 nautical miles, whilst during the evening period they travelled in an easterly direction over Europe and Asia along the shortest route, which is about 9,381 nautical miles. These results were so encouraging that I was tempted to try a wireless telephony test to Australia.- With rather experimental arrangements at  Poldhu,  intelligible speech was transmitted for the first time in the history of England to Sydney, on Friday, the 30th day of May, of this year. For the telephone test to Australia, oil-cooled valves were employed for the main valve and for modulating valves. The wave length was 92 metres, and an independent drive was employed for controlling the main valves. The total power supplied to the valves was, approximately, 28 k.w. divided up as follows : 18 to the main valves, 8 to the modulating valves and 2 to the drive valves. No  reflector  was employed. It was gratifying to all concerned that the experiment succeeded the very first time it was tried, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> S. Franklin being in charge of the transmitting apparatus at Poldhu,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> T. Fisk, of the receivers at Sydney. It is also interesting to observe that, these extreme distances were obtained without the use of any reflector at either end. The results obtained between England and Australia easily constitute a record for ratio of distance to wave length for Sydney, by the shortest route, is approximately 189,000 wave lengths from Poldhu </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be noted that, although two features of the new system were employed in the Australian tests - the short wave and low power - Marconi emphasizes that another important factor - the reflectors - were not employed, thus making the success of the tests all the more remarkable. He expresses the opinion in his paper that adequately designed reflectors, even if of comparatively moderate size, would enormously increase the effective strength of the signals. This would augment the efficiency of communication, increase the number of hours during which it would be possible to work with very distant countries, and reduce interference. Marconi added that there was no theoretical reason why the speed attained with the short wave should not be a hundred times as great as is possible with the long wave employed by the high power stations. </para>

This is a much more rapid system of transmission. In June this year, further tests were conducted between  Poldhu  and Buenos Aires, in the Argentine, a distance of 5,820 nautical miles. At the conclusion of the tests the international committee controlling wireless in the Argentine, stated that the signals from  Poldhu,  transmitted by the new system, were received at Buenos Aires with such regularity and extraordinary strength as to permit a service being conducted at any speed. The committee also expressed the opinion that the Argentine station should be immediately equipped with the new system, which the committee is confident will handle in six hours more than double the traffic that is now handled in 24 hours with the present super-power station. These facts show that the old high-power system is out of date, and the Commonwealth would not be justified in sanctioning the erection of a high-power station, when the results under the new system are entirely satisfactory. Excellent results were also obtained at Bio, in Brazil. In view of these tests, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marconi</inline> concludes as follows: - </para>

                        <para>All these results, many of which have greatly exceeded my expectations, convince me that by means of this system, economical and efficient low-power stations can be established, which will maintain direct high-speed services -with the most distant parts of the globe during a considerable number of fixed hours per day. I am further of the opinion that by moans of those comparatively small stations, a far greater number of words per 24 hours could be transmitted between England, India, and her distant Dominions than would he possible  by  means of the previously planned powerful and expensive stations. Another particular advantage of this system should not be overlooked. As distant stations situated only within a certain angle or sector of the beam are enabled to receive, this condition brings about a comparative privacy or secrecy nf communication unobtainable with any other system of radio communication, and this may prove to bc of the greatest importance in war time, besides considerably increasing the number of stations it will be possible to work, by reducing the possibilities of mutual interference between them. The comparative economy in capital cost of these stations, the small amount of electrical power which need be employed, together with the capability of work ing at very high speeds, should make it possible to bring about a substantial reduction in telegraphic rates. The importance of this to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Empire must be obvious. </para>

                            <para>- The system which I have been describing is the beam system, and, as I have shown, Marconi has obtained magnificent results from it. This being so, the Government would not be justified in going on with the erection of a high-power station in Australia which, to say the least, would be extremely costly and probably would not yield the same results as the beam system. </para>

If we do not adopt this proposal, we shall have to wait at least six months until experiments are made, and then we shall have to put a measure through Parliament to provide for the erection of stations for the new system. Probably at least eighteen months will elapse before anything can be done. This scheme promises good results. It will cost only about one-fourth the high-power station proposal, and it is expected to yield results immediately the stations are ready. In the circumstances, it would be inexcusable to further delay the measure. </para>

                        <para class="block">I do not know of anything that has taken place since then to cause those honorable gentlemen to alter their opinions. The agreement stipulated that the Amalgamated Wireless Company should erect high-power stations in Australia, Canada, Africa, and the United Kingdom.The company has not, so I understand, erected any stations in the countries mentioned. It made a. promise that it would be able to erect a high-power station in Britain. In my opinion, the company knew at the time that it could not carry out what it had contracted to do. Did the Government inquire if any communication had passed between the company and the British Government concerning that proposal? The British Government is now erecting a high-power station because it believes, as I do, that wireless should be the sole monopoly of the nation. It is also true that the British Government  has given the Marconi Company permission to erect a beam station at its own cost, and that if it is a success, about which there is much doubt, the Government may take it over from the company, but the Government will not in any circumstances, allow the Marconi Company to control wireless in Britain. I do not profess to have much knowledge of wireless, but I know that for many years the Marconi octopus, with its tentacles outstretched to every country in the world, has been exercising an influence in this country. When the Fisher Government was in power, the Marconi people consistently agitated for the installation of their system in Australia, but the Fisher Ministry would have nothing to do with it. Instead, the Government took over the Balsillie wireless system, and erected a number of stations in different parts of the Commonwealth. Those stations have been operating successfully, but ever since then the Marconi Company, with which is now associated the Amalgamated Wireless, has been working through the columns of the newspapers, and by lobbying and button-holing members of Parliament, to induce the Government to. take over its system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> had a well-prepared brief for the Marconi Company. </para>

Because Signer Marconi has stated that the experiments have been successful, and because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> has confirmed that statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> contends that that is proof of the success of the experiments, and he urges that the Government will be doing the right thing if it goes ahead with the erection of a beam station. What evidence is there to show that this is a more perfect system than the high-power system? </para>

                    <para class="block">The British Government will have nothing to do with it, and I think that this Government would do well to follow its example. The beam system is not approved of by the British Admiralty, or by naval authorities in Australia. When the Marconi Company makes promises we ought to examine them very carefully. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> has stated that this system can be operated only during the hours of darkness at both ends. So far as Britain and Australia are concerned that can never take place. One cannot, therefore, see how the beam system can be made a success. Under the first agreement, we were promised that the loss of &#163;50,000 that had already been incurred would be turned! into a profit of &#163;50,000. Instead of a profit being derived, the loss has increased to over &#163;80,000. Notwithstanding that fact, we are asked to commit ourselves to an expenditure of &#163;120,000 for the erection of a beam station when according to those who are competent to express an opinion, the beam system is still in the experimental stage. I think the Senate would do well to agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment. He has given a great deal of time and thought to the matter, and his advice is worth following. A delay of a few months would be neither here nor there. Three years have elapsed since the original agreement was entered into, yet nothing has been done, and probably nothing will be done for some time. A select committee could go into the matter thoroughly and present its report very quickly. In the interests of the people, on the score of economy, and in order to get the best possible results, I hope that the Senate will agree to the amendment. </para>
                    <para>SenatorH.  HAYS  (Tasmania) &#91;9.7&#93;.- I am somewhat at a loss to know what is the right thing to do. There are many sides to this question. Even the Minister has admitted that the Government has no expert knowledge by which it can be guided to scientific conclusions. It has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and, I think, inferred by others, that the beam system is in the experimental stage. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> who evidently has been in consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> has stated that the system is an absolute success. By interjection I asked the honorable senator why, if it had been so successful, it was not in more general use in other parts of the world. I understand that it has not been put to commercial use anywhere in the world. So far as we know the experiments have been successful, and probably as big strides will be made with this particular system as have heretofore been made with wireless generally. </para>

                        <para>- I do not doubt that for a moment. The Marconi Company is hoping to develop a system that will supersede the high-power system that is now in general use. If it fails, its losses will not be great; if, on the other hand, it meets with great success - as we all hope it will - it has everything to gain. The Commonwealth is, in a measure, to be commended for&#39; assisting experimental work. But under the bill we are really encouraging a company to experiment with a new system that has not yet been thoroughly tried out. I appreciate the position in which the Government has been placed through no fault of its own. The company is unable to induce the British. Post Office to permit it to install a high-power station in Great Britain. Was that attitude of the British Post Office known to the company when it completed negotiations with the Commonwealth Government for the erection of a high-power station in Australia ? </para>

                            <para>- I have read from time to time fragments of news that have appeared in the cables, and there has been nothing to suggest that the British authorities regarded the proposal of the company with favour. Although I do not view the promise of the company with suspicion, I think there is reason to believe that it had doubts as to whether permission would be granted by the British Government. If I may go so far as to presume that that is so, we shall drift still further into difficulties, should this proposal turn out to be a failure. As the system can be operated only during the hours of darkness it is obvious that, in addition, we must have high-power stations. None of us knows what the developments are likely to be. Some other  system, which will render this system obsolete, may be developed in the very near future. </para>

                            <para>- But wireless is largely used for rapid communication. I hesitate to oppose the bill, for I consider that we should assist as far as possible in experimental work, but for all practical purposes, at all events for the present time, we should rather rely on a system that has been proved efficient. If the experiments to be conducted in the next six months are successful, we can, later on, supplement the wireless service by installing the system now proposed. My present inclination is to oppose the bill, but I am reluctant to do anything that would hinder progress in the improvement of communication with Great Britain. I shall await with interest the Minister&#39;s reply before committing myself as to the attitude I shall adopt. The people of this country have been waiting impatiently for practical results following upon the agreement entered into three years ago. Prior to the dinner adjournment I asked the Minister how it was, if the company had not been able to carry out any of the conditions of the old agreement, that such a large sum of money had been paid to it by the Government. I think that is a matter on which the Senate is entitled to some information. </para>

                        <para>.- I find myself in a somewhat similar position to that of those honorable senators who wish to hear the Minister in reply before finally making up their minds as to which system should be adopted. The present position i3 certainly most unsatisfactory. &#34;When the original agreement was before us honorable members were summoned by the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Hughes),</inline> and asked to appoint a committee representative of all parties to report upon the agreement. We were assured that the matter was of extreme urgency, and that some definite arrangement should be arrived at between the Government and the company to advance wireless in Australia. We were all hopeful that within a short period something of a practical nature would be done, but we are now informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who is recognized as an authority on this subject, that practically nothing has been done, although the Commonwealth is represented on the board of the Amalgamated Wireless. </para>

                            <para>- I am not particularly concerned as to the sum of money spent by the company, if there are ample assets that can be set off against the expenditure. But I remind honorable senators of the fact that Parliament took the precaution to see that . the control of the company was placed in the hands of the Government. The Government has a majority of two shares, and it has equal representation with the Marconi Company on the board of Amalgamated Wireless. An independent  chairman  was appointed, and care was taken to select a man who would not have leanings in the direction of the Marconi Company. I was impressed by the remark of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> that if we submitted the proposal to a select committee, he failed to see how we could at once get information in Australia as to the best wireless scheme to adopt, since the knowledge of wireless here was very limited. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> has made exhaustive inquiries in Great Britain as to the best method to adopt, but unfortunately his decision appears to be completely at variance with that of the Imperial Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. It puts an entirely different aspect on the matter from that given by the earlier portion of the debate. A great controversy is raging on the other side of the world as to the advisability of accepting the beam system, and Australia should be careful not to adopt it until the fullest investigation has been made. I understand that the hours during which the beam system can be used are limited, and that there is also a limitation in regard to the distance over which messages can be conveyed. Therefore, before I give my vote on the amendment, I should like to hear whether the Minister is satisfied, from the investigations made by the Postmaster-General, that the beam system would be. better than a high-power station for Australia&#39;s requirements. </para>

                        <para>. - There are two points on which I should like information. As I understand the beam system can only be operated during the hours of darkness, will the Minister explain how it can be used when it is dark in Australia and light in Great Britain. I should also like the Minister to explain in detail how the &#163;80,000 of Commonwealth money which has already been spent by Amalgamated Wireless has been disposed of, and what assets there are to show for that expenditure. At the same time the Minister might tell the Senate whether the company has expended an equal amount out of its own funds. While the Commonwealth holds a nominal majority of the shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and while the  chairman  of directors is independent of both the wireless company and the Commonwealth Government, it appears to me that the company can do exactly as it chooses. I have no desire to vote against the Government on this matter, nor do I object to the expenditure of public money in this way. because I think it only fair that the Commonwealth should not expect to reap all the advantages of an invention of such far-reaching importance without making some contribution towards the cost of its development. </para>

I am quite sure that if left free to vote as they chose a few of them would vote for the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- Notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> remark, I venture to say that honorable senators will fall in behind the Government. Very few honorable senators have proclaimed themselves as possessing any technical knowledge of wireless. While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has not professed to be an expert, any one who listened to his remarks must have come to the conclusion that he appears to know a great deal more about it than any other senator who so far has disclosed to the Senate his views on the subject. Parliament has placed &#163;500,000 practically at the disposal <inline font-style="italic">&#60;d</inline> a private company. I am opposed to the Government linking itself with Amalgamated Wireless or any other company in this regard. I would rather see it conducting the business itself. However, as it is to some extent in partnership with Amalgamated Wireless, I think the Government should release its strangle hold on some of its supporters like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> one of whom would be only too pleased to vote against Ministers on this occasion if he were at liberty to do so. I should like some information from the Minister on the points I have mentioned - what has become of the &#163;80,000 already spent; what assets exist as the result of that expenditure; and will the beam system, which can only work during the darkness, enable communications to pass between Great Britain and Australia, seeing that while it is dark in Australia it is light in Great Britain ? </para>

                        <para>. - I commence my few remarks with a &#39;confession that my ignorance on the subject of wireless is absolutely profound. This may be a disadvantage in one way, but it is an advantage in one respect, since it means that I have no preconceived prejudices to get rid of. I should have thought that, with a bill of this kind, honorable senators would have been furnished with more printed information than has been made &#39; available. Neither have I been able to appreciate the intensity of the urgency for the measure. Nearly all honorable senators, with the exception of one or two, seem to share my profound ignorance, and goodness knows I thought I had quite enough to go all -round. Therefore, when I find a gentleman who may be looted upon as easily a foremost authority in the Senate on matters of this kind, voting for some little delay - I allude to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> - I cannot do better in the interests of Australia than fall in behind him. I do not wish to see the bill go by the board, and I do not think it will. </para>

                            <para>- Communication by cable of whatever information is available is nothing compared with the value of the personal .delivery of the goods. That is what I wish to see. I nave no prejudice against the bill, but I want to see the public money spent to the best advantage. If this is an experiment in research, there are many other methods of research on which the Government are very reluctant to spend money that, perhaps, would, for about one-tenth of what is proposed to be spent on the erection of this experimental beam station, give just as good, if not better, results. For these reasons it is my intention to vote for the amendment. </para>

When that agreement was entered into it was believed that there would be no insuperable difficulty in the way of the Marconi Company carrying out its contract. The preamble to the new agreement says : - &#34;Whereas at the time of the .making of the principal agreement the parties thereto believed  that the British Government would be ready and willing to grant licences for the erection and operation of a trunk station and other stations in the United Kingdom, for communication with Australia, and whereas the British Government refuses to grant licences for the erection and operation of commercial wireless stations in the United Kingdom with a view to communication with Australia, and the Marconi Company is by reason thereof unable to obtain the necessary licence to erect or operate the said trunk station in the United Kingdom for that purpose - </para>

Some time ago the whole question was referred to what is known as the Donald Committee, and that committee reported in favour of Government control of all high-power wireless stations. A beam station is in a sense a high-power station, because it will be capable of sending messages from one end of the world to the other. Honorable senators seem to be somewhat in doubt concerning the possibility of enforcing the guarantee which may be provided under the contract for the erection of the proposed station. This question was considered by the parliamentary committee of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was a member. That committee reported as follows :  - </para>

                            <para>- As the British Government is permitting the erection of a station, a similar station should be provided here. The principal provision in the amending measure is to cancel the contract made two years ago for the erection in Australia of a high-power station. The amending agreement will relieve the Commonwealth Government of its responsibility, as well as the company of its obligation to erect such a station. It is a question of whether the company should be relieved of this responsibility, seeing that it cannot legally erect the station in Great Britain which it contracted to provide. At the time the inquiry was conducted by a committee, evidence was taken as to the service the proposed station would render, and it was shown that the maximum traffic which could be guaranteed was 20 words per minute for 12 hours a day for 300 days in each year. In the amended agreement it is provided that the guaranteed capacity shall be 21,600 words per day for 300 days a year, which would give in the course of a year a service 50 per cent, in excess of that guaranteed under the high-power system. Apart from the cancellation of the contract, which cannot be carried out for the reasons I have mentioned, the only concession made to the company is that the period of three years set put in the original agreement during which the Commonwealth Government are to contribute towards the cost of carrying on radio works in Australia, is increased to four years. </para>

                            <para>- Ships in Australian waters can be communicated with by the wireless stations already operating in the Commonwealth, and which are capable of communicating with other stations at considerable distances. Our communications with Rabaul are conducted by wireless. It has been suggested that the consideration of this measure should be delayed until its provisions have been investigated by a committee. Honorable senators are aware that the cables between Australia and other countries are already overloaded, and that the business is of such a volume that the cable companies have been pressed to duplicate their services. The companies recognize that in  wireless  they have a great rival, and naturally they do not wish to proceed with duplication if there is likely to be a diminution of their business. It would be of great assistance to the commercial community if the existing cable services could be relieved of some of their business. </para>

                            <para>- It is immaterial whether messages are sent during the day or the night, so long as they are transmitted within reasonable time. Does the honorable senator suggest that the cable companies transact all their business during daylight, or that the Telegraph department despatches telegrams only during business hours? The proposed system is a comparatively new one for long distance transmission, but it is capable of sending messages for at least seven hours a day at the rate of 200 words a minute, as against twenty words a minute for twelve hours a day under the old system. </para>

                            <para>- Simply because the company was not permitted to erect the necessary stations. Practically no risk is involved. Contracts may be made to protect the Government, and even if some slight risk is involved we should not, for the sake of the expenditure of a few thousand pounds, lag behind other countries in the matter of wireless communication. No one imagines that the beam system is perfect. Some honorable senators seem to think that the Government should wait until perfection has been reached, but such an attitude would be unworthy of a progressive country. We ought to do all we can to keep up to date in the matter of wireless communication, particularly as we now have the opportunity of installing the system at a comparatively small cost within twelve months. </para>

That practically does all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> seeks to do. In the circumstances, I trust that he will withdraw his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> will not withdraw his amendment. It is a very businesslike proposition. We have had a statement from the Minister in charge of the bill that all costs incidental to the erection of these stations will be borne, not by the Government, but by the company. If the stations prove a success, well and good, but if they are not a success, the taxpayers of Australia will not be called upon to foot the bill. If we carry this amendment, we shall be certain of our ground. Parliament will then have an opportunity later to express an opinion in regard to the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> deserves to be complimented, and if the amendment is supported by two or three honorable senators in addition to those who supported the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> there is no doubt that it will be carried. </para>
