                        <para>- Speaking on the adjournment last night, I asked whether it was the intention of l5ie Government to introduce this session a measure to provide adequate pensions for certain officers of the Permanent Military Forces, non-commissioned officers, warrant officers, and others who have been retired on allowances which are altogether too small to support them. Has the Minister representing the Minister for Defence the information for which I asked? </para>

                        <para>The question of the extension of the provisions of the Superannuation Act so as to provide adequate pensions for the officers and men of the Permanent Forces is receiving the earnest consideration of the Government. A scheme has been drawn up by the Defence Department, and has been submitted to the Superannuation Board for their consideration. It has now been referred to the actuaries for their report, and the Government has decided that it shall be dealt with as an urgent matter. It. is hoped that the necessary legislation will be introduced this session. </para>

                    <para>Dunk sailed for England in June, 1917, per s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Beltana.</inline> He alleged that during the voyage ho met with an accident. The Commonwealth legal advisers in London admitted liability, and as a result ho was paid 30s. weekly under the provisions of the Seamen's Compensation Act, less an amount of 15s. weekly which he drew in respect of an old-age pension. This continued from the date of the accident until September, 1920, when he accepted a lump sum of £120 in full payment of the Commonwealth's liabilities in respect of his injuries. </para>

                            <para>His old-age pension has been paid from 30th April, 1914, when he must have been at least Co years of age, i.e., the age of eligibility for pension. He would thus be at least 08 when applying for employment as a munition worker1. In spite of this, he gave his age as 54. </para>

                            <para>He has always been paid the maximum pension, excepting when payment was stopped to adjust overpayments made owing to misrepresentation - i.e., payment as munition worker exceeding the statutory limit of income under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and again for six months after conviction on a charge of stealing by finding. </para>

                            <para>At first Dunk refused to accept the £120, as he understood the old-age pension would be reduced to approximately 5s. weekly. On the case being explained to him, he begged to be allowed to accept the amount. In spite of this, he has twice applied to the courts on the grounds that the compensation was inadequate. In both cases judgment was given against him. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators will remember that towards the close of the discussion of this clause last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> seemed to convey the impression that I had made some comments in favour of the nationalization of the private banks. The nationalization of banking has been on the Labour party's platform for a number of years, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> cares to carefully peruse my remarks, he will find that I made it quite clear that, in my opinion, the Commonwealth Bank should make its way in fair competition with the private banks. It should be able to do that, because it has the credit and resources of the Commonwealth behind it. Only by more efficient, management and more effective trading operations could the Commonwealth Bank take over the bulk of the banking business in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> states, that is what we usually find in connexion with government enterprises. It is delightful, in this instance at least, to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> in accord with my views. Although I did not say the things attributed to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> it would appear from that honorable senator's comments that I should have said so. When the Commonwealth Bank Bill was before the Senate twelve years ago, I was opposed to the Government's proposal - although it was the proposal of a Labour Government - of control by one man. There was . considerable diversity of opinion at the time. The idea in the minds of the members of the old Liberal party was that there should be a directorate of five; some favoured a board of three, but the Government's majority was sufficient to enable them to provide that the bank should be controlled by ou« man. In perusing the records, I find that I voted against the management being placed in the hands of one man, and also against the board of five, but t supported a directorate of three. On this occasion my action will be somewhat modified, because I shall vote to leave out the word "seven," which is being proposed with the intention of inserting " five," but if the opportunity is given me I shall move to insert the word "three." Personally, I am quite prepared to admit that the Government's proposal of 1911, which placed the control of the bank under one man, has been justified, although I am not prepared to say that the bank has done all that we expected it to do. The bank has carried out its work efficiently, and has been a much greater success than its opponents anticipated. It has shown us what can be done by the Commonwealth engaging in banking. There is another aspect of the Government's proposals that the amendment desires to change. It is that the directorate snail be composed of men representative of diverse interests. That is one of the worst provisions of the bill. </para>

The amendment proposes to amend the clause in the direction of reducing the number of directors to be appointed. If the number is reduced the representation of interests provided for by the clause cannot be effected. </para>

                        <para>- When you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> have been a member of this committee sufficiently long to understand me - and I realize that it must be a lengthy process - I think you will find that I am never out of order in debate. It is very easy for any one who is not acquainted with my methods of reasoning to become possessed of a mistaken idea regarding the trend of my argument, and to rule me out of order before I reach the point I have in view. I was endeavouring to show that the amendment, by aiming at a reduction in the number of directors to be appointed to the board, also has a bearing upon a later provision that those directors must possess commercial, manufacturing, pastoral, agricultural, and currency experience That, to my mind, is the very worst feature of the bill. A strong argument in favour of leaving out the word " seven " is that the lesser of two evils is to be preferred, and it would certainly be better to appoint five directors than it would be to appoint seven, in addition to the governor of the bank. </para>

                        <para>- The evil will be minimized if we reduce the number of directors, as the Government then will not be able to give representation to as many interests as at present it proposes shall have representation. Whatever the number may be, the positions should be given to those who, by reason of their character, capacity, and attainments, are best fitted to fill them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> I think, said that he favoured appointing sixteen directors, one to retire annually, in order to prevent a sudden change being made in the policy of the bank, and to guard against political influence being used. The clause itself leaves the way open for the use of political influence, because it provides that the appointments shall be made by the Governor-General. He will act on the advice of the Executive Council, the members of which hold political appointments. Nothing would be gained by appointing a large directorate with the object of tying the hands of a future Labour Government. If I held office in a Labour Government that had a majority in both Houses, and a directorate which was appointed by the present Government was doing its duty well, I would allow it to continue without interference and unhampered in any way. But if such a directorate were preventing the development of the bank in the direction desired by the people, a simple way of dealing with the matter would be to introduce an amending bill. If the present Government, which cannot be said to represent the people, possesses the power to introduce an amending banking bill, how much greater would be the power of a government that did re&gt;present the people, to reduce the number of directors to what it considered was right and proper. To show that action is possible  against a board of  this description. I would refer honorable senators to what occurred in New South Wales some time ago. In that state the railways are managed by a board of commissioners. A Liberal Government with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Carruthers  as Premier, becoming dissatisfied, introduced a bill to dispense with the services of one of the commissioners. The bill also contained a provision which took from that officer his right of appeal to the courts. I feel quite certain that the Labour party would not follow such a wicked precedent as that. I mention the matter merely to illustrate what can be done when the occasion warrants it. I have not from that day to this learned the reason for  the action taken by the New South Wales Government. Strangely enough",, the gentleman concerned did not appeal against that action. A reason may be found in the fact that shortly afterwards the same Government, appointed him to another position in the public life of the state. Continuity of policy may be detrimental to banking, which is a. peculiar, business that requires to be directed by men who are highly trained and have a widen outlook combined with a quick perception. They must not merely follow the traditional lines laid down by centuries of safe banking, but they must be able to foresee an impending danger and be prepared to meet it. Therefore, I can see no virtue in appointing a board which, because of its solidity and strength, would follow set lines and provide/ a continuity of policy. On the other hand, very great disadvantages would attach to the appointment of a large number of directors. The officer changed with the management of the bank could carry out his duties much more efficiently if he knew that his policy would be approved. I realize that it is not wise, in connexion with government institutions,, in their infancy, to place too much power in the hands of one man. I think that the appointment of three directors would provide a happy medium. Those three should be the Governor of the bank, the Deputy Governor, and the secretary to the Treasury. That would be an excellent directorate for the- Commonwealth Bank, because the Governor and the Deputy-Governor would bring to the board a full knowledge of financial proposals without others interested being aware of what was contemplated. The Secretary to the Treasury would be well posted in matters of policy. He would inform the Treasurer and, through the Treasurer, the Government of the day, of what the bank was doing. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should like to say a word or two in reply to some remarks directed against the proposal which I have submitted. Of course, it will be admitted on all hands that the change which the Government is making in the control of the bank is- a fundamental one. The Government proposes that control shall be taken from the Governor of that institution and placed in the hands of a board.. I have already indicated in the course of. the debate on this measure, that I arm in sympathy with the broad principles, of that proposal, but I am very doubtful whether the class of. directorate which the Government intends to set up is likely to be the most desirable in the interests of. the bank. The main consideration' in connexion with the board is not that the men comprising it should be drawn from the various states of Australia; not that they should have been connected with certain industries or branches of commerce,, but that they should be fully qualified to sit, and able to sit, on the directorate of the bank. By this I mean that the directors should be on the spot from day to day, and from hour to hour, if their services were required. </para>

That, I think, is obvious and requires no argument. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> if the board were drawn from the various states - that is to say, suppose one man was in Cairns, another in Fremantle another in Adelaide, and another in Melbourne. and perhaps two in Sydney - how long would it take to get it together? </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with my honorable . friend at all. The directorate will not be required to discuss only questions of policy. It should be constantly in touch with the whole of the financial operations of Australia, and able to use immediately the resources of the bank to the best advantage and in the interests of the people of Australia. The Government, as indicated in the speech delivered by the Treasurer in another place, proposes to transform the Commonwealth Bank and the Notes Board into a  central bank, a bank of banks, a bank of issue, deposit, discount, exchange, and reserve. On page 5 ©f the Treasurer's printed speech, we find the statement that it is not proposed that the bank shall enter into competition: with the' other banks at all; that it shall sheer off that class of business and devote its attention and resources entirely to the business of central banking. That is what is contem.pllated, and to do that I .say that the bank must be controlled by a board that will really function. If must not be a board to be called together only once in a while to' discuss abstract questions of policy. It must meet weekly, and by functioning constantly, effectively control the affairs of the bank in the way best calculated to perform the highly important duties expected of it. The bank must be so con-  tf  trolled, if it is to be successful along the lines which the Government is proposing, although, personally, owing to the manner in which the bill is drawn, I very much doubt that it can. Nevertheless, let us give it a reasonable chance. The only way to do that is to have a compact board of thoroughly competent men, chosen for no other reason than their competency and integrity. A board is needed which can function constantly from day to day, and even from hour to hour, in times of crisis. </para>

There is no safeguard against that, nor can there be. If five men are appointed instead of seven, as proposed in the clause, the appointments may be made so as to spread over a period of seven years, just as easily as seven appointments may be made to spread over such a period. I must confess that I do not see any reason for the appointment of what I may call the currency directors. They will not serve any useful purpose. It would be much better to omit that provision altogether, and so leave only five appointments to be made. </para>

                <para> SenatorREID (Queensland) [3.42].- The speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> is, to my mind, a strong argument in favour of seven appointments rather than five. On first glancing at the bill I thought that the Government was proposing too large a board, but I have taken the opportunity to ascertain the size of the directorates of various banking companies which are equally as important as we hope the Commonwealth Bank will be. My investigations have convinced me that a board of eight directors, inclusive of the governor, is small enough. The directors of the private banking companies have been re-appointed from time to time, and I have no doubt their experience has proved the wisdom of large directorates. Most of the banks that I have in mind have larger boards than that proposed by the Government for the Commonwealth Bank. It has been remarked frequently during this debate that the bank management has not used all the powers conferred upon it by the original act, and I believe that if a progressive directorate were obtained, steps would be taken to see that the bank exercised all its powers and also fulfilled the purpose of a central bank. The commercial world has been agitated for some time by the resistance which the Notes Issue Board has offered to the requests by private financial institutions that it should issue additional notes. Probably if that board had not been so small numerically, and if its members had had wider experience of the commercial world, they would not have adopted their present attitude. It appears to me that the matter of the issuing of notes may pass away to-day and return to-morrow. A directorate of eight would be in a much better position to give expression to the wishes of the commercial community in regard to the issue of notes than would be a smaller directorate, for the larger number of men would undoubtedly be in touch with wider interests than would the smaller number. As to the qualifications of the directors, I agree with the majority of honorable senators who have addressed themselves to this aspect of the subject, that we need men who are well acquainted with financial matters. A gentleman may be well informed in his own particular line of business, and yet know very little about the intricacies of finance. It is essential that the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank shall be composed of financial experts. If gentlemen can be found who possess the desired industrial, manufacturing, agricultural, or pastoral knowledge, in addition to extensive financial experience, it would certainly be wise to appoint them, but the first requirement in these directors should be a thorough knowledge of finance. So far as I have been able to gather, the private banking institutions have not selected their directors or managers on account of their knowledge of agricultural, pastoral, or other industries, but on account of their financial ability. </para>

                <para>SenatorREID. - That is so. The wisdom of appointing such men has been proved by the success of the private banks, especially since the financial collapse of 1893. One of the main reasons for that unfortunate happening was that the private banks in those' days had authority to issue, for their own use, an unlimited number of notes. So many notes were issued that when large numbers of them were produced simultaneously for payment in gold the banks were unable to honour them. In those days I know that I could only get 15s. for 20s. notes. Some banks were offering 17s. 6d. In Queensland the Government ultimately guaranteed payment in full. We are not likely to have a repetition of that experience, for to-day the banks have practically to buy their notes, and care is taken to ensure that there are substantial reserve funds to meet any demands that may be made. If the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank is to have power to issue notes, it is essential that it should be composed of men who have a thorough knowledge of the commercial necessities of Australia, and particularly the seasonal requirements, for after all, Australia's financial needs are largely governed by seasonal conditions. It would be wise to have the larger board, also, in order that difficulty may not be experienced in obtaining a quorum. If the committee agrees to the Government proposal to have at least one director m each of the capital cities of Australia, it will be almost essential to have a largo directorate, for it will not be practicable for, say, the director in Brisbane, or Perth, or even Adelaide, to get to the bank's head-quarters frequently to attend , board meetings. For* the reasons given I favour the clause as it stands, and shall vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I give notice that I intend to move a further amendment that the number of directors be three. If I had my way, I should have the bank managed as it has been since its inception, by one man. The institution has won the approbation of the people of the Commonwealth. It has passed through a war period never previously experienced in Australia. Any justification for strengthening its management would have been demonstrated during that period, but it passed successfully through that time of difficulty, under the control of one man. Therefor, I fail to see the necessity for making any alteration at this stage in respect to it management. </para>

                        <para>- Additional duties can now be undertaken by the bank more easily than they could have been in the earlier years of its existence; I could understand a proposal to strengthen its management if it had proved a failure or if any fault could be found with its administration, but the bank has proved itself, and no fault has been found with its conduct. How can seven directors, who meet monthly, strengthen the institution We do not know what the special qualifications of the directors will be, except that two of them, if the bill is passed in its present form, will be associated with agricultural or pastoral industries, and. two others will have a knowledge of currency. I am afraid that the directors who possess these qualifications will spend their time discussing currency and other matters without doing anything to bring about the substantial progress of the bank. Many prominent men are offered positions as directors of companies, because the promoters of those companies realize that their services will be of value to the concerns with which they become associated. But ornamental directors will not be required for the control of the Commonwealth Bank. We shall not get the best men to devote the greater part of their time to the bank unless the directors meet more frequently than once a month. It would not pay any person engaged in a big way of business to neglect his private affairs to attend even monthly meetings of a board. The directors appointed might have an unconscious bias against government institutions. They might not approach their duties with absolutely unprejudiced minds. If directors are to be appointed, we should pay substantial salaries to get the best men, and we should requisition  their  services weekly, or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> suggests, have them always available at a moment's notice. The Victorian railways are managed by three commissioners, who are appointed for four years. Can any one compare the work which they perform with that which is to be undertaken by the directors of the Commonwealth Bank? The Victorian Railways Commissioners, who control railways which cost £63,000,000, and cover 4,300 miles of line, employ nearly 27,000 persons. The gross earnings of the railways under their control is £10,750,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>- Would the honorable senator say that among 27,000  employees there is not likely to be one with qualifications that would fit him to be a commissioner of railways? Most railway commissioners have risen from the ranks. The latest case in proof of that lis the appointmentof <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miscamble,</inline> who rose from the ranks to the position of a commissioner of railways in Victoria, and has just been appointed to a similar position in Tasmania. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has put up an excellent case in favour of his amendment to reduce the number of directors to five, there is every reason to believe that the committee will agree to amend the clause in that direction, but I am hopeful, that at a later stage, they will go still further, and support my amendment to reduce the number to three. I think also, that the period of appointment should be limited to three years. If the directors knew that their appointment would depend upon their capacity, they would endeavour, during a short term of appointment, to do their very best to justify their reappointment. </para>

Is it to placate a certain section of the community,, irrespective of whether the persons are . qualified to fill the positions to which they are to be appointed ? We all know that certain influences, which are not in the best interests of the Commonwealth, are being exercised to-day, particularly in relation to freetrade, and to which I, as a protectionist, object.

                        <para>- The person appointed, because he has a knowledge of currency, may not be a wage-earner in an industry. According to my reading of history no section of any community has suffered so much as the wage-earner from the irregular or bad control of the currency. That great American jurist, Daniel Webster, once said that nothing has fertilized the rich men's fields so much with the sweat and tears of the poor man than the inflation of the currency. The poor man is always the last to receive the reward of his labours when markets are rising and prices are soaring. When he reaches the peak and begins to descend he is faced with inconstant employment, idleness, and poverty as the result of the disorganization of industry. </para>

                        <para>- It would exclude a lawyer, because such a profession is not mentioned. Apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has a very poor opinion of those who are engaged in the legal profession, because he practically says that they do not possess the qualifications necessary to fit them for appointment to the directorate. The amendment shuts out the medical profession, and, therefore, would even exclude from appointment the Commonwealth Treasurer, who is a medical man. Why have a restricted choice? Why not have the field wide and open ? That there is little or no difference between this proposal and the original provision was shown by the readiness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to accept it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I support the amendment because it approaches most nearly to the board desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> It offers an absolutely wide field. It does not affect lawyers in any way. The French have a phrase by which they refer to a certain class of persons as <inline font-style="italic">chevaliers d'industrie</inline> - knights of industry.  I  think that the lawyers might come within that definition, although it is not particularly applied to them. However, I leave honorable senators to look up the meaning of the phrase for themselves. Without being unduly strained, I think the definition can be taken to include lawyers. I believe in having the field of choice as wide and as unrestricted as possible. Prior to the leaving out of certain words, the field was restricted. I believe that an occupational restriction is as bad as the geographical restriction which is proposed later in the clause, and each merits equal condemnation. The amendment, to my mind, is an admirable one, which covers every class in the community/ Those who are not engaged in finance or commerce are, at all events, engaged in industry of some kind or other. I believe that the Leader of the Senate is thankful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> for having moved the  amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  Before any divisions took place on the clause, I protested against the restriction of the selection to any interest. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> intends to propose that wage-earners shall have representation on the board is an example of how wide we are getting in our view of what is required. The Government would secure the more speedy passage . of the measure if it did not accept amendments that in any way narrow its opportunities for making appointments. That i« the effect that this amendment will have. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> deserves to be congratulated for having pointed out that it will close the door against the appointment of lawyers. Possibly, many other people who are not mentioned also will be shut out, because they do not come  within the scope of the amendment. The suggestion that a blank be left in the clause is a most reasonable one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> doubtless, was surprised to find that the number of honorable senators supporting him was sufficiently large to enable a blank to be left in the clause. I can only conclude that the form of. the amendment is due to the haste with which it was drafted, on account of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> natural excitement at having won such a victory over the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mind how it is put so long as I keep in touch with the honorable senator's sympathies. Why should a man's occupation have any bearing upon appointments of this kind? The Government should take responsibility for the appointments, and reserve to itself the right of free selection. For this reason I do. not favour any restriction. The matter should be left entirely in the hands of the government that will make the appointments. Otherwise we can imagine what may occur at a meeting of the Cabinet. One Minister might suggest a certain man for appointment to the board, and another Minister might ask what sectional interests he represented. An inquiry might disclose that the person nominated was shut out by the definition. The Government would be well advised to allow the clause to pass with the blank created, and fill it in at their leisure. In that way the business of the Senate would be expedited. I do not know how many amendments the Minister has to move, but I think there are at least 40 or 50, and in addition to others which have been circulated by honorable senators, we get unofficial amendments,' that suggest themselves suddenly to us, but which may be far-reaching and very important. The committee, therefore, should pass the clause with the blank created in it. If necessary, it could be recommitted. The Minister, in the meantime, might see the advantage of the Government having a free hand with regard to the proposed appointments. Personally, I have not had time to consider the amendment, but so far as I am able to judge, it is opposed to my idea of how the appointments should be made. In my opinion, men should be selected because of their fitness for the position, irrespective of every other consideration. Using the illustration employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I may be permitted to suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> amendment panders to the agricultural or commercial interests of the country. Why should any sectional interests have this special concession ? </para>

                        <para>- The breadth of an outlook that is disinclined to include in our legislation any narrowing sentiment is a, breadth that I reached at a very early age in my public career. I have never yet recognized sectional interests, and I never shall. Why not pass the clause as amended, and leave the Government free to appoint men best suited for the work they will be called upon to perform? If we restrict the appointments in the manner suggested, we shall be including in our legislation a pernicious principle to which I am strongly opposed. If men, because of their knowledge of finance, are to be appointed, I have in mind the possibility of a man whom I regard as an interesting personage being ineligible for appointment. I refer to J. W. Scott, the author of an interesting pamphlet known as <inline font-style="italic">The Circulating Sovereign.</inline> I do not know whether he would be considered an authority in financial matters, but I should say that he is. </para>

                        <para>- Superior, in my opinion, to most of them. I do not think it is likely that the Government could appoint any man with a greater knowledge of currency and the circulation of money than the gentleman to whom I refer; but I suppose that if a man of his character were available the Government, being restricted by this definition, could not appoint him. I do not intend to vote for the inclusion of any such provision in the bill. The objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> appeals to me as a representative of the working classes, but I suggest that in these matters we do not want to consider sectional interests at all. If, however, sectional interests are to be represented, I can think of quite a number of amendments that appeal to me as most desirable. The Minister, if he accepts this amendment, instead of expediting the passage of the bill will go a long way in the direction of inviting from honorable senators on this side amendments representing sectional interests that are really worth consideration, and which, if submitted, would necessitate honorable senators supporting the Government voting in the division against those interests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> amendment, in my opinion, has not received sufficient consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> represents the same class of the community as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> he does not think that provision has been made for the appointment of a  wage-earner. The arguments that I used against the appointment of a representative of the pastoral interests apply with equal force against the appointment of a representative of the wage-earners. But I am chiefly concerned at the moment in revealing the attitude of mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> A few moments ago he willingly accepted an amendment which cleared the' way for the appointment to the board of a representative of the class he represents, but he now draws a marked distinction between pastoralists and wage-earners. The wage-earners of this country outnumber the pastoralists by millions, and it is just as likely that there are, proportionately, as many wage-earners as pastoralists in the community with qualifications which would justify their appointment to- the board. But the Minister is willing to overlook hundreds of thousands of wage-earners, and appoint a representative of the few pastoralists. Our object should be to provide for the appointment of the best men obtainable, irrespective of sectional interests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> reasons for rejecting the amendment may satisfy his supporters, but they do not satisfy me. I suppose that he has a sufficient number of followers behind him to cause the amendment to be defeated.  His  refusal to accept it is in accord with previous actions of the Government' of which he is a member. He and the Government have frequently drawn invidious distinctions between sections of the community, and this is an additional illustration of the length to which they are prepared to go in that respect. We have no right to draw distinctions between different classes of the community in dealing with legislation. The application of that principle to the appointment of a board of directors for the Commonwealth Bank is particularly objectionable. </para>

                        <para>- And I am surprised that the honorable senator is in his place in the committee to hear me enunciating it ! The representation of sectional interests in legislation like this is altogether undesirable. But, seeing that the Government has agreed to the representation of the pastoral interests, it could hardly be expected that I would sit down quietly wheal it absolutely refused to give any consideration to the wage-earning community. The one thing that keeps the Government together, and the one bond which unites the National and Country parties, is antipathy and opposition to the working class. The Government, and the National and Country parties which support it, fear the wage-earners and the wage-earners' representatives. I am  rather surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has not shown more knowledge of the inner workings of his party than to introduce an amendment like this. </para>

I cannot sing "The Red Flag," for Providence has not endowed me with the capacity to sing two lines, or even two notes, musically. But if I cannot sing, I can stand true to my convictions and principles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil</inline> has shown that he cannot be true to any principle for 20 minutes at a time.  His  best friends do not know how he will vote on anything. I do not think that he knows himself until the whip is cracked and he is dragged behind the Government. </para>

                    <para>- If you, sir, will protect me from irrelevant interjections, I shall try to confine myself to the measure under discussion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Lynch</inline> moved his amendment in order to make sure that a representative of the wage-earners should be appointed to the board of directors if one with sufficient qualifications could be found, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will not agree to it. He says, in effect, "We will accept a representative of the pastoralists, but not of the wage-earners." I am, therefore compelled, against my principles, to ask the committee to divide on the amendment, for it is necessary to show the country just how far honorable senators opposite will go in their desire to represent sectional interests, and, at the- same time, to demonstrate their opposition to anything that is calculated to assist the wage-earners. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators who know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> well will realize that if he has a doubt about the right of a wage-earner to be appointed to the board under the clause as it stands, there is a good deal of room for doubt. No member of the committee is keener than he to mark a distinction, and to anticipate possible trouble.  His  zeal in noticing distinctions of this kind has frequently brought me into conflict with him, and for that reason I appreciate fully his motive in moving the amendment. He feels that unless his amendment is included in the clause there is a danger that the largest section of our community will be overlooked when the directors of the bank are appointed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I made it quite clear previously that I objected to the representation of sectional interests on the proposed board of directors, but in view of the attitude of the Government on the matter, I am forced to support the amendment. I may as well inform the committee that in my opinion the workers are immeasurably better informed on financial matters generally than are the pastoralists, and are as well qualified as are the pastoralists to act as directors of the bank. When an opportunity is afforded by an honorable senator opposite to let  the  Government and the people outside see, by a division in the Senate, that the accepted opinion of pastoralists and financiers might not be that of wage-earners, I am prepared to be as inconsistent as possible by supporting that honorable senator in having a division taken on those lines. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator who leads the Opposition is somewhat labouring under a misapprehension in regard to the amendment. The proposal is to have a wage-earner with currency experience appointed . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> amendment referred to persons experienced in agriculture, commerce, finance, or industry, but they were not specifically to be employers. Wage-earners qualified by their experience in agriculture, commerce, finance or industry were to be just as open to selection as their employers. Therefore, wage-earners are already fully qualified for appointment to the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank; but as I think it will be somewhat difficult to find a wage earner with a sufficient knowledge of currency to enable him on account of that knowledge to occupy a seat on this board, I shall oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment. The field is left open to every one. That being so I do not think we should be in the position of the American who said he wanted the whole world " and then some." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment is the " then some." I do not believe in over painting  the picture or in gilding refined gold. </para>

                        <para>- We all know that it is not intended to appoint a wage-earner from the general community, but now that the committee has decided to specify four staple industries as a field of selection, I am proposing a further subdivision. The section of the community that rightly deserves representation on the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank is the wage-earning section, which history proves has suffered more than any other from the maladministration and the bad control of the currency of a country. I suppose that I have read as many books on currency in the Library as has any other honorable senator, and the one outstanding lesson I have extracted from those books is that in every community it is the wage-earning section that suffers from the bad management of the currency. Now that we are proposing to create the " high command " of the Commonwealth Bank we should introduce into it a representative of that element, which would suffer most from the bad management of the institution in the exercise of its control of the currency. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> went astray by introducing a reference to party politics. I believe that honorable senators on the ministerial side represent as many wage-earners as do honorable senators opposite. My object in submitting my amendment is to have on the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank some one who will see that the interests of those who suffer most in any time of crisis are properly guarded when the critical hour comes. </para>

I take it, of course, that if my amendment is agreed to the Government will appoint to the board of directors the person so nominated. My proposal is a departure in banking, but it is admitted that the whole of the banking experience of the Commonwealth has completely failed to grapple with the exchange position. It has also to be admitted that on more than one occasion some of the banks in this country would have failed had it not been for the support accorded them by the state governments, which shows conclusively that those in control were incapable of efficiently conducting financial operations. That cannot be denied by any one, because the records show quite clearly that owing to the inefficiency and incompetency of the banking fraternity depositors doing business with the banks in this city lost approximately £14,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the calamity was not averted by the directors who were in charge of banking operations at that time. To a lesser extent, owing to the incompetence of bankers in the city of Sydney, the depositors lost approximately £5,000,000. Taking into consideration the whole of the facts in connexion with banking in Australia, it will be found that £30,000,000 has been lost by depositors. I do not know whether a somewhat similar financial crisis is in evidence at present, but we are quite certain that for a considerable time it has been difficult for those who desire to extend their businesses and to obtain accommodation from the banks to have their requirements met. This condition has been brought about, notwithstanding the fact that there is not an employee of any of the Australian banks on the directorates. If provision is made in the direction I indicate it may be' said that the Commonwealth Bank will be .handicapped to some extent in competing with other  banks, which, have the right to select their directors from persons who, in their opinion, are competent to do the work. It is not uncommon, however, in modern industrial concerns, for employees to have a voice in the management, and the appointment of one employee recommended, and in effect appointed by his ' fellow employees, would have a good effect," inasmuch as it would be the means of rapidly, effectively and permanently overcoming any differences that might arise between the employees and the management. It is of great importance in a big financial institution such as the Commonwealth Bank, the operations of which we hope will extend, that the employees shall work in complete harmony with the management. As my amendment, if adopted, would have a beneficial effect in that direction, I trust it will have the support of a majority of the members of the committee. </para>

                        <para>- It is difficult of course for some of us to keep in touch with modern progress. We have passed the days of the stage-coach and railway trains, and now have to keep pace with flying machines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is one of those fortunate mortals who can keep in touch with democratic development in a most amazing way. Reference to job control would probably -be objectionable, but something should be said on behalf of the people who have to do the work. Therefore if we admit the fact, which I do, that the people who do the work should have a voice in the. conditions under which their duties have to be performed, the employees should be given representation on the board. I can see no" objection to the principle, which is a good one, but whether it would be wise to support it here, I do not know. It certainly  doe3  not differ greatly from the proposal" submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> or that accepted by the Minister. Being satisfied that these short cuts are really the longest way round, I shall not take up the time of the committee, but if a division is called for I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is merely suggested that we should give the employees of the Commonwealth Bank the right to nominate one member of the board. A representative of the employees, if elected, would have to sway the opinions of six other members before effect could be given to any proposal he submitted. If there is any one in the community who ought to be' skilled in finance it is those engaged in the business of banking. The Government do not appear to have any objection to sections being represented - in fact they suggested that some of the directors should be selected from men engaged in certain industries - and the only difference between the proposal I have submitted and that originally made by the Government, is that those in the business I have mentioned would make the nomination. I do not know whether the Government intend that those engaged in agricultural or pastoral pursuits or associated with commerce or industry, shall make the nominations or whether that will be the duty of the Government. When these appointments are under consideration those engaged in the industries specified in the bill will find a means of advising the Government who, in their opinion, are best fitted for the positions. The only difference between the appointments to be made by the Government and the one I suggest is of a technical character, and I trust the Government will see their way clear to accept this moderate instalment of an up-to-date method of conducting business. </para>

                <para class="block">If this amendment is agreed to I shall move a further amendment providing that the period of appointment shall be three instead of seven years. There is no justification for appointing the directors for the period stated in the bill. As I pointed out earlier, those entrusted with the management of big government undertakings are appointed for a much shorter period. The Railways Commissioners in Victoria are appointed for four years, and are eligible for reappointment. I understand that the governor and the  deputy  governor of the Bank of England - an old established institution - are appointed annually. Yet it is proposed to appoint to this institution for seven years gentlemen who will be new to the business they will be called upon to transact, in that they will not have been directly associated with the bank. The committee would do well to say that the period of their appointment shall be three years. The gentlemen who were appointed would then know that, unless they were fit for the position, and satisfied the Government of the day and the people of the Commonwealth that they were performing their duties in a thoroughly satisfactory manner, there would be no hope of their being reappointed. It would be an incentive to them to put forth their very best efforts in the conduct of the business of the bank. There would be no doubt that if they made good they would be re-appointed. What objection can there be to providing that the appointment shall be for three years? I do not think that many big institutions in Australia appoint their directors for so lengthy a period as that proposed in the bill. The directors of many financial and' industrial concerns are appointed annually. It is proposed that the bank shall be completely transformed, and shall in future function in a manner entirely different from that in which it has been functioning since its establishment. Yet it is urged that the directors should be appointed for periods ranging up to seven years ! The shorter the period the better will be the result. The directors will be called together only twelve times annually. ' Their appointment, therefore, cannot be regarded very seriously. If it were a serious proposition, the Government would provide that meetings of the directors should be held weekly, on oftener if need be. Every honorable senator, I believe, is actuated by the desire to have the affairs of the bank entrusted, to the very best men available. We should not, therefore, make these appointments for such a long period that special legislation will be necessary to alter it if the system works unsatisfactorily. I know that the Government is wedded to the provisions of the bill, and that, in some directions, it is very hard to move it. But it has yielded to representations made by honorable senators opposite, and I am justified in asking that favorable, consideration be given to the amendment. The supporters of the Government; too, should not make up their minds hurriedly, and conclude that, because the Government has seen fit to include this provision in the bill, they must necessarily vote for it. I think that they should approach the matter with open minds. If they do, I believe there is a chance of the period of appointment being limited. Public opinion, I consider, is not in favour of the proposed change in the management of the bank. I believe it is opposed to the management of the bank by directors. This is the people's bank, and it should be run in their interest. In view of the importance of the departure proposed in regard to the future management of the bank, the Government should seriously consider whether the period of seven years will prejudicially affect the interests of the people. If the amendment receives the consideration that it merits, I am hopeful that the number of honorable senators who will support it will be sufficiently large to carry it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not know whether the amendment has been seriously proposed. The governor- and the deputy governor of the Commonwealth Bank are, in reality, the manager and deputy manager of that institution. Does any one seriously consider that anybody who is worth while will be found willing to accept either of those positions for three years? The directors are dealt with in a subsequent clause, and I do not intend to waste the time of the committee by now referring to the period of their appointment. If men who are worthy of the salary that will attach to these positions are to be secured they must be offered appointment for a longer term than three years, and seven years is quite short enough. </para>

                        <para>- That somewhat alters, the aspect of the position, because I think the Minister wastes more time than any other honorable senator. Here a new departure is contemplated. What would happen if the appointments were made for a period of three years, with the right of renewal? If the Ministry was lucky in its (appointments, and they proved to be justified, a renewal of the engagements would be assured. If, on the other hand, judgment in regard to the appointments proved faulty, without this amendment it would be most difficult for any government to remove objectionable members from the board. The Minister has asked who would take the position under the conditions imposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> amendment. Without wishing to acclaim my own abilities, because I do not think I would come within the definition, I would accept a position on the directorate. We all know that any person so appointed would take very good care to discharge the duties of the office as satisfactorily as possible in order to ensure re-appointment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> amendment suggests wisdom. Experience might well justify it, because we might have on the board a person who, although quite suitable from the point of view of ability, might be temperamentally unable to work with his fellow members to such an extent as to make good work by the directorate impossible. To my mind, as we are getting away from the old system, the Minister, instead of what appears to be a display of temper, might  very well 'give the amendment reasonable 'consideration. The term mentioned is the :same as that fixed for a member of the House of Representatives, .and one half that of a member of this chamber.* We should remember that we are dealing with a bill that has come to us from .another place, where detailed discussion was not permitted and that, in this chamber, for the present, at all events, there is freedom of discussion. We should not permit of any curtailment of our right to discuss adequately all measures, especially  those  that have not received sufficient consideration in another place. The amendments which the Minister is submitting will have to go back to another place where, under existing conditions, there will not be sufficient time for proper consideration. Therefore, the views of honorable senators on this side of the committee should be adequately stated. I trust that the Minister will reconsider his decision* and accept the amendment. It would be most encouraging to honorable senators on this side if occasionally he would accept proposals made by us. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to give the amendment more consideration than I think it deserves. In the first place it alludes, I understand, to the whole of the directorate, including the Governor and the  Deputy  Governor. It is questionable whether that portion of the amendment which specifically refers to the directors is quite in order, but certainly that portion which seeks to shorten the term of the Governor and  Deputy  Governor is absolutely out of order. A young man who joins the Commonwealth Bank as a junior clerk should expect to be able to work up through the various stages to the  deputy  governorship or the governorship. If by an amendment of this sort we cut off the Governor and the  Deputy  Governor in their prime, we shall destroy incentive to effort on the part of the men in the lower branches of the bank's service. A man who, after a lifetime of service, has proved his fitness for the position he occupies, should not be required to put himself up for reappointment at the end of three years. I do not think the honorable senator has considered this aspect of the case. </para>

                    <para>.- Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> is not conversant with quite a number of appointments that are made in Victoria. Earlier in the day, and as a reason why the committee should agree to limit the period of appointment to the directorate for three years, I instanced the appointment of railways commissioners in this state and contrasted the work which they have to do with the work that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank will be called upon to perform. The railways commissioners in Victoria are appointed for a term of four years, and whilst it may be true, and no doubt is true, that sometimes we obtain the services of gentlemen from overseas, in the main the appointments are made from the Victorian railway service. In what way, may I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> will we destroy the incentive of any young man in the employ of the Commonwealth Bank if we limit the period of the appointments to three years? If a young man entered the service of the bank as a messenger, and eventually rose to a high and responsible position on the directorate, he would be appointed for a period of three years. We may be quite sure that during that period of three years he would endeavour to make good, so that there would be no doubt whatever about his reappointment. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator would have us believe that gentlemen possessing all the qualifications for appointment to the board would not "jump" at the opportunity if my amendment were carried. The persons likely to receive the appointments are men engaged in business of some kind, and perhaps in a very large way. Certainly they will not be amongst the unemployed. Their time will be mainly taken up with the business about which they are most concerned. A position on the bank directorate will, in a measure, be a minor matter to them. Once a month they will come along to a meeting and draw £50 for each sitting. I cannot see how the proposed limitation will make any difference at all so far  as  they are concerned. If they were full-time directors, in receipt of substantial salaries, it might be a different proposition, but it is not seriously proposed that they shall devote the major portion of their time to the duties of the hank. I understand that, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> is against the proposal to limit the period to three years so far as the governor and  deputy  governor are concerned, he is disposed to favour this limitation in regard to the other directors. Why should they not be treated alike? We have shown a disposition to assist honorable senators supporting the Government in regard to other matters, and in return we now ask them to help us in the direction of limiting the period of appointment of the directors. </para>

I think that the committee, in agreeing to an amendment moved some time ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> indicated that it did not desire the Government to give undue consideration to the representation of the various states, but rather desired that the best men available should be appointed to the board. The issue is clearly before the committee, and therefore I shall not labour the matter, particularly as the acceptance of my amendment will not really  debar  the Government from taking into consideration the representation  of  the various states on the board. </para>

                    <para>. -  The proposal of the Government to provide for the representation of certain localities in making appointments to the board of directors, is a recrudescence of a mischievous principle, formerly included in the electoral laws of various states, which resulted in territories and not people being represented in Parliament. I therefore oppose the adoption of the clause as drafted, and support the amendment. The committee has shown clearly that it desires the Government to appoint to the board the very best men obtainable, irrespective of the locality in which they may be temporarily residing. The Government also has indicated that it does not desire to be unduly hampered by restrictions in appointing the board. The proposal in this sub-clause seems, therefore, to be inconsistent with the general intentions of the Government. I suppose that the idea behind the subclause is that a man who lives in Kalgoorlie will not be so capable of representing the best interests of, say, Queensland and Australia generally, as one who lives in Cairns; but I do not agree with that view. Any intention to accept that principle should be abandoned and the Government should be left absolutely free and untrammelled to appoint the best men it can secure. Personally I have no objection to the Government appointing all the members of the board from one city, or town, or village, so long as it is satisfied that they are the best that can be secured. </para>

The committee has already shown its reluctance to limit the period of first appointment to five years, but I think the period of re-appointment should be limited to four years. If four years is a sufficiently long term for the appointment of railways commissioners, it should be a sufficiently long term for a board of directors to be re-appointed after they have occupied the positions for the respective periods specified for their first appointment. </para>

Once appointed, subject to good behaviour, they continue to act as commissioners until they resign or die. In their first period of appointment the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank will be given a trial, and upon what they show they are capable of doing the Government will be safe in deciding whether they should be re-appointed for another term of seven years. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to give the Senate a few of the outstanding facts and figures in connexion with these papers, and to make a few general observations regarding the position of the finances of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The revenue of 1923-24 amounted to £65,077,810, which was £4,078,810 in excess of the budget estimate of £60,999,000. As regards the excess of £4,078,810, this has been principally affected by three items. The revenue from </para>
                    <para class="block">Customs and excise was estimated at £29,650,000, but £35,750,784 was received, which constitutes a record. A considerable variation from the estimated revenue occurred in regard to income tax, which only yielded £11,057,555 instead of the estimate of £13,000,000. The reduced amount received under this head was due largely to the disturbance connected with the transfer of the assessment and collection of income tax to the state departments, the work of assessment being considerably in arrear at the close of the year, when there were on hand unexamined returns numbering 279,000. The amount of tax remaining to be assessed, however, cannot at present be ascertained. Apart from this, it would appear that the estimate of £13,000,000 was rather optimistic. The postal revenue for the year produced £104,000 in excess of the estimate - the estimate being £9,653,000, and the receipts £9,757,021. </para>
                    <para>Turning now to expenditure out of revenue for the past year, the actual expenditure amounted to £62,484,169. The budget estimate was £60,951,848, so that the expenditure exceeded the estimate by £1,532,321. This excess was caused by certain expenditure that was quite unavoidable. The figures relating to the excess of revenue over expenditure, 1923-24, are : - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The estimated expenditure of 1924-25 is £63,445,183, and may be set out under the following headings. For purposes of comparison, the actual expenditure of 1923-24 is also shown. </para>

                    <para>In addition to the estimated expenditure for 1924-25, £63,445,183, shown above, we shall have to pay £923,785 on account of interest on loans raised for the states. Including that amount, the total estimated expenditure for 1924-25 is £64,368,968. The most outstanding figure amongst those I have just quoted is the special defence provision of £1,000,000 in 1924-25. The Government has decided to initiate a programme of development upon which there will be required this year a sum of £1,000,000. The programme is marked out in stages, the first stage totalling five years, at the end of which period the Government expects that the defences of the country will have advanced to a definite point. Full details of this programme will be placed before senators when the Estimates are under consideration. </para>
                    <para>Under all heads, including repayment of interest on loans raised for the states and repayment of fruit advances, it is estimated that the total revenue for 1924-25 will be £64,395,000, as compared with £66,017,203, received in 1923-24. Details of these receipts are given in the budget-papers which have been circulated. The estimated expenditure of 1924-25 has been stated as £64,368,968, the estimated revenue is £64,395,000, so that the estimated surplus on the year's transactions is £26,032. </para>
                    <para>In 1923-24, revenue moneys amounting to £4,915,755 were used for redemption of the public debt. After making this payment, the accumulated surplus at 30th June, 1924, amounted to £5,100,003/ It is proposed to deal with this surplus as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will no doubt expect some announcement with regard to the matter of a remission of income tax. The Government proposes to make such a remission, but this is rendered possible only because we are receiving a large revenue from the duties of Customs and excise. Much of these .imposts fall upon persons with small incomes and large families. On such persons income tax presses with severity, and the Government has decided to ask Parliament to grant them a substantial concession. The general income tax exemption will be increased from £200 to £300, and will diminish by £1 for every £3 by which the income exceeds £300. All persons in receipt of incomes up to £1,200, or 96 per cent, of the taxpayers, will benefit as a result of raising the exemption. These will still bear a large share of the burden of indirect taxation. As many as 260,000 will be relieved altogether of the payment of income, tax, and by reason of the higher exemption, 180,000 other taxpayers will pay reduced tax. The tax payable by individuals still subject to tax will be reduced by 10 per cent. This further concession will benefit 200,000 taxpayers, and must have an important influence on development in Australia. In view of the special circumstances of the gold mining industry, it has been decided to exempt from income tax the profit derived from gold mining, until the whole of the working capital invested has been returned to the owners. The remission of tax in these directions will amount to £2,000,000. In addition to the remis'sion of £2,000,000, the tax on lotteries <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> being discontinued, as part of the proposal to assist Tasmania. At the present time the Commonwealth receives about £111,000 from this source, which it is understood Tasmania will re-impose. Queensland will also benefit by this decision. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not quite clear  as to  the real meaning of the proposed new section 12a, when read in conjunction with the proposed new section 15. The proposed new section 12a provides that the governor of the bank shall be the chief executive officer of the bank, and that the Deputy Governor shall perform such duties as are directed by the board. The proposed new section 15 gives the Governor-General power, in case of the illness of the Governor of the bank for a period extending over two months, to appoint a deputy who shall have all the powers and perform all the duties of the Governor. It does not appear  to  me that there will be power to constitute that deputy the chief executive officer of the bank, which is what the bill does in the case of the Governor. If I read the bill correctly, the management of the bank, in the event of the Governor being absent, through illness, for a period exceeding two months, will be placed in the hands of the directors, because the Deputy Governor will have to take his instructions from the board. Is  it  advisable that the management of the bank should be  in  the hands of the directors, seeing that four directors  will  constitute a quorum? Whilst the Deputy Governor may be able to exercise a voice at meetings of the board, it appears to me that he will not have a vote. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has misread the proposed new section 15. It provides that in the case of the illness of the Governor, the  Deputy  Governor, any director, or any member of a local board, or in the absence of any of those gentlemen for a period exceeding two months, the Governor-General may appoint - in the first-mentioned case not necessarily the  Deputy  Governor, as SenatorFindley imagines, but a person to act as a  deputy  of the Governor. Whilst so acting, he will have all the powers and perform all the duties of the Governor. He will thus be the chief executive officer of the bank. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that I have submitted an amendment to a postponed clause. As that will be printed, honorable senators will have an opportunity of considering it. It appears from the Minister's remarks that, because of future banking business likely to be transacted with London, the Ministry intends forthwith, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> to appoint a board in London, although it has not been made clear yet what will be the nature of the proposed board. To what extent will it control the Australian end of the branch bank operating in London ? The Minister should make an allowance for honorable senators who have not had an opportunity of considering this amendment. On the spur of the moment I am not prepared to vote for it. Why should we create a board in London? This is a far-reaching amendment, and with the suspicion which I always have in regard to matters that are not fair and above-board, I want further information. This appears to me to be part and parcel of, shall I say, a conspiracy on the part of certain honorable senators opposite, by which private banking institutions are by an amendment in this bill, to get notes issued on securities held in London. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> played a leading part in that business, I am not prepared to accept blindfold any proposal which he may bring forward with regard to the creation of a board in London. The amendment which the honorable senator succeeded in forcing upon the Government by the votes of a few insurgent followers gives the Private  banks all the advantage of notes issued, not on a gold basis, or upon Australian securities, but oil securities held by the private banks in London. Now the honorable senator wants to bring about the appointment of a London board. He tells us that he gave notice of his intention during his second-reading speech. If one cares to peruse his speech one will find that he practically foreshadowed the remodelling of the whole bill, so that whenever he submits an amendment in committee he is able to say that he gave us notice of it in his second-reading speech. </para>

                        <para>- I took the trouble to get the figures, because if there is one thing I am particular about it is that I should make no misstatement. I said that the Minister -had about 40 amendments. I now find that he has more than 40. Possibly, the Minister will say that his amendments are so trivial that he does not consider them amendments at all. But surely this proposal to appoint a board in London is a drastic amendment. I am anxious to help the Minister with his bill. Therefore, I suggest that the proposed new clause submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> be postponed until it is in print, and honorable senators have the opportunity  of studying its effect. If I cannot understand any proposal suddenly put forward, I endeavour to debate it until I do understand it. If, however, it is in print, and I have the opportunity of studying its effect upon a measure, I aim then in a position to judge whether it should pass without debate oi' be debated at length. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> amendment is ' far-reaching in its importance, and it has been sprung suddenly on the committee. Is it proposed to have boards also in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart,  Perth, and Darwin ? SO . far as the volume of business is concerned, there will be infinitely more in Sydney or Melbourne than ever there is likely to be between London and Australia. Why, then, appoint a London board ? What is the meaning of the amendment? The outrageous proposal to issue notes against London securities held by the private banks, convinces me that there is something more than Australia in this proposal. There is in it the influence of the London money magnates: the men who direct the financial affairs of the world. No doubt, they will give advice' to the manager of the London board, and I am satisfied that, whilst this Government remains in office, attention will bs paid to that advice. The manner in which the Minister accepted the amendment suggests that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> are carrying out instructions of which other honorable senators know nothing. This amendment is, in my opinion, part of a business that is being done behind the scenes, in the interests of private financial and trading institutions in London and elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> in his request for time to consider this very important amendment. Unhappily, I. did not have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> good fortune, because when I submitted an amendment last evening I received a mild reprimand from the Minister in charge of the bill for not having given notice of it. This amendment is very  important, and it requires time for the committee to properly digest it. Looked at superficially, it appears to be a praiseworthy effort on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> to improve the management of the bank, so far as the London end of the business is concerned. But whilst it may be most laudable, we  should consider carefully its probable effect upon the bank. The amendment means that the London end of the business is to be controlled by a board of advice appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the government of the day. Any vacancy that may occur on the board will be filled in the same way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has stated in no uncertain words that, when the Labour party is in occupation of the treasury bench, it will take good care that the controlling authority of the bank shall act in accordance with its wishes, and that any vacancies that may occur on the board in London or in Australia will be filled by gentlemen who will be prepared to give effect to its policy. That means nothing more nor less than political control of the bank. If the London board is politically controlled, it will not be of much value to the management of the bank in Australia. If a political element is introduced into the Commonwealth Bank management, it will sound the death-knell of the institution. </para>

In those circumstances, we should be most careful about agreeing to the amendment. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> would consent to alter his amendment to provide that the proposed London board shall be appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the board of directors in Australia, my objection to it would be removed. It is preferable to have a board appointed in accordance with the wishes of the Australian board than to have one appointed by a government which for the time being is in power. </para>

                        <para>- I am informing the committee of the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> speech made on my mind. He left me in no doubt that, when his party came into power, it would see that the board which controlled the bank in London would give effect to his party's policy. If that declaration is carried out, the board will, undoubtedly, have a political significance. In view of that likelihood, we should be very careful to consider the amendment thoroughly before we consent to it. We shall' be dealing presently with the proposal of the Government to appoint local boards of advice. According to my reading of that proposal, local boards of advice may be appointed not only in the capital cities, but in such cities as Ballarat and Bendigo. It seems to me we shall be making the Commonwealth Bank not a bank of banks, but a bank of boards. I disagree with the proposal to appoint local boards. </para>

                    <para>. - I must reply to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> concerning my statement of the intentions of the Labour party in regard to the board of directors of the bank. I said that it was quite apparent that political influence would control the bank for the time being, because the Governor-General, who will have the power to appoint directors, is the mouthpiece of the Government of the day. He will make the appointments on the advice of the Executive Council, and the Executive Council consists of the members of the Cabinet who are kept in office by a majority of the members in another place. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> however, that what I said was that if the board of directors that was appointed did good work it would not be interfered with when a Labour Government came into office, bub if it did evil it would certainly be removed. It cannot properly be inferred from that that the Labour party intends to interfere with the board if it manages the bank well, nor can it be truly said that I stated that the Labour party would bring political influence to .bear upon the management. The Labour party brought this bank into existence, and administered the act under which it was constituted for three of- the four years of its infancy, and I challenge our political opponents to give one instance of the Labour party having exercised political control over the management. We have never been guilty of it, nor shall we be, as long as the bank is run on proper lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> endeavoured to lead the' committee to believe otherwise. The position really is that this bank was created by a government elected by the people of Australia, that it operates in accordance with legislation passed by this Parliament, and that just as this Government is, by this bill, altering its constitution, so may any future government. I stated clearly that if the bank was not managed in the interests of the people who were responsible 'or its establishment the Labour party, when it  Came  into power, would cake all the necessary steps to ensure that the interests of the people should take precedence over all other interests. It is time that the British interests which have dominated the institution for the last few years should give place to Australian interests. But I shall never permit any honorable senator, either intentionally or unintentionally, to misinterpret my remarks. </para>

                        <para>- I make it quite clear, that it is not the intention of the Labour party to use political influence on the Commonwealth Bank so long as the management does its work properly. It is pure hypocrisy, however, to talk about shutting political influence out from the bank altogether, for the institution is the creation of Parliament. It has served a good purpose for the last twelve years, and if it is managed in such a way that  it  will be unhampered and uninterfered with by speculators and private banking institutions, it will render much better service in the next twelve years. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister knows all about it. Apparently he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> are in full agreement as to it. They apparently are also familiar with the work which the proposed London board will be called upon to do. Possibly they had had a chat about it, because the amendment had no sooner been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> than it was accepted by the Minister. The Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> may know its significance, but other senators do not. There is too much ambiguity about- the proposal. First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> proposed the appointment of a London board, and now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> suggests that the appointments to it be made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the board of directors in Melbourne. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has not told us what are to be the duties of the London board, how often it will meet, or what remuneration is to be paid to the members  of  it. </para>

On introducing the bill the Government declared that it had received most careful scrutiny, and that the advice of all whose advice was worth obtaining had been sought. In such circumstances one would naturally think that little or no improvement could be made to it, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> declared, on the second reading, that he would like to "shatter it to bits"- and to remould it in the way he desired. It is quite evident that the Government are prepared to accept important amendments submitted by him which  really will have the effect of re-moulding the bill.

                        <para>- Yes, when an amendment is submitted from the government side. The only reason the Government can advance for the acceptance of such amendments is that they realize that if they did not do so there might be a breakaway on the part of some of their supporters. In fairness to the committee, the further consideration of this amendment should be postponed. If, on further consideration <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> can tell us how often the London board will meet, and what remuneration will be paid to its members, and" if he can give other information that may be helpful to us, he may for his proposal secure the support of honorable senators like myself. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite impersonal in the matter. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> on his wonderful command over the Minister.  His  is the master mind that guides the Government. I have often said that Government supporters are like dumb-driven cattle, but now it strikes me that the Government: are being driven, not by dumb supporters, but by a commanding supporter. The bill requires each local board to submit to the board of directors at least once a month a report in writing concerning the affairs of the bank in the district in which it operates. How will it be possible to have a monthly statement in writing from a London board ? No provision is made in the bill for' the remuneration  to be paid to a local board or to fix the conditions under which each board will work. That is because the board of directors will be in close touch with each local board, and so will have immediate control over it. The board of directors cannot have that same control over a London board, because it will not be in close touch with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said that it would be dangerous to appoint a London board of advice, and that it would be unwise to take even one step at a time in that direction; but now that it is proposed to have the London board appointed on the recommendation of the board of directors here, he sees no further danger in the proposal, and would even be willing to take two steps at a time. I think that we ought to proceed very carefully in this matter. I fear the danger of political interference, although I trust this bank will never come within the ambit of political control or .influence. Honorable senators on both sides have taken the trouble to circulate their amendments to give the committee ample opportunity to thoroughly understand them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> who has been waiting for two days to reach clause 8, has circulated an important amendment. I also have certain amendments to propose to that clause, and although they may not be as important as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> they have been in circulation for at least 48 hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> amendment, however, which is even more important than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> or mine, has not been circulated. The least the honorable senator can do is to ask the permission of the committee to withdraw it temporarily until it has been circulated, so that honorable senators may have an opportunity to understand what it means. </para>

                    <para>. - My recollection of the amendment as submitted and proposed to be amended is that a London board is to be appointed on the recommendation of the board of directors. When an important amendment is not printed and circulated it requires a high mental capacity to carry in one's mind not only the amendment itself, but also any words pro-' posed to be added to it. I should like to know who will take the appointment on the recommendation of the board of directors, and to whom the board's recommendation will be submitted. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am opposed to the creation of a board to conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth Bank in London, where at present there are already a manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> A. B. Campion, an assistant manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 0.</inline> A. Smith, and an acting manager at the Australia House branch. I was under the impression for a limited time that the Commonwealth Bank was to conduct the banking business of the people of the Commonwealth. At least that was the intention of those who advocated its establishment, and I dare say the idea of establishing a branch in London did not enter their minds. The intention was to have a branch of the bank established in every important centre of the Commonwealth, but although the bank has been in operation for twelve years this has not yet been done. "Until the management of the bank can be induced or forced to extend the operations of the institution to all the principal "towns of the Commonwealth, we should not entertain the idea of setting up a directorate in London, where the work is now being done, so far as I know, in an effective manner by the officers I have 'already mentioned. Apparently there is a desire, in connexion with almost everything the Commonwealth Government undertakes, to create and maintain expensive boards of management to assist in eating up the profits earned by the various activities in which the Commonwealth is engaged. That is largely why an expensive board has been set up in connexion with the activities at Canberra. Although the Commonwealth Bank has not expanded its operations to the extent that it should have done, I do not anticipate that we shall have any more rapid development from the Australian or London boards than we have had in the past, unless an indication is conveyed by us to those bodies that it is their imperative duty to extend the business of the bank. At present there is one branch in Great Britain, but, apparently, it is the intention to create others. Until the bank has extended its operations to such centres as Goulburn, Bathurst, and hundreds of  other towns of equal size and importance in Australia, we ought not to entertain the idea of creating a London board. I look forward to the time when a very much more up-to-date method of borrowing money and dealing with financial matters generally will be adopted, and I hope that before long a proposal similar to that which I advocated last night will be accepted. At present the Commonwealth Bank has only 16 branches in New South Wales, 9 in Victoria, 31 in Queensland, 5 in South Australia, 3 in Western Australia, 4 in Tasmania, and 1 in Rabaul. The number is altogether inadequate, and until such time as the bank can extend its business in the Commonwealth, I am opposed to the creation of a London board. </para>

                <para class="block">I have already given reasons for my belief that the appointment of local boards in each state will be detrimental to the objects aimed at by the bill, and will re act against the  best  interests of the Commonwealth and the well-being of the bank. Further consideration has convinced me that the principle of the establishment of local boards in every state, and perhaps in more than one centre in a state, is a most pernicious one which will yield results totally at variance with those anticipated by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- At one time I was in accord with the idea to wipe out this provision relating to the appointment of local boards; but on reflection I realized that, with the head office of the bank situated in a particular city, there was a possibility that other states would not have much chance to make their influence felt in the affairs of the bank. The state of Queensland is very greatly interested in the financial arrangements undertaken by the Commonwealth Bank on behalf of some of its industries. The bank plays a very important part in financing the great sugar industry, and the wool industry, in Queensland. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am sorry to find myself differing from my colleague from Queensland, but I am totally opposed to the appointment of local boards of advice, because I do not think that their creation will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth Bank. I think that the committee would be well advised to leave out the whole of the proposed new section 12b. Australia has an extensive system of telegraphic and telephonic communication, and I cannot see any necessity for having boards of advice in the different states. It will merely afford an opportunity for a few well intentioned individuals to become inquisitorial in connexion with the affairs of the bank. They will not prove useful to the governor or to the board of directors. I hope that the committee will support the amendment. </para>

                    LYNCH  ("Western Australia) [9.401.  -  I support the remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline>
                    believing that this proposal is very much in tie nature of an innovation. If the purpose is to secure local atmosphere, why can it not be obtained from the managers and their assistants in the different states? Officers holding such responsible positions would be likely to give much more reliable advice than could such boards as it is proposed to appoint. I believe that those boards will prove useless, inefficient, and. provocative of friction, which should not. exist in any branch of the Commonwealth. Bank.

                        <para>- I do not admit that an exact parallel can be drawn between a private institution and the Commonwealth Bank. To do so one would need to charge the local executive officers with inefficiency. The responsible officials will regard the members of such boards as busy-bodies. The bill itself shows very clearly the quality of the advice that is likely to be tendered by these boards. The proposal is to pay the members £200- per annum. They will be expected to furnish a report every. month, and will be empowered to overhaul at will the affairs of the bank. That will interfere with the orderly progress of the bank's affairs, in addition to causing confusion and annoyance to the officials. A responsible officer drawing, perhaps, £1,000 a year will not tolerate the interference of these men. I think we can very well continue along the lines hitherto followed. If it could be shown that the present practice did not work efficiently, there might be some excuse for superseding it with such a proposal as this. It has not been shown that the management of the bank in any city is inefficient. On the contrary, I think it will be admitted by all that the management throughout has been admirable. </para>

                    <para>. - I fear that some honorable senators may be labouring under a misapprehension in regard to this matter. It is, of course, expected that the board of directors will sit in Sydney. Honorable senators will notice that it is provided that one member of these local boards of advice shall, where practicable, be a director of the bank. This will be a central bank having intimate relations with other banks. Looking at the position not merely from the point of view of the Commonwealth Bank, but also" from the view-point of the other banks in Melbourne, would not it be an advantage to have on the Melbourne board of advice a member of the board of directors through whom the local board could make its representations? During the last twelve months the banks have had to make representations to the Notes Board, and I know it is a great advantage to be able to make those representations in the city in which they are operating. </para>

Working in co-operation with the Commonwealth Bank as the central, bank, a local board of advice would be able to put its difficulties before the board of directors. Having on the local board of advice a member of the central board, it would be able to discuss its difficulties with the directors of private banks in Brisbane or Perth, as the case might be. If this is not done, the banks in distant states will only be able to place their views before the board by means of correspondence. </para>

In view of all the facts, I urge die committee not lightly to dispense with these boards of advice, and I particularly impress on members representing distant states the importance of this provision. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause provides for the appointment of a local board in the principal cities of the states. Does this mean only each capital city? If not, other principal cities in the Commonwealth will probably demand the appointment of local boards. Queensland comprises three distinct divisions. The people of North and Central Queensland would certainly object to a local board at Brisbane as being representative of that state. Those divisions would make a demand for the appointment of local boards to represent their interests. No doubt there would be the same trouble in the other states. </para>

It is not clear to me how local boards will be of any assistance. So far as I am aware there has been no complaint anywhere as to the management- of the branches of the Commonwealth Bank. The people have confidence in them. If there had been any evidence of failure  to meet the requirements of the people, there might be some reason for the appointment of local boards in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    DUNCAN  (New South Wales)  [9.52J. -  I should like to say a few words in reply to the objection raised by the Minister
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                    in regard to my amendment. He said that if the principle of local boards were deleted from the bill, people in the distant states would only be able to place their representations before the board of directors in writing. I venture to say there will be very few cases arising in any state in which it will be necessary for representations to be made to the central board. In ordinary banking practice the board simply declares a policy. Very rarely does it interfere directly with the details of management. These are left to the general manager of the bank. Under the system I suggest, the general manager or  deputy  governor of the bank in each of the states will have the power to deal with all local problems. He will hear representations, and, if necessary, will present a full statement of the case, together with his recommendations to the board of directors for final decision. Is it to be inferred from the opposition to my amendment that the Ministry is afraid that the gentlemen in each of the states who will be responsible to the board of directors for the proper control and management of the bank, are not to be trusted? If that is not the inference to be drawn, then there is absolutely no necessity for the creation of a local board in any state or area. The duties enumerated as being the duties of the local boards are really the kind of duties that would be performed by an assistant general manager in any state. He will make a report once a month. Why should it be necessary to have in each state a board, one member of which shall be a member of the board of directors? We may get three local business men interested in all kinds of business in the state, and each with his own axe to grind,, and prepared to cut off the head' of some other business man. '

                        <para>-  I do not go that far. The state of which I am one of the representatives has been- overlooked very frequently, and I fear that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> amendment is agreed to, Tasmania and Western Australia will get very little representation on the board of directors. We have had experience of this in Tasmania, and I intend to see that the states get representation. A few years ago two banks that were doing business in Tasmania  were taken over by other banks, with the result that the head office became located in Melbourne. Since then it has been more difficult for any one to do business with those banks. Every important transaction !has to be referred to Melbourne. We can imagine, from the experience of Tasmania, what will be the position of the distant states if they have not representation by means of local boards. Everything will have to be referred to Sydney. I do not stand for that. A local board of advice will be able to convey to the board of directors a better interpretation, at all events, of the general conditions surrounding any particular local problem. Very few financial transactions involving substantial sums will be decided with' out reference to the head office. Who could be in a better position thar the members of a local board to submit such problems to the board of directors? Seeing that we have removed from the bill the clause which provided for the representation of the geographical divisions of the - Commonwealth  i  we ought now to provide that the various states shall be given every possible opportunity to place their- needs before the board. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays spoke on behalf of the smallest state in the Commonwealth; I speak on behalf of the largest state, namely Western Australia. I cannot recall a single handicap that Western Australia has suffered in consequence of the present method of managing the Commonwealth Bank. I had some dealings with the Perth branch of the bank while I was a responsible officer in the Trades Hall in Perth for two years, and I found that any business that I submitted to it that needed consideration by the head office was promptly put before it. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not satisfied that the remuneration provided, in sub-section 2 of the proposed new section 13, for members of local boards would be adequate for members of the London board. Nor am I in a position to suggest what would be a fair remuneration to pay to them. A good deal would depend on what is customary in the circumstances. I suggest, therefore, that their remuneration should be such as may be determined by the board of directors. </para>

                    <para>.- Is it the intention of the Minister to accept this amendment ? After due consideration, the Government has introduced a bill that rightly enables Parliament to decide the remuneration which is to be paid to certain directors of the Commonwealth Bank. Now, however, that certain appointments are to be made,  over  which Parliament will have little or no control, a further suggestion has been made that the board of directors may fix whatever salaries they like for the London board. They may have an extraordinary idea of what salaries should be paid in London. I have heard it stated on good authority that the salary of £3,000 a year paid to the High Commissioner in London places him absolutely on the bread line. It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a leap in the dark to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> amendment without' some idea of the remuneration that should be paid to the London board. Therefore, I propose to move an amendment that the salary of each member of the London board shall not exceed £1,500 a year. That will give a reasonably large margin for the board to work on. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> accept my suggestion as readily as .he accepts one from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> ? </para>

It is also provided that each member of the board of directors shall be paid £600 a year, and the  chairman  of directors £1,000 a year.

The Government must have some idea of what work will be performed in London, and of the number of times the members of the board will b© obliged to attend meetings of the board.

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but at the same time it is not- proposed to insert another amount in its place. In order to give the London board of advice the! same salary as is proposed to be given to the directors in Australia, I propose to insert £600 in place of £200. But why the payment to the board of directors is fixed so low I do not know. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot imagine the Government deliberately creating a board of directors, and proposing to pay each director £600 a year, unless the board will have something to do. If we are to extend the operations of the bank to London, where the cost of living is as high as it is in Melbourne or Sydney, I fail to see how we can do other than provide in the bill that the London board shall be paid at least what is proposed to be paid to gentlemen holding a similar position in the Commonwealth. If the committee decides not to insert in the sub-section the words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> proposes in place of those to be omitted, I shall move an amendment to fix the payment to each member of the London board of advice at the rate which is payable to the directors in the Commonwealth, namely £600 per annum. It will be the most satisfactory arrangement. </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment is not submitted with any derogatory intention concerning  those  who have reached the age of 65 years. The Commonwealth Bank, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has frequently pointed out, is branching out into new spheres of activity, and the directors are to be appointed for varying periods. If we appoint a person over the age of 65 years for a term of five, six, or seven years, his advanced age will prevent him from undertaking the work in the manner in which it could be handled by a younger man. We are hopeful that the directors to be appointed will be associated with the management of the bank for many years, and will be able to direct' their attention to formulating and developing a policy for the carrying on of the bank's operations for a long period. If that is so, comparatively young men should be appointed to the board. Notice of this amendment was given in another place, but owing to a time limit being imposed, the honorable member who intended to submit it was prevented from doing so. </para>

He will have . a considerable influence as a member of' the board, but, as the Government viewed the honorable senator's amendment with some concern, I did not support it. The governor will have a voice on the board, but if he were  chairman  also he would have au overriding power. The amendment proposed" by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is necessary in the interests of the employees. The governor will decide matters of discipline, and if the employees are dissatisfied they will appeal to the board. If the governor is  chairman  of the board, the appeal will be from Caesar to Caesar.  Such a procedure would be unjust. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government might well accept this amendment, because in the interests of the bank it is undesirable that the governor should also be  chairman  of directors. He will be the chief executive officer, and the duties of the directorate will include the oversight of the work of the governor. Serious conflict of opinion may arise between the governor and the board, and it may be necessary to give the governor certain definite instructions. Those instructions should be conveyed in writing to the' governor by the  chairman,-  and it is not desirable that the  chairman  should sign directions from the board to himself as governor to adopt  a certain course, of which he does not approve. Of course, such a situation may not arise once in ten years; but there may be circumstances in which definite instructions from the board to the governor will be necessary in the interests of the bank. Moreover, it is desirable that the employees should have a right to appeal within the jurisdiction of the bank itself, and if the governor is  chairman  of the board, the appeal will be from himself to himself, or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has said, from Caesar  to Caesar. That would not be in the interests of the employees. In practice, the directors will probably realize the anomalous position  in  which the governor would be placed at times if he were chairman, and they will elect some other director to be chairman. Still, it would be safer to lay down a definite direction to that effect. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause, as drafted, is preferable to the amendment. The directors will be appointed to control the business of the bank. They will have to consider matters of the gravest importance to, not only the bank, but also the Commonwealth. The Government has', therefore, proposed a middle course in regard to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">chairman. Senator Duncan</inline> proposes that the governor shall not be eligible for election as  .chairman,  even if the directors desire him to occupy that position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has said that he would provide that the Governor of the bank should be  chairman  of directors of the board. I think that the present provision is a wise one, particularly as the occupant of the office may be changed periodically. In 99 cases out of 100, it would be more convenient for the Governor of the bank to be  chairman  of the board. He should be more conversant with the affairs of the bank than the other members of the board, and, being in the best position to realize the necessity for taking urgent action, he could promptly call the board together. The men appointed to these positions will have had their qualifications thoroughly investigated. If we can entrust to them the management of the affairs of the bank, surely we can entrust to them the task of electing the best man on the board as  chairman.  They will be in a much better position than we are to decide who is the best man. Honorable senators may have observed that, throughout the consideration of this bill, I have been reluctant, except in regard to any proposal touching a matter of principle, to depart from what has been carefully prepared by those who drafted the bill. They considered all the pros and cons before finally deciding upon the nature of the provisions that should be included in the measure. To my mind, it is always better to accept what is thus placed before us than to adopt the ideas of individual honorable senators who may propose amendments without having considered the manner in which they will affect the remainder of the provisions in the bill! Consider what resulted from the acceptance of an amendment earlier. Amendment after amendment was subsequently found to be necessary. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> quite innocently told us that he had two sets of amendments, one in case he won, and another in case he did not. </para>

                        <para>- It will involve something much more serious. It provides that the man who is most conversant with the affairs of the bank is to be debarred from appointment as  chairman  of directors of the board, no matter what his fitness for the position may be. I do not take up that attitude. I think' the Minister will be well advised, in view of his experience this evening, not to take a definite stand on any matter. I do not think that I could pledge my supporters, but I am prepared to promise the Minister my support in preserving intact any principle in the bill that is assailed by an insurgent honorable senator opposite, if he will exercise a little of that restraining influence which Ministers in charge of bills should exercise. If we could agree to a workable arrangement of that character, we would quickly obviate these unseemly exhibitions of insubordination in the face of the enemy. I offer that olive branch to the Minister to show how anxious I am to assist him to have the measure passed. I was hoping that he would report progress. As he has not seen fit to do so, I shall certainly participate in the debates for the remainder of the evening, no matter how frequently I may be called upon to give utterance to my views on these important matters. The Minister has invited us to express our opinions. My opinion is that it would be a very serious thing for the committee at this stage, and in its present condition, without knowing the character or the capacity of the man who will be the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, to say definitely that he shall not be appointed  chairman  of directors of the board, even though the board itself is unanimously in favour of his appointment to that position. I admit that there may be occasions when an appeal will lie from the Governor of the bank to the  chairman  of directors of the board, but I contend that the man who is fitted to occupy the position of Governor of the bank would constitute a safe court of appeal. I think that most men can divorce themselves from the littleness of things. If an appeal were made from this gentleman in his capacity as Governor of the bank to himself as  chairman  of directors of the board, I do not think that any gross wrong would result. We frequently see appeals made from single judges to full courts, but no one contends that the judge whose decision is appealed against should be prevented from sitting on the full court. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government has created for itself an unfortunate position by transgressing the rules that usually operate in cases of this kind, and giving the general manager a vote on the board. I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> amendment will not improve matters. In effect, the Government has made the Governor of the bank a managing director. As I said on a previous occasion, it does not require much vision to foresee a clash between a virile  chairman  of directors and an equally virile governor. Having decided that the governor of the bank shall have a vote, and be a member of the board, to provide for the contingency which I feel sure will occur, it would be far better to leave matters as they are. If the governor became the managing director, and was made  chairman  of directors, it would prevent that clashing which I foresee is bound to happen. It is usual for a managing director to be  chairman  of a board. Otherwise there is bound to be clashing between men of outstanding ability. I could point to instances of leading concerns in Melbourne in support of my contention. I disapprove of the governor of the bank having a vote on the board, but, in the circumstances, I prefer that matters should remain as they are rather than support <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Duncan's</inline> amendment. </para>

In order to buttress his argument, the honorable senator pleads the case of the employees; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> who followed, had something to say about appealing from Caesar to Caesar. This amendment has nothing whatever to do with the appeal board. I am surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> unexpected solicitude concerning the board of appeal.  His  amendment, if carried, will not prevent this appeal from Caesar to Caesar. It deals with the board of directors, not with the appeal board.  His  subsequent amendment in clause 8 will deal with the appeal board. </para>

In this august chamber our Standing Orders provide that the  President  shall have a deliberative vote, but that, in the event of the voting being equal, the question shall pass in the negative. That is a very democratic principle, and is one which I desire to have incorporated in this proposed new sub-section. I have had experience in this matter. A wise New South Wales Labour Government some years ago appointed me to a board of directors. I thought that I was going to do important work on that body, but I found that I was able to do practically nothing, for the simple reason that in a quorum of four the  chairman  had a casting as well as a deliberative vote, and the result was that two men at a meeting were always able to out- vote the other two. </para>

There is very good reason for this provision. In this chamber there is an equality of representation for the states. That principle would be vitiated if the presiding officer had two votes. We may assume that the boards will appoint as their  chairman  a man who is an outstanding figure in the banking world.  His  views should therefore carry additional weight. For this reason it is thought wise that he should have a casting vote as well as a deliberative vote. </para>

This chamber consists of 36 members, and therefore, a casting vote exercised by the  President  would not be nearly so important as a casting vote exercised by the  chairman  at a meeting of four persons. At all meeting's there will be men whose thoughts on general questions run alike. Therefore, if we allow the  chairman  of a board of directors to have a casting as well as a deliberative vote, at meetings where only four are present, two will be able to carry the day for the simple reason that their thoughts run along parallel lines, and one of them will be the  chairman.  I value this provision of equal representation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> amendment commends itself to me on the grounds of fair play and justice, and I think it should be accepted by the Minister. </para>

We are not obliged to nor should we slavishly follow the procedure of other financial institutions. I am sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> was a member of a board of which four formed a quorum, and was present at a meeting with three of his fellow directors, he would not be pleased if, in a case of the board being equally divided on an important matter, the chair man, by exercising both a deliberative and a casting vote, forced his will upon the board. It would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth Bank to provide that where only four members of the board were present at the meeting, and the voting on a certain matter was equal the question should be resolved in the negative. That would leave it open for further consideration when a larger number of directors was present. I support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I shall be quite frank with  the  committee, and admit that not only  are all questions which concern the currency of the highest importance, but that, in my opinion, they should not be left to the decision of a chance meeting of the board when just a bare quorum was present, but should be decided by a full meeting or at least an absolute majority of the board members. The Government might very well concede that point. In doing so they would not be going very much further than they propose to do, now that the directors with a knowledge of currency have been cut out. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that they are matters of the highest importance. "I have not the time nor the inclination to indulge in a long dissertation on the question of currency, and I do not know that the Senate would be much wiser if I were so inclined. I think in the end there would be, on this matter, an equal balance of opinion in this chamber, just as there is outside. In fact, there is no greater diversity of opinion on any matter than there is on exchange questions. Everything hinges on the fact that to-day we are living under abnormal conditions. There is practically no gold basis for our currency. Living under extraordinary conditions, we must use . extraordinary means. It may be many a long day before we return to a gold currency. I fully anticipate that the directors who are appointed will have a wide divergence of opinion on this question, and I think it would be in the interests of the Commonwealth to provide that if there be an absolute majority of the board in favour of any course of action, one way or the other, in relation to currency matters, it should be sufficient to determine the question. </para>

It was my intention to move that all the words after the word " unless " be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words " an absolute majority of the full board vote in favour of it." If a bare quorum of the board is in attendance, the proposition will be carried if the whole five are in favour of it. If there are six directors present, the proposition will be carried if five vote for it and one against it. </para>

                    <para>. - A proposal has been submitted to adopt the best safeguard that can be conceived for the proper carrying out of that highest of duties, the regulating of the currency of the Commonwealth. The original proposal was to call in the aid of experts to handle the question, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> thought it was wise to cast that proposal aside. Now, in the words of Kipling, he is returning with " an humble and a contrite heart," and to make up, in some measure, for the demolition in which he was engaged in connexion with this provision, he suggests the requirement of an absolute majority of the board of directors in place of the two experts to control currency. That is to say, he proposes to replace experts by ordinary banking men. I am afraid we are proceeding in a vicious circle. We commence to do certain things, we advance to a certain point, and then we begin to feel sorry for having made such an advance. </para>

                        <para>- I might reply to that question by quoting the words of a British Prime Minister, who once asked, "What is a pound note?" There are in Australia men who know more about currency than do ordinary banking men. I  admit there are very few of them, but, at the same time, there are also very few of those who control the banks of Australia who understand the underlying principles of banking. They certainly know all about the ordinary routine of banking business, but there are not very many men who are really conversant with the principles which underlie modern banking. I_ am sorry that the Government did not get sufficient support for their proposal. Owing to its defeat, a very peculiar position has arisen. I do not know that it is due to a feeling on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> that he was rather too successful in smashing the provision in the bill, that he is now engaged in an effort to secure the same result as, but for his success, would have been achieved. At any rate, we are faced with the serious problem of what is to be done to safeguard the currency of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene's</inline> only suggestion is to adopt an absolute majority of the board of directors. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it has; but I hope there may be a chance of resurrecting it. We had a workable proposal to control the currency, but the committee saw fit, in various ways, to tinker with it. Now we have to acknowledge that it is a difficult question; and, after cutting out the experts,, the proposal is to call to our aid eight ordinary banking men, who need not be experts in currency, and leave them to settle these most important matters by a majority of five votes to throe. We are going too far. If there is any means of getting back to the original proposal to call experts to our aid, my advice is to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner'</inline> has wisely said that we are going too fast with this bill. On <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Greene's</inline> admission, this is a serious matter.  His  proposal to leave the' determination of these important questions to five ordinary banking men is a confession that it is a most serious problem. We are now running in a circle. Every one now admits that currency questions are most important, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> will not have experts to decide them. </para>

                        <para>- To put the bill into right shape, and make it a workable measure which will be a credit to this Parliament, let us, in the words of Charles Dickens, "Bite our nails" over it; let us try to re-insert the proposal of the Government to have two experts on currency matters on the board of directors. I would rather vote against the present proposal than rely on the haphazard expedient of .depending on the decision of five ordinary banking men, who may have no special qualifications in regard to currency, as to whether the currency in Australia should be inflated or deflated. We have been brought to this position by a haphazard judgment of this chamber. I shall require more information on the subject before supporting the amendment. I have, however, fulfilled my duty by calling attention to the position which has arisen. </para>

                    <para>- I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> that the difference between his amendment and the Government's proposal is not sufficient to warrant a conflict of opinion. The Government feels that currency is such a vitally important matter, that unanimity, or something closely approaching it, is desirable. I wish to quote from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> of the 29th July, an opinion regarding the amendment of which the Government gave notice, to allow the issue of notes against securities held in London. The concluding portion of the article in question reads: - </para>

                        J. Cohen, speaking on Friday at the annual meeting of the shareholders of the Commercial Banking Company, of Sydney, said that he viewed with apprehension the proposal that notes should be issued against securities in London, or that Bank of England notes should be made legal tender here. The adoption of either proposal, he said, would mean decided inflation, and would eventually lead to serious trouble.

                <para class="block">I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen</inline> is regarded as a very high banking authority. Whatever views we may hold, we must all admit that the matter of currency has to be handled with the very greatest caution and care. This country would not be alone in holding that view. The Bank of France is governed by twelve regents, or governors, and three censors. The censors are appointed by the general assembly of the bank, composed of 200 of the largest shareholders. Three of the regents must be government officials. The special mission of the censors is to supervise the whole of the bank's transactions. They are entitled to examine all the records of the bank, but they have not the right to vote on any proposal. No action in relation to the issue of bank-notes can be taken unless unanimous approval is given to the proposal. In dealing with ordinary banking matters, the Bank of France allows a certain amount of freedom; but it deals with currency in quite a different way, saying that no action can be taken without the unanimous approval of the censors. The proposal in the bill does not go quite so far as that. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> could very well agree to the provision in the bill, especially as at board meetings there may frequently be one or two absentees. We are in this respect treading on ground that is dangerous, largely unexplored and untried, and we de sire that unanimity shall prevail before any decision is arrived at. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> and the committee to stand by the proposal of the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather glad that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has referred to the report of the speech made by the  chairman  of directors of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, in relation to currency matters. I am sorry that he did not see fit to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the whole of that report, because he will, no doubt, have noticed that in it there is a very strong confirmation of a statement that I made at a previous stage of the bill, that the banks were not consulted by the Government in regard to this particular measure. That was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen</inline> in the most deliberate terms. I agree that the issue of currency will be the most important function that the bank will be called upon to perform '. I agree, ' too, that in nine cases out of ten, all the directors will not be present at board meetings, particularly if they are drawn from centres that are far removed from the place of meeting. Frequently the Secretary to the Treasury will not find it convenient to be present. He will not, for instance, be able to attend every meeting of the board that is held in Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- It will be impossible for him always to . be present. Equally, it will be impossible for others always to be present. The Government has provided that in such a case five shall be the determining number. If the Government insists that six members of a full board must vote in favour of any proposal relating to currency, I shall not press the matter any further. I simply .state my opinion that an absolute majority of the full board would be sufficient 'to decide any matter. I again ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to tell me by what means he proposes to determine who is an expert on currency. I venture to say that he would determine it in the manner in which I should determine it. He confesses to having browsed deeply in the banking authorities that are to be found in the parliamentary library. I am astonished at the unflagging zeal and industry which he has displayed in the study of this very vexed question.  I  also have done something along the same lines. I should regard as an expert any man who agreed with my views on. currency. Equally, I should conclude that the man who did not agree with the opinions that I had formed was, if not an unmitigated fool, at all events a man who by no stretch of the imagination could be considered to be a real expert in currency. Broadly, it is by that standard that we decide who is an expert and who is not. Bankers are handling these matters from day to day. I could quote the opinions of bankers in Sydney who, in the banking world, are just as eminent as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen,</inline> and who hold views entirely contrary <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> those expressed by him. I hope that the Government will secure for this board men who are proficient in the particular duties that members of the board will be called upon to perform, and that their judgment will be sound, thus making for the prosperity of, not only the Commonwealth Bank, but also Australia generally. I do not press the amendment. </para>

My chief reason for rising is to say that I desire to live up to the best traditions of banking. If my memory serves me rightly, the 1st August - which is to-day - is. a bank holiday. .1 ask the Minister to state how far he- desires to proceed1, in order that we may expedite the business to that point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene-</inline> regretted that the whole of the speech of a great banking authority in Sydney was not placed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I do not want to take the trouble of putting it there, but if the Minister is' determined! to give us an exhibition of brute force",, and to use his&gt; majority against us when we are&gt; physically weak, I shall endeavour to- put- in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as much useful'' information as it is possible- to compile between now and Saturday night.. I should', however, prefer to meet the&gt; Minister- half way. If it is- his', intention to use brute force, I do not mind' shouldering, my share.. I. realize that I am not physically as fit as- I. was' some years ago;- but we on this' side- will be able to obtain, some steep, whilethe' Minister will be under tine necessity of remaining constantly in the chamber. I am not using a threat. In the most friendly spirit, I ask the Minister to state how far he desires to go. Let us endeavour to reach that stage as quickly as possible, and live up to the best traditions of banking by keeping 1st August as a holiday. </para>

If the committee feels that this can be done, I am quite willing that the Senate should rise almost at once, but I remind honorable senators that there are still a number of amendments that will probably require a fair amount of discussion. Before we adjourn this morning we should, if possible, dispose of some of them. I am prepared to accept the assurance given by the Leader of the Opposition that he will place no obstacle in the. way of the bill passing through committee before the Senate adjourns this afternoon, but I should like to point out that if it is. not through committee to-day, we shall, have a delay of another day next week before we can take the- third reading. </para>

                <para class="block">The principle for which I am contending is already incorporated in the Public Service Act. When that act was recently amended this provision was inserted at the request of the Government. In that case it was contemplated that there might arise occasions, not frequently perhaps,* when a state officer would be taken over, and it was desired that any officer so transferred should take with him his existing' and accruing rights. The position of the bank is similar to the Public Service. At some future time it might be deemed desirable to take over officers of an existing state bank, or that the procedure already adopted in regard to two of the states should be extended and other state savings bank departments amalgamated with the Commonwealth savings bank department. If this amendment is made in the act, any officers taken over from a state savings bank will retain their existing and accruing rights. The amendment will safeguard their interests. It is possible, of course, that the necessity for this provision may never arise. In the meantime, it will not cost anything. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment; and I must ask the committee to vote against it. We should be very careful not to do anything that might militate against the interests of state officers. The position is not quite the same as when we amended the Public Service Act. We were dealing then with transferred departments, and we had made provision in the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Constitution for state Officers joining the Commonwealth Service to bring with them their existing and accruing rights. The Commonwealth Bank does not present an analogous case. The only analogy is in respect of state savings banks. In the general banking business, I do not know of any case, except, perhaps, that of South Australia, where the principle would be applicable. I remind the committee that if a state bank officer were loaded with superannuation, pension, or leave rights, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank would be very cautious about taking him into the service of the bank, because the bank would have to carry that liability; and as the Governor could obtain from private banking institutions experienced officers who were not so loaded, the probability is that he would look to them, and not to the state banks, for any men that might be needed. The agreement in regard to the Queensland state savings bank provided for the Queensland officers to come over to the service of the Commonwealth Bank with all their existing and accruing rights, and the probability is that if a similar arrangement were made with other state savings banks, the same privileges would be extended to the state officers concerned. In the circumstances, it would appear that the amendment would really be a bar to the employment of state bank officers in the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> amendment is that when the Commonwealth Bank takes over state bank officers, the latter shall bring with them their existing and accruing rights. I do not doubt the accuracy of the Minister's statement. Probably, in some cases, the provision sought to be incorporated in the act would operate against the appointment of such officers by the Commonwealth Bank That would be a matter for the Governor of the bank to decide. If he wanted an officer from a state banking department he would have to consider, if this amendment were agreed to, whether it would  be  profitable for the bank to employ that officer. In the past, there has been no desire on the part of the Commonwealth Bank to engage men from other banks. It prefers to train its own staff, but if the bank extends its operations, as  we  intend it shall, it may then be necessary to draw its officers from a wider area. Those who are directly concerned, however, favour the amendment.  I  presume that the men know their own business best. This being so, and notwithstanding the Minister's statement,  I  intend to support the amendment. </para>

The rights of the Queensland savings bank employees were preserved by the terms  of  the agreement that was entered' into, and I cannot see why the rights of an individual who transfers should not also be preserved. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister in charge of the bill gave such logical reasons for not adopting the amendment that I felt inclined to support him, but having listened to one or two unofficial Ministers, I feel that I cannot do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> spoke to the amendment from the high ground that the bank should employ the cheapest labour offering. I have never yet been convinced that the cheapest labour is the best labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> says, in effect, that the cheapest labour that is offering should be engaged in preference to what I might call the union labour which would come to the bank with accruing rights. My view, naturally, is that we should employ the union labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> argued that, if the state savings bank employees voluntarily enter the Commonwealth savings bank service, they should not be entitled to their accruing rights, but I point out that those rights are the result of long service with the state institutions, and that long service must, of necessity, make the men highly qualified to do the savings bank work. Their experience would be very valuable to the Commonwealth savings bank, and, therefore, they should be entitled to retain their rights. Though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> gave good reasons for opposing the amendment, I feel that I must vote for it because of the bad reasons given by unofficial Ministers. </para>

                    <para>. - There is something to be said for the contention of the Minister that, in odd cases where savings bank ' officers, by choice, enter the Commonwealth savings bank service, they should be prepared to sacrifice any rights they may have as state officers. But if, say, the Commonwealth Bank entered into an agreement to take over the savings bank business of Victoria, it would be practically compulsory for it to take over the Victorian officers. In that case it seems only fair that those officers who, in a measure, would be compulsorily taken over should have preserved to them all their state rights. It is likely that the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank would be willing to take over a state savings bank business, but would not accept the obligations of the state savings bank in respect to its employees. </para>

                        <para>- When the Queens-, land Government handed over to the Commonwealth Bank the state savings bank, it was liable to the officers of the bank who had contributed to a superannuation scheme. It could not break its contract with them, consequently it preserved their rights in the agreement which brought about the transfer. A precedent was thus established which will protect other states in future transfers, and the amendment, so far as it affects mass transfers of state officers to the service of the Commonwealth Bank, is rendered quite unnecessary. It would be a hardship to impose on the bank the restriction contained in the amendment in its application to individual officers. </para>

                        <para>- That might upset the whole of the bank's scheme of salaries. It would not be wise to have  one  officer paid more than other officers doing similar work. There seems to be nothing unreasonable in asking for a general provision which will enable the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to offer to individual officers of State services similar privileges to those already secured for other officers by agreement with the states. </para>

                <para class="block">My amendment proposes to set up an appeal board for the staff of the Commonwealth Bank. It has been drafted on legal advice and modelled almost entirely, with adaptations, upon the appeal board provisions in the Public Service Act. After years of consideration, and years of experience in dealing with Commonwealth public servants this Parliament found it absolutely necessary in order to maintain good order and discipline in the Public Service, and to give equitable and just treatment to the public servants, to set up an appeal board. There are, I believe, approximately 2,000 officers in the employ of the Commonwealth Bank. The service is a growing one, and, although other amendments have been suggested by the bank officials, it is generally admitted by the staff that this is the most important of all, as it provides a means by which any member of the staff suffering an injustice may appeal. It is felt by the members of the staff that they should have the right to appeal to some independent tribunal, similar to that provided for Commonwealth public servants working under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. It is true that the officers of the bank can, if they so desire, approach the Arbitration Court concerning their conditions, but the amendment which I am submitting, and which is modelled on provisions contained  in the Public Service Act, provides more than could be obtained through the intervention of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court or any other similar tribunal in the settlement of their working conditions. </para>

                        <para>- If I had moved it, it would be necessary for me to withdraw it if I did not intend to proceed with it. But I have not and do not intend to move it. My amendment provides for the constitution of an appeal board on similar lines to the appeal board set up under the Public Service Act, and passed by the Senate not very long ago. If it is fair to grant an appeal board to the members of the Public Service generally, the staff of the Commonwealth Bank, which is regarded as being in effect a branch of the service, should also have an appeal board, particularly when the work performed is similar in many respects, and of equal importance to that undertaken in government departments. Is it fair that the officers of the Treasury Department, for instance, should have a board to which they can appeal when troubles arise, and that officers of the Commonwealth Bank should not have a similar tribunal before which their grievances can be ventilated? This matter was mooted in another place when the bill was under consideration, and if honorable senators will take the trouble to peruse <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they will see that the Treasurer's only objection to the proposal was its nebulous character. On those grounds the Government were unable to accept it. The Treasurer further stated that if it were submitted in a better form the Government would not oppose it. </para>

                        <para>- No, but the principle is exactly the same. Slight amendments, of course, are necessary, but if the principle is fair we are justly entitled to ask that the consideration which has been given by Parliament to the Public Service should be conceded to officers of the Commonwealth Bank, who are also employees of the Government. The amendment is drafted in such a form that I am sure that if it were adopted it would work satisfactorily, and be in the interests of the staff of the Commonwealth Bank. It reads that in every contingency which may arise appeals can be made to a board, which shall consist of - </para>

The proposal I am submitting is perfectly fair, irrespective of the angle from which it may be viewed. The claim which the officers have submitted is just, and one which is recognized to the full, so far as other groups of employees in other departments are concerned. Unless the Government wish to be accused of gross partiality to one section of employees which comes under their jurisdiction, they should be prepared to accept the amendment. Perhaps it may be necessary to make minor amendments, in order to enable the proposal to be acceptable to  the Government. The principle, however, is one which should be adopted. </para>

I wish the words in the present section to be left out, as they are grossly inadequate and do not, in any way, meet the position, particularly when compared with the provisions of the Public Service Act. I ask the committee to agree to strike out the words I have indicated, in order that we may provide some scheme which is more adequate and acceptable to the. bank, and conforms more closely to the principles of justice, which we are here to see carried out. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is entirely wrong in assuming that because certain of these provisions are in the Public Service Act they are therefore applicable to, and should be embodied in, the Commonwealth Bank Act. I remind the honorable senator that we have a somewhat similar analogy in the Commonwealth railway service, in respect of which we have no such provision as this, because it is recognized that the Commonwealth railway service is not a portion of the Public Service proper. There are conditions associated with the carrying out of , an undertaking such as a railway service which are not the same as those of an ordinary public department. I shall give some reasons why they are not applicable. I doubt if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has realized the effect of what he is proposing. If this amendment is carried in its present form, . we might as well abolish the board of directors and make the appeal board the supreme body. One of the most important functions of the Governor or the board is that of dealing with the staff. The amendment as drawn up would not give the board of directors or the Governor power to promote, transfer, or punish an officer if that officer should elect to appeal. Let us imagine the effect of appointing a board of directors and expecting them to make a success of the bank when they had not the power to promote, transfer, or punish an officer. What would happen ? Which is going to be the superior body: the board of management or the board of appeal? The appeal board is to be the final court, and, therefore, would be the superior authority. We spent the greater part of yesterday discussing the constitution of the board, and serious injunctions have been laid upon the Government concerning the necessity of searching the Commonwealth to secure the services of the best men. If this amendment is carried, the members of the board will be subservient to the members of the appeal board.. For the information of honorable senators I point out that the amendment provides that the appeal board shall comprise: - </para>

                <para class="block">If an officer is punished or dismissed because he has been convicted for a criminal offence, he will be able, under this amendment, to approach the appeal board, which can order his re-instatement notwithstanding the opinions of the Governor or the board of directors. We had an example of a case of this kind in the Customs Department, where an officer was actually convicted of being in a conspiracy connected with the landing of goods on which duty had not been paid. He was convicted by the court, and the appeal board found him not guilty and ordered his reinstatement. Are we to perpetuate such possibilities in this measure? The list of offences continues: - </para>

(2.) If the Governor or any officer prescribed as having power to deal with minor offences has any reason to believe that an officer has committed a minor offence he may call upon the officer for an explanation as to the alleged offence and if on consideration of the explanation he is of opinion that the offence has been committed he may caution or reprimand the officer. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para>The amendment further provides that where there is reason to believe that an officer has committed an offence other than a minor offence he may be charged by the governor, and if it is considered that he should not continue in the performance of his duty he may be suspended by the governor. If the governor, after consideration, considers that the charge has been sustained, he may fine the officer, reduce his salary, reduce him to a lower position, transfer him, or recommend his dismissal to the board. There is a proviso that if the punishment imposed or recommended by the governor be other than a fine not exceeding £2 the officer may appeal against the decision, and the appeal shall be heard by an appeal board. Sub-section 4 of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> proposed new section 16c provides - (4.) Appeal may be made on the ground of innocence of the charge or excessive severity of the punishment and the appeal board may confirm, annul or vary the decision appealed against by imposing any other punishment specified in the last preceding sub-section and -its decision shall be final except that in any case where the appeal board considers the officer should be dismissed the case shall be referred by the  chairman  of the appeal board to the board which may dismiss the officer from the bank or may impose any such other punishment as is prescribed in the preceding sub-section. </para>
                <para class="block">The appeal board, it is proposed, shall be constituted of a permanent  chairman  who shall be an officer of the Commonwealth Service, having the qualifications of a stipendiary or police magistrate, a representative of the Commonwealth Bank branch of the United Bank Officers Association, and a representative of the Government. I point out that such a board would be superior to the governor, to the board of directors, and to' the Commonwealth or state court that found the man guilty. Sub-section 8 provides - that where an officer has been suspended and the governor, after consideration of the reports relating to the offence and charge, and the reply thereto, is of opinion that the charge has not been sustained, or an appeal board finds that the charge has not been proved, the governor shall forthwith remove the suspension. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> proposed new section 16d empowers the officer charged, and the governor, to be represented at the hearing of an appeal. Under the proposed new section 16e any document in the bank may be called for by the appeal board, and must be produced. </para>

                        <para>- Another provision to which I direct the attention of the committee is that contained in the proposed new section 16G, under which officers may appeal against promotions or transfers. If the appeal board is opposed to a transfer it cannot be made. The Commonwealth Bank has branches established all over the Commonwealth. The governor is acquainted with his staff and knows the peculiarities of the various branches. He may decide that " Smith ", now stationed in Sydney, shall go to Broken Hill. "Smith" may object to that transfer, and appeal against it. The appeal will be heard, not by banking authorities, but by a gentleman possessing the qualifications of a police magistrate, an officer elected by the Commonwealth Bank branch of the United Bank Officers Association, and an officer appointed by the Governor. The Governor is not to be trusted to decide these matters, but some of his officers are to have the right to decide whether " Smith-"  shall be- transferred from Sydney to Broken Hill. If the appeal board says that he shall not go to Broken Hill, all the powers conferred upon the board of directors will not enable it to shift the officer. </para>

The board of directors will be an independent board of appeal. Promotions, transfers, dismissals, and fines for offences will be made by the Governor. An officer  may appeal to the board of directors, which will have nothing to do with the case, and will approach its consideration without prejudice. It will hear the case of the officer and the case of the governor, and decide whether the officer has right on his side, or' whether the Governor has properly exercised his discretion. That is a privilege that is not possessed by any other bank officer in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The provision for the appointment of local boards of advice has been taken from the bill.. Had it remained in the bill, those boards could have heard the cases that occurred in the various states. I have indicated what in my opinion are the weaknesses of the amendment. It would not be possible to run a bank under such conditions. The amendment would strip the Governor and the board of directors of all authority. The' greatest blot in it is the proposal to allow this appeal board to review a case in which a man may have been convicted of forgery or theft. Even if the High Court decided that the mat was guilty the Governor could not dismiss him if the appeal board said that he should not. Can we stand for such a proposal? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> amendment would require to be considerably amended before I could ask the committee to accept it. It must be rejected if the bank is to function properly. </para>

                    but not quite so comprehensive. My idea was to leave out clause 8 and substitute a new clause providing for a board of appeal. I have given way to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline>
                    in order to test the feeling of the committee. Let us admit, at the outset, that there is, perhaps, a great deal of verbiage in this amendment; but notwithstanding that let us ascertain whether the Government favours the granting of an appeal board to the employees of the Commonwealth Bank.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    has referred to a lot of imaginary things. He has stated in effect that even though an employee of the bank had been convicted of murder, but had not been hanged, he would have the right of appeal to such a board. No one in the wildest stretch of imagination would make such a suggestion. Under the Public Service Act every public servant has the right of appeal to an appeal board, and why should not the officers of the Commonwealth Bank be given that right ? In
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline>
                    statement I recognize an echo of a circular letter that was sent out by the  Deputy  Governor of the bank to the officers of the bank. It is quite evident that the  deputy  governor is opposed not only to an appeal board, but to the organization of the employees of the bank. He is not in favour of these men combining to protect their interests and their rights. The time has long gone by in Australia when any man would dare to say that employees should not combine to protect their rights and their  interests. What does
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kell</inline>
                    say ? He sent out the following circular letter -
                </para>
                <para>Bank Officers' Association. </para>
                <para>Circulars headed " Commonwealth Bank branch of the United Bank Officers' Association " dated 12th and 19th insts., and signed " Sydney Smith, Secretary," have been brought under my notice. As reference is made therein to an interview which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King,</inline> the vice-President of the Association, had with myself, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hullo,</inline> and the circulars arc couched in somewhat extravagant language, I feel it incumbent upon me to state that the views and opinions attributed to me in the circulars are entirely misleading and highly imaginative. My own opinion is that the officer of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia would be very much better served by an internal guild of their own on a wide interstate basis of organization, and which would work harmoniously with the bank, and have nothing but our own officers' interests at heart. Under such a scheme no feeling of antagonism between the staff and the bank would arise, and the staff would be in a position to bring forward their views on matters of general principle from time to time, and would not become embroiled in outside matters in which they are not in any way concerned. In several of the large English banks such guilds have been found to work for the substantial benefit of the staff, and without any friction whatever with the management. I would ask every member of ' the staff to seriously consider such a proposal before definitely, and perhaps unwisely, committing himself or herself to any other course of action. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been wondering as I listened to the debate in committee, as well as during the second reading of the bill, when we will decide that the members of this branch of the Public Service shall not be required to be kept in cotton wool. I want to know, in their own interests, why honorable senators are seeking further privileges for them that are not enjoyed by the common or garden variety of citizen. </para>

By what right should one section of citizens, simply because they happen to be employed by a semi-public institution, be placed on a better plane than other citizens of the Commonwealth? </para>

                        <para>- What is wrong with the service of the bank ? Nothing has yet been proved. Behind all this talk there is the suggestion that because they are employees of the bank perforce they must be subject to some injustice or grievance not suffered by other employees. Let us look at the position squarely. I am sick of all this effort on the part of certain public men in this country to extend to the Public Service such onerous conditions which, in the long run, must be paid for by the patient taxpayer. It is about time some one said a word or two. for that unfortunate fellow. What is the reason for this constant desire to foster and pamper one class alone ? I refuse to admit -that it is our duty to do this. The essence of a free democracy is that no advantage shall be given to any section of the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> said something about a circular that had been issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kell,</inline> the acting Governor of the bank, and objected to that gentleman outlining the kind of organization which, in his opinion, should be constituted. What is wrong with that circular? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> himself was a member of an organization in Western Australia established and maintained for years on exactly the same lines as that approved of by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kell.</inline> It is so existing to-day. This amendment is only part of an effort that has been made for a long time by certain public men to place public servants on a higher plane than other citizens of the Commonwealth. I took a prominent part in putting the Public Service on a very fair level, and incorporating in the act provisions whereby any grievances might be remedied in a fair and square manner. I do not want members of the Public Service to be placed in front of other men, no more than I desire that they shall be unfairly treated. The taxpayers have to stand behind the bank. This means financial responsibility. Employees of the bank are in an infinitely better position than many other people. There is no manifest grievance which does not find an echo in this Parliament. This chamber, and the same may be said of another place, has been used in the past for the purpose of ventilating grievances of the employees in this and all other public and semi-public institutions. . Do we hear of similar efforts on behalf of employees in private banks ? No, for the simple reason that no votes are involved. It is about time we took a definite stand in this matter if the Public Service of this country is not going to prove an insoluble problem and menace to the effort to deal out even-handed justice all round. This is plain talk. If I could find language to make it plainer I would employ it. I say that under this bill the employees of the Commonwealth Bank are placed in an infinitely superior position to employees in any other institution. I challenge contradiction of that statement. First there is an Appeal Board, then the Arbitration Court is open to them. On top of that there is. this Parliament as a last court of appeal with public opinion ready to do the fair thing. What better means could they employ for the settlement of their grievances? Fair play is bonny play. Why should we make pets of these people simply because they are employees of the bank? Do we not realize that the taxpayers will have to foot the bill if this bank is not a success ? I want to put in a word for the taxpayer - for the man who goes out into the interior and bears a much heavier burden of citizenship than can be said of employees in any of these semi public institutions. I freely admit that in the Public Service there are men who are underpaid and badly treated, but, as a whole, they are maintained on a fairly high level of equity and justice. and I want to be assured that they are giving 20s. worth of work for the money they receive. That is the stand I take, and I am satisfied that in this matter I shall have the approval even of the men themselves because of their strong sense of justice. Do these men want pampering ? If they do, I will not help them. On the contrary, as my votes and action in this chamber- prove, I shall be their friend in any well-grounded grievance. Honorable senators will be negligent of their duty if they argue that privileges which cannot be given to all shall be extended to a certain favoured few. That is my policy, and here I stand to defend it. The employees of the Commonwealth Bank, speaking broadly, have nothing to complain of. If they have any grievance a regular means is available for them to have it remedied. They may appeal to the established tribunals of the country, the doors of which are open to them. Every man should be equal before the law. I do not believe in any man appearing in a better light before the law, and that, I fear, is the essence of the effort that is being made from time to time by some honorable senators. I see nothing- wrong with the bill. The employees of the bank are getting a fair Heal. I do not believe that those who will be responsible for the management will be so callous as to steel their hearts against any appeal by the employees for justice. If they do, even they can be dealt with. Rather do I think  that these men will have just as generous instincts and fine qualities of human nature as the average men have. I do not believe that tyrants will be appointed to the board, but that the appointees will be men who will grace their positions with dignity, and will feel a duty imposed upon them to discharge their responsibilities creditably to themselves and to the bank. If we find that unsuitable men are appointed, we shall soon find means to get rid of them, or at least to curb their inclination to act unjustly. An unjust man cannot reign long in a public position in this country. Public opinion will soon work its will on perpetrators of injustice. "We need a new conception of our boasted belief in equality of treatment for all sections of the people. If I had my way there would be no pets in the community, because pets can only be supported at the expense of somebody else. I am quite satisfied with the clause as it stands, in the absence of a better one. The adoption of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> (amendment would result in the constitution of a board which would supersede our law courts. It would take the staff management from the responsible hands of the board, and place it in irresponsible hands. What business in the world could stand that and prosper? The Leader of the Opposition may be able to see- some other, meaning in it, but I fail to understand English if that will not be the effect of adopting it. We are coming to a most dangerous pass in even considering a proposal to constitute a board which' will usurp the functions of our law courts. It is high time that we gave evidence of the possession of a keener sense of justice and fair play. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> says that the Public Service already has an appeal board. </para>

If it be true, as has been stated, that all sorts of obstacles have been placed in the way of the Commonwealth Bank employees joining the United Bank Officers Association, it is high time that they were afforded some measure of protection. </para>

                        <para>- I know that some time ago, when they desired to join the Bank Officers Association, the men who took a prominent part" in the movement were in some case victimized and intimidated and in others dismissed. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> even at this period in his career, will not stand for the victimization of men who advocate the cause of unionism. If he does so, he has changed vastly from the man he- was a few years ago. He knows that in the years gone by employers of labour in this and other states 'vigorously advocated freedom of contract as against unionism, and only through the consistent and persistent agitation of the workers has unionism won public recognition. To-day even governments which are opposed to the Labour party's policy recognize the value  of  unionistic  principles, and, in consequence, we have our factories acts, wages boards, and arbitration courts. So far, the Commonwealth Bank employees have been denied access to the Arbitration Court, or the appointment of a wages board, and I am informed that its responsible officers have shown unrelenting hostility to every organized effort of the employees to better their conditions of employment and rates of pay. One result of that is that the employees of the associated banks enjoy much better conditions than do the Commonwealth Bank employees. For instance, the employees of the associated banks are paid time and a half for all hours worked in excess of 40 weekly, but the Commonwealth Bank employees are required at times to work as many as 60 and even 65 hours a week: and are paid no overtime. The employees of the associated banks are granted 2s. 6d. tea money when they have to work late, but the Commonwealth Bank employees not only receive no such consideration, but are also required to work on Saturday afternoons, and frequently at night, without consideration. The general secretary of the Bank Officers Association is able to interview the general managers of the associated banks whenever he has any matter of importance to put before them, but he is not able to obtain an interview with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. I think the committee will say that the Commonwealth Bank employees should have working conditions and remuneration at least the equal of those enjoyed by the employees of the associated banks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that the associated banks were probably jealous of the chief officer of the Commonwealth Bank because he had the title of governor. Apparently, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is himself proud of his title. We know that - . - . . . Man, proud man I "Drest  in a little brief authority " sometimes plays "fantastic tricks," and wc should prevent the Governor of the bank from doing so at the expense of the bank's employees. No hindrances should be placed in the way of their linking up with the Bank Officers Association and approaching the Arbitration Court, and they should be given a proper appeal board to investigate their grievances. Prior to the Queensland Savings Bank employees coming under the control of the Commonwealth Bank '.they had the right to an appeal board, but that right has now been abrogated. Why should they be deprived of it? Not one substantial argument has been advanced against the appointment of an appeal board for the Commonwealth Bank employees. In my opinion, the fact that ' in the past employees of the bank have been intimidated, victimized, and in many ways treated unfairly, to say nothing of the marked differentiation between their rates of pay and conditions of work and those of the private bank employees, is a substantial reason for the appointment of such a board. The Public Service has an appeal board, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> spoke so vehemently against it just now, I think, when he reflects calmly on the matter, he will be sorry for what he said. </para>

                        <para>- But what kind of an appeal is it? How and to whom must it be made? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will agree that the employees should have some means of voicing their grievances. If we affirm the principle of the right to an appeal we can, I believe, agree upon its exact nature. The clause as drafted only permits an appeal to the board of directors, and sitting on that board will be the Governor of the bank, who is its chief executive officer. Naturally, when the employees' appeal is submitted in writing - as it must be - the Governor will reply to it, and it is only reasonable to assume that, being present in person to discuss the matter, he will be able to impress his fellow board members much more than will the written document presented by the employees. As the matter now stands, if the employees feel that they have a grievance and approach the board for a remedy, the board will say, "You have the right to appeal and a prescribed method of making it. Put your complaint in writing and it will receive consideration." That would not be a proper kind of appeal. If an executive officer can put his case personally before the board of directors, why should not a man with a grievance also have the opportunity to appear in person before the board ? In the Public Service would we allow the  chairman  of the Public Service Board to tell a dissatisfied public servant that in order to exercise the right of appeal allowed to him under the act he must submit his appeal in writing to the board, and that the board will determine it? That would really be an appeal from Caesar unto Caesar. There are numbers of men in the Commonwealth Bank with serious grievances, and those who have endeavoured to get their grievances adjusted have been victimized; they have been intimidated, and even, in some cases, dismissed. If that condition of affairs is allowed to continue it will be impossible to obtain a contented or efficient service. To secure good service, the men must be treated as they deserve to&gt; be treated, and as we hoped they would be treated, when the bank was established. The committee has now the opportunity to do what is right. The men have not had justice done to them. They would not be asking for an appeal board merely for the sake of having one created. They want it because they are justly entitled to it, and because, up to the present, they have not received the consideration which they deserve. I ask the committee to affirm the principle that the officers of the Commonwealth Bank shall have an appeal board, and that it shall not be an appeal from Caesar unto Caesar. If such a board cannot be secured- on the lines proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> it should certainly not be on the lines of the appeal board for which provision is made in the bill. </para>

I think that the officers of the bank should have the right to put up their cases through an officer of their own association.

                        <para>- I do not think that the Government should appear in the matter. The Commonwealth Bank is not a government institution in the ordinary sense. The Minister should take the opportunity to think over the position between now and when the Senate meets again. He might bring in a provision to give officers an opportunity to put up their cases when they feel aggrieved in regard to certain penalties. I do not think that the board should be burdened with appeals with regard to transfer from one branch of the bank to another. I have some very vivid recollections in my own somewhat limited banking experience of cases where men were absolutely victimized by their immediate superiors, and had no possible chance of getting a fair square deal. </para>

It has been said that the appeal proposed in the bill is from Caesar unto Caesar, and as that criticism is justified by the fact that the governor of the bank would be on the board of directors, I have given instructions for the preparation of a new sub-section in substitution of sub-section 3 of the proposed new section.

                        <para>- They will be appointed by the board. As I have already pointed out, we cannot and must not take away from the board the right to give a final decision in the matter of employment and transfers. We must give the board control of its own staff, but we shall give an employee, who may consider that he has been unjustly treated, an opportunity to refer his case to this independent board - upon which he will be represented - which will inquire into the whole circumstances. This board will make its finding, which will go before the board of directors, whose decision will be final. Only one member of the board of directors is concerned, and that is the governor, because he has to order promotions and transfers. The proposed new provision does not go so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> intends; but it provides for an independent inquiry, and that the report of the finding shall come before the board of directors, whose -decision shall be final. In order to enable the proposed new clause to be submitted in a proper form I ask the committee to agree to the postponement of the clause. </para>

                    <para>If the amount lent by the Commonwealth has been refunded one half shall be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet.  ft has been decided that the Commonwealth shall grant to the Commonwealth Bank £6,000,000. The amendment I have moved will, if adopted, provide that no payment to the National Debt Sinking Fund shall be made from the net profits of the bank until the moneys granted under a previous provision of the bill have been repaid by the bank. I have already expressed my 'opinions in opposition to the granting of £6,000,000 to the Commonwealth Bank as a round-about way of finding funds for the institution. It seems to be absurd to make a grant to the bank by one operation and by another to take one-half of its profits and place that one-half to the credit of the national debt sinking fund. I have consistently opposed profits of the Commonwealth Bank being utilized for any such purpose. I have always held that the profits made by the bank should be utilized in extending the bank's operations. The Commonwealth Bank will, I presume, have to pay interest on the amount granted it from the profits derived, but if it proceeds in the future as it has been during the last six months, its profits will not be great. The first duty of the bank is to repay the money it has borrowed. I am not proposing that one-half of the net profits of the bank shall for all time be withheld from the national debt sinking fund, but only until such time as the £6,000,000, or whatever sum may bo granted to the bank, has been repaid. If a further proposal is made that the national debt sinking fund be reduced by the misappropriation of the profits of foe Commonwealth Bank, I shall, if I have the opportunity, oppose it. The proposal to place one-half of the profits to the bank's reserve is all right so far as it goes. If it had not been for the decision to grant £6,000,000 to the bank, I should have been in favour of the whole of the net profits being placed to the reserve fund to enable it to meet its obligations and also to extend its operations. It was never intended by those who advocated the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank that the profits should year after year be utilized for any purpose other than an 'extension of the bank's operations. When the establishment of the bank was under consideration, we were of the opinion that we were not getting a fair deal from the private banking institutions, but it was never intended that the operations of the bank should be hampered by this misappropriation of its profits. I find on reference to the last half yearly balance-sheet that the total profits made by the bank exceed £4,500,000. It is intended to take at least £4,000,000 of that sum and place it to the credit of the bank reserve fund, to be used in furthering the operations of the bank. That will be a perfectly legitimate use for the money. But the proposal that has been sprung upon us during the last few days to continue to pay half the profits into the national debt sinking fund, can have been dictated only by a determination to prevent the development of the bank's operations. I am informed, on very good authority, that it was decided a considerable time ago to establish a branch of the bank at Goulburn, but that for various reasons the management has not been prepared to expend the necessary money. I know, also, that land has been purchased in other localities, but the establishment of branches in those centres also has been delayed. </para>
