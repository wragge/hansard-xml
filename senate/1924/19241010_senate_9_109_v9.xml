                        <para>- I have heard of the wonders of beam wireless, but they are as' nothing in comparison with- the wonders of " mulga " wireless. ' The alleged message carries with it its own contradiction, because no wireless message could reach . Darwin from the locality where . the <inline font-style="italic">Huddersfield</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">John Alce</inline> were last reported to be except from the Kyogle, and that vessel could not possibly have reached the locality by the time this "mulga" message reached Darwin. There is no truth in the report, otherwise it would have been received by the department. </para>

                    <para class="block">The bill is intended to give legal standing to the Australian Meat Council, which was formed by the last Government in 1922, -to improve the production and marketing of meat, and to advise the Commonwealth in regard to the acts and regulations governing the export of meat. The council consists of representatives of cattle-growers and meat works elected by the Advisory Meat Board in each state. The Australian Meat Council is controlled by cattle-growers who are in a majority on it. It is the only national organization in connexion with the meat industry, and has already done much to advance the interests of the stock-raisers by investigating conditions in Great Britain, the East, the United States of America, and South America; securing reductions in freights on meat shipped oversea; co-operating with the Customs officials in improving the- grade and standard of Australian meat exported ; and urging improvements in methods of trucking cattle. The council is now urging on all concerned the necessity for improvement in the breeding of stock with a view to the production of young cattle for slaughter. The bill will not come into operation until the states or a majority of them pass legislation creating the State Boards, and giving them power to tax stock-owners at rates not exceeding Id. per head of cattle and one-sixth of a penny per head of sheep. The amounts raised by this levy will be used to pay the expenses of the boards and the Australian Meat Council, and to do everything necessary to improve the marketing of Australian meat. The Commonwealth is committed to no expenditure under the bill. The moneys required must be raised by virtue of legislation passed by the states. Queensland has already passed an act for the purpose, the New South Wales Government is about to introduce a bill, and the Victorian and Tasmanian Governments have promised favorable consideration to the matter. South Australia and Western Australia are expected to co-operate in the scheme very shortly. The bill accords with the Government policy of organizing primary industries on efficient lines. In committee I propose to move an amendment to clause 9 to provide that action taken under paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> shall not apply to any state in which there is no law in force as specified in sub-clause 4 of clause 4. We desire all the states to  come into this scheme, but if one remains outside the scheme will not be defeated. </para>

                        <para>.- There are 30 members on the Australian Meat Council which this measure proposes to perpetuate. They are elected by all the stock-raising interests of the Commonwealth, and their appointment reduces to some extent the number of persons available for appointment to boards, by the Government. I disagree entirely with the proposal to delegate to this board, power to impose the proposed taxation on stock-owners. I realize that the Government cannot, itself, go much further in the direction of imposing taxation, but that is no excuse for proposing pernicious, legislation of this description. These methods are absolutely wrong. I cannot blame the Government for adopting them, for it does not understand even the elementary principles of taxation and is absolutely incompetent in every respect. It is. for that reason that we are asked to consider day after day miserable make-shift legislation like this. I understand that the Government has already advanced Â£17,000 to this board for which it has no security. I suppose that we can hope for nothing, but that the Government will continue to pursue this policy until it has exhausted the patience of even its most patient followers. Its only excuse for appointing so many boards is, apparently, that it recognizes its own incompetence lo manage the affairs of the country and so it must delegate its powers to outside bodies. </para>

                            <para>- My point is that the method by which taxation is to be imposed under this measure is inequitable. If the bill reaches the committee stage I shall probably move an amendment, to substitute another and fairer system for the one proposed. Even in a measure like this, the Government should make some provision for ensuring that the agricultural and pastoral lands of this country are put to their best use. If that were done, both the quality and quantity of. our stock would be improved, and the people of Australia would be able to enjoy cheaper mutton and beef. It is surprising to me that although the Government is concerned, in season and out of season, with organizing the export market for our primary products, it . has no time whatever to devote to improving the local market. Stock-raisers receive, I suppose, only a few pence per lb. for the meat they sell, but by the time the best beef reaches the Australian consumer it costs as much as ls. 6d. a lb. The Government should direct some attention to the improvement of the local marketing conditions, with a view to reducing overhead charges, and so making meat available to the general community at a lower price. Not only does the Australian consumer have to pay a higher price for home-grown commodities, but he has to submit to the injustice of receiving an article of poorer quality than that which is exported and sold at a lower price. The&gt; best of our products are exported, whereas I submit that they should be obtainable at reasonable prices by our own people. We should be far more concerned than we are about giving the local consumer a fair deal. </para>

                            <para>- It does. It includes members of the permanent military, naval, and air forces. Advantage is also taken to correct some anomalies that have been discovered in the administration of the act. These corrections are embodied in clauses 4 to 12 and clause 14, which I shall briefly explain. The defence provisions are embodied in a number of sub-clauses under clause 13. Clause 4 widens the definition of the word "Service " by including service in the permanent naval, military, and air forces, also the permanent state service of an employee transferred from the service of the state. The effect of this extension is to include as " service " . the military service of military staff clerks who have been transferred to the control of the Public Service Board, and also the state service of lighthouse-keepers who were transferred to the Commonwealth service in 1915, thereby bringing these employees and their widows and children within the benefits of the act. Clause 4a amends the second proviso of section 12, subsection 2 of the act, to provide that an employee whose age for retirement is fixed between 60 and 65 years may, on retirement, pay his contributions to- 65 years and thereby qualify for a higher pension than that which can be granted under the existing conditions. Clause 5 refers to the naval forces, and will be dealt with later. Clause 6 amends section 13 of the principal act, by giving certain employees over 30 years of age, who had not the opportunity to elect to contribute for units at the rate for age 30, the right to contribute up to four units at that age. Clause 7 is one of the most important in the bill. It introduces a new section, 16a, in the act, under which an employee may elect to contribute at increased rates with the right to retire at 60 on full pension, in lieu of contributing at the existing rates, which are based on retirement at the age of 65. Clauses 7a and 9 should be taken together. The effect of these amendments of sections 24 and 30 of the act, is to abolish the condition of 7 years' service before an employee can become entitled to an invalid pension. Clause 8 makes one or two verbal alterations in section 29, but does not otherwise affect its provisions. Clause 10 and the proviso to clause 11 may be taken together. They amend section 38 of the act by extending the benefit of free pensions to the widows of employees with state rights, who died after the 31st December, 1920, and before the 5th January, 1923, when contributions to the Superannuation Fund commenced. These widows are not included in the principal act, and it is but fair that they should be given the benefits of the act in common with the widows of employees without state rights. Clause 10a amends section 47 of the act by making pensions payable fortnightly and fixing the fortnightly pension at Â£1 in respect of each unit. Clause 11, with its proviso, modifies the 'provisions of section 51 by excluding from its operation the members of the military and air  forces; also the widows of employees with state rights, who, but for the section, would have rights to free pension under section 38. -Clause 12 gives employees with state rights, who contribute for a limited pension, the privilege of increasing their contributions as their salaries increase, provided that the number of units for which they may contribute, plus the value of their state- rights, shall not exceed .the number of units for which they could otherwise contribute, according to their salary group. Clause 13 contains the machinery for bringing the military and air forces under the act. A new part, IVa, is created, and the sub-clauses give effect to the proposals adopted by the Government after consideration of a report and recommendation furnished by a committee - comprised of responsible officers of the Defence Department, and appointed by the Minister for Defence. These proposals have been reported upon by two of the three actuaries, who reported on the Superannuation Bill in 1922, and a copy of their report has been circulated with the bill. The proposals, briefly, are - All officers and men of the Naval Forces are to be excluded from the operation of the Superannuation Act, and to be granted deferred pay in lieu of superannuation. Members of the military forces are to become contributors under. the provisions of Part IVa for pensions on retirement at 55 or 60, according to rank. The airmen, other than officers, are to become contributors as in the case of members of the military forces. Air officers are to be entitled to deferred pay, and, in view of the hazardous nature of flying operations, will be permitted to contribute for invalid pensions for themselves and pensions for their widows and children in the event of fatal accident. The machinery clauses are comprised in three divisions. The first division contains the clauses which are general in character. The second division deals with contributions, and the third refers to pensions and benefits. Under a new clause, 13a, the act is made to apply to certain employees at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, who were contributors to the fund, but lost their status as employees of the Commonwealth when the dockyard establishment was taken over by the Shipping Board. The rights of these employees of the Commonwealth, as contributors to the Superannuation Fund, were not preserved under the Shipping Act. Clause 14 amends section 77 of the act to provide for reports by Defence medical officers where questions arise respecting the invalidity of members of the Defence Forces. The purpose of the bill is to extend in certain . directions the benefits of superannuation to permanent officers of the Commonwealth, and I trust that the measure will be acceptable to honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - Owing to pressure of business I have not been able to grasp the full purport of the bill, and I do not yet know whether it will meet the case of two warrant officers, whose claims were recently brought under my notice. Warrant Officer Ingall, after 36 years of service, was retired under the 1922 act without being given any allowance or pension. He certainly received his holiday pay. The other case was that of Warrant Officer Gale, who had 23 years' service. Honorable senators will remember that when I previously dealt with this matter I decided to ask for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into such cases as these. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> informed me that a bill would be introduced in which these anomalies would be dealt with, but the difficulty was to obtain the bill from the Superannuation Board. It has now been introduced in this chamber. Warrant Officer Gale had commenced to pay for a pension of five units, which would have given him a retiring allowance of Â£135 per annum if he had continued his payments until 65 years of age. But under the Defence Act he was compulsorily retired at 60 years. When he asked for his pension allowance he was told that by paying a sum of over Â£30 ho would receive it. He paid that sum and received an allowance of lis. 9d. per fortnight, or 5s. 10Â½d. per week. When the Government, under the 1922 act, retired many commisisoned and non-commissioned officers they were given a lump sum, in some cases exceeding Â£1,000, and it passes my comprehension that the Government should pay a non-commissioned officer with 23 years' service a pension of 5s. 10Â½d. a week. From my reading of the bill, I understand that Warrant Officer Gale, who was retired at 60 years of age, may, under this bill, receive a pension of Â£52 a year . if for the two previous years he pays Â£10 19s. Id. a fortnight, amounting in all to over Â£500. I hope that I am wrong in my reading ot the bill, and that the Minister will be able to place a better construction upon its provisions. The sum of Â£500 seems exorbitant to obtain a pension of Â£52 per annum. The Commonwealth can well afford to treat its employees generously. It is a rank injustice to ask a man to retire from the Service at 60 years of age without a pension, when during his 23 years' ' service he had been paid only a bare living wage. Warrant Officer Ingall was one of the old instructors ill Nev/ South Wales before federation. He has to his credit 36 years of excellent service, but he was precluded from the benefits of superannuation because all his appointments were for three years only, and, therefore, his service was not considered permanent. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill proposes to extend the provisions of the Superannuation Act of 1922 to the military and air forces of the Commonwealth. I think it is time that the Government took a wider view of the matter. I do not object to the Public Service being brought under an act of this description, nor to the proposed addition to the number of those who will benefit. But I do think that the time is opportune to extend the provisions of the act to every member of the community. The men working in the iron and building trades, the men doing the pastoral and pioneering work, outside the Public Service, should be treated in precisely .the way in which we treat public servants. </para>

Notwithstanding that, I am glad that this bill has been brought down in fulfilment of a promise of the Government. The portion of the measure in which I am interested is that which deals with payments to widows of deceased officers. I should like to know whether widows of deceased officers will get the same benefits as would have, been given to them if their husbands had at the time of their death been contributors to the superannuation fund. That is a vital point. If the bill confers upon widows and orphaned children that particular benefit, will it have retrospective operation; and, if so, to what extent? I should also like to know whether the dependants of unmarried contributors will receive the benefits of the measure, or whether the contributions will be returnable. </para>

                        <para>. - After I had moved for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into certain hardships that had been put upon people who were retired from the Defence Department, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> informed me that a bill would be brought down to relieve those hardships. Will this bill do that? If it will not, what is the reason for the omission ? Have we reached the stage when a Minister's word cannot be accepted ? The promise given was so definite and distinct that I withdrew my motion for the appointment of a select committee. I am quite aware that- compensation was paid on an actuarial basis, but that was so unfair that the Minister informed me that legislation would be introduced to bring about an improvement. I was looking forward to-the bill, and I cannot now find in it the relief which was promised. I am reluctant to believe that we cannot accept the word of a Minister when he makes a distinct promise. I shall not permit the bill to be hurried through committee. Men who did not pay anything into the fund were given an allowance of Â£104 a year. When I mentioned the case of a man who, after 23~ years' service, received 5s. 10Â½d. a week, the Minister for Defence told me that he could produce the case of a man who was receiving only 2s. lid. a week. We should remedy those anomalies. The Commonwealth should not turn into the street these aged and unfit men. The Superannuation Board should not be  allowed to withhold the measure until the closing hours of the session, and omit from it the provisions that are desired. If the hardships are not now remedied I shall take the earliest opportunity available next session to see that justice is done. </para>

                        <para>.- I am . glad that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is in his place, because I wish to refresh his memory of the circumstances connected with the case of Warrant Officer Gale, When I submitted a motion for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into this man's case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> informed me that an amending superannuation bill would be brought before the Senate to right the wrong of certain officers whose names had been mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has just informed the committee that Warrant Officer Gale, who paid over Â£30 in a lump sum into the superannuation fund, is getting an allowance of11s. 9d. a fortnight, representing the actuarial equivalent of his contributions, and other officers, who paid nothing at all into the fund, are receiving Â£104 a year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> distinctly promised that the Superannuation Bill to be introduced would meet such cases, and upon his definite undertaking I informed the Senate that I would withdraw my motion for the appointment of a select committee. I did so. I should like to know if this bill really remedies the position. The Minister in charge of the bill is taking the same stand as the Superannuation Board, because he states that Warrant Officer Gale is drawing an allowance in accordance with the provisions of the act. I am aware that, with legislation being crowded on the Senate, Ministers have not sufficient time to consider measures properly, but I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that if this bill does not remedy Warrant Officer Gale's wrongs, and if the present Government is in office when Parliament re-assembles, 1 shall not be satisfied' with any promise that legislation will be introduced, but shall persist in my demand for the appointment of a select committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>  bringing certain cases before the Senate, and my recollection is that I informed him that the Government intended to introduce a bill to deal with naval and military officers who were not provided for in the Superannuation Act. Certainly I cannot remember promising that the case of Warrant Officer Gale would be provided for in a way different from officers of the Public Service. I am informed that if what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is asking to be done were done, certain persons in the naval and military forces would be treated differently from persons in the Public Service in the matter of superannuation benefits. That was never intended. What we intended was that persons in the naval and military forces should be treated in the same way as persons in the Public Service, with such variations as might be rendered necessary by the difference in time of service. No promise was made that persons in the naval' and military forces would be treated differently from persons in the Public Service. Obviously that could not be done, because it would mean making an invidious distinction between the two classes of employees. I am advised that Warrant-Officer Gale will be dealt with in the same way as if he were a member of the Public Service who retired before the age of retirement. </para>

                        <para>I desire to bring to the notice of the Minister the case of a warrant officer who was retired from the Defence Department subsequent to the passing of the Defence Retirement Act. This officer had had 23 years' service, and he was. retired at the age of 60 years. Just prior to his retirement, he was contributing to the superannuation fund at the- rate prescribed for a pension of five units. Had he remained in the service- until he reached the age of 65-years; the sum that he was contributing would have entitled him to a pension of Â£130 a year.  His  name is W arrant-Officer. Gale.  He received notice from the department that unless he paid something like Â£30 forthwith, he would not be entitled to a pension. It is a rather heavy call upon a man who is out of employment to find Â£30 in a lump sum, but believing that when he had paid it he would' become entitled to the pension, he forwarded the amount. Time went on, as it generally does when departments are dealing, with the claims of poor men, and eventually he was granted a pension of lis. Sd. per fortnight ! Whenever an apparent injustice is brought to my notice, I endeavour to have it remedied. I therefore represented the bare facts of this case to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden).</inline> He and his Under-Secretary went into the matter, and stated that there waa quite a number of similar cases, to deal with which legislation would be introduced during the present session. The session is proceeding, but I cannot see any indication of the introduction of that legislation. I trust that I shall not be regarded as uttering a threat when I say that if the definite information is not supplied me that that legislation will be introduced to remedy what the Minister for Defence admitted ib a hardship, I shall move for the appointment of a select committee of this Senate to inquire into the matter. I do not like asking for the appointment of a select committee because of the worry and trouble it entails, and the expense in which it involves the country, but/ if I am compelled to take that action, I feel sure that the fair-mindedness of honorable senators will induce them to grant my request. The expense which  will thereby be incurred will be at least as great as the payment that has been withheld. I have no doubt what the verdict of a select committee would be, because there is not an honorable senator who would deny the justice of this man's claim. This officer belongs to New South Wales. Had federation not been consummated he would, according to the New South Wales "custom, have received one month's salary for every year of service. I have not read to the Senate the correspondence that has taken place, as I wish to reserve it for the consideration of a select committee, if such be found necessary. It looks as though the department obtained from this man the sum of Â£30 by deceit. I do not contend that the letter he received was such as to lead him to anticipate that he would get all that he expected, but I feel quite satisfied that, had he known he was to receive a pension of only 11s. 5d. per fortnight, he would not have made that payment of Â£30. I do not think any honorable senator would do so. During the war he frequently volunteered for active service at the front, but he was not permitted to. leave Australia, because he was one of those sterling, reliable, efficient officers whose services were required for the training of recruits here. He did his duty well. When the Superannuation Act was passed he accepted the conditions it imposed, and commenced to make the payments required.  His  services were dispensed with when he reached the military retiring age of 60 years. There are men who were put off two years prior to him and were paid handsome pensions, although they made no contributions to the fund. The explanation of the Minister for Defence is - " We could pay those pensions then because we were not working under this act, but we cannot do so now, because the act clearly defines the manner in which pensions shall be paid." It is hard to induce people to believe that justice is being meted out when only Â£14 per annum can be paid under the act, although Â£130 per annum is being received by men who were discharged prior to the passing of the act. It will be about two and a half years before this man will get back what he has paid into the fund. If his death occurs before that time, the department will have made a profit cut of him. I have brought the matter up because I am so impressed with the justice of the claim. </para>

                        <para class="block">Honorable senators conversant with the work of warrant officers and non-commissioned officers know that it is a very difficult and technical procedure to formulate a superannuation scheme on an actuarial basis in relation to them, because although many of these men served for upwards of 30 years, their service was in five-year periods. At the end of each period of five years they were re-engaged. The work of investigation is being pressed forward, and we trust that we shall soon be in a position to introduce the necessary amending bill. In any case, irrespective of the date at which the measure is passed, those concerned will not suffer because the scheme will come into operation as from the 1st July, 1924. If a select committee were appointed, it could not do more than is being done by the officers who are inquiring into the matter. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> motion relates to retiring allowances I understand that he really has in mind a superannuation scheme, because in the strict sense of the term retiring allowances are of a different character. As inquiries are being conducted with the utmost expedition it seems unnecessary to appoint a select committee before which the actuarial experts would have to appear to give evidence when their time might be better employed in completing the investigations on which they are engaged. As it does not appear that any good purpose would be served by adopting the motion, I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will consent to its withdrawal. </para>

                            <para>- It is not unfair; it is candid. When. I withdrew my claim for a select committee I did so on the clear understanding that a bill would be introduced to meet the cases into which I desired the select committee to inquire. But this bill does not do so. The Minister has brought it down at the end of the session when he can get it through Parliament easily. But there is still another session ahead, and I promise the Minister and the department that deals with these cases that there is a power in this land which will deal with them. If they throw warrant-officers aside without adequate compensation after rendering 20 or 30 years' service to the country, they in their turn will be thrown aside when the opportunity arises. The Defence Department is most callous in its treatment of the men who have served it well. While commissioned officers have been retired on good allowances, not because of their ability but because' of their social influence, the warrant-officers, who do the real work of the department, have been treated as workers are always treated - by being tossed on one side without adequate compensation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> avoided the appointment of a select committee by saying that it could do no more than the department was already doing, and he distinctly promised that the cases I mentioned would be dealt with. He says now that his promise has been fulfilled by the introduction of this bill. The bill does not deal with the cases I brought forward. lt was only circulated this morning, but nevertheless I was prepared to go on with it because I was anxious to ascertain if these men's cases had been dealt with. I learn that it does not provide for them. I ask the Minister to show me how the bill treats the men to whom I refer any better than they would have been treated without it? I mentioned certain cases only, because I had proof of them, but there are many others of a similar nature which are also not covered by this bill. The Minister is always ready to gain a point by making a statement in such a way that, no matter what happens, he will be  able to justify it. How long he will continue to ' do that I do not know, but he will not " put it over me " again. The bill is a gross repudiation of a definite promise made by him. To pay one man a pension of a little over Â£14 a year and another, who was doing the same work, a pension of Â£104 a year may suit the Government, because possibly one man may be a friend of their party and the other may not. The whole thing is a fraud and a swindle so far as these warrant officers are concerned. I read the letter forwarded to one officer informing him that his claim for a pension would be considered if he paid an additional Â£30. He paid this money, and was then told that he could have a pension of a little over Â£14 a year. It would take him three years, if he lived that long, to work" out what he paid into the fund. If a person in private life got money from other' under the same conditions he would be brought before a court and charged with obtaining money under false pretences.. But the Government can do this sort of thing with impunity. It gave some commissioned officers over Â£1,000 each as a retiring allowance, without calling upon them to pay into any fund, but no such provision was made for non-commissioned officers. It is more than nine months since I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden,</inline> the Minister for Defence, on the matter. He saw at once the injustice of the case I put before him, and he said that when Parliament met again a bill would be introduced to remove it. We had a definite promise from the Government that the non-commissioned officers would be treated fairly, and were told that the Superannuation Board was engaged in preparing the necessary legislation. Honorable senators will not forget the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> gave that promise. He may try to hide behind the fact that he did not actually use words which could be interpreted into a promise to deal with certain definite cases, but as a matter of fact, I did not ask that certain definite cases should be dealt with. I merely used the cases of which I had proof as an illustration of what was happening. Noncommissioned officers were being retired on a starvation allowance. I could, if necessary, produce letters from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trumble,</inline> the Secretary of the Defence Department, pointing out that when Parliament met the matter would be remedied. The bill for which we have been waiting has now  arrived, and we find that it leaves these officers in the position they occupied before all these promises were made. It  is a. scandal and a disgrace to the people of Australia that a Government should, without proper compensation, turn men adrift at 60 years of age to earn a living as best they can. They will derive no advantage from this bill. I withdrew my motion for a select committee on the ground that the bill foreshadowed by the Minister would remedy the cases I had in mind, and now I find that the bill does not provide any remedy for them at a stage when it is no longer possible to secure the appointment of a select committee. If I had known last night what was in this bill, or rather what was not in it, I would have seen that the Senate met next week, so that a select committee could be appointed to inquire into the matter. I believe that there is sufficient honour among honorable senators on the benches opposite to prevent ' the Senate from being fooled. When I withdrew my claim for a select committee, the words I used were that it was on the understanding that a bill would be introduced to deal with the cases I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> allowed my words to go unchallenged. If he had then said as a straightforward man would have said, " I have made no such promise," I should have gone on with my motion for the appointment of a select committee. I believe that honorable senators would have supported that motion, because they were anxious that justice should be done to these non-commissioned officers. I shall move to add a proviso to the bill, " That nothing in. the schedule shall prevent the Government from doing justice where cases of grave injustice come under their notice." That will give the Government sufficient scope to deal with cases of deserving non-commissioned officers. Why should there be a difference between the treatment of a commissioned officer and a warrant officer? In nine cases out of -ten the warrant officer is the more efficient of the two and does more work, but he is not paid a sufficiently high wage to enable him to make provision for his old age. I was definitely promised that the cases of warrant officers would be met by this bill. I did not doubt the assurance that was given me, and immediately withdrew my motion for a select committee. I believe that all honorable senators were of the same mind as myself concerning the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Is the Minister desirous of remedying cases of hardship? </para>

                            <para>-I regret that a bitter experience prevents me from accepting the word of the Minister on the matter. Other men,, as well as Ingall, are being treated unfairly. I have in mind a mau who,, in the early days of military service in New South Wales, was one of the partially paid officers, and a most efficient instructor. He had exceptional ability, and though he was over the military age when the war began, he offered his services to the Government and rendered excellent service for several years. Only two years ago he won the prize in a New South Wales competition for veteran marksmanship. He is the kind of man who' built up the genuine military spirit in Australia. In 1922 this man was discharged. The Government paid him for holidays due to him. He was told that, because he had been re-appointed every three years his 36J years' service was not continuous, and, therefore, he was not entitled to a pension. </para>

                            <para>- And it always will be the same old quibble. Retired commissioned officers were generously treated. There should have been no discrimination between the two classes of men, yet one commissioned officer received a retirement allowance of Â£1,000, and this warrant officer received only 5s.  10Â½d.  a week. I ask the Government during the luncheon adjournment to re-draft the clause to permit: of these grievances being remedied. The Minister stated to-day that men who had contributed nothing to the superannuation fund had been retired on a pension of Â£104 per annum, and that other men, who had been retired after contributing to the superannuation fund, received Â£14 a year. In other cases, about half of that amount was paid, the allowance, working out at 2s. lid., per week. Does the Government want to continue these hardships, and do they want the. force of representation in this Parliament, to be continually used to ventilate injustices to persons who have served their country well <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I cannot really understand the mental attitude of the members of the Government in seeking to pass this legislation. It is the old military spirit, which cannot tolerate civil control. </para>

                        <para>. -I  propose to move  a  new clause, 14a. Clause 14 deals with state rights, and  I  want to make it clear that these rights shall not be statutory, but rights accruing by reason of the custom and procedure of the states. If the bill is passed as it stands the only rights recognized will be statutory rights. In New South Wales, in pre-superannuation days, the custom upon retirement was to pay to officers one month's salary for each year of service. That applied to the whole of the Public Service of that state. It is only fair that this right should be conserved to officers who cannot take advantage of the benefits of the Superannuation Act. The bill was introduced to rectify, not only hardships imposed under the Superannuation Act, but also anomalies existing in the Defence Department. If the bill is passed as it stands the Minister, when considering cases of hardship, although acknowledging the justice of the claims, will take refuge in the fact that the law does not provide for them. </para>

                <para>This amendment was carried in another place under a misapprehension. The amendment was contingent on the insertion of a new clause 8c, which was withdrawn in the House of Representatives. The proposed new clause 8c provided for the safe custody of all persons required or ordered to be deported under the act. If the new clause had been passed, it would have been unnecessary to retain the special provision in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> of clause 5, for the safe custody of persons referred to in section 8a of the act. Further, the section, as affected by the amendment of the House of Representatives would not contain any express provision to give effect to an order of deportation made by the Minister in cases covered by paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and c, sub-clause 1, of section 8a. This is necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of the section. By disagreeing with the amendment the Senate will restore the provisions of the bill relating to deportations under section 8a to the position existing when the bill left the Senate. </para>

These Estimates cover the expenditure which was so made during the last three financial years, and Parliament' will now be asked to grant the necessary covering appropriation. With regard to the apparent delay which has taken place in submitting the supplementary Estimates for 1921-2, I may explain that, before this action can be taken, it is customary for the Auditor-General's report, together with the Treasurer's financial statement of the accounts of the year, to be presented to Parliament. The statement of accounts for the year 1921-2. and the Auditor-General's report thereon, were presented to Parliament in October, 1922. </para>
                    <para class="block">The House dissolved a few days later, and there was; no opportunity to ask Parliament to deal with the supplementary Estimates. After the elections, a short session of about a fortnight was held. It was devoted wholly to dealing' with the Address-in-Reply, and, during the second session, which was adjourned prior to the departure of the Prime Minister to the Imperial Conference, it was possible to deal only with matters of pressing urgency. I have now taken the earliest opportunity during the present session of submitting the supplementary Estimates; The amount voted for Treasurer's Advance in1921-2 was Â£1,500,000, and the expenditure made therefrom, which requires a covering parliamentary appropriation, is Â£1,412,072, made up as follows :  - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The Auditor-General's report for 1922-3, was not available until the 10th December, 1923, and, as Parliament was not then sitting, it was not possible to bring down supplementary Estimates until the present session. In this year the vote for Advance to the Treasurer was Â£1,500,000, the same amount as was voted in. the previous year, and the expenditure made from this vote, for which an appropriation of Parliament is required, totals Â£1,377,736, viz:- </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="109332192410103_15_1.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>The accounts for the year 1923-4 have now been audited by the Auditor-General, and his report in connexion therewith was presented to Parliament on Friday last. Included in the accounts and statements submitted to the Auditor-General' is a statement of amounts to be included in supplementary estimates, and in his re port the Auditor-General states that supplementary appropriation is necessary to cover this expenditure. I am therefore now in a position to bring down the Supplementary Estimates for 1923-4.. The amount voted for advance to Treasurer for 1923-4, was again Â£1,500,000. Out of this vote the expenditure was as follows :  - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="109332192410103_15_2.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>Parliament has already been fully informed in regard to the. expenditure now submitted for covering appropriation. The expenditure was furnished in the fullest detail with the Estimates and budget papers of the several years'. In addition, the Treasurer's finance statement for each year, accompanied by the Auditor-General's report on the accounts, was laid on the table of the Senate and thus made available to members, amongst the Parliamentary papers. So far as the accounts for 1923-4 are concerned, I presented an approximate statement of accounts to the Senate at the earliest possible moment after the close of the financial year, and-, at the same time, I gave full explanations of the principal- increases in the actual expenditure over the estimate. This was- done on the 4th July last. Similar action was taken on the 5th July, 1922, in regard to the accounts for 1921-2, and again on the 4th July, 1923, in respect of the accounts for 1922-3. It will thus be seen that many opportunities have been afforded to honorable senators to make themselves familiar with the expenditure which is now submitted for their approval in the supplementary estimates. </para>

Twelve months ago an application was made for an additional machine. Although the officers employed in the Works and Railways Branch use the most up-to-date machines themselves, and although the application made by the sub-committee of federal members was for an Underwood typewriter, the department furnished a second-hand, ramshackle, tumbledown, Monarch typewriter, which was, of course, promptly returned. Why could not the request of the sub-committee of members in Sydney be complied with? </para>

                    <para>. - I have noticed that whenever permanent officials are attached to any department they take very good care that every convenience is provided for them. Their offices are furnished in a most up-to-date manner, and have table telephones installed. But "when we come to deal with the accommodation provided for members of Parliament, it is a different matter. I do not know who is at fault, but I take it that members themselves are mainly responsible for the manner in which they are sometimes treated. Whoever was responsible for laying out the offices in Sydney used by members of Parliament from all parts of the Commonwealth, and sometimes by members of the New Zealand Parliament, merely fixed one telephone on a wall, so that, if a member wished to communicate with any part of the state he was obliged to stand up against the wall to do so. Permanent officials would not tolerate that kind of thing for five minutes if it affected themselves. On representations being made in the proper quarter, it was finally decided, at considerable cost. I believe, to provide a telephone for each of the large tables in the room. The provision was not more than was required. I do not know who has been responsible for providing the  chairs one is obliged to use in the members' offices in Sydney. They are most unsuitable. One would imagine that members used the offices to sleep in instead of for the transaction of public business. </para>

In regard to the application for a typewriter made by the Sydney sub-committee of members consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall, Mr. Cunningham,</inline> and myself, instead of an Underwood machine being sent along as requested, the Works and Railways Department sent along an old contraption quite out of date, and utterly unsuitable for the purpose for which it was required. No public officer would use such a machine. When requests for facilities of that description are made, they should be complied with. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has promised to bring before the House Committee, at its first meeting, the matter's I have mentioned. I think his representations will be sufficient to ensure that an up-to-date No. 5 Underwood typewriter is installed in the offices used by members in Sydney. </para>

As this money has already been spent,, it is futile to discuss the various items, but it . appears to me that such measures could be submitted to the Senate earlier so that we should have an opportunity to ascertain exactly what items were included, in the expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- The question to be considered is not whether this amendment will impose a hardship on 'a rich or a poor man, but whether the principle is fair and just. I contend that it is neither fair nor just. There are many other avenues by which the Government, if it so desired, could obtain substantial revenue. If a man buys property in one of our capital cities at Â£50,000, and sells it at Â£100,000, the unearned increment of Â£50,000 is free from taxation. The cost of medical services, hospital attention, and medicine very often amounts to from Â£200 to Â£300. Despite the fact that that money is expended on account of sickness, income taxation is levied on it. The principle is not right. I am not concerned for the moment with whether a man is rich or poor. The principle should be general in its application. Expenses incurred because of sickness in any home, whether the man be well or poorly circumstanced, should be allowed as a deduction from income taxation. I hope that those honorable senators who previously supported me will now stand by me in insisting upon the amendment made by the Senate. </para>

Honorable senators twice considered this matter, and deliberately arrived at the same decision on each occasion. Honorable senators are, of course, entitled to back down if that is their desire. But it would be more in keeping with the dignity of the Senate to compel a recognition by the other place of the overwhelming majority that has twice been recorded in this matter. Of. course, there is the alternative of a double dissolution. The magnitude of the question warrants even that. </para>

The reasons which induced honorable senators to accept the amendment should be put plainly before honorable members of another place, who would, no doubt, then see the error of their ways, and agree to this reasonable concession. Unfortunately, at ' the present time throughout Australia there is a very great deal of sickness, and practically every public and private hospital is filled. The attitude adopted by the other place is not the correct one. </para>

                        <para>- Sometimes even Labour members, like my honorable friend, are led astray. We must endeavour to bring them back to the path of rectitude from which they have evidently strayed in this instance. If the Senate is at all times to bow to the will of another place it may as well be abolished. Twice this committee has decisively voted to eliminate a distinction that has been drawn between classes in this community. That distinction does not find a place in other measures, and it should not be allowed in this. I hope that honorable senators will not be stampeded because the other place has again disagreed to our amendment. Let us show to that House, and to those who have sent us here, that we have some backbone, and that we know what we are doing. I hope that the committee will stand by the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> twice previously, but I think that nothing can be gained by prolonging this struggle between the two Houses. It is not worth while, particularly as the Government has said that it will consider the advisability of withdrawing this provision next session. I think that the other chamber showed a desire to compromise when it raised the amount by Â£300. That was a very substantial concession. It is recognized that the House of Representatives is paramount in financial matters. This chamber has asserted its right by rejecting the unfair measure that came before it last night. I think that we can very well rest on our laurels, and that we should not precipitate a contest that may not end favorably to us. </para>

I* prefer to legislate for human beings in preference to legislating for agricultural implements and beasts of burden, but I am not prepared to see the bill thrown out.

It may be stated that the present practice of establishing uniform- sugar prices (which places Fremantle in the same position as Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart) reduces the cost of sugar consumed by residents of Perth by fi 4s. 4d. per ton as compared with the usual trade -practice where all the freight from factory to consumers is added to the price of the goods. In the case . of sugar, the Sugar Board pays Â£1 4s. 4d. per ton of the freight from the refineries to Fremantle (which automatically involves sugar consumed in Perth and in almost all other parts of Western Australia). </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to express, on behalf of the Government, its appreciation of the assistance that honorable senators have rendered to bring .to a close a very strenuous session. I desire also to record our appreciation of the courtesy that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President</inline> and the Temporary Chairmen of Committees have always extended to Ministers and honorable senators generally, and 'of the .orderly manner in which the debates have been carried on. As I am aware that honorable senators are anxious to catch their trains, I shall not detain them, but I should like to express the appreciation of honorable senators generally of the work of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and of the courtesy that they have always received from the officers of the Senate. We  do  not always recognize our debt . of obligation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Monahan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. U'Ren.</inline> It is not to be understood that because I am brief in my remarks I do not thoroughly recognize the services these gentlemen have rendered. I trust that all honorable senators will enjoy a good holiday, meet their constituents and come back renewed in health and spirit. </para>

                        <para>. - I join with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in extending good wishes to the officers of the Senate and all concerned with the transaction of the business of the Senate, particularly those who cater for our personal comfort. The session has been to me a very strenuous one, and although it is not usual to voice any complaints on an occasion like this, I hope that we shall all live to see legislation dealt with in that deliberate way in which it should be dealt with, when no new bill will be brought down within one month of the close of a session. No man can live and thoroughly study two important bills a week. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in his expression of hope for the happiness and health of all honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Newland).</inline> - I am grateful to Ministers, to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner),</inline> and also to all honorable senators, for their uniform kind ness and courtesy to me during my temporary occupancy of the chair. All honorable senators have been most generous to me, and have shown me many manifestations of goodwill. The Clerks at the table have been most ready to render assistance to me, and the Temporary Chairmen of Committees have performed their tasks readily and willingly, relieving me of all anxiety on that score. I wish to thank the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff - no praise could induce them to do their work better- than they do it at the present time - members of the Library staff, and also the messengers in attendance in this chamber, and the household and refreshment room staffs, for their attention to the personal, needs of honorable senators. We have had a fairly strenuous session, and although political party feeling may have occasionally run somewhat high, I am confident that every honorable senator leaving this chamber to-day will have no , bitterness in his heart towards any other honorable senator on either side. One of the outstanding features of political life is that, while men may differ strenuously at times on political questions, such differences do not in any way interfere with their personal regard for one another. I join with the Leader of the Government in expressing the wish that all honorable senators will have a pleasant holiday, and when we come back we may, as the Leader of the Opposition hopes, have some reform in the method of bringing in legislation. </para>
