          <para>-(SenatorKingsmill). - The position when the Temporary <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman (Senator McDougall)</inline> left the chair on Friday was that the Minister had moved to agree to amendment No. 1 of the House ofRepresentatives, which amendment is to omit certain words and insert other words. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had moved to re-insert the words proposed to be omitted, viz.,  or  deputy  registrarin bankruptcy. &#34; I have now toput the question on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> motion, The carrying of his motion would not, in effect, be an amendment of the amendment made by the House of Representatives, but a disagreement with that part of such amendment as omits the words &#34; or  deputy  registrar in bankruptcy.&#34; The correct and most direct way to arrive at a decision is to put the question - &#34; That the committee agree to that part of amendment No. 1 of- the House of Representatives which omits the words &#39; or  deputy  registrar in bankruptcy.&#39; &#34; If the committee decides that question in the affirmative, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> motion is defeated. The committee can then proceed to a decision on the second part of the amendment of the House of Representatives, which is to insert certain words. I shall now put the question - That the committee agree to that part of amendment No. 1 of the House of Representatives which omits the words &#34; or  deputy  registrar in bankruptcy.&#34; </para>

          <para>. - The committee is entitled to know why this error occurred. It is impossible for every honorable senator to carry in his mind the effect of a clause upon other provisions in the bill, but the Minister should make a more definite statement. Unless it was intended to leave out paragrapha I cannot understand how it could have been left out. I think that the Minister should say who moved to have it omitted. </para>

          <para>. - I stated that it was omitted in error. If the honorable senator desires to place the responsibility upon me, I shall take no exception to that being done. Since this bill was first introduced there have been so many alterations that it has been impossible for anyone to follow them all. When the bill was before the Senate, 50 amendments were made, and we have here about 80 made by another place. Possibly 65 of them are of very little more importance that the crossing of a &#34; t &#34; or the dotting of an &#34; i &#34;..I agree with the honorable senator that having regard to the time that this bill has been before us it should be perfect when it finally leaves us. </para>

The courts having jurisdiction in bankruptcy under the bill will have certain judicial powers which could only be exercised by the registrar in violation of the Constitution. As  clause 23 stands at present, it purports to empower the court to delegate any of its powers, including presumably its judicial powers, to a registrar.

          <para>. The Minister&#39;s  explanation  appears to be that after this bill has been fifteen years before Parliament, and has passed through this Senate, some one finds out that something which has been passed is probably un constitutional, and for that reason amendments must be made in another place. I. know that the Minister is quite clear in his own mind as to the necessity for agreeing with the amendments of another place, but I am not quite so clear on that point. How could a matter of such importance have escaped the draftsman  in  the first place, and, later, the legal advisers of the Government? The error must have been detected by some of the keen legal minds of the Labour party  in  another place. Evidently the various governments during the last fifteen years discovered nothing of a doubtfully constitutional nature in the bill. </para>

          <para>. -  It  is  seldom that lawyers agree. In a lengthy measure such as this, it is possible that  a  number of further alterations could be found. A careful scrutiny of these amendments will show that for the most part they affect only the phraseology of the bill. While I agree with the honorable senator that it is a pity that so many alterations have been found necessary, I do not attribute that to any negligence on the part of any one. In none of these amendments are there any alterations of the principles which were discussed and agreed upon by us; all the amendments refer to small details which were discovered  on  the re-printing of the bill. </para>

Clause 24 relates to  the  powers that the registrar can exercise, but the amendment made in another place is to include a paragraph reading: - &#34; To exercise the powers of the court under section 62 of this act.&#34; Clause 62 deals with the powers of the official receiver, and I am wondering whether there will be any conflict between the powers of the official receiver and those of the registrar. The amendment before the committee gives the registrar all the powers contained in clause 62, and if the amendment is accepted, possibly the duties of the registrar will conflict with those of the official receiver. </para>

          <para>. -  The functions of the registrar have already been restricted to administrative duties, and this amendment is to give effect to that. It is the policy of the Government to restrict the powers of the registrar to administrative duties, and clause 62, to which attention has been directed, reserves that power to the court, except where the court gives the power to the official receiver.. In order to properly safeguard the position, paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">p, q,</inline> and r, which relate to judicial capacity, excepting where expressly delegated by the court under clause 62, have been left out. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that the preference provisions inserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith in the Queensland act against fraudulent practices have not found a place in this bill. However, this clause is a step towards the prevention of fraudulent preferences, and that fact modifies very considerably my regret that it does not go further. We are certainly not getting all we want in this legislation, but I think it highly desirable that it should be enacted without further delay. If in the course of time it is not found to work too well, or if anomalies are discovered in it, an amending bill can be brought down. </para>

          <para>. - There appears to be some anomaly as regards the fees. In clause 57 it is stated that the remuneration of the trustee shall, if the creditors so resolve, be in accordance with the prescribed scale, but under clause 58 the court may order the remuneration of a trustee to be increased if special services are rendered, or if special circumstances increase the difficulty of realization. It would be quite easy for a trustee to put up a very good case in support of a request for special remuneration. In my opinion, it would be safer for the fees to be as prescribed in clause 57. </para>

          <para>. - This amendment is faulty in construction, and, in practice, may be capable of wrong application. I can conceive of a case where the expenses of realization might be so heavy that there would bevery little prospect of the trustee getting his commission, but I think that is provided for in other clauses, and I dare say that no serious disability will be suffered by a trustee. But paragraphb is not well expressed. It provides that the remuneration of a trustee who carries on the business of a debtor shall be &#163;1 per centum on the turnover of the capital of the business.

          <para>. - I have considered the clause very carefully, and I am satisfied that it will meet all requirements. For the realization of a business the trustee&#39;s remuneration will be &#163;5 per centum, and for the conduct of the business, &#163;1 per centum on the turnover. There is also the collection of book debts, for which it is customary to allow 10 per cent., but this commission will not be paid in addition to 1 per cent. on the turnover of the capital of a business.

          <para>. - I consider that this amendment is not warranted, and call attention particularly to sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> Bankruptcy sometimes overtakes the artisan as well as the wealthy man. To put down the sum of &#163;50 to cover all the contingencies referred to in the sub-clause is ridiculous. The kit of tools required by a carpenter could not be purchased to-day under &#163;75 or &#163;100. If &#163;50 only is allowed, a man may have his tools of trade taken from him, and he will thus be unable to recover himself. He may have become bankrupt through circumstances entirely beyond his control, but under this new clause he would have no means of remedying his unfortunate positon. </para>

If we accept the argument of the Minister we should not mention any sum at all, but leave it entirely to the creditors to deal fairly and leniently with the debtor. But having stated a sura, it could as well be made &#163;100 as &#163;50. The Minister has adduced no solid argument against my amendment. It is my intention to test the feeling of the committee on this matter. </para>

If it is doubled, as desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> there will be nothing left for the; creditors in. many instances. The amendment opens the way for abuses to creep in. I know the class of debtor which the honorable senator has in mind, but there are very few cases of bona fide workers appearing before the Insolvency Court. Where they have so appeared, my experience has been that their tools of trade have been granted to them. In an estate where the assests are not -large - say, &#163;150 or &#163;200 - to exempt goods to the value of &#163;100 would leave little or nothing for the creditors. </para>

          <para>. - I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. I do that because of an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny,</inline> that in some of the state acts the amount allowed an insolvent in respect of tools of trade is &#163;30. When those acts were passed, &#163;30 would purchase more than &#163;100 to-day. What a tradesman could buy 25 years ago for 5s. would cost him 25s. to-day. At the close of my apprenticeship, after having served my . employer day and night for five years, I purchased a Mathieson smoothing plane for 4s. 9d. Recently I went into the establishment of one of the biggest firms in Sydney, and saw a similar plane offered for sale for 23s. 9d., and it was marked in the window as being specially cheap. That shows that we should not be acting generously iu making the amount &#163;100, as compared with the provision of &#163;30 when the acts to which the honorable senator has referred were passed. The clause does not exempt tools of trade to the value of &#163;50, that  amount also covers furniture and wearing apparel. It&#39; will operate most harshly on the man with the largest family. To provide furniture and clothing for a large family would cost a great deal more than &#163;50, to say nothing of the value of a man&#39;s kit of tools. What is left of my own kit could not be purchased to-day for &#163;100. I da not see why the Minister should hesitate to accept the amendment. I admit that some insolvents are &#34; crooks,&#34; but because of that we should not penalize the man who is endeavouring to &#34;play the game.&#34; Our present competitive system gives an advantage to the man who is not &#34;playing the game. </para>

            <para>- Honesty is not honesty if it is exercised only because it is the best policy. To be honest because it is profitable is not honesty at ali. This clause will not prevent a &#34;crook&#34; beating his creditors. Such a person will have neither tools of trade nor furniture. The &#34; crook &#34; gets off because he makes provision for escape. The person who will be affected is the honest man who is overtaken by misfortune, and who pays to his creditors all that he can. Most of .the poor are honest. We often hear it said of a person that he is &#34;poor, but honest,&#34; but wo never hear the term, &#34;rich, but honest.&#34; Many are poor because they are honest, and I think I can say that others are honest  because they are poor. The amendment should be accepted by the committee because to-day &#163;100 would not purchase more than could be purchased with &#163;20 or &#163;30 fifteen or twenty years ago, owing to the increased cost of commodities. It is easy to imagine the cost incurred by a father of seven or eight children in providing household furniture, clothing, and tools of trade. Some deserving men have failed because they have backed a bill for a friend, believing that it would be met when payment was due, and others because they have been depending on a crop which proved a failure. If we were to make the amount &#163;100 instead of &#163;50 the debtor would be in about the same position that a debtor was in some years ago, when commodities were obtainable at a lower rate. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the creditors can permit, a debtor to retain furniture of - a higher value, but with a limit of &#163;50 to cover wearing apparel, household furniture, and tools of trade, very little assistance is being afforded him. Under our present wicked system of society the frail in our midst are comparable with the weakest cattle in periods of drought - they are forced to the ground. A few years ago working men could rent a dwelling for from 12s. to 14s. a week, but to-day the cost of a similar habitation is 30s. or 40s. per week. In these circumstances a debtor should not be stripped of everything likely to be of any value to him. Under our bankruptcy and other laws, little protection is afforded the wife, who I think, should possess one-half of these assets because she has done her share in endeavouring to get the home together. There is, I know, a provision whereby the creditors can allow the debtor more if they so desire, but the needy or the greedy creditors will in some instances outvote the others, and extract the last shilling from the unfortunate debtor. I trust the Minister will agree to the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> particularly in view of the extra cost involved in replacing furniture and tools of trade. It will, of course, be said by some that debtors should exercise due precaution, and avoid getting into financial difficulties, but many people get into difficulties in endeavouring, to avoid them. I intend to support the amendment because I think &#163;100 to-day represents only a little more than did &#163;20 or &#163;30 some twenty years ago. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has apparently overlooked the fact that in this instance we are dealing only with a deed of arrangement, and that a deed of arrangement cannot be enforced without the debtor&#39;s consent. This clause does not take away the protection afforded the debtor by other provisions of the bill ; it must be assumed that anything done under this provision must be done with the debtor&#39;s consent. A debtor can safeguard himself by saying that he requires certain tools of trade and other articles to enable him to earn his living and to provide for his family. If thecreditors do not protect him in that way he can refuse to enter into a deed of arrangement. If that were done the creditors would then have to take proceedings in bankruptcy. The debtoris protected in another clause which deals with tools of trade and furniture, which do not enter into the distribution. I direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> attention to the fact that an alteration of the amount is not so important when we remember that under a deed of arrangement the debtor has the right to say what shall and what shall not be included. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> stated that the proposed new clause deals with a deed of arrangement, but it is clearly stipulated that furniture, wearing apparel, and tools of trade to the value of only &#163;50 shall be protected with a view to prevent bankruptcy court proceedings. To all intents and purposes the person concerned would be a bankrupt as he would be seeking an arrangement with his creditors. The debtor informs his creditors that he wishes to retain furniture, wearing apparel, and tools of trade to the value of &#163;50. </para>

          <para>. -  In ordinary circumstances I should have supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> because I think it necessary to protect a man who has been so unfortunate in his business that he has to enter into some arrangement with his creditors. We have to remember, however, that thisbill has been before another place, and if the committee does not accept the amendments now &#39;before it it is possible that we shall lose thebill, and I do not wish to assist in doing that. I agree with what the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has stated, that this is a voluntary matter under which a debtor is enabled to bargain with his creditors before he signs a deed of arrangement which is vital or binding upon him. Whilst I have every sympathy with an insolvent debtor, we have also to consider the unfortunate creditors who have to be protected against fraudulent acts on the part of a debtor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the paltry sum of &#163;50, and the extent to which such an amount could be employed in purchasing commoditiesat present-day value; but <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that these commodities would be taken at their second-hand value, and furniture for which &#163;100 or &#163;200had been paid would probably be coveredby the amount stipulated in the proposednew clause. The debtor would get the &#163;50 worth of tools of trade, andwhatever  household furniture a majority of the creditors determined to allow. I think we should leave the clause as it stands. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline>remarks had no bearing on the point at issue, because a deed of arrangement is practically an act of insolvency. The fact that this chamber originally provided for an amount of &#163;25, which was increased by the other place to &#163;50, is a proof that the Parliament considered that it should have a voice in the fixing of the amount. I want to show how little an insolvent will get. If a man, his wife and six children are left with one pair of boots each, the value of which is &#163;1 a pair, &#163;8 of the &#163;50 will be absorbed. Suppose that they are left with a suit of clothes for the father and sons, and one outfit for the mother of the value of &#163;5 each. </para>

            <para>- The difference between &#163;50 and &#163;100 is so slight that it will  scarcely have any effect in a bankrupt&#39;s estate. I recognize the force and the cogency of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> argument, but I point out to him that it applies equally to the creditor as to the debtor. The creditor need not enter into the arrangement if he thinks that too many things are exempt. I want to leave the margin a little wider, to enable a deed of arrangement to be entered into in cases in which it is not now possible. Special provision having been made in relation to household furniture, it must be quite clear that in these deeds of arrangement it will not be possible to make an additional allowance for tools and implements of trade, clothing, and matters of that kind. I think that if the amount were fixed at &#163;100 there would be a greater number of deeds oi arrangement and fewer insolvencies. I know that honorable senators realize that  in this bill are incorporated the insolvency laws under which the states&#39; are now operating. I do not see the necessity for adhering strictly to the provisions that were originally passed by the states. They have been in existence for very many years. One of the best acts that Queensland ever had was passed in 1885. A great deal of water has run under the bridge since then, and there has been an appreciable change in public opinion. There is now a better understanding between the creditor and the debtor. Measures such as this will receive only passing notice, because we are within measurable distance of the time when the Labour party will govern this country, and there will then be no more insolvents. When we make provision that production shall be for use and not for profit, insolvencies, with a great many other unpleasant things, will cease. When that happens I should like to be able to point to the fact that in this chamber there were ten men who were sufficiently kindly disposed to the unfortunate insolvents to leave them a reasonable amount of clothing, their implements of trade,- and a few sticks .of household  furniture.  What furniture will be left in the house if the amount is limited to &#163;50 ? Do honorable senators want to clean up a household to that extent? This misfortune very frequently strikes a most deserving section of the community, whose one offence has been that they have met with ill-health. I can picture sturdy, independent &#39;men who have lost their health by working harder than their fellows in order to get together a few sticks of furniture. The extra work has so weakened their systems that they have been stricken with a lingering illness, which has deprived them of their resources and finally has driven them into the insolvency court. Take the case of a small business that is depending for its prosperity upon the energies of one man. If by reason of illness he is removed from control for a few months the business may be mismanaged, and when he returns he is faced with insolvency. That is a frequent occurrence. Such a case has come to my knowledge. One of the finest business men that I have ever met died early in life. He had a big business, but his manager in a brief period brought it to insolvency because he bought old.-fashioned articles which he could not sell. These facts came to light after the insolvency. He did not suffer, because he received his commission on the goods that he bought. &#34;Why should the wife and family of a man suffer because he becomes insolvent? We ought to fix the. amount at &#163;100. That would permit a deed of arrangement to be entered into whereby the tools and implements of trade, and the clothing, would be allowed to remain in the possession of those to whom they belonged, without opening the door to wrong practices. Those who set out to defraud will not come under this provision; they will operate in a bigger way. They have experience of laws, and they know how to keep within the law. If they are not themselves acquainted with the law they consult a lawyer, and he instructs them how to keep within the law. </para>

          <para>. - I make a final appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment. Part XI. of the bill deals with bankruptcy, when the debtor is actually in the insolvency court. I find that clause 163 has the same wording in relation to bankruptcy that the amendment proposed by another place has in regard to a deed of arrangement. My request is not unreasonable. I think we should give these men a chance to make a fresh start in life. It cannot be contended that &#163;50 will cover the value of household goods, wearing apparel, and implements of trade. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to direct the attention of the committee to the conditions under which motor-car drivers are employed in the Federal Capital Territory. I am informed that, as compared with departmental drivers in Melbourne, they suffer certain disabilities, both as to wages and working conditions. Melbourne drivers get &#163;4 5s. per week, with ordinary overtime at the rate of 2a. 6d. per hour; and 3s. 6d. per hour on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. In addition, on five days a week they get time and. a quarter for all time worked before and after ordinary working hours, also a child endowment allowance of 5s. a week for each child. Motor drivers in the Federal Capital Territory get ordinary time for five days a week, and time and a half on Saturdays and Sundays. They are paid &#163;411s. a week, with overtime at1s.10&#190;d. per hour, except on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, when the overtime rate is 2s. 10&#188;d. per hour. They are only paid for actual driving time. They claim that they should be paid from starting time to finishing time, as in Melbourne. I am not complaining of the wages and conditions enjoyed by motor drivers in Melbourne. I wish drivers in the Federal Territory to be placed in the same position. At present they are unjustly treated. If a man is instructed to leave Canberra for Yass to meet the train coming from Melbourne, he has to get up early in the morning,, long before the ordinary starting time, and on the outward journey he will leave Canberra after the ordinary knock-off time for the day. He should be paid for all waiting time. Frequently, although he. may be only driving for an hour or an hour and a half after the ordinary knock-off time, he does not reach his home until 9 o&#39;clock at night. I ask the Ministerto ascertain whether or notthe position is as I have stated. I have been very careful in making my inquiries, and have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information supplied to me. I hope that the Minister will at least give to the motor drivers in the Federal Capital Territory the same conditions as obtain in Melbourne. </para>

          <para>. - I shall certainly make the inquiries which have been suggested, but I desire to disabuse the honorable senator&#39;s mind of his misconception of the position. The wages at Canberra are not fixed in relation to wages in Melbourne, but in relation to the wages paid in New South Wales. If we commence with the chauffeurs, and place them on the same footing as men similarly employed in Melbourne, the result may be beneficial to them, but I am inclined to think that the innovation would not be looked upon with favour by others employed at Canberra. In many occupations the wages paid in Sydney are higher than those paid in Melbourne. The question is : Are these men receiving the rate of pay that is recognized in New South Wales, or in Sydney, as the rate of pay for that particular class of labour? </para>

            <para>- Those matters will also have to be looked at from the same point of view. It must be remembered that these men are not permanent employees of the Commonwealth Government. If there is any discrepancy between the rates of pay, it does not follow that in adjusting them the rates will be fixed in relation to the wages paid is Melbourne. Further, I remind the honorable senator that there is an industrial tribunal appointed for Canberra. That tribunal was appointed by myself some time ago, after consultation with the union at Canberra. All workers at the Federal Capital other than members of the public service have the right to appeal to that tribunal. As these chauffeurs are not members of the public service, they have that right to appeal. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to refer to the Port AugustaOodnadatta railway. A few evenings ago the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> made a very interesting statement in this chamber regarding the future development of the Northern Territory. When the Commonwealth Government took over the Northern Territory, it also accepted certain obligations, one of which was to complete the North-South railway. The people of South Australia were under the impression that the Commonwealth Government was committed to the completion of the line from Oodnadatta to the line then running from Darwin to Pine Creek. That line has since been extended from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. Probably soma people in South Australia still entertain the hope that the line will eventually link Oodnadatta with the present terminus at the Katherine River, but I do not think that any honorable senator who heard the statement of the Minister will any longer be of that opinion. At any rate, the impression conveyed to my mind by his remarks was that some other route was contemplated. I understand that an arangement has been entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia, whereby the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta line will in future be run by the Commonwealth Government, and that the rolling-stock,- as well as the workshops, will also be under Commonwealth control. Should the Government decide upon some route other than the linking up of Oodnadatta with the present terminus at the Katherine River, I should like to know what is its future policy regarding the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. Is it proposed to continue it as a separate line or are further extensions contemplated 1 </para>

          <para>. - I have nothing to add to my previous statement in this connexion, except that the Government is at present negotiating with the Government of South Australia, and that those negotiations have now reached the stage which necessitates a further communication being sent to the South Australian Government before the Prime Minister can make a statement to Parliament as to the position. It is hoped that it will be possible for him to make a statement very shortly. Any proposal will, of course, require parliamentary sanction. One thing is clear, namely, that the Commonwealth Government is under an obligation to continue the running of the railway between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta. The present arrangement is that from the 1st January next the Commonwealth Government will run the railway instead of, as in the past, allowing it to be run by the South Australian Railways Commissioners, and merely meeting the loss at the end of the year. </para>

My complaint refers to the refreshment station at Eurelia, in South Australia. It is the most disgraceful refreshment station on the whole route. People coming from other countries find at Eurelia a state of affairs which does Australia no credit. Something should be done to cause the South Australian railway authorities to make this refreshment room more in accordance with the demands of a civilized community, so that people travelling to and from Western Australia may be able to obtain a decent mealamidst reasonably comfortable surroundings. I have no complaint respecting the other refreshment rooms on the route, but for the sake of the travelling public, and especially in the interests of women and children, the existing state of affairsshould be remedied. </para>

        <para class="block">Government which acquired it. Some time ago, when the railway was under discussion, we were informed that the system under which the railway was then operating waa unsatisfactory, and that the Commonwealth Government intended to make such drastic alterations that not only would the deficit be reduced, but the service would be improved. Notwithstanding this promise, three days are occupied in travelling from Adelaide to Oodnadatta, as the trains do not travel at night. The total deficit since the line has been under Commonwealth control amounts to approximately &#163;1,500,000. If the railway were in any other state, the debt would have to be borne by the taxpayers. </para>

            <para>- It seems outrageous that the Commonwealth should be compelled to carry this burden year after year. I ask the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson),</inline> as a representative of South Australia, if he thinks it fair that the Commonwealth should be asked to conduct the unprofitable railway between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> at one time, when he occupied the seat that is now occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> severely criticized the then government on the ground that it did not exercise economy. No honorable senator would criticise more strongly than he would such an action as this if any state other than South Australia were affected. We should have from the Minister a. statement showing why we are asked to vote this year &#163;101,835 moTe than was voted last year in. connexion with this railway, which properly belongs to the State of South Australia. South Australia is the only state that has had the audacity to foist on the Commonwealth Government its non-paying railways. The other states carry their own burdens. Western Australia, too, has not done badly out of the Commonwealth, because many miles of the transcontinental railway run through its territory. </para>

          <para>. - There is no real increase in the expenditure on the Oodnadatta railway, because hitherto the Commonwealth, has been paying the loss on the railway, and thus its estimates did not show the revenue that was received. The Commonwealth proposes to take over the running of the railway from the 1st January next, and it is necessary to make provision in these Estimates. The loss incurred on the line is not received from South Australia until after the close of their financial year. We, therefore, have to provide for the loss on running for eighteen months, and also for the cost of running for six months. On the revenue side we are able to show the receipts. In the Loan Appropriation Bill the sum of &#163;240,000 is provided for capital expenditure on this line. Of that sum, &#163;200,000 will be required for the purchase of new locomotives and rollingstock when the Commonwealth takes over the line, which is- at present operated by the South Australian railway department on behalf of the Commonwealth. It is considered that a substantial saving will be effected when the line is worked by the Commonwealth railways branch. A conservative estimate of that saving is &#163;22,000 per annum. Notice of the termination of the agreement between the two governments has been served by the Commonwealth. The saving that will be effected when the line is controlled by the Commonwealth department has been very carefully investigated. The Chief Engineer of Ways and Works, and the Chief Mechanical Engineer, Port Augusta, both of whom are acquainted with the railway and the conditions appertaining thereto&#34;, have reviewed the cost of maintaining the permanent way and works, as well as the operating cost. An analysis of costs has also been made by the Comptroller of Accounts and Audit- </para>

        <para class="block">Interest at the rate of 5$ per cent, on the &#163;200,000 which it is proposed to expend in the purchase of new locomotives and rolling-stock will represent &#163;11,000 per annum. The interest that is at present being paid on the capital value of the rolling-stock the property of the South Australian railways is in the vicinity of &#163;7,000 per annum. The line will be equipped with new and efficient rollingstock, and the net annual saving to the Commonwealth will be &#163;20,000. It is also considered that numerous other savings, upon which it is difficult to place a money value, can be effected. The elimination of the handling charge of approximately 3 per cent, that is levied by the South Australian Supply and Tender Board upon all stores and materials that are used on this line, and the railage for 235 miles, from Adelaide to Quorn, on most of the issues, will be possible. The department has a stores suspense account, and could supply direct from Port Augusta all the materials that are required for the line. </para>
        <para>In reply to the other question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I may state that apparently the South Australian Government was not throwing open for lease the pastoral lands alongside lie line. The Commonwealth Government made numerous representations to the South Australian Government to have those lands surveyed and thrown open for selection. I am in the happy position that I can inform the honorable senator that at present those lands are open for selection, and are being taken up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> has informed me that the result has been an appreciable increase in the traffic on the transcontinental railway. That fact, combined with the development in land settlement that is proceeding in Western Australian territory, made the receipts from the line during the last quarter, for the first time in the history of the line, greater by a few thousand pounds than the working expenses. If honorable senators consult the railway report, which was tabled to-day, they will see that there has been a gradual improvement during the last two or three years. It is hoped that if that improvement continues, and land settlement expands, the line will before long be a payable proposition. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline>stated that the &#34;Western Australian Government had accepted the obligation &#39; to build a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. That is not quite the position. An offer was made by a Western Australian Government some years ago, before the transcontinental railway was authorized  by the Commonwealth Parliament, that if the Commonwealth would agree to construct a transcontinental railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie within a given time - which was named - it would undertake to construct a railway of the same gauge from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. The transcontinental&#39; railway was not constructed within the period fixed by the offer, which therefore lapsed. </para>

          <para>. -  I should like some information from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> with regard to the line between Yass Junction and Canberra. For a time I believed that it was the work\ of the New South Wales Government to construct a line from the main- southern line to the boundary of the Federal Capital Territory. From recent reports in the press, however, it; appears that there is .a probability of the Commonwealth being asked to defray the cost of the construction of that line. If the Commonwealth is- toconstruct it, is it proposed to impose what is known as a betterment tax - a somewhat one-sided scheme of land value taxation which, though unsatisfactory, is better than no land value taxation? </para>

On the other hand, there is the resolution of the House of Representatives- that the line from Yass to Canberra should be constructed. The Government has not yet had time to investigate these conflicting recommendations and to decide which it shall ask Parliament to approve. It has not concluded that the time has arrived for the construction of the line from Yass to Canberra. Whatever decision is come to, the Government will have to seek parliamentary authority before it can act. </para>

I believed that not only was a promise given, but that there was an understanding within recent years that the Commonwealth should find the money for the construction of that line. I was under the impression that when the Commonwealth spent from &#163;4,000,000 to &#163;6,000,000 on the transcontinental railway Western Australia would immediately link up. </para>

I can quite understand that nothing seems good after the excellent catering provided on the Commonwealth section of the East-West Railway. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> seemed to think when I questioned him about South Australia having to contribute towards the construction of the Grafton to South Brisbane railway, that I was obliged to take part in the game of securing for New South Wales advantages at the expense of other states. </para>

            <para>- The sooner we get away from the present system of calling upon other states to come to the assistance of any particular state the better. I see no reason why New South Wales should expect a small contribution from Tasmania, Western Australia, Queensland, or South Australia towards the building of a railway within its own borders, or the conservation of water in the Murray Valley. Commonwealth money should not be expended on such works. The Commonwealth Government has sufficient functions to carry out without embarking on such undertakings. If it devoted its energies to a reduction of the war debt it would be doing better work than by attempting to help the states out of their present difficulties, or to assist New South Wales and Queensland to build a railway. I could understand the Commonwealth intervening if the proposal were to make a military railway running from Brisbane through to Perth, but it is wrong for the states to ask the Commonwealth Treasurer for money for purely state purposes. My voice will always be raised against the continuance of such a pernicious principle. </para>

Information supplied to the Public Works Committee, of which until recently I was a member, suggested that owing to the high cost of construction and expensive furnishings, the tariff would be very high; so high, indeed, that it may be necessary for Parliament, at an early date, to authorize substantial increasesin the allowances paid to members. </para>

          <para>. - I am able to report that substantial progress isbeing made with the erection of the public buildings in Canberra. Honorable senators will have seen in the Library a photograph of the provisional Parliament House. At the end of last month the walls were up to the roof level. I understand that the building is now ready for roofing, and that it will be ready for the meeting of the new Parliament. Concerning the hostel, I have recently been making inquiries in order to get a definite date for its occupation, because upon this will depend the date of the first sale of Canberra city leases. Accommodation must be available for intending buyers. The Works and Railways Department informs me that the hostel will be ready by about the end of November. We are now inviting applications for the leasing of the place. Until an offer has been accepted we shall not be able to indicate what the tariffwill be. I regret that I am unable to supply the figures dealing with the cost of the hostel. That  is provided for in the  Loan Bill, and as </para>

However, I shall endeavour to obtain it, and let the honorable senator know. The Public Works Committee has had the erection of the secretariat building under consideration. I understand that a recommendation has been made, and that the necessary steps to authorize its construction are being taken in another place. As  thi3  will not be a very large building, it ought to be ready when Parliament meets at Canberra. </para>

          <para>. -  I listened with interest to the remarks made by honorable senators about the various railways under the control of the Commonwealth, and I was particularly interested in the statement that the East-West line, during the last quarter for which returns have been made available, was paying working expenses. That statement, however, hardly sets out the position. The railway cost the Commonwealth over &#163;6,000,000, upon which there is an interest charge of at least 4J per cent, or 5 per cent. It ought to be made clear that whilst the railway may be paying working expenses, it certainly is not paying interest on capital cost. In my opinion the time has come when the Government should seriously consider taking over control of the whole of the railways in the Commonwealth. It is unfair that we should be saddled with some of the worst-paying propositions, and that the best-paying railways should be in the hands of state authorities. There is now a proposal to vote a sum of &#163;3,500,000 for the construction of a new railway line between Kyogle and South Brisbane. </para>

            <para>- If the- principle were applied to that line, the tax imposed on land for 25 to 30 miles on each side of the railway would be only a nominal impost and would be amply justified, as also would a betterment tax on the suggested line from Yass Junction to Canberra. . Since the railways, at present controlled by the Commonwealth are likely to be non-paying for some considerable time, the Commonwealth should take steps immediately to take over control of all the railways in Australia and proceed with the unification of gauges, not in piecemeal fashion, but in a general way. When I was at Port Augusta some years ago, I saw in store there a large number of armchairs- of antiquated design. Since then several of the chairs have been placed in the Commonwealth offices in Sydney. I hope that the same kind of furniture will not be foisted on members of Parliament at Canberra. They are not to be found in any of the departmental offices. Apparently they are retained for the use of Federal members. I trust that when the furnishing of the Federal members&#39; rooms at Canberra is under consideration, furniture of a more up-to-date and more suitable design will be chosen. </para>

I have been there on one or two occasions as a member of the Public Accounts Committee. On the last occasion I was amazed at the evidence of all-round progress. The rate of progress on the provisional parliamentary building gives the lie direct to those who declare that day labour is slow labour. The same remarks apply to the work on the hostel. I believe that the provisional Parliament House will be ready by the end of 1925, but it must be remembered that we shall have to provide for a large number of officials. If the Government&#34; intends that Parliament shall meet at Canberra immediately after the next federal election, it will have to expedite the work of providing the necessary accommodation. </para>

            <para>- I saw the cottages provided for the workmen, but they are not very creditable from the point of view of the accommodation provided. A number of wooden huts built by Hudson have been brought from Sydney for the artisans engaged on the building of Parliament House, but those huts are no credit to the Commonwealth Government. As they have <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> brick chimneys there is no place for a fire in the winter time. While at Canberra, I visited the grave of General Bridges, and adjacent to it I noticed the residence provided for the five civil employees of the Duntroon College. These men had their wives and five children with them. The word &#34; hovel &#34; would be a dignified term to apply to their place of abode. It is wrong that the civil employees of the college should be housed in such a place. The establishment contains five families, but it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> not fit for a man and his wife, without children. The Minister should see that something is done at once to provide healthy accommodation for these employees. Their present accommodation is not fit to house a dog. </para>

          <para>. -  One cannot wonder that the EastWest railway does not pay. It practically starts nowhere, and ends nowhere. The Government should build a line from Hay to Port Augusta, so that  the states conic connect their railways with it. As in a few years&#39; time the Murray valley will be. thickly populated, the line would soon be a paying one. We cannot expect any line to pay while it is incomplete. In a very short time we shall also have the KyogleBrisbane line, which will pass through some of the finest country in Australia. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that that is not a national line. The states have a railway to Murwillumbah, and another from Coolangatta to Brisbane, which serve their purpose. The Kyogle to Brisbane railway, being a national line, should be constructed forthwith of  .4  ft.  8^  in. gauge. Personally, I should never build the North-South railway, but should prefer to construct a line from Bourke to connect with the present line running south from Darwin. That line also should be of  4  ft.  8J  in. gauge. The Queensland lines could then be continued out to meetit, and it would be only a short time be fore we had a  4  ft.  8J  in. line to Darwin. Such a line would pass through some of the best sheep and cattle country in Australia. At present, because the line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie is incomplete, the&#39; expenses are much greater than they should be. The Government should proceed at once with the line from Port Augusta to Hay. </para>

          <para>.- When I was at Canberra about ten months ago, I noticed that the Public Works Department was covering over some of the brickwork in the buildings with rough-cast, and then colouring it white. Judging by appearances, the bricks made at Canberra are equal to the best obtainable in Australia, and one would imagine that they could be used to make both a pleasing, and a satisfactory job. I cannot, therefore, understand why the Works and Railways Department should cover them with rough-cast. Looking down on the city  f  from the surrounding country, the houses appear to be like a lot of glorified cowsheds.  Adb fu  from their unsatisfactory appearance, the upkeep of these whitewashed houses is greater than if they, were constructed of struck brickwork. I consider that handsome brick cottages have been spoiled by this action of the department. </para>

          <para>. -  Bungalows and cottages, when constructed of bricks, should have cavity walls and struck brickwork. These abortions - I can call them nothing else - which have been foisted upon Canberra by the officers of the department, are a standing disgrace to the Federal Capital. I can find no words strong enough to condemn them. Brickwork, when properly struck, is always pleasing to look upon. We know that rough-cast is frequently used to cover up poor materials or bad workmanship, but that is not the case at Canberra. Apart from their unsightly appearance, the cottages have been badly designed, both as regards their external appearance and their internal arrangement. I shall welcome the day when the Government makes building  sites at Canberra, available, so that other people may have the opportunity to show what can be done with the bricks produced there. From the way in which they are covered up, one would imagine that they are of inferior quality, but we know that that is not so. I trust that the &#34;Minister will see that work of this kind is stopped immediately. </para>

            <para>- It enables inferior or careless brickwork to be covered up, so that it will escape detection. I cannot understand how any officer who knows his business can tolerate such work. It is a wonder that rough-cast has not been used in connexion with the new Houses of Parliament. I understand, however, that some departure from clean struck brickwork is contemplated even there. If so, it is a very great mistake. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to express my dissatisfaction with the amounts paid and promised by the Government for losses incurred in connexion with the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. As this is a national matter, there has been a considerable agitation to endeavour to get the Commonwealth Government to bear the whole of the loss incurred, as it is thought that the expense should not be borne by the people of Western Australia. The Commonwealth has agreed to pay onehalf of the value of the stock destroyed, and the amount paid to date is &#163;14,448. Approximately &#163;6,000 to &#163;7,000 has still to be paid, the accounts for which have not yet been received. After the outbreak occurred an agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the then Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline><inline font-style="italic">James</inline> Mitchell, under which compensation was to be paid on a 50-50 basis. The sum of &#163;7.000 was granted by the&#62; Government, of which only &#163;4,500 has been paid, leaving &#163;2,500 which, in addition to the &#163;10,000 also promised for economic losses, and which has not yet been paid, brings the total up to &#163;12,500. The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was deputed by the Cabinet to visit Western Australia to assist in stemming the tide of this dread disease, in order to protect, not only the herds in. Western Australia, but also those in the eastern states. Up to a certain point the Minister rendered very valuable service, but the Government and the people of Western Australia consider that as it was a national matter the Commonwealth Government should have defrayed the whole of the expenditure in meeting compensation claims. The Government promised to pay &#163;10,000 for economic losses, but the claims received by the department under this heading total &#163;44,000, of which the sum actually paid to date amounts to only &#163;19,000. Considering the unsatisfactory state of the finances of Western Australia, it is the duty pf tha Commonwealth Government to assist the people in that state by paying the full amount.

            <para>- It is a mistake on the part of some honorable senators to be continually fanning the flame of dissatisfaction and discontent, particularly as the Government have done what they consider to be just. The sum of &#163;14,000 has already been paid. Provision has been made for the payment of &#163;8,000 and also for the payment of &#163;4,500 in connexion with the destruction of crops; although there was no moral obligation on the Government to pay anything. It is reasonable to assume that if the Commonwealth Government met the whole of the expenditure in this connexion, other claims of a far-reaching character would doubtless be made by other states from time to time. I repeat what I have already stated - that had I been administering the department when this matter was considered, I would not have been in favour of paying as large a sum as has been paid. As honorable senators are aware, the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> visited Western Australia and handled the whole situation in a very able manner. </para>

            <para>- It is easy to say that a further sum should be paid, but the Government have to consider the interests of other taxpayers in the Commonwealth. The Government in the first place appointed a committee to control the distribution of &#163;10,000, but as that was considered unsatisfactory, the Government requested the Western Australian Government to appoint a committee to allot the &#163;10,000. Notwithstanding this, a request was received from the Western Australian authorities to the effect that the Commonwealth should appoint the committee to allot payments. During the influenza epidemic, the Western Australian Health authorities quarantined the passengers and crew of a trans-Australian train and utilized the cars, including the dining car, for victualling arrangements. As a result of this action, the Commonwealth preferred a claim against the Government of Western Australia for &#163;3,113 12s. 5d., the details of which were as follows :  - </para>

It then endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to induce the Western Australian Government to conduct the inquiry. I urge honorable senators to leave this matter with the department. It will have to make the next move. I give my assurance that it will do the just and the equitable thing. </para>

The whole question is, was this a national danger? To the press, when he returned to Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said most emphatically that it was. He rejoiced because the disease had been checked and confined to one state; and in unmistakable language he said that had it got abroad it would have sounded the death-knell of the great pastoral industry of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> with heroic gestures, has told us that very nearly &#163;40,000 has been made r available by the Commonwealth Government.

My belief is that, when losses are due to action by the Quarantine Department to keep disease out of Australia, it is an Australian affair, and, no matter where the action is taken, the Commonwealth should pay for the whole of the direct loss. If the Commonwealth had conducted its quarantine operations upon any just system, if it had not made this a haphazard job. and made an act of grace of what should have been an act of right, there would have been no controversy. I believe that the direct losses amount to about &#163;41,000 </para>

I am endeavouring to- help him out of a very real difficulty, but he refuses to be helped. As a matter of fact, I understand that he approves of my system, whereby these direct losses would be paid by the Commonwealth, and the indirect losses - some of which are extremely ridiculous - would be dealt with by the State Government. If that course were adopted it would be found that the Commonwealth had about &#163;2,000 more to pay to cover the direct losses that have been approved by investigating committees. I do not want Western Australia to get any more than she is entitled to. My request is not an impudent one.

The present state of affairs is largely due to the fact that we have not a definite system for operating our quarantine legislation.

          <para>. -  I should not have intervened in this discussion except for the fact that the Labour party in Western Australia, instead of being sincere in their desire to get some additional compensation for the people of the state for the destruction of cattle and other losses arising out of the rinderpest outbreak, have sought to use the outbreak as a club with which to belabour me and other honorable senators on this side of the chamber. The last issue of the Labour paper in Western Australia contains n cartoon depicting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Senator Lynch,</inline> and myself as standing before the Treasury, &#34;and preventing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill, Senator Needham,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham,</inline> representing the people of Western Australia, from getting at it. That is the sort of rubbish which is being circulated all over Western Australia, suggesting to the people of the state, that the senators who have to go up for election on the next occasion are preventing them from getting their just dues. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> are honest they will admit that no one in this Senate has worked harder than Senators Pearce, Lynch, and I have to try to get justice for the people of Western Austrafia in this regard. But when a comparatively unimportant matter is used as a club with which to strike me I propose to hit back. My view has always been very similar to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill.</inline> The money already offered by the Commonwealth to the Government of Western Australia for distribution among the people who suffered from the outbreak of rinderpest is just about equal to the total amount claimed by those who suffered direct losses. Obviously, the Commonwealth, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> says, can have nothing to do with&#34; fancy &#34; claims. Heaven knows where it- would end if it did. Excluding the balance of the &#163;7,000 already mentioned, namely, &#163;2,500, the actual amount placed at the disposal of .the Government of Western Australia is &#163;36,500. Including the &#163;2,500, the total is &#163;39,000, whereas the total amount claimed is &#163;41,000. The Commonwealth Government has given so generously in this regard that it has practically made available to the State Government, and the people of Western Australia the total amount of the direct losses. Tet my friends, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham,</inline> allied with the Labour Government of Western Australia, endeavour to make political capital out of this question. </para>

            <para>- He is honest enough to admit that the Western Australian Labour party is probably making political capital out of that which is not a party matter. If the figures are examined, it will be seen that a very large measure of justice has been done. Nov/, let me examine the position in regard to quarantine generally. The Government of Western Australia would resent very quickly any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth Parliament to exercise the powers which it undoubtedly has under the quarantine provisions in the Constitution Act, and deprive them of all their quarantine powers or their control over the administration of health. If they insist on maintaining their own control in these matters, then they cannot complain when they are asked to pay half the losses incurred in combating an outbreak such as that which has recently visited their state. That is all they have been asked to do. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on behalf of tha Commonwealth Government asked the then State Government what they wanted in this connexion all they asked for was that the Commonwealth should bear half the cost. </para>

            <para>- Yet the honorable senator is now complaining, although the Commonwealth Government has conceded everything that the then Government of Western Australia asked for, and, in addition, as a consequence of representations made by Western Australian senators, and particularly&#39; Senators Pearce, Lynch, and myself, has placed at the disposal of the people of Western Australia sums amounting to&#39; &#163;8,000, &#163;10,000, and &#163;7,000. Obviously, this move on the part of honorable senators is nothing but an attempt to make political capital out of a thing which gives no ground for such an attempt, and which in the interests of the people concerned should not be used for party purposes. I hope that when the people of Western Australia realize the true facts the action honorable senators opposite have taken will, like a boomerang, catch them in the comeback. </para>

Although I have always been engaged in an endeavour to stop the states from dipping into the Commonwealth Treasury, I have never had the luck to be depicted in a cartoon keeping the people back from the Commonwealth Treasury.  Every time that Stale Governments have put out their hands for assistance I have raised my voice in opposition. My friends opposite do not mind giving away anything from the Treasury.  The latest move I have heard of is that they propose to give &#163;5,000 to some &#34; loyalists &#34; who participated in an attempt to break down unionism in 1917. When that question comes before the Senate will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> again be found defending the Treasury - preventing these men from helping themselves to &#163;5,000? </para>

            <para>- I admit that I am, and I think the honorable senator is. Very few of us can see the truth in anything, particularly if we allow ourselves to become bitter partisans. No one suffers in that respect more than I do. The honorable senator claims that an attempt is being made to put him in a false position by depicting him in a cartoon, but it will be the best advertisement he can have on the next occasion he is a candidate for election to this Senate. I.shall probably be in the same position as the honorable senator in a few days. I shall be forcing certain people of New South Wales back from dipping their hands into the Commonwealth Treasury. I shall lay myself open to be cartooned as a man who will not let &#163;5,000 be circulated among good &#34; loyalists.&#34; Honorable senators opposite call them loyalists, but we regard them as &#34; scabs,&#34; although that is a term I do not like using. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has told us that when another outbreak threatened Western Australia the government of that state appropriated Commonwealth property and refused to allow the Commonwealth to interfere. He also told us that when the Commonwealth presented its bill to the state government, if was only met to the extent of onethird. But two wrongs do not make a right. There was a short-sighted National Government in power in the state at the time, and there was a National Government in control of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I can believe that both governments were wrong. In any case, I do not know that the state government is to be condemned for retaining the control of quarantine in its own hands, and taking drastic steps to protect the people of the state from a plague that originated in the eastern states. </para>

            <para>- When it comes to paying we&#34; are up against the same old problem. The time is long overdue when the Commonwealth and the State Governments should come to some arrangement acceptable to all concerned. I venture to say that, even after our experience of the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia, if another outbreak occurred to-morrow, either there or in another state, we should have the same muddle owing to divided authority. I wish to make it quite clear that no one wishes to make political capital out of this matter at the expense of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> He will have a sufficiently heavy load to bear at the next election without any addition to it. The fact that he is Government Whip should alone be sufficient to destroy his chances of re-election. </para>

But there is an important principle involved in this question. When the matter came before Parliament several months ago I contended, without any suggestion of party feeling, that the obligations of the Government should be so clearly recognized that self-interest would induce people to report immediately the outbreak of any disease that threatened the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. -  Perhaps I may be permitted, as briefly as possible, again to explain my attitude to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I have spoken three or four times on the rinderpest outbreak, and possibly what I am saying now will not be the last word on this subject. This is a matter which, if properly arranged, should settle itself automatically. The direct losses in any case should be paid by the Commonwealth, but not the indirect losses, which in this case are referred to as the economic losses. All losses are economic. No  Government should be expected to pay for indirect losses. A man who has had his cattle slaughtered or property destroyed is, perhaps, unable to pay his bills.  His  creditors are indirect losers, as also are their creditors. Thus the effect is felt to the uttermost edges of the community. This is a matter that should be simple of adjustment. As a last word, let me say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> that I did not draw the cartoon in question. </para>

          <para>- No. The State Government should have paid reasonable compensation. I agree with the honorable senator that the Commonwealth and State Governments should decide upon some equitable scheme to deal with all such outbreaks. I venture to say that hundreds of thousands of pounds, have&#39; been spent by private individuals in combating the various diseases which have affected both crops and animals, but they have received not one farthing, by way of compensation. Only those who have raised cattle in the northern portions of Australia know of the thousands of pounds which have been spent in combating the cattle-tick pest. Similarly, only those connected with sheep raising know of the money which has been spent in dealing with the blowfly pest. The same remark applies to many other pests which have been introduced into Australia. We were informed that the Institute of Science and Industry was formed to deal with these things. Although I did not have much faith in the institution, because of the way in which it was created, and of those &#34;who were connected with it, I hoped that it would do something of a useful nature. Unfortunately, our hopes in that direction have not been realized. </para>

            <para>- I feel that Western Australia has been treated too  generously  by the Commonwealth Government in regard to this matter. Other states have spent thousands of pounds in combating pests, but they themselves have borne the burden. This is the first time that the Commonwealth Government hae provided public money to meet a claim of this- nature. If we are to recognize the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, we should get down to bedrock and formulate some proper scheme, to be followed in the event of similar outbreaks in the future. We should not dip our hands into the public treasury, and hand over to a state large sums of money merely because some members of this Parliament ask for it. Senators Pearce, Drake-Brockman, and Lynch have been depicted in a cartoon circulated in Western Australia, as keeping back those who desire to raid the Commonwealth Treasury, and I say that, they are entitled to credit for so doing. When that cartoon is seen by the people of Western Australia it will not have the effect that some people anticipate. Instead of injuring those .honorable senators it will lead the people to realize that in them <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> have representatives in this Parliament who are determined to do their duty. The result will he that those honorable senators will retain their positions as .members of the Senate. </para>

It was, therefore, taken in the interests of the people of Australia as a whole, and the expense should be borne by the Commonwealth . </para>

            <para>- The action was taken to prevent the spread of the disease. If it was considered that there was no possibility of the disease extending, why was such drastic action taken? Was it only to get the state out of the difficulty in which it was placed? When the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> returned from Western Australia, he stated that the action taken was to prevent the disease from spreading to the other states. So long as I have the privilege of sitting in this chamber, I shall give the fullest and the most sympathetic consideration to requests that come from the different states. Had a request come from the Queensland Government on behalf of the cotton-growersof that state, who suffered loss by the action taken to prevent the spread of the boll worm, I would have given it my earnest consideration. Where a state government takes action to wipe out a pest which might possibly extend to the other states, we are entitled to compensate those who suffer loss thereby. I heartily support the request which has come from Western Australia. I do not think, however, that the Government is entitled to shovel out public money to the people who make the claims ; it should first make the fullest and most careful investigation into those claims. </para>

          <para>. -  I have listened with considerable interest to the speeches that have been delivered on this subject. I cannot but feel that our quarantine methods in Australia are very unsatisfactory. We have had the misfortune to have an outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia. Had the tsetse-fly, with its capacity for inoculating our people with the trymponosome - the causative agent of that dread scourge known as sleeping sickness, which produced such devastation in South Africa - come among us, the position would have been much worse. It is absolutely essential that, in matters of quarantine, we should be in the position to deal with any outbreak. The Govern  ment should immediately take this matter in hand, and place the quarantine on an effective basis. One step has been taken, but, if necessary, 100 steps should be taken to make the laws effective. I agree with the statements that have been made from the Ministerial bench regarding payment for the direct losses sustained by reason of the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. That is a sound economic principle. I remember that, some years ago, I did some analytical work for a milk vendor, and had to attend a case in the court. In making certain observations in relation to the case on behalf of my client, I showed that one of the biggest dairying industries in England adopted the practice that, where any of their suppliers had a cow in his. herd which showed a positive result from a tuberculin test, and he immediately notified the factory, he was then credited with the amount of milk or cream he would have obtained from that cow. so that he should not be the loser by his action, and the factory would maintain the purity of its supply. That is a sound principle. I know of a person in Tasmania who had an orchard of peach trees from which he obtained his livelihood. An inspector said that the trees were affected with the San Jose scale, and that the trees must all be rooted out. He was an old man, but he received no compensation at all. I do not think that that was right, nor do I think the sugges-. tion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> is right. If a man&#39;s capital invested in the cotton industry is destroyed, as the result of action taken for the eradication of a pest, he should be compensated. We need to be very careful how we deal with this matter. I can readily understand that, if it were dealt with in a wholesale way, the &#163;62,000.000 which the Commonwealth annually receives in revenue would not be sufficient to compensate the whole of the people of Australia for indirect losses due to these visitations. In determining the compensation to be paid in connexion with the outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia, those who suffered as a result of it should not be over-generously treated, but they should be justly treated in respect of their direct economic losses. The Senate should be concerned, not so much with the payment of a few thousand pounds to sufferers from the outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia, but with the far more important question of whe ther or not the Government is going to make quarantine effective in Australia. Many pests might be introduced inimical to life, to economy, to agriculture, and other industries, and unless such matters are dealt with carefully, soundly, . and strongly, apart from anything which the Government may have to pay in the way of compensation, the results may. have a very serious effect upon the commercial life of Australia and upon Australian civilization. I could quote many instances from history of the disastrous effects of the admission into a country of pests and diseases. We know what happened to the Greeks, andhow they went down as a nation. God forbid that we should go down as a nation in the same way. Our people must be prepared to do the right thing, and should demand from the Government an effective system of quarantine and public health administration. The rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia was a. very serious matter for those who suffered directly because of it, but surely it should be regarded as an important lesson to Australia. It might be Tasmania&#39;s turn to-morrow, and New South Wales&#39; turn next day. One cannot tell where a similar outbreak may occur. We need to consider whether we are making use as we ought to do of all the resources of science to protect us in these matters. If we were prepared to deal with them in a thoroughly scientific and economic way, it would be unnecessary for the Senate to consider such votes as that now under discussion. I repeat that we are not so much concerned with the outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia, as we are with the way in which the whole question of quarantine is dealt with, as it affects Australia as a whole. </para>

          <para>. - There is one matter to which I wish to call direct attention in connexion with the vote for the Health Department. We have had a report from General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse against the Spahlinger treatment for tuberculosis. No one questions the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse, but he has himself admitted that he is not qualified to speak very definitely about the treatment. Since his return to Australia there has appeared in the public press certain letters from a young man who was suffering from tubercolosis, but who, at his own expense, put himself under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spahlinger. His</inline> letters are full of hope and promise, and in connexion with them I wish in a very few woras to put a proposition before the Government. I suggest that it should agree to have six persons in different stages&#39; of the disease carefully examined here, and should then pay the expense of sending them to Europe to undergo the Spahlinger treatment and have them examined again on their return in order that we may know what results have followed from the treatment. That would be a simple, practical, and common-sense method of testing its efficiency. The letters to which I have referred were written by a young man who was a resident of the town of Parkes, in New South Wales. He went to Europe at considerable expense to undergo the Spahlinger treatment, and he writes in glowing terms of the effect of the treatment on himself and on others. Australia should not lag behind in this matter, as it seems to do in many others. We can understand that when scientists have to report upon the discoveries of other scientists they feel pretty safe in turning them down.If they turn out to be valuable, well and good, and if they do not, those who have adversely criticized them are justified. Amongst the many persons who suffer from tuberculosis it should not be very difficult to find half a dozen who would volunteer to go to Europe to undergo the treatment if their expenses were paid. If it were proved, as the result of such a test, that the treatment is a failure, that would in itself do an immense amount of good. If, on the contrary, it were proved, as the letters of the young man to whom I have referred would lead one to believe, that the treatment is successful in combating the disease, the hope and promise cif benefit which it would give to sufferers from the disease would justify the expenditure involved a. thousand times over. I do not expect the Minister representing the Minister for Health to stand up and say that the Government will accept my proposal, but I do ask him to undertake that the Government shall seriously consider it. If selected cases of various stages of the disease are carefully examined by medical men here, and are again examined after they have undergone the treatment on the other side of the world, we shall have something definite to go upon in coming to a conclusion as to the efficacy or otherwise of the Spahlinger treatment. </para>

          <para>. - The Government has already seriously considered the matter referred to by the honorable senator. It is exceedingly anxious to do all that is possible in connexion with it. I mentioned on a previous occasion the action we took in London. I had seen the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse),</inline> who had made certain inquiries in connexion with the Spahlinger treatment, and had reported to me. I freely admit that I am not personally qualified to express an opinion upon such a matter, but I went into the case carefully with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse. Some time later I had an interview, lasting about an hour, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spahlinger</inline> himself. I must admit that it was not very satisfactory. It was very difficult to get anything very definite from him. A few days later the Prime Minister from New Zealand brought the matter up at the Imperial Conference. The same anxiety waa exhibited there to do everything possible to secure an effective investigation of the treatment. It was  not a question&#39; of money, but merely one of proof, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spahlinger</inline> could substantiate the claims he made for his treatment. The matter- was not treated lightly. A committee was appointed to investigate it thoroughly and exhaustively, in the interests of the Empire. I was privileged to attend the meetings of the committee, in company with the High Commissioner. Many of the leading medical men of London were present at the meetings of the committee. The  chairman  made a statement as to the action, which he thought the committee should take. It was decided to adjourn for two or three days, to give him anopportunity to get, into touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spahlinger,</inline> and ask him to put his case before the committee. The expense was not in question. Australia was ready to defray its share of whatever expense might be incurred, as also were the other dominions. This man absolutely refused to attend the committee, to state his case, and put the facts before it. It was then definitely decided, and to this I agreed on behalf of Australia, that if the committee of health authorities of Great Britain made any progress in the investigation of the matter it should communicate with Australia. The British Government has authority to act for Australia in any financial arrangements which may be made, and if Spahlinger is willing to conduct test cases on our behalf, the British Government will be willing to make the necessary arrangements at the earliest possible moment. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston,</inline> who will be visiting Great Britain in the course of a few weeks, will conduct further investigations, and continue the work already commenced, in the hope of obtaining necessary supplies of the serum to enable the authorities in Australia to conduct tests, even in a small way, in order to ascertain its efficacy. </para>

For instance, item No. 2, &#34; New Hebrides - Grant for special services, &#163;1,300.&#34; Although the amount is small, we should have some information as to how the money is expended, particularly as we receive reports from the islands that the administration is not all that some desire. </para>

It will be noted that only &#163;875 was expended in 1923-24, while &#163;1,300 is provided for 1924-25.

        <para>The amount of &#163;800 to be paid to the International Agricultural Institute at Rome is to cover the. Australian contribution for the year. This institute carries out research work on all matters pertaining to agriculture, and issues bulletins and other publications of great interest to Australia as an agricultural country. The large excess of the expenditure for 1923-24 over the provision is accounted for by the payment of arrears for the previous financial year. </para>
        <para>The amount of &#163;1,000 provided for assisting the boy scout movement is to meet any expenditure that may be incurred in connexion with the issue, including packing, cartage, cleaning, &#38;c, of stores and equipment loaned by the Defence Department to various boy scout organizations together with the return of the goods to the store. </para>
        <para>In 1920 an agreement was arrived at by which certain wool from the then existing pool was supplied to the Colonial. Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company Limited for the manufacture of wooltops. A promise was given that the Government would allow the Australian wool-growers in respect of this wool the same proportion of profit as would have accrued had it formed part of the wool sold to the Imperial Government. In redemption of this promise it was agreed during 1923-24 to pay to the Central Wool Committee an amount of &#163;275,394. Half of this amount was paid last year from the Treasurer&#39;s Advance pending the supplementary Estimates, and the remaining half is provided on this year&#39;s Estimates. A full statement of the circumstances in connexion with this transaction was given in the Prime Minister&#39;s speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 6th June, 1924, <inline font-style="italic">vide</inline> pages 1111-1119. </para>

        <para>SenatorWILSON. - Adelaide printers tried to get some of the work, but were beaten in open competition. In regard to the continuanco of the exhibition, I agree that it has done a great deal of good and has given a wonderful advertisement to Australia. Everybody who visited Wembley was astonished by what had been achieved for the credit of the Commonwealth. We have now to decide what shall be done with the Australian pavilion, which covers four acres of ground. Cables have been exchanged with the Imperial authorities, and only this week we asked for a concrete proposal for a continuation of the exhibition next year. If the exhibition can be continued at reasonable cost, and the British Government gives substantial support to the proposal, the Commonwealth Government will seriously considerwhether such a prolongation would be desirableon account of theadvertisement which Australia wouldreceive. </para>

            <para>- It is similar to thatof Australia. Some months ago we decided that we could not recommend the re-opening of the exhibition, and I think that Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, &#34;and Newfoundland took the same view. Since that date there has beena change of opinion;. Australia occupies probably the most advantageous position at Wembley, and it would be a great pity if our pavilion had to be pulled down or lot before further use was made of it &#39;for the benefit of this country. However, before we can seriously discuss the future- policy in regard to it, we must have a concrete -proposal before us. I hope to receive information on the subject next week, and to be able to make a statement to the Senate later. </para>
