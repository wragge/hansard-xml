                            <para>. - It was intended that the first sale of leases for business and residential purposes at Canberra should be held during October, but consideration has been given to the question of postponing the date, owing to the additional time required in which to complete the necessary plans and consider certain legal matters involved in the leasing proposal. Another reason for delaying the sale is to afford accommodation for visitors in the main hostel. Steps have, therefore, been taken to expedite the completion of the main building and five pavilions of the hostel, and applications will shortly be invited from persons willing to lease and conduct the hostel and commence business early in December. It is, therefore, possible to fix a definite date for the sale which will ensure ample time for distribution of the plans and conditions, and admit of visitors obtaining accommodation which would otherwise be a matter of difficulty. It has accordingly been decided that Friday, the 12th December, 1924, shall be the first day of the sale of city leases, and that the sale, if it is not concluded on that date, it shall be continued on the following day, Saturday, the 13th December, 1924. The Government will not undertake any responsibility in regard to transport, accommodation, or refreshments for intending buyers, beyond arranging for the opening of the hostel. Plans of the proposed subdivisions, together with conditions of sale and regulations, are now being completed, and will be available within eight weeks of the date of the sale. </para>

As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> intimated to me that he proposed to ask a question relating to the sale of the city leases at Canberra, and as I had been for some time dealing with the matter I told him that having at length completed it, I would be in a position to-day to name the date upon which the sale would be held. That is how I happened to have a statement prepared. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s reference to reports in last night&#39;s and this morning&#39;s newspapers is rather too wide. I am sorry to say that no further information has been received as to whether the rescue party has been successful or not. No boat has reached Darwin from the locality, and the only means of communicating with Darwin from that point is by sea. My attention was drawn to a statement appearing in an evening paper last night, the headline on which seemed to indicate that later news had come to hand. The letterpress, however, served to show that it was merely the same story that was told by the blacks who gave the information to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> and could have been picked up by any one who happened to be in Darwin at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> arrived there. Furthermore, the statement was made that Captain Wilkins had been refused permission to accompany the rescue party. It is quite true that Captain Wilkins asked me for permission to accompany the party. He wished to do wo, as he stated, in order to obtain specimens of fauna, that being the object of his visit to the north. However, as he was then at Townsville, and as he could not reach Darwin before the 12th August, he was informed that the expedition could not be delayed to enable him to accompany it for the purpose of collecting specimens of fauna. He subsequently applied to the Administrator, who practically sent him the same reply. A telegram has been sent to the Administrator, asking him to endeavour to forward by the schooner <inline font-style="italic">John Alce</inline> any wireless equipment which theH <inline font-style="italic">udders field</inline> may be lacking, and to try to send a wireless operator from Darwin.He has also been informed that if there is any difficulty in obtaining a wireless operator in Darwin the department will endeavour to make arrangements with Amalgamated Wireless for the services of a suitable man. </para>

                            <para>- I saw the statement referred to by the honorable senator. A search has already been made in the Home and Territories Department, and I can say that no such report has ever been made to the department in Mel bourne. A telegram has been sent to the Administrator at Darwin, asking him if such a report was made to him. </para>

The company is not subsidized by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> is at present engaged in compiling his report on his investigations in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, including Elcho Island. But, in order that there may be no misconception, let me say at once that no oil company in the Northern Territory is being subsidized by the Government, and therefore there can be no question of any payment for any depth of sinking. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I am saying. If this is a revising chamber, why was the debate on the measure conducted on party lines, and why was the Senate denied the credit of inserting this amendment? If it is acceptable to the Government now, surely it should have been acceptable last week. The amendment is certainly an improvement, but the measure itself is iniquitous, because it perpetuates an unwarranted interference with trade and commerce. However, it is something to know that for the future the public will have some knowledge of what is being done by the Tariff Board, because people desiring to reap advantages under it, will have to state their reasons in public and upon oath, instead of being able to get ahead of the other fellow in secret and doing everything behind closed doors. It will ensure publicity to all such transactions. For that reason, I welcome it. At the same time, I cannot help protesting that the amendment was not considered on its merits in this chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that no reasons that I could have advanced would have induced the Government to accept it then. But since then, the party whip has been cracked, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman&#39;s</inline> opinions must go by the board. Members of this chamber, apparently, must take instructions from another place. I have already pointed out that a considerable number of people have written to me urging that all these inquiries should be held in public. I have received letters from the Associated Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide, the New South Wales bag manufacturers, and a number of other organizations, all urging that they are being &#34; crucified&#34; in their business transactions by decisions of the Tariff Board based on statements made behind closed doors. It was urged by those bodies that the inquiries should be held in public. The whole of the arguments advanced in the other place were used without avail in this committee. Honorable senators were informed that it would be very injudicious to disclose to the public the secret formulae in possession of the manufacturers of certain articles. No honorable senator desired that that should be done. Honorable senators opposite would not agree to the amendment providing that these inquiries should be held in public. This bill is objectionable in every way, and it ought not to have been passed by the Senate. I realize, however, that it is a part of our protectionist policy. Although the Government introduces to Parliament a schedule of rates to be imposed upon imported goods, and Parliament fixes the rates, the Tariff Board is able to review them at its own sweet will and submit to the Minister recommendations upon which he can impose what are termed dumping duties. It is an entirely wrong procedure. The taxation imposed by Parliament should stand until Parliament alters it, or withdraws it, no matter how objectionable it may be. The business community to-day does not know where it stands. I recently quoted instances of the remission of duty for one day only, no doubt at the instigation of interested persons. Can anything more absurd be imagined? Probably it was done to meet the convenience of certain persons who had prior knowledge of the action that was to be taken. Had the inquiry into the advisability of remitting that duty been held in public, every one would have been placed on an equal footing. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the honorable senator is correct. Let me make my point clear. The Tariff Board makes a recommendation to the Minister. What follows? A pliant Minister approves of the recommendation, and certain articles are admitted free for one day only. The honorable senator cannot deny that that has been done; nor can he deny that it is solely and exclusively upon the recommendation of the Tariff Board, which sits in secret, that action is taken that puts a number of men to very serious financial loss. I do not stand for that, even though the honorable senator does. </para>

                        <para>- No. I should not think of doing that. But every action of this kind is surrounded with very grave suspicion. Fancy men meeting behind closed doors and quietly and secretly taking action which financially embarrasses certain people I I take it that this amendment means that all inquiries under the Industries Preservation Act will be held in public, and the evidence taken on oath. There is some little satisfaction in that I do not think, however, that the bill provides that every inquiry shall be held in public. The inquiries referred to in clause 3, I take it, will be held in public. The amendment certainly is an improvement upon the bill as we were forced by ministerial supporters to accept it last week. </para>

                    <para>That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the  bill  being passed through  all  its stages without delay,  1 wish to intimate to honorable senators that I do not take this action with any desire to curtail debate. But,  as  honorable senators are aware, both Houses are endeavouring to complete their business at an early date, and it may be that the carrying of this motion will enable us  at  some stage in the proceedings to continue our work without any break. That is the only object I have in moving this motion. As this is a bill which can be debated on the first reading, I propose, after that motion has been submitted, to move that the discussion be taken at a later hour in the day, after honorable senators have had an opportunity to deal with the Quarantine Bill. </para>
