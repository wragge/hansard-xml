                        <para>- I have seen a statement somewhat of the nature referred to. I do not think any governmental action was taken. The agitation seemed to be confined to private individuals. If such action were taken by Japan, with the consent of the Allies, it would undoubtedly create a precedent, and it is just because of that fact that it is undesirable for Australia to create the- precedent. </para>

                <para class="block">Copies of these summaries the being distributed, so that honorable senators will have at their disposal full information on the matters te -which the proposed resolutions relate. It will be remembered that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> undertook to call Parliament together immediately after his return from these Imperial Conferences&#39;, and promised that he would not only place before Parliament the &#39;fullest information in regard to the various subjects dealt with, but also- outline the attitude he had assumed thereat. More publicity was given through the press to the transactions of these Conferences than to those held on any previous occasion, and this makes my task a light one, since honorable senators are already well aware of a great deal that took place. It is my intention, therefore, to refer more particularly to the matters mentioned in the motion I have just read. A great many subjects were dealt with at the- Conferences, hut it is unnecessary for me to refer to a large number of them. Summarized, the- reasons for the Conferences were (1) to promote a good understanding between the nations comprising the British Empire; (2) to try to obtain greater unity of action; and (3) to try to extend reciprocal trade within the Empire. The Conferences had these objects in view. </para>
                <para>These Conferences, I would remind honorable senators, are consultative .and not executive. And I draw attention to the fact that, notwithstanding a statement to the contrary that has been made in </para>
                <para class="block">Australia, the Prime Minister, both at the Imperial  Conference and outside it, made it quite clear that he could not commit this Parliament to any of the resolutions arrived at, but that they would have to be confirmed by this Parliament. Although these resolutions are not binding on the Parliament - and the Prime Minister has made our position quite, clear in that respect - I maintain that they are entitled to the greatest respect and the fullest consideration by every part of the British Empire, because they embody the views arrived . at, after consultation and consideration, by the political heads of the various self-governing Dominions and of Great Britain itself. They represent, so far as parliamentary government can express them, the opinions of the people of the Dominions and of Great Britain. The view of this Government is that these Conferences are of great value, that they should be held more frequently, and that a secretariat should be constituted in which all the Dominions should be represented. By that means, during the periods between the Conferences, the various subjects that had been brought up and dealt with could be kept alive, and a record made of what action had been taken with respect to them, so that it would not be necessary to begin <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> as frequently happens, at each recurring Conference. An example of the kind of secretariat to which I refer, and what could be done by it, is afforded by the Imperial War Graves Commission, whose duty it is to see that the graves of the Empire&#39;s sacred dead are eared for in a proper manner. Every Dominion of the British Empire is represented on that Commission. Australia&#39;s representative is the High Commissioner. We are as much interested in such a matter as are the people of the United Kingdom, and our voice is heard on the Commission, which, without elaborate machinery, affords a very effective means of enabling every part of the Empire to express its views. It seems quite practicable to arrange something of the same kind in regard to the Imperial Conferences. </para>
                <para>The recent Imperial Conference was notable in one particular, which I think affords a striking instance of the freedom enjoyed within the British Empire. I. refer to -the fact that for- the first&#39; time the Irish Free . .State was represented in the. same way as the self-governing Dominions. The discussions at the Conference, as honorable senators will see from the full record of the transactions, proceeded with a recognition of, and with emphasis upon, the one great central fact, that, in the interests of Britain, the Dominions, the Colonies and Dependencies of the Empire as a whole, and of civilization generally, the unity of the British Empire should be preserved and strengthened. Around that principle all the discussion and the resolutions centred and at that end they aimed. Differences of opinion may arise as to the methods which should be adopted to achieve that object, but to this central principle I should imagine that all the members of this Parliament can subscribe and give their hearty adherence. These Conferences, working on that principle, proceeded to discuss the various means by which the consolidation, preservation, and strengthening of the &#34;British Empire, which means so much to the world, might be secured. </para>
                <para>We come, first of all, to the question of foreign policy, which is of great importance. This, in my judgment, is the  touchstone  of one&#39;s  view as to the British Empire and as to the position in that Empire of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the other self-governing Dominions. We lay &#39; it down that Australia, as a part of the Empire, i6 interested in Britain&#39;s foreign policy, and desires to be consulted in regard to that policy. We adopt that attitude because we say that we cannot- be in the Empire and at the same time be out of it. If we are in the Empire, then, obviously, its relations with other countries must affect Australia as they affect every other part of the Empire. I ask honorable &#39; senators who may be doubtful upon that point to apply to themselves what I think is a very effective test. &#39; They may be looking at the Empire, as Australians, from within the Empire, and from &#34;that point of view they may not get quite the right focus. I ask such honorable senators to try to put themselves for the moment in the position of a Japanese subject, or that of a citizen of the United States of America, or a Frenchman, and then to say what their view of the British Empire is. In such circumstances they would not look upon Australia as a separate or divisible part of the Empire; they would view the Empire as one unit. &#39; To a Japanese, an American, or a Frenchman, the British Empire is one, and in so far as foreign affairs are concerned that is the correct view. It is true that within the Empire we have the greatest freedom and liberty in managing our own affairs - we are free and untrammelled but that is &#39; not the point of view of foreign nations. Foreign affairs and foreign relations within the Empire have to be looked at from- the same  point  of view as they are looked at from outside the Empire, otherwise we get a wrong perspective. If Britain is at war, then from the view-point of the enemy, every point of the Empire is available for an attack. We know that foreign relations are the determining factors for war or peace, and as we live today, unfortunately, in a world of war, this is a most vital and important consideration. If the conduct of Britain&#39;s foreign relations leads to war, we are just as liable, just as open, to attack as is any other part of the Empire. Therefore, from that point of- view, Britain&#39;s foreign policy is of vital concern to  us, and we should be consulted in respect to it. Before decisions are arrived at on matters of foreign policy, we should be informed of what is proposed, and our opinion should be  sought.  Australia stands for peace. We are not a war -loving people. We do not desire war. No section of the people of the Commonwealth desires wax. Obviously, peace is the policy that we should pursue and, therefore, Australia&#39;s voice in any consultation in regard to foreign affairs would be in the direction of securing peace. </para>
                <para>There is another point which I should like honorable senators to consider. It was emphasized at the recent Conference, and it is that in the case of war not only  would  our territory be open to attack, but our ocean-borne trade, which is so vital to us and to the Empire, would also be liable to be attacked, to be interrupted, to be destroyed. That is an additional reason why we should be consulted in regard to matters of foreign policy. We demand consultation, and claim  that  our views, together with those of the other self-governing Dominions, shall be heard. The Government invite the Senate to subscribe to that principle. We feel that the time has arrived when this Parliament, and not merely the representatives of the Commonwealth at the Conference, should voice that view. We have, therefore, taken the unusual course on this occasion of inviting Parliament, by direct resolution, to subscribe to that view, and to publish it to the world. </para>
                <para>The Imperial Conference, proceeding to discuss the question of how peace could be secured, came to several conclusions, which can be summarized in three paragraphs. It put, first of all, the maintenance of the unity of the British Empire. The Conference believed, as we believe, that this is the greatest factor for peace in the world  to-day. Without it peace cannot be secured. We point to the whole policy of Great Britain since the war, and the keenest critics of that policy cannot but admit that it is Britain that is leading the Powers in the direction of peace - that is securing the peace of Europe to-day. The Conference said, secondly, that the cultivation of the closest possible relations between the great English-speaking nations of the world - between the United States of America and the British Empire - was yet another way of securing peace; and, thirdly, that still another way of securing peace was by giving the fullest possible support to the League of Nations, so as to insure its power and prestige throughout the world. I wish to draw particular attention to the emphasis which has been laid on the concluding words of .that paragraph, &#34; the power and prestige of the League of Nations.&#34; The League of Nations cannot secure peace, any more than we could do, by merely passing resolutions. To achieve tha&#39;t desirable end it must have the power to enforce its decisions. The world, had an object lesson in that regard not long ago, in connexion with the incident at Corfu, when a great Power showed its readiness, ana&#34;, indeed, determination, to use its naval strength to enforce its will upon another nation. No one who recalls the history of that trouble will deny that the only means that the League had to enforce respect for its decisions - the only claim it had to make its voice heard on that occasion - was that Britain was a member of it, that Britain was taking a prominent part in the efforts to maintain peace, that she had a great fleet in the Mediterranean, and that she had the  power,  if she chose to use it, to enforce the decisions of the League, and so keep these combatants  from  each other. </para>

                <para>A number of questions dealing with foreign relations were dealt with. * One was reparations by Germany, and the French occupation of the Ruhr, a matter which was fully discussed after the facts had been submitted to the Conference by the British Foreign Minister. After an examination of the facts presented, the Conference determined that the question could only be adequately dealt with by securing the co-operation of the United States. Honorable senators who have traced the history of this matter, will recollect that the Conference happened to be sitting at the time it came into prominence, and, as a matter of fact, it was on the recommendation of the Conference that the British Government took action to endeavour to get the United States of America to join in the appointment of two Committees to ascertain the means of. balancing the German budget and to estimate the amount of Germany&#39;s foreign credit, and arrive at means for&#39; securing the return of capital to Germany. These steps were taken while the Conference was- sitting, and I am glad to say that the efforts of the British Government to secure the co-operation of the United States of America were successful, the Government of the United States of America being represented on both of the Committees appointed. These Committees will shortly submit their reports, but already, as a result of their appointment, there has been a change in the attitude of France, which, I venture to say, is largely attributable to the fact that America has been brought into the issue, although only in an indirect way. Great Britain, which all along has been pursuing a conciliatory policy, and endeavouring to retard and check the wilder attempts to recover reparations, has in this respect, I think, achieved a notable victory, and has certainly done a great deal to stabilize conditions in Europe. The Conference had also under review the treaty arrived at between the Allies and Turkey, and gave its assent to the principles of that treaty, which will shortly come before this Senate for ratification. </para>
                <para>Discussion also arose as to the position in Egypt. The geographical situation of Egypt is of immense importance to Australia,: it lies across one of the arteries of our trade; and as the granting of self-government to that country had opened up a new set of problems to the Empire, and also to Egypt, it was well, I think, that while our Prime Minister was in London the position in Egypt should be discussed. Not only did it give him the opportunity to ascertain the British view of Egyptian matters; it also enabled  him  to place before the Imperial authorities the Australian view of the question, and the importance of the Egyptian situation to this part of the Empire. </para>
                <para>Another important subject that came under review at the Conference was the relations between the British Empire and the United States of America, a matter which is all-important, not only to ourselves and to the Empire, but also to the whole world. One serious source of irritation was affecting the relations of these two great countries at the time the Conference was sitting, and that was the inability of the Government of the United States of America to carry  out  effectively the law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of liquor in the United States. Negotiations were on foot to secure an extension of the limits within which the Government of the United States of America could seize vessels for search in order to enforce its liquor prohibition laws, and the Conference agreed to  recommend  Great Britain&#39;s acceptance of the right of the American Government to &#39;search vessels -within a 12-miles limit, in order to enable its prohibition laws to be carried out. Whatever may be out opinion in regard &#39;to prohibition, I nave no hesitation in saying that the decision arrived at had a very wholesome effect upon the relations &#34;between&#39; the two great countries., because every matter that affects the United .States of . America is seized upon hy the opponents of Great Britain in the States to lay  to keep  the two nations .apart. Any step we .take to obviate that is .certainly in the  right  direction. </para>
                <para>In .regard to information on foreign affairs, the Prime Minister has been &#39;kept fully and freely informed during the last twelve months. We have no complaints on that score; but there is something to he done by ourselves. I am not quite sure &#39;that the machinery we possess for handling the information we receive is adequate or properly organized. The Prime Minister proposes very shortly so to organize his Department that the information freely and fully sent along to us stall be utilized in the proper manner., .and that Parliament, if necessary, may &#39;.be informed of those matters in respect of foreign, policy .of which it should be  cognisant. </para>

                <para>It was that resolution which this Conference indorsed. Honorable senators will remember that, as a result of the discussion which took place at the Economic Conference, the British Government of the day proposed to make certain Tariff alterations;an fact, they announced that they would make certain alterations in their Tariff for the most part in the direction of taking off duties. That would have had an important effect, because they proposed to take off, as against the Dominions,duties on such products as currants and dried fruits, leaving the duties as they were against foreign countries. </para>

That was not a resolution of  the Conference; it was announced at the Conference as a decision of the Government. It did not take effect, however, because legislation had to be passed concerning it. The present BritishGovernment have given a general undertaking that they will allow those resolutions which were necessary to give effect to that promise to be submitted to the British Parliament, and that the Parliament will be unfettered in arriving at a decision upon them. That is of great importance to Australia. As these preferences do not in any way affect the decisions of the British electorates in favour of Free Trade-they are, in fact, in the other direction - one can only hope that the Parliament of Great Britain will confirm them. </para>

                <para class="block">Canadanot assent to that resolution, but that, apparently, the present British Governmentsawinit some menace to the economic system to which they have committed themselves. I cannot conceive why. It seems to me that whether a country adopts the principle of Free Trade or Protection, provided it is within the Empire, there cannot be any objection to having a standing economic committee meeting to consider means by which mutual trade between all parts . of the Empiremaybeassisted. Many questions arise. For instance, there is in connexion with Australian trade the marketing and distribution of our products overseas. That, obviously, is a matter over which we have little or no control ; but if there were in the United Kingdom an economic committee of this kind, and we were represented on that committee, we could, through it, bring facts and figures beforetheBritish Government, and possibly be able to evolve a system which would not only benefit our export trade, but lead to cheaper living in the United Kingdom. Possibly some means would fee provided by which those products could be taken direct to the consumer without, as is the case to-day, having to pass through the hands of so many agents and middlemen. Further, there are the questions of shipping, of freight, of communication. Although there is an Imperial Shipping Committee, there are many questions affecting shipping and communication with which at present there is no body to deal. We can deal with the mattei at one end, and the United Kingdom can deal with it at the other, but there is no body to harmonize the resolutions of both. This economic committee, the Government think, would fill that hiatus and do very valuable work. </para>

                    <para>In connexion with Naval Defence one matter of immediate interest came before the Conference,  namely,  the projected Empire cruise of a squadron of modern warships. The First Lord of the Admiralty explained that the project was that two capital ships, the <inline font-style="italic">Hood</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Repulse,</inline> together with a small squadron of modern light cruisers, should visit South Africa, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, and return by &#39;-way of British Columbia, the Panama Canal, and Eastern Canada.

                <para class="block">I submit that the most rabid anti militarist, the most earnest advocate of  reserving  to Australia complete power to provide for its own defence, cannot find in those resolutions anything to which <inline font-style="italic">hh</inline> may not subscribe. They leave absolutely to Australia the decision of the methods, the means, the time, and the place of its own defence. What they do provide, however, is that since there are so many partners in this Imperial concern, it is both economic and advisable that those partners should have a common plan upon which to work, so that if, at any time, they require to operate, that plan will work smoothly, the various parts will dove-tail, and there will be that uniformity of organization, of material, and of equipment that is so necessary for effectiveness in time of war. At the same time they recognise that as the seas are practically one, that as there are no borders in the sea, therefore, in time of war our fleets must be one; they must be as effective in one ocean as they .are in another, because the Empire may not have the  choice  of the place in which a decisive action is to be fought. If the fleets are to be effective for the protection of the whole, they should n&#39;ot only be organized in like manner as to discipline, as to method, and as to equipment, but should also be able to co-operate in any of the seas in which Empire interests are to be protected. Recognising, as they did, the importance to Australia and to the British interests in the East, as it is called there - it is our North - that this vital spot, this gateway, as Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Field so truly called it, should be provided for, they recommended that an adequate base should be established there from which the fleets that protect our trade and our interests in those seas could work and co-operate. </para>
                <para>Some attempt has been made, in various quarters, to make it appear that the establishment by Britain of a base at Singapore would be regarded by Japan as a menace and a threat, and that it would in some way be an infraction of the provisions&#39;&#39; of the Washington Treaty. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> Macdonald, himself, has &#34; scotched &#34; that idea by declaring that he is quite convinced that the establishment of a base at Singapore is in no sense an infringement of the Treaty, either in spirit or in letter. As one who had the honour to take part in the preparation of that Treaty, and who listened to the discussions, not merely in the Conference itself, but- what was&#39; far more important - in some of the Committees and at meetings of various delegates that were held in secret, the reports of which have not been published, I say that not only is it not an infraction of the Treaty, either in the spirit or in the letter, bub that the idea of a base being established at Singapore was clearly and distinctly understood, not only by the British Delegation, but also by the American and the Japanese Delegations, to be an essential part of Britain&#39;s plan for the defence of its interests in the Pacific. Singapore was discussed in exactly the same way, and from exactly the same point of view, as Honolulu as an American Defence Base, and as certain islands to the south of Japan as a Japanese Base were discussed. The point at issue was this: The United States of America was proceeding to establish a base at Guam. With, a Naval Base at the Island of Guam, and with capital ships in the Pacific, she could have struck at Japan - because Guam is within effective striking distance of Japan - at China, at Australia, and at the Dutch East Indies. And, therefore, the United States of America was asked to forgo the fortification of Guam, because  it was not necessary for the defence of the United States of America, while on the other hand it would have given that country an aggressive base from which it could strike at other nations. The United States of America gave up the right to fortify Guam, but not the right to fortify Honolulu, because it was agreed at the Conference that, with a fleet base at Honolulu, the United States of America could defend the Western  States  of America, but could strike at neither British nor Japanese interests in the East. The same arguments apply equally to Japan&#39;s position in the Pacific. Japan was proceeding to fortify and prepare for a Naval Base in the islands lying farther south, which would have enabled her to strike at Manilla and the Philippines, and at Borneo, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other British possessions. Japan gave up the right to establish a base there, but she did not give up the right to fortify and provide Naval Bases on the islands off her mainland. Bases there would be too far away to assist her in striking at American or British interests, but would enable her to defend her own interests. Equally, Great Britain gave up the right to expand the fortification of Hong Kong, because that base is within striking distance of Japanese and American interests, but Great Britain did not give up - on the contrary she claimed and was conceded - the right to establish a base at Singapore. She claimed, and it was admitted by British and Japanese Naval authorities at the Conference, that a base at Singapore could not be used for the purpose of aggression either against America or Japan, but was essential to the defence of British interests in that part of the Pacific. No attempt was made by any Power represented at the  Conference  to include Singapore in the prohibited area. It was clearly set out, and clearly accepted, that Singapore was the natural base that would be proceeded with by Great Britain to defend - her Eastern and Pacific interests. Those who say that the establishment of a- base, there, would be regarded either by Japan or America as a threat against their interests do not know what they are talking about, and would certainly receive no support from any of the Japanese <inline font-style="italic">av</inline> American representatives who participated in the Washington Conference. I make that statement without fear of contradiction. I read recently that Earl Balfour had stated that it was clearly understood that Singapore was outside the prohibited area, and that it was never asked that it should be included within that area. The United States of America gave up its proposal to establish a base at Guam, Britain gave up its proposed extension of fortifications at Hong Kong, and Japan gave up the . right to fortify islands to the south of Japan, because from bases there the interests of other nations could be- menaced. If it had been thought possible at that Conference that the British Government would not establish a base at Singapore, the outlook of the British delegation would have been completely altered. What were we considering? We were considering the question of peace, and particularly the peace of the Pacific. It was recognised that there were three great Powers whose interests predominated ; that they were fairly equal in naval strength, and that they were engaging in a wild policy of building ships in a mad race for armaments to dominate the Pacific. The Conference was an attempt by the late President Harding to bring those three nations&#39; together and stop their suicidal policy of building ships against one another. The representatives at the Conference were not such cheerful optimists as to believe that any one of the nations would strip itself of the power of defending&#39; its territories and trade; but what they asked the nations to do was voluntarily to give up the means of aggression. Why was a Limitation placed upon the building of capital ships? It was done because it was recognised that the most aggressive factor in naval warfare wa3 the capital ship. The American, Japanese, and British naval officers who&#62; constituted the technical delegation that advised . us agreed that the capital ship was the aggressive weapon, but they also agreed that the radius of action of capital ships  was limited to a certain* distance from their bases. It was considered necessary, therefore, to limit the number, not only of capital ships, but also of their bases. The bases were an essential factor in the discussion. Each nation was looking, not merely at the capital ships, but also at the bases from which they could operate. It was clearly and distinctly understood by the British delegation that the base from which the British fleet of capital ships in the Pacific should operate would be at Singapore. The American representatives understood that their base would be at Honolulu, and the Japanese representatives understood that their base would be the islands to the south of Japan. Now, after the treaty is signed and sealed, and Great Britain has consented to surrender her aggressive power in the </para>

                    <para>- It would be quite a wise thing for her to surrender her power of defence if the other nations would do likewise, but will the United States take similar action in regard to Honolulu, and will the Japanese Government do likewise in regard to the bases to the south of Japan I that is the first question that should be cleared up by the British Government before it proceeds to surrender the power of defence, which is very different from the power of aggression&#39;. </para>

                <para>I wish to make another point in this regard. There seems to be behind the action of the British Government a belief that peace can be insured by weakness. There is a very significant inner history of the Washington Conference. Great Britain, Japan, and the United States framed the Naval Treaty. But they are not the only Powers that have possessions in the Pacific. Why were the other Powers with possessions there not invited to assist in framing the Treaty? These three Powers framed it because they had force behind them iri the Pacific. They were the great naval Powers in the Pacific. Holland has great possessions in the Dutch East Indies. Why was Holland not asked to take part in the discussion 1 She was not asked because she is  a  weak naval Power-- because she has a small and ineffective navy. If weakness is the way to peace, why was not Holland asked to take part in  the  Conference? Great Britain was asked because she was regarded as  a  powerful naval factor, without whom there could  be  no peace. The American and Japanese nations took part for the same reason. A ratio of 5:5:3 was agreed upon for capital ships. Three Japanese capital ships can cruise in the Pacific, and are allowed to have a base there. The American nation can have  five  capital ships to cruise from their  base  in&#39; the Pacific; but Great Britain, if it has no base, in the Pacific, can have no capital ships there. Yet  we  are told that (his is the way to bring about further disarmament! Why need the nations in future consult Great Britain iu regard to the Pacific? She will not be able to strike in that part of the world. She has placed herself in the same category as Holland. She has virtually abandoned the Pacific, for the naval experts say that the battle-ship is the effective aggressive unit. Without  a baBe  in the Pacific, British battle-ships may come here on a peaceful cruise, as they are doing at the present time, but in time of war they dare not be left in the Pacific. If this policy is persisted - in it means that Great Britain voluntarily withdraws from herself the right to take Hie lead in promulgating peace measures in the Pacific in the future. </para>

                        <para>- They made very emphatic protests, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> which, however, the other Powers did not listen. There is the further significant fact that France, although a strong power, and a signatory to the Treaty, did not take part in the preliminary negotiations relating to the drafting of the agreement. The agreement was drafted by Great Britain, Japan, and America. It was ratified afterwards both by France and Italy, but they were not consulted in the preliminary drafting. It was some time afterwards that they came in.. The decision of the British Government has opened up  for  Australia one  of  the most serious problems we have yet had to face, and I solemnly say that it is not the way to peace. So far from leading to peace, it is more likely to lead to war. In such an Empire as ours it is the greatest incentive to war that we could have. These resolutions are important, and the idea qf the Government in submitting them is that the Parliament of Australia should be something more than a mere debating society. They involve important principles to which Parliament should be asked to subscribe, and I invite the attention of honorable senators to the terms of the motion that I intend to move. </para>

That is not the  View  of this Government. The Cabinet has not considered what should be the proportionate payment, but we did intimate to the British Government that we were prepared to ask Parliament to make a substantial contribution to the cost of the base.
