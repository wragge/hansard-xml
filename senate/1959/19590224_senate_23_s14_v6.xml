                        <para>- Some little time ago an approach was made to my colleague, the Minister for Defence, by the Hobart Marine Board and other interested bodies in Hobart requesting him to submit ,to rae, and to the Government, certain proposals along the lines now referred' to toy the Leader of the Opposition, -who, I think, will possibly recall that the .terms of that submission were very similar to those which he, in concert with a .deputation of Tasmanian senators, submitted to me a couple of years ago. The Government considered the request which was forwarded through the Minister for Defence, and decided that for a number of reasons the decision made a couple of years ago would not toe altered. The subsidy involved would amount to a minimum - I stress, a minimum - of £13.3,;0©0 a year. The ship in question is 27 years old and has become uneconomic, not only by virtue of the fact that all such cargo-passenger vessels have become uneconomic because of waterside working conditions, but also because of age. The vessel was due for survey within a few months of the submission. That survey would have cost a great amount of money. The Government also had in mind that the new ferry, " Princess of Tasmania ", would be commissioned towards the end of this year. That vessel will greatly alleviate the existing passenger traffic problem. Further representations have been made to the Minister for Defence, subsequent to the particular submission to which T ,have referred, (relating .not only to passenger, but also to .cargo vessels. I am pleased to -be able to inform the Leader .of .the Opposition that I am looking at this latest request to see whether any improvement can be effected by way of providing a regular Hobart-Sydney cargo scheduled service. </para>

                        <para>- I preface a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate by drawing attention to a statement made by the Treasurer, the Right Honorable Harold Holt, as  chairman  of the Australian Loan .Council, in which he announced that an additional £4,000.000 was to be made available for the local government authorities of the States during this financial year, and that of this amount New South Wales was to receive an additional £2,000,000. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the New South Wales Government has made any proposals to the Loan Council to use a substantial portion of this increased loan allocation on local authority works which have a high man-power employment content? In view of the displacement of man-power by mechanization in the coal-mining industry, will the Minister ask the New South Wales Government to have special regard to the coal-mining areas in the allocation of these additional funds? </para>

                        <para>- As Senator Anderson has intimated in his question, the answer lies more properly with my colleague, the Treasurer, but this is a matter in which T have taken more than a passing interest because of my responsibilities in coal-mining matters. As I understand the position, the local authorities throughout Australia were given the right to go on the market to borrow an additional £4,000,000. and the other States of the Commonwealth agreed that New South Wales should get a larger proportion of that amount than it might be strictly entitled to receive. That was agreed because of this unemployment problem on the coal-fields in New .South Wales. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The position in New South Wales, roughly, is that there are about 6,000 fewer .employees in the coal-mining industry  than  there were seven or eight years &amp;&lt;ro. and that reduction in numbers has  occurred  despite the fact that because of the mechanization that has .occurred in the mines, more coal is being produced now than was then -produced. I think that at the : present time there are some 600 miners seeking employment in the Cessnock-M aitland area. The purpose at the back of this additional authority was, in part at ]eas to give the local authorities in the coalfields area an opportunity to borrow  mo  money so that they could go on with  lo  government works and thus provide  emploment  in that part of New South  W  around Newcastle. </para>
                    <para>It is not possible for the Commonwealth Government to give any directions about the matter to the New South Wales Government. In these matters, the States have their sovereign rights once the Loan Council fixes the overall level of borrowing. What is done with the £2,000,000 which the local authorities in New South Wales can borrow is a matter entirely for the New South Wales Government. That Government can elect to give such municipalities as Maitland, Cessnock and Newcastle an opportunity to borrow more and thus provide more employment on the coal-fields; or it may maintain the limits available in  other  parts of the State. It is all within the  juridiction  of the New South Wales Government. </para>

                        <para>- The exportation of Australian fauna is prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. It cannot take place without the prior permission of the Minister for Customs and Excise. Usually we seek from the State concerned a certificate to the effect that it raises no objection. In the case of koalas, platypuses, lyre birds and birds of paradise, the approval of the Minister is expressly required. I know of no instance where koala bears have been exported and have lived. In 1952 approval was given for the exportation of four koala bears to the United States, for use in the making r»f a film. If I am correctly informed, they were to have been returned to Australia, but died in a zoo in that country. I can only say that, as yet, we have received no application for permission to export these koala bears. When such an application comes to hand, 1 will examine the position in the light of what I have just said. </para>

                        <para>- The Royal Australian Navy will this year, as in previous years, be contributing a contingent to the combined fleet exercises carried out by Seato countries in waters to the north of Australia. This year's contingent is to be  made up of the aircraft carrier " Melbourne ", two ships from the strategic reserve at Singapore - the " Q " class destroyers " Quiberon " and " Queensborough " - a Daring class destroyer, " Voyager ", and two Battle class destroyers, " Tobruk " and " Anzac ". That congregation of ships will be calling at Fremantle before sailing for those exercises, and with them will be a contingent of the Royal Navy, at present in these waters, which will rendezvous at Fremantle before leaving. I believe the time will be 17th March, approximately, but I am not sure. </para>

The Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania stated, in reply, that they did not want, that opportunity to be given them, that, for their own various State reasons, they thought the arrangements that had already been made by the Loan Council were adequate, and that the local authorities did not need any addition to the limits of money that they could borrow. </para>

I read it with a little interest at the time, because I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for Trade, is making inquiries aimed at increasing our trade with the Philippines. I do not know whether the Minister for Trade would be willing to sponsor a trade delegation to that country; it would be a matter for him to decide. I remind the honorable senator that recently a trade mission visited the Philippines in the trade ship "Delos-" during its tour of South-East* Asia.

In spite of the findings of the recent inquiry in Hong Kong and in consideration of the great distress of the wives and families of the lost crew due to the uncertainty of its fate, will the Minister consider offering a substantial reward in the appropriate areas for information which may help to ease the minds of these unhappy people or lead to some clarification of the mystery? </para>

                            <para>. -  I take the opportunity afforded me by this debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to refer to the excellent speeches that were made by Senators Branson and McKellar in moving and seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. It is a long time since we have heard maiden speeches of the calibre of those to. which we. listened on. that occasion. I have no hesitation in saying that both honorable senators will make a worthy addition to. the ranks of Government senators. May I add,, in regard to their contributions, that I hope we shall hear more such speeches for many years to come, and may their stay in this Senate be bothvery long and1 very pleasant. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>The speeches by the two. new senators had, I think, one. significant point about them, in: that both dealt with the same subject,, namely, the development of our nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> confined his remarks to important aspects of the development of Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> went further afield, and dealt with a broader field of development,, but the point I want to make is that, both speeches, referred to development. I suggest that there is some significance in that fact alone. I submit that both honorable senators deemed it to be a subject worthy of inclusion in their maiden speeches and. therefore we in this, Senate must have regard to the fact that the development of our nation is probably of supreme importance to the Parliament. 1 feel that we should not let pass the opportunity to mention that, because I agree entirely with what both senators said, and 1 agree that the subject-matter, they selected was fitting for their maiden speeches. 1 think that this Senate should take cognizance of what both honorable senators said. </para>
                        <para>I also wish to offer congratulations to some other people. I offer my heartiest congratulations to our two new knights - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Neil</inline> O'sullivan and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper. It is very pleasing to me that  Her  Majesty has recognized in due course - but not too late - the worthy efforts of both these fine Australians, who have given the best years of their lives to the Parliament of this country and' to the service of the nation. Both have worked hard and untiringly for the parties they represent and the States that they represent. Both have worked untiringly and given their services unsparingly for the whole of Australia. I think it is proper for us to place on record the fact that the nation is deservedly grateful to them for their great contributions in the Parliament. </para>
                        <para>Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> wish to congratulate two other of my colleagues - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge. Senator Spooner</inline> has. been appointed' Leader of the Government in this chamber, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> his  deputy.  I congratulate them on their appointments. I feel quite certain that they will carry on the very fine traditions of our party in this Parliament, and that they will be a great success in their new spheres of responsibility. </para>
                        <para>Having exhausted-,, as- it were,, the matters upon which I wish to congratulate people, I now turn to the main subject of my speech this afternoon. I wish to make some observations concerning an important matter - the matter of western New Guinea and the joint statement that was made by the Australian Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Subandrio</inline> of Indonesia. That subject, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, was</inline> dealt with rather extensively by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> last week. I. desire, at this stage, to make some observations in criticism- of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> remarks. During his speech, he endeavoured, to give us the policy of the Australian Labour party in relation, to western New Guinea,, and he quoted the precise terms of Labour's policy from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline></para>
                        <para class="block">Evatt's policy speech. The relevant passage, to which I wish to direct my attention, was as follows: - </para>

                        <para class="block">That, 1 think, epitomizes the Labour party policy as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> last week, and I agree with his observation that that policy is clear and unequivocal. But, at the very time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> was enunciating that policy, the learned Leader of the Opposition in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> was putting forward something quite different concerning this precise question.

The honorable senator is confusing himself in endeavouring to enunciate Labour policy if, on the one hand, he advocates a policy of blind neutrality and, on the other hand, suggests that Australia should get off the sidelines, get into the ruck and do some kicking and pushing in the ruck to prevent Indonesia succeeding in her claim of sovereignty.

                        <para class="block">I very enthusiastically join issue with the honorable senator on that question. I insist that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is quite wrong when he suggests that the Netherlands must submit any questions relating to sovereignty to the United Nations before agreements cao be made with any country with relation to that sovereignty. I suggest he is confusing the issue there with the question that arises in respect of trust territories under the United Nations. West New Guinea does not happen to be a trust territory under the control of the United Nations. For hundreds of years, it has been the sovereign property of the Netherlands. It has never been granted under a trust by the United Nations. </para>

                            argument would properly apply to the northern section of Australian New Guinea, which we hold under trust from the United Nations. The sovereignty in respect of that area is not vested in Australia; it is still vested in the United Nations. But that is not the case with West New Guinea. That sovereignty has never been vested in the United Nations, and it has never been vested in any country by the United Nations as a trust territory. Therefore, I suggest that it is quite clear that
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                            misdirected himself, if I may use that expression, in arguing that the consent of the United Nations would be a condition precedent to any change in ownership or any agreement made by the Netherlands with any country in relation to sovereignty. The very most that would happen would be that a nation, if it did acquire the sovereignty of West New Guinea from the Dutch by agreement, would be obliged to observe the fundamental principles relating to native peoples. I refer to the principles observed by all nations in relation to native peoples and which form part of the Charter, and that burden or obligation would be transferred, as it were, from the one nation to the other  - from the Dutch nation to the nation acquiring sovereignty in West New Guinea. But that is quite different and distinct from the question whether the United Nations should have to be consulted.
                        </para>
                        <para>I suggest that it follows that this question of sovereignty on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggests Ministers for Foreign Affairs place too much reliance or emphasis is of the very essence of any question that should arise for discussion -between Australia and Indonesia in relation to West New Guinea. After all, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Subandrio</inline> came here to discuss sovereignty. Would it not have been proper for us to refuse to discuss sovereignty with him? I think that the question of the sovereignty of West New Guinea goes to the very crux of the position between Australia and Indonesia, but that other questions relating to West New Guinea are not the concern of Australia and Indonesia in talks between the two nations. </para>
                        <para>That leads me to what I think is a serious flaw in the Australian Labour movement's criticism of this joint statement. Some Labour people, and in fact some newspapers, have criticized the joint statement, suggesting that in some way it should have included reference to other aspects of Australia's policy relating to West New Guinea. T .have heard it said that the joint communique should have included reference to certain aspects of the future of West New Guinea, to certain aspects of security and to questions relating to the welfare of the indigenous peoples. AH these matters have been referred to from time to time during recent weeks as being subjects which should have been discussed and which should have been mentioned in the joint communique. In a moment 1 shall deal with the reason why they were not in the joint communique. </para>
                        <para>Bun it amazes me that the Leader of the Opposition in this place should insist that this statement should have included something about the strategic importance, for example, of West New Guinea. The mere statement or platitude that West New Guinea is of great strategic importance to Australia, Indonesia and 0:her countries, is nol a proper observation to make in a communique of .this nature, nor does it assist either country to any extent at all. Every student of military strategy in any staff college in the world knows perfectly well that West New -Guinea -is strategically important not only to Australia but also to Indonesia, and the placing .of such a statement in a communique does not make it any more important. What could follow from such a statement would be important. If Australia had asked for bases in West New Guinea, we would be getting somewhere. But would a joint communique issued by the representatives of Australia and Indonesia be the place for such a statement? My answer, of course, is " No ". This was a joint communique issued by the representatives of Australia and Indonesia which recognized the sovereignty of the Netherlands. I thin'k it would be quite impertinent for Australia and Indonesia to discuss matters of security in relation to West New Guinea behind the backs &gt;of the Dutchmen. I submit that the proper place for a discussion -of questions relating to security, defence and :the strategic importance of Dutch New 'Guinea is not with the Indonesians, whom we do not recognize on these questions but with the Dutch. It follows again that questions relating to native welfare in West New 'Guinea cannot properly be discussed in talks between Australia and Indonesia relating to sovereignty. The proper place for .those questions to be discussed is surely as between Australia and the Netherlands. The same applies to .all other domestic, economic or social .questions relating to this :area because we have recognized the Dutch sovereignty over West New Guinea, and all other problems must have regard to that factor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggested that that question should have been submitted to the United Nations and that we should have supported the submission. My reply is that we should not have done so. It would have been most improper to have supported the Indonesians in any discussion before the 'United Nations on the sovereignty of western New Guinea. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> support an application to such a body by, say, Ceylon, for sovereign rights over Tasmania? If he asserts that Australia should have supported an Indonesian claim for sovereignty before the United Nations he cannot avoid the answer to the illustration that I have just given him. He would have to support a claim by some other nation to part of Australia. </para>
                        <para>L repeat, the United Nations: is not. the place for a. discussion, on sovereignty. If it were so regarded, we should produce nothing but chaos. The: proper place for the resolving of differences over sovereignty is the International: Court of Justice. Both Australia and the Netherlands have stated that they are quite prepared for the matter of sovereignty to be contested- before the International Court, but the Indonesians, of course, are not prepared to take part in any such hearing. </para>

If the honorable senator will not accept that, he will have to tell me where sovereignty does lie in this matter, and what is the nature of the sovereignty that the Dutch have. Undoubtedly, they have total sovereign rights over West New Guinea. Those rights are no more or less than the rights that we hold over Tasmania. When the honorable senator asks me whether the Dutch could hand over their sovereign power, to the Russians I must answer that,, legally, they certainly could, that we could equally hand over Tasmania to some other country,, and that it would be equally unlikely.. </para>

                        <para>What it all boils down to is this: What is to be the next move in regard to Dutch New Guinea? So far I have not uttered one word of criticism regarding some of the statements of policy that have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> I have merely observed that they differ from those of some of his colleagues. However,. I am quite prepared to agree that certain very important questions will, either now, in the short term, or in the long term, arise with respect to this- strategic part of the world. </para>
                        <para>The most important matter is the future welfare of the- indigenous people of West New Guinea. I suggest that it cannot be discussed with the Indonesians if we respect </para>
                        <para class="block">Dutch, sovereignty;, if: we respet the nationthat, is actually in possession; of the country in question.. I suggest that the only people with&lt; whom we. can discuss this question are: the Dutch. We should1 be having discussions with- them now as to the. future welfare of the indigenous people. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not think anyone will contradict me when l1 say that, ideally, the living1 standards of the' whole population of New Guinea should be raised to the- point where the' people, including- the white- settlers, enjoycompletely responsible Government and&gt; political' autonomy. That may take many, many years. No one would' suggest that' it would take less than many generations. At the same time, honorable senators will agree that during the interregnum, before nationhood is achieved, there will' be upon both Australia and the Dutch an obligation to maintain the utmost goodwill with the indigenous peoples. Moreover, we must seek the closest possible ties with, them when they do attain nationhood. </para>
                        <para>Finally, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that in the long term it would' be ideal to have one nation in New Guinea-. I repeat, however; that this cannot be done by conducting; negotiations with the Indonesians. It would be most improper- to discuss the question with them at all. It would be equally proper to begin discussing it with the Dutch. The timing of such discussions' would doubtless be a matter for some disagreement, but eventually this country must face up to the need for very close co-ordination with the Netherlands- in relation to the economic and cultural' future of New Guinea. </para>
                        <para>Meanwhile, the strategic aspects should be discussed.. Again, I suggest that these, cannot, and should not, be discussed with, the Indonesians.. Discussion can take place only with' the Dutch, and it is time that it took place. It- might, of course, be. the. policy of the Government to hold. such, discussion in. due course. After all,, we have, had a most satisfactory preliminary, discussion with the Indonesians on. this allimportant question of sovereignty. It is probably a corollary of that first series, of. talks to expect that a second will be held with the Dutch. It would then be most proper and relevant to discuss the strategic implications of West New Guinea. When these discussions take place - and' I hope they take place soon - serious consideration should be given to the establishment of bases by both Australia and the United States of America. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that West New Guinea is of the greatest strategic importance to Australia. We have lost bases in the Indian Ocean. We no longer have Trincomalee. I do not think that any one knows much about the long-term future of Singapore. We have one base in Northern Australia, at Darwin, only. We own Cocos Island and I suggest that immediate consideration should be given to the establishment of not merely a base,, but a fortified post there. When we consider how we shall draw a chain of bases from Cocos Island through to the Philippines we find Dutch New Guinea very much in the way. As a matter of urgent defence policy we should begin discussions with the Dutch with a view to the establishment, in collaboration with, the Americans of fortified posts in that area. </para>

                                <para>-  That must also form part of any defence system between Australia and Asia. Despite the inacitvity of the former Australian Labour party government the fortification of that island must, I suggest, be taken up again. In endeavouring to clarify my thoughts on this subject, I have endeavoured to show, first, that we still await a uniform enunciation of policy by the Australian Labour party. We have heard several contradictory statements of policy in the last week. Secondly, the Government has been attacked for not including in the communique a statement of policy relating to Dutch New Guinea. I repeat, it would have been most improper to have included such subjects in a communique signed jointly with a nation whom we did not recognize as having' sovereignty over the country concerned. Thirdly, the communique, as it is, is certainly a milestone in the diplomatic relations between this country and Indonesia. We have achieved something that has been very rarely achieved by any Australian Government. We have obtained a guarantee that in the activities of Indonesia in regard to its claim to the sovereignty of Dutch New Guinea, no force will be used. I suggest that that is a great success for this Government in relation to this dispute over sovereignty. </para>

                        <para>Finally, I submit that all these matters that have been suggested as being proper for inclusion in this joint communique, matters relating to the security and political future of New Guinea, its amalgamation with Australia, and the co-ordination of native policies, whether economic, social or cultural, are all matters most improper for inclusion. Those are questions which, I have no doubt, will very properly be the subject of discussion with the Netherlands Government in due course. I believe we have won the first round in the diplomatic negotiations with the Indonesians, and I look forward to the second round with a great deal of enthusiasm and optimism. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. </para>

                            <para>.- I have said on other occasions and I say again now that I rise with great diffidence, not because of my innate modesty, but because I fully realize that what 1 say, and what is said by others, will not take us very far. It will have very little effect on the policy of the Government and on relations between Australia, Indonesia and Holland. But it is my job to speak now and I want to make my points as clearly as I possibly can so that the words taken down can be used by me, by the Labour movement, or by the little paper we publish for the purpose of promulgating our propaganda. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> said to me just now, " As a matter of fact, you might as well climb Mount Kosciusko and speak to the rocks, for all the avail it will be ". We are not on the air; we are speaking to just a few of our fellow senators - good fellows all - and " Hansard " is doing its duty by taking down our words. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>I certainly join with every other honorable senator who has spoken in congratulating the mover and seconder of this motion. To speak for the first time in this chamber is somewhat nerve-wracking, and our two friends did very well indeed, but I would have been more enthusiastic in my congratulations had I been congratulating two Labour men who would have given us a majority in this chamber. However, we are in the minority. The Government has the numbers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> has been elected Leader of the Government in the Senate, and1 we know his ruthlessness from the way in which he has acted in the past. He has smiled when he has said. " We have got the numbers, and numbers count". They will count during the next three years in securing the pass-age of the legislation which the Government desires to pass. Of course, the Government says that it has the people behind it and, therefore, is right in bringing forward again contentious legislation that was not passed during the last Parliament, when we had the numbers. According to the Speech of the Governor-General, the Government intends to introduce again its banking legislation, which will pass through this chamber without any amendment whatever. We on this side, of course, will speak against it, but what we say will not have the slightest effect on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> or the Government. </para>
                        <para>I would say that as far as Queensland is concerned, the Government has not got the backing of the people there. I have not studied the numbers in other States, because I could not get them, but in Queensland there was a majority of over 30,000 against the Government, if the Queensland Labour party and Australian Labour party votes were added together. I am not counting the votes given to Communists. </para>
                        <para>On an occasion such as this we always express our loyalty. An expression of loyalty is included in the Address-in-Reply before the Senate. We on this side of the chamber have no need to say much about it, because every one knows that the Labour movement throughout Australia is loyal to our Queen and the Royal Family. There is no question about that, and there is no need to stress the obvious. Personally, I think  -  I have said it before - that the Royal Family does a good job. Some people speak about the psychology of emotionalism, about the emotionalism that is developed as a result of a royal visit, but such emotionalism plays a good part, I suppose, in binding and unifying our Commonwealth. Even though it be only emotion, it plays a splendid part in maintaining the unity which is so essential in opposing those who would destroy the free world and establish some form of international communism. </para>
                        <para>There are also others playing their part in this matter of emotionalism. Although we might not agree with their actions or their speeches, I think that, on the whole, they are doing good because they are preaching the cause of righteousness. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> mention Moral Rearmament, and I have a reason for mentioning it. I feel that those people are doing good work in affecting the mental outlook of people who otherwise would come to the conference table, when they meet to settle differences, with a spirit of antagonism. This movement throughout the world in making a splendid effort to reduce that antagonism and to bring about a sensible approach to the questions that concern the world and the problems that are undoubtedly undermining the stability of the world. </para>
                        <para>We have a gentleman here now who is speaking to thousands of people. His mission is one that the psychologists tell us is a matter of emotionalism - arousing the emotions of the people - but he is speaking in the cause of righteousness. Whatever our views may be, we must agree that even if he is not doing any good, at least he is not doing any harm. But I should say that he will do a certain amount of good. </para>
                        <para>All these factors that may fall into the category of emotionalism have an influence on the minds of men and women, in the long run, for the good of the community. I feel that perhaps a greater service would be rendered if we could reach the minds of Khrushchev and many of the Russian people, Mao Tse-tung and many of the Chinese people, and many of the other dictators who are aiming at controlling this world in the interests of dictatorship. </para>
                        <para>Unfortunately, these emotional movements, if you so like to describe them, do not go as far as they might. I suppose the greater part of the problem confronting the world is coming from men who, with the backing of a few hundred thousand people, are able to dominate and control the minds of millions. The control of the mass mind will be one of the greatest problems of the future. Those who have studied psychology and who have read books on the subject know the great danger there is to the free world and to men who believe in freedom and liberty. Arising in the world there is a method of government which, in the hands of unscrupulous men, could have such power that it would dominate the people in. the interests of those who are their dictators. </para>
                        <para>We welcome royal visitors, of course, but when royal visitors have come and gone, when Moral Rearmament has done its , best and when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Graham</inline> has returned ito America, we of this nation will still be confronted with social, political and economic problems. We cannot .avoid those problems, and as .a Parliament we must face them. The great evangelist says there is no hope in .politics. Well, in our democracy, he has a perfect right to .express himself in that way. But personally, .1 think there is hope for the people of this world even in politics, because is it not political when the Prime Minister of Great Britain visits Khrushchev? I see great nope for the world when leaders like Macmillan and Khrushchev come together and talk in a reasonable way around the conference table apart from the influence of crowds and demagoguery. I do not agree there wim the great evangelist. </para>
                        <para>We know that much that happens in politics is bad. We know that for political preferment men will hide the truth and emphasize their own viewpoint. That, I suppose, is part of politics; it is the bad side of politics. But there is one thing about the Australian political world to which I direct attention and that is that, not to-day, but on other days the proceedings of this chamber are broadcast and it is possible for us to reach the people and for the people to hear the discussions that take place about many of the problems which worry us in the Parliament. That ls all to the good. </para>

                        <para>It is my opinion that, if we can avoid war for the next few years, there is every possibility of eternal peace from the viewpoint of atomic war and the like. That is my firm opinion, because there is growing up in Russia amongst the technicians and others who are controlling the economic destiny of that country a spirit of freedom which must be exercised in some way. That one way would be the granting of more and more political freedom to the people. You cannot destroy a desire for freedom in the human heart, and when in the course of the development of a country's economic system you have to train men fully and well, as they .are being trained in Russia, there must develop in their brains a , desir.e for something better than they have now in the way of political and economic freedom. </para>

I am not upholding that system, but we must not pull our own legs or .deceive .ourselves. It is now over 40 years since the revolution, and the great mass of the Russian people have become used .to the dominance of their leaders; but there is throughout Russia an undercurrent and a desire for freedom which must have their effect. </para>

They were very plain and straight-forward and did not beat about the bush. These people looked ahead for ten, fifteen, twenty, or even one hundred1 years, and saw the time coming when Australia would be under the domination of Japan. While I am speaking of this, I recall a statement by General Cariappa, who was the Indian representative in Australia a few years ago. I was at a function tendered to him when he was about to leave Australia. He said definitely, in a speech after a splendid repast, that Australia was part and parcel of Asia, and he likened Australia to a great mansion of many rooms, with the Australians occupying only one or two rooms and refusing the rest to other people. </para>
                        <para>That undoubtedly was a penetrating illustration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and1 it certainly had its effect on the minds of General Cariappa'. audience. In dealing with these matters, we have to realize that what is important is not so much what we here in Australia are thinking, and not so much what our beliefs and our political fancies are, but what the millions - or at least the leaders of the millions - in Asia are thinking. We cannot possibly ignore the development that has taken place, say, in China, where thousands of young men have attended the universities, studied the history of their country and know how it was controlled and dominated by Europeans and others. To-day, according to many Australians - some from this side and some from the other - who have been there, there is a feeling right throughout China that the people are fighting for China. Undoubtedly, they are being misled and misinformed by their Communist press. They have turned bitterly against America, which was a great friend of China some years ago. To-day, America is public enemy No. 1 of nearly all the citizens of China. These are forces and facts that wc cannot gainsay. Therefore, when we come to study questions of this kind we have to study them not only from our own parochial point of view but also from the point of view of the world situation. </para>
                        <para>That brings me to the matter of Indonesia. I have listened to various speakers during the recent debates and t must admit that, so far as I am concerned, I have much to learn about Indonesia. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> who made a fine speech on the subject last week, the Australian people have been negligent in their approach to the Indonesians. The honorable senator pointed out that it would have been a splendid thing had our Prime Minister, instead of by-passing Indonesia, seen fit to call there on his way to or from the United Kingdom, and that it would also be a splendid thing if we had a greater knowledge of Indonesia than we in fact have. After all, Indonesia is a barrier against the southern progress of Communist Chin.i. While I am speaking of barriers, I point om that America and Great Britain failed to develop a barrier to the north of India. Many years ago, the Tibetans made clear to the United States of America and Great Britain that some action should be taken to conserve their independence; but unfortunately, their appeal fell on deaf ears. The Tibetans now have been conquered by China and the gate to India is being opened. </para>
                        <para>In Indonesia, the Communist party is growing. I think that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> who told us recently that the party was not so powerful there as some people thought, but Denis Warner, in many of his articles, has warned Australia and the world that, as far as South-East Asia is concerned, there is a powerful and growing force which, aided and backed by Peking, undoubtedly will be such a colossal force in the near future that it may take more than the Indonesians to stop it. </para>
                        <para>In regard to this matter that has arisen in the last few days, I am not one who is going to do any great criticizing because I realize., as I think we all should realize, that in questions of diplomacy the truth is not always told, or perhaps to put it better, the truth does not always come to light. Personally, when I first read the statement by the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> 1 thought that we had made a diplomatic mistake. Were we compelled, or was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> compelled, to make such a full statement regarding our action in relation to the situation of West New Guinea and Indonesia? Was it imperative that the world should be told that Australia would withhold its hand? If the Dutch Wanted to hand over Indonesia to the Indonesians, well, that was their business, but why should Australia make it plain that we would not lift a hand or move in any direction if they wanted to do that? There was no need to do it. Whatever attitude may have been adopted in the conference hall, there is such a thing as bad publicity which gives rise to unrest throughout a given country. </para>
                        <para>Here in Australia, the action of the Government, whatever may be behind it, has undoubtedly developed in the hearts and minds of our people a grave unrest concerning this matter. No matter how slender it may be, this territory is a barrier between Communist China and Australia. The matter involves the question of defence, too. It is no use falsifying the situation or deceiving ourselves. The Australian people as a whole would like to see New Guinea in the trusteeship of Australia. With the development of modern international relationships, and with the growth of the United Nations, that is imperative and essential. Whether it may be legally right or wrong - an aspect about which our good friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> spoke, is beside the point. We have travelled far since the last war, and nations must realize that the days of colonialism have gone. We do not want to continue the system that operated adversely for many years for the colonial peoples but which undoubtedly meant millions of pounds for those who exploited them. To a degree, of course, the exploiters did good work in developing countries economically. But the question I want to ask, as far as the end of colonialism is concerned, is this: Have we or have we not a duty to Australia, and has not the free world a duty to itself, to deal with these questions in which there is a possibility of one colonial power handing over a people to another colonial power? </para>
                        <para>I think that Labour is right, that the returned soldiers are right, and that the many writers in the press are right, when they say that the Australian people should work to the end that we have in New Guinea a force and a power, not for colonialism, but for the best development of the country and the best advancement for its people. With all due respect to Indonesia, which is our friend, are we going to accomplish that by saying publicly that if there is a compact between Indonesia and Holland, we shall stand idly by and do nothing? </para>
                        <para>Personally, I do not know that we can do very much, and certainly no sensible person would advocate that any Australian should take up arms against Indonesia. Indonesia has stated that she will not use force to compel this change in colonial control, but I remind the Senate that conditions change very rapidly these days and before many years have passed it may be that force could be used by a government that would not respect the treaties made by the present government of Indonesia with Holland or any other country. We would be fools if we thought that simply because the present government signed a treaty that force would not be used to take control of western New Guinea, force might not be used when a change of government occurs. We have known treaty after treaty to be torn up and surely politically we are not children. Let us express our greatest regard for Indonesia, and let us hope for the friendliest of relationship between Indonesians and ourselves. Personally, I thought it might have been better if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> and those associated with him had fully explained our position behind closed doors. Of course, they may have done so; I do not know. </para>
                        <para>Do we know what the Dutch are saying? Have we been told of the views and opinions of the Duch in their approach to this particular question? No! We are in the dark, and the people of Australia are in the dark. But last week there appeared in a Brisbane newspaper an extremely interesting article - I suppose it was syndicated throughout Australia - under the caption " Dutch Prepare N.G. Natives to Decide Own Future " Possibly the few honorable senators who are listening to me have read the article. It stated, in the course of a column or two, that the Dutch officials were anxious to apply the principles of closer technical, education, and medical cooperation to the affairs of western New Guinea. After saying this, which, mark you, was rather disturbing to me, the article stated that a senior official had said - </para>

The officials there are doing good work, although I understand from this article that the development of a certain area inhabited by 200,000 natives is lagging because of a lack of funds. The article went on to say - </para>

                        <para>I come now to the matter of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> as Minister for the Navy. I have great respect for the honorable senator, especially after seeing in the Brisbane " Courier-Mail " a photograph of him swinging in a bo'sun's chair as he transferred from one ship to another during naval exercises outside Sydney heads recently. I am sorry that I was not at the shivoo; I would have liked to be there. I repeat, I am sorry that I was not there, because it was a good show. I do not want it to be thought that the remarks I am about to make are personal. During my 27 years' association with this desirable club - for which we are well paid for being members - I may have fallen from grace occasionally, but I think my friends on both sides of the chamber will acknowledge that I have tried to avoid making personal remarks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> has been selected by the Prime Minister for the Navy portfolio, and the numerical strength of the Cabinet has been raised from seventeen, as it was during the Chifley government's term of office, to twenty-two. I have noticed quite a number of criticisms in the mess concerning the enlargement of the Cabinet. That brilliant journalist, Harold Cox - really and truly he is above the average- </para>

He was asked some questions as to Australia's strength in relation to Indonesia and other nations. He painted a sad and doleful word picture of the position and, having regard to his calibre, one was forced to believe his statements. He distinguished between the big conflagration that might occur between the mighty forces of the United States of America and Russia, and the small fire that may burst into flame as a result of friction between Australia and other countries.  His  remarks were most disturbing not only to myself and my family, but also, I am sure, to the Australian people.

                        <para>We are all concerned in this matter. The decisions do not rest entirely with the Government and the few persons aspiring to become Cabinet Ministers. We are not sure whether to build up our Navy, Army and Air Force, or to let them go by the board and weaken them simply because we believe we will never be involved in an atomic war. Where does the Government stand? Does it believe that the danger of atomic war is over? If not, it is the Government's duty to see that our Navy, Army and Air Force are brought up to the highest pitch of efficiency. On behalf of trie citizens of Australia I ask the Minister for the Navy to answer these questions: What is the position regarding submarines? The recent display showed that we have two submarines on loan from Great Britain. What is the position in regard to spotting helicopters? What chance have we against an enemy such as Russia if she should ever declare war on Australia or the world? I am asking these questions, not merely for the sake of speaking, but because we are deeply concerned about the defence of Australia. The Minister is a knowledgeable man. Has he any knowledge of Russia's submarine strength in the area from Vladivostok to Australia? In, the event of war, will we be able to keep open our sea lanes? No- doubt the Minister is aware that the United States of America is developing " Polaris ", a submarine that will carry guns fitted with atomic warheads. That vessel will be able to stand 100 miles off a port and fire an atomic bomb into the heart of the city. Is he aware whether Russia has submarines similar to the " Polaris " which could blast any Australian city off the map? </para>
                        <para>The Government is absolutely hopeless in regard to civil defence. It is tragic that the Commonwealth Government can pass the buck to the States in this matter. Some of the military leaders of Great Britain have said that their organization would be effective to some extent in the event of an atomic war, but what is the position in Australia? We have no civil defence! To illustrate my point, I direct the attention of the few honorable senators listening to me to-day to the report of the commission of inquiry concerning the circumstances connected with the attack made by Japanese aircraft at Darwin on 19th February, 1942. Never was a more serious - I was about to say heart-rending - document ever published. I am sure that very few Australian people have read it. I shall quote one or two passages from the report which relate to the matters of preparedness, organization and leadership. On page 11. under the heading, "Conditions which Developed after the Raids ", this passage appears - </para>

Prior to the raid evacuation had been widely discussed. Very quickly rumours began to be spread and were readily believed. Houses were abandoned in haste. I myself observed in the Darwin Hotel tables upon which drinks remained half-consumed, letters started but not finished, papers strewn about, beds unmade in bedrooms, and other signs of a very hasty exit. In other places, T saw similar conditions. In one there were indications of a mail but partially opened. </para>

The Administrator, learning this, forbade the supply of petrol. Actually by some means many vehicles did proceed towards the south. Many people proceeded on foot, and others on bicycles. Even the municipal sanitary carts were pressed into service and for some days the town was without a sanitary service. The foreign element in the population was prominent in the attempt to escape. Business houses were closed and the civil life of the town practically ceased. </para>

If this country is to be safeguarded, there must be direction, organization and control in our cities. Knowing what happened at Darwin, knowing what happened in the various towns along the Queensland coast, I emphasize that highly organized civil defence is vital. Why, even on the Gold Coast, where houses and land are now being sold at prohibitive prices, where a man who bought a house from me for £4,000 is offering that same house for £15,000, people prepared to move inland. After the Darwin bombing, houses similar to the one I have mentioned could have been bought, together with furniture, for £150 or £200.

I said to  Colonel Spender,  " Have you studied the psychology of the situation? You know that thousands of people who could afford it left the seaside towns and went bush when a bomb dropped on Townsville and when a number of bombs destroyed many of our people and their property at Darwin. What is going to happen, for it is possible for a Russian submarine of the Polaris type to direct its power against Cairns or Townsville and blast such a city into hell? What is going to be the psychological effect of such a happening on the people of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne? When we know the effect of a comparatively small raid such as that on Darwin, what can v/e expect the psychological effect to be in such an event as I have visualized? " I do not say that it will happen, but it could happen and it is incumbent upon any government to do more than is being done to-day in connexion with civil defence.

                        <para>I wish to deal for a few moments with a subject that is very important indeed, because it relates to people who are now suffering severely, to people whose homes have been wrecked and whose property has been, destroyed. Fortunately, there was very little loss of life - I believe only one person lost his life - in the cyclone that struck Bowen, Ayr and Home Hill. The other day, I asked whether Cabinet had discussed the establishment of a national insurance scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> who replied to my question, is the arch exponent of private enterprise and when ones speaks of national insurance he shrivels up; he does not like it at all. He assured me that Cabinet had discussed the matter and had come to the conclusion that the Government could not do anything and that the matter would have to be left to the private insurance companies. It is my firm belief that in times of national disaster such as war. floods, huge bushfires or cyclones, we should have at our command a fund built up by contributions from people in all walks of life. The contributions could be be made by way of taxation, if that is thought preferable. After all, what is the difference between the tragedy of war and the tragedy of cyclone, or flood or the bushfires which have caused loss of life and property? Why should we differentiate? Why should we not see to it, as a nation, that part of the revenue we collect by way of taxation is set aside to bring succour to those who have been hardly dealt with by nature? I see no reason why we should not do so. </para>

                        <para>Many years ago the Queensland Government did a great job in establishing State insurance. I hold the view that insurance should be a national matter. Perhaps some day that will happen, but if our tory friends remain on the Government benches, it will not happen for a long while. I do hope that in the near future the Government will do something to alleviate the present unfortunate position, and make it no longer necessary for distressed people to depend upon the funds of charities. Of course, under the circumstances, it is splendid to see charitably minded persons coming forward in this way. Some give hundreds of pounds and some give but a few pounds, but their help is very real. Whenever a cyclone comes to the north coast - and there was one at Bowen not long ago - a fund is opened by the " Courier-Mail ". Tn time of war, when every one was in danger, this democratic nation of ours developed a war damage insurance scheme, but in peace-time it refuses to consider the alleviation of distress caused by flood, fire and cyclone. This nation ought to be ashamed of itself for refusing to deal with this matter communally. Assistance such as I have described is eminently necessary. I hope that the Government will do something in the very near future to alleviate the distress of the unfortunate people to whom I have referred. </para>

We have the Speech from the dais and then the very special resolution in which we join the mover and seconder in expressing loyalty to our most gracious Sovereign, beginning with the words, " We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled . . . ". Those of us who were privileged to be here when the Queen herself opened Parliament remember with special gratitude both  Her  Majesty coming to us as our Queen, the Queen of Australia, in Australia, and we also remember the very wonderful service which  His Excellency  the Governor-General has given to us since he first came to live among us.

We remember how she came among us, bringing us closer together, and renewing that wonderful feeling of unity with the Throne of which we are all so conscious. How important that unity is to the great Commonwealth family which previously we called the British Empire. As one studies the Speech further one realizes with pleasure that soon we shall have among us the Princess Alexandra of Kent. As a Queenslander, I am especially proud that on the occasion of the centenary of that State we should be so greatly honoured; that  Her </para>

                        <para>One hundred years is not long, considered in the light of history, but we may well be proud of what has been done in Queensland during that period. Our State has a proud record of achievement and it is fitting upon this occasion to pay tribute once more to the men and women who were our pioneers. I refer not only to the pioneers of the Commonwealth but to those who pioneered my own State. It must have been a very hard task in a new land, and we are indebted to them for the way of life and traditions which make for good living and a happy community. </para>
                        <para>I am also pleased to see that later this year the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association will hold its general conference in Australia. Some years ago I had the great privilege of attending a similar conference in Canada. Many other honorable senators have attended such conferences and all will agree that it is a wonderful experience. No one will deny the importance of people from different countries coming together to discuss matters which are of importance to the whole Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>The history of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is well worth recalling. It was formed in 1911 upon the occasion of the coronation of King George V., and was then known as the Empire Parliamentary Association. I think we can all imagine what a tremendous occasion it must have been. The association was born as a result of decisions at the historic assemblage at Westminster of members of the Parliaments of the dominions. They came from all the corners of the earth where our flag flies and formed this association because they believed that it would facilitate the exchange of information. They felt that closer understanding between parliamentary representatives in various parts of the Empire could help to strengthen the Empire. </para>
                        <para>T am reminded of a speech that I read many years ago. It was delivered by His Majesty King George V. Speaking of this very association he said, as I recall his words - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>This is an important association. It is important that men and women from the Empire should meet together and discuss their problems, because to know about a problem, to begin to understand a problem, is indeed the first step to solving  a  problem. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That, in itself, reveals the importance of the meetings of the association. It is not merely a conference. It is also a meeting of men and women from different parts of the world who believe in the same form of government and in the unity and importance of the link with the Throne. It is a meeting of representatives endeavouring to work for the betterment of their people. It is a meeting outside the conference halls as well as within them. The great thing about it is that each delegate gets to know the other a little better; each understands the problem a little better. As His Majesty so rightly said, when that stage is reached you have taken the first step towards solving the problem, towards helping the representatives of particular countries to acheve the betterment of their own people. T hope that when we have this meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in this country we will, as the host country, make it a memorable occasion for those who come to our shores. As a result of those deliberations, may we be able to make the world a better place because men and women have been enabled to understand better each other's needs. We have, during the years, had visits from people coming from within the Commonwealth and from other nations. Those visits have done a great deal, I believe, to cement friendships between Australia and other countries. Such friendships are surely very important from the viewpoint, not only of defence, but of the future well-being of the world. </para>
                        <para>Now let me turn to one or two other points in the Speech of  His Excellency.  I should like for a moment to refer to immigration. We have seen a very important advance in our immigration scheme during recent years. People have come from all over the world to live amongst us, and we are indeed pleased to know that they are settling down here and helping us to develop this great country. I think one of the most important things in our immigration scheme has been the great consideration, kindness and understanding which has been shown by all Ministers for Immigration and by the Department of Immigration itself. Immigration is a very human problem. The people concerned have many personal problems, and I should like to pay a tribute to the department, particularly to the senior officers, for the assistance that we have been given. Whenever we take an immigration problem to them, they remember that immigrants are people with very human needs and faced with very human problems. We are all interested to note that legislation will be introduced to simplify naturalization procedures under the Nationality and Citizenship Act and to do away with the issue of certificates of registration under the Aliens Act. We look forward always to legislation which will make the immigration scheme still more satisfactory. </para>
                        <para>I pay tribute to all those organizations forming the great Good Neighbour movement, whether they be governmental or non-governmental bodies. A person who comes to a strange new country is often very lonely. It is very difficult, I am sure, to settle down and take up the threads of life in a new land, in new surroundings and under new conditions. The Good Neighbour movement, through various church and charitable institutions and other agencies, has done more than anything else to promote the assimilation of New Australians into our community. </para>
                        <para>I am particularly interested in child immigration, and I was very pleased to see, as one of the guests of the Government at the recent Citizenship Convention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Fairbridge,</inline> the widow of the founder of the Fairbridge Farms scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fairbridge</inline> was still a young man when he died - he was only 39 - yet he gave so much of his life to the task of sending children to those parts of the Commonwealth where they could take up, in this case, farm work. They were children in difficult, lonely and, in many cases, unhappy circumstances. He sent them to new lands where they could eventually set up their own homes and live happy lives. We pay tribute to that great man, and we are indeed pleased to know that the scheme he initiated is playing a part in the immigration scheme of Australia to-day. </para>
                        <para>We also acknowledge with gratitude the work that is being done by our special welfare officers on the immigrant ships coming to Australia. Perhaps the very first contact people coming to Australia have with Australians is their contact with the welfare officers on the immigrant ships, from whom they hear of conditions in Australia. These officers are a tremendous help to the families who come to live amongst us. </para>
                        <para>I turn now to the subject of housing. His Excellency said - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>This financial year a record amount of approximately £80,000,000 is being provided by my Government for housing. This will enable the normal current demand to be met and, in addition, will permit a substantial reduction in the already diminished arrears. My Government will continue to encourage home ownership. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">The encouragement of home-ownership is very important. It is good to remind ourselves when we read those words that this Government has a record of achievement in housing of which it can well be proud. In the last nine years, the Government has provided 25 per cent, of all houses in Australia. That is a very good record indeed. It has also assisted people to own their own homes, with the result that to-day, as I understand, Australia is the greatest country of home-owners in the world. I also remind honorable senators of the Government's great record in the war service homes field. It has provided more war service homes than has all other previous federal governments. Those are achievements which mean a great deal to Australian families, because a home is surely one of the most important things that a family needs. There is, of course, a very great need for more housing, but I believe there «an be no better evidence of the Government's very real appreciation of the needs of the community when, at the commencement of the new Parliament, it says through  His Excellency  that it will find the record sum of £80,000.000 to continue its work in this very important field. </para>
                        <para>May I make a further point in connexion with housing. I have heard recently with pleasure that in certain areas where new housing settlements are being established by State housing commissions several units are to be provided for aged persons. I do hope that that is so. For a long time in this chamber I have advocated that in new housing areas a percentage of houses should be specially built and equipped for the use of aged couples or aged persons. That would be of tremendous help in solving the problems of some aged couples who are endeavouring to find suitable homes. They may be in good health for their age, anxious to help within the community, and anxious to live in their own homes. If in our housing schemes a percentage of home units could be set aside for aged persons, I believe it would be a tremendously important factor in solving this housing problem. </para>
                        <para>I now turn to another portion of His Excellency's Speech, in which he said - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>My Government proposes to meet the additional cost to unions of court-controlled ballots. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That is very important, because I believe that the excellent legislation dealing with court-controlled ballots in trade unions, introduced by this Government, has been responsible for the recent excellent record of industrial peace, which is very important in any community. When we brought in this legislation, honorable senators will recall the attack which came from the Opposition benches. However, I believe that this legislation has given to the trade unionist a weapon to fight Communist infiltration of his union, and in that way has assisted to bring about peace in industry and continuity of employment. Those two things are important. I am glad that further assistance is to be given by this Government to meet the cost to unions of conducting court controlled ballots. </para>
                        <para>May 1 also refer to the paragraph in  His  Excellency's Speech relating to the policy of keeping social services under constant review to ensure that they meet the needs of the changing circumstances of our growing population. I feel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as I have said before in this chamber, that there is a very great need for a conference to be held as soon as possible between government bodies and non-government organizations that work with our aged people. There are throughout the community wonderful church and charitable organizations, all sorts of welfare services, and other people who are working daily with aged people and who know the needs of the aged person who is living alone in his own home, in hospital or in an aged persons' home. </para>
                        <para>I pay tribute to the excellent work that is done by the Department of Social Services. Its officers are most helpful, sympathetic, understanding and untiring in their efforts to help these people. But I feel that, if a conference of the kind I have suggested were held, we could arrive  at a new approach to the great problem of the aged in our community and meet their needs to a greater degree. </para>
                        <para>I congratulate the Government upon its realization of the need for the special housing of aged persons and upon the way in which it has contributed to church and charitable organizations in the implementation of their excellent housing schemes; also upon the special distress and medical assistance it has given. </para>
                        <para>May I say that I should like to see very much more consideration given to the new science of gerontology, about which I have spoken before and which is concerned with the care of the aged and of their problems. I believe that, with the miracle of modern science and the splendid medical and hospital care that is given to people to-day, as the years go by the expectation of life will become very much greater. It is our duty as citizens to ensure that the added years that are given to the citizens of Australia are made as happy and as full of dignity and well-being as is possible. If we are to do that, we must do as other countries have done in ensuring the establishment of special geriatric wings and units at all major base hospitals. </para>
                        <para>In about November last I was privileged to meet one of England's greatest women doctors, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Marjorie</inline> Warren, of the Middlesex Hospital, to whom I have referred in this chamber and who was visiting Australia. She journeyed to this country to speak on the subject of gerontology at the Pan-Pacific Rehabilitation Conference in Sydney. She visited Queensland, and I was privileged to be the only lay person to attend the lecture she gave at the Medical School and to see a film of the work that she was doing at the Middlesex Hospital in assisting people who had had strokes and become bedridden or who had badly broken legs and hips - aged persons who, without this special care given by a geriatric unit, would probably have been bedridden for the rest of their lives. We saw how these aged persons were able to leave their hospital beds and return to live happily with their families for added years of life. As medical science approaches its objective of adding to the expectation of life of our older citizens, surely it is our duty to adopt the slogan " Let added years be happy years and not just years of existence ". They are the points that 1 should like to leave with my colleagues on this occasion. </para>
                        <para>So we look forward to the first year of office of this Parliament. Incidentally, it is a year of history for Queensland; but unfortunately it has been marred by the tragedy of a cyclone. 1 tender my sympathy to those who have suffered. Together with my colleagues, I ask the Government to give every possible help to those people. The force of nature is a terrifying thing; if one has not experienced it, one cannot imagine what it is like. But we shall observe those who have been affected rebuild their homes and start once more with that courage that was displayed by their pioneering forefathers. I repeat that I hope every possible assistance will be given through governments and in every other way to the people who have suffered in this disaster. </para>
                        <para>I look forward1 to the term of this Parliament with confidence and hope because I know this Government will consider the needs of all sections of the community, that it stands for those things which we as British people believe in - indeed, that it will always endeavour to ensure that the people of Australia enjoy a prosperous, happy and very successful life and that this nation takes its place amongst the nations of the world. I know that the Government Wil consider the needs of every member of the community, that it realizes its great responsibility, and that it realizes it has been given a mandate to ensure for those who live within our shores the best possible future. </para>
                        <para>I have great pleasure in supporting the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. </para>

                                I quite naturally associate myself with honorable senators on this side of the chamber in supporting the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I, too, congratulate the mover of the motion,

                                upon their maiden speeches in the Senate. I think they are due for extra commendation because of the fact that they had such a nebulous and empty Speech to direct their thoughts to.
                            </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Quite a number of those who have spoken on both sides of the chamber during this debate have dealt very extensively and very  interestingly with affairs in Indonesia and western New Guinea. However, I do not intend to go to Dutch New Guinea; I intend to stay right here in Australia. I do not want to minimize the importance of affairs in Indonesia and Dutch New Guinea, but I think the first essential for us is to deal with bread and butter issues - matters which concern the people of Australia generally. As 1 said earlier, the Speech delivered by  His Excellency  the Governor-General was quite empty and nebulous, lt was a speech prepared by a lazy, arrogant and carefree government. It was prepared for the Governor-General by a government that was assured of its success before the general election campaign started, because of the activities of its latest satellite. I speak of the disgruntled little party, the Democratic Labour party, lt was obvious right from the opening of the campaign that the Liberal party, together with the cuckoo party, was prepared to rest on its laurels - if they could be called laurels. The Government knew that it would be returned because of the support of the satellite of the Liberal party. Therefore, we have really nothing in the Address delivered by  His Excellency  to which we can reply. Nevertheless, I wish to remind the Government of some of its many omissions, and also of some of its sins of commission. </para>

                                <para>-  Because it is still with us. Throughout the Governor-General's Speech, there is not one word of any proposal by the Government to deal with the unemployment that exists in this country to-day. At the end of January, no fewer than 85,000 people were registered as unemployed. When we consider that there are thousands of others who are not registered but who also are unemployed, the real figure probably is more like 120.000 or 130,000 people, quite a big army. If we include the dependants of those unemployed people, it means that there is a large army in Australia to-day dependent on the dole. </para>

To the person who is out of a job, his unemployment is 100 per cent. Let me read to honorable senators what I have said in this chamber before. It bears repeating. Not so many &gt;.-ars ago the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made the definite statement that we must have a pool of unemployed in order to discipline the workers. He still believes in that, and the supporters of the Government believe in it, too.

                        <para>It cannot be said that the Melbourne " Age " and the " Canberra Times " are at all favorably disposed towards Labour. Recent headlines in the Melbourne " Age " were " 50,000 more seek jobs than offered ", and " Big rise in jobless registered ". </para>
                        <para>I do not suggest that conditions now are comparable with those of years gone by, but we have to guard against any deterioration. Because there are many national projects that need to be undertaken in this country to-day, not one person should be unemployed. Such works include the national roads scheme that has been suggested, transport schemes, water conservation, and the building of homes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin has told the Senate that this Government has spent more on housing than any other Australian government. We know that that is only a half truth. When one considers the relative values of money, it can be seen how ridiculous such a statement is. Admittedly, more money is being spent on housing to-day than ever before, but regard must be had to the relative values of money. In order to refresh the minds of honorable senators. let me refer to some of the conditions that obtained in Australia only a few years ago, before World War IT. Just before the outbreak of the war, the food dole for a single man was 8s. 6d. a week; for a married man and his wife it was 15s. 6d.; for a married man, a wife and one child it was the munificent sum of 20s. 6d.; and for a married man with a wife and two children it was 2 ls. 6d. It should not be forgotten that at that time the basic wage was £4 2s. a week. lt may be said that the unemployed to-day also receive unemployment benefit, but it must be remembered that while the basic wage then was £4 2s. a week, to-day it is more than £13. The amount that an unemployed married man receives at the present time, therefore, is no more, relatively speaking, than was paid to an unemployed man in 1939. </para>

                                <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting, I mentioned the continued existence in Australia of a big army of unemployed - far too big an army for the Government to be complacent about the position. I also mentioned that there are many national projects that should be commenced and completed in order to keep everybody in this country fully employed'. This is a very serious matter when one considers that, even on the admission of the Government, at the end of January, 85,000 persons were registered as unemployed. This matter cannot be disposed of merely by saying that that is only a small percentage of the work force. </para>

                            referred to the condition of the roads. Of course, as everybody knows the roads throughout Australia are in a very bad state of repair. Many thousands of miles of our roads need to be rebuilt. The various 'bodies such as the Victorian Country Roads Board are doing a wonderful job with the money that is available to them. This Government cannot keep saying that road making and maintenance are State responsibilities because, as I have mentioned before, the States are dependent on the Commonwealth Government for the finance necessary for road building.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline>
                            was very emphatic that roads are a State responsibility. He quoted figures of the casualties on the roads, and said that this was a national tragedy and a national responsibility. I point out that the roads themselves are responsible for thousands of deaths in Australia. In. a few minutes, I shall cite figures of casualties due entirely to faulty roads - not excessive speed, drink, or anything else. Before I do so, 1 shall dispose of another matter.

                        <para>I return to the vital question of roads. We all know that throughout Australia maintenance work and the construction of new roads are badly needed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> has referred to a proposal by New South Wales that an amount of £350,000,000 be spent on the roads over a period of fifteen years. The honorable senator emphasized the necessity for good roads and implied that the New South Wales Labour Government had made this suggestion in order to cover up for failing to do the job it should have done. Of course, we are used to that kind of statement in this chamber. It was made frequently in relation to Queensland roads when Labour was in office in that State. Day after day wc heard derogatory remarks concerning the then Queensland Labour Government. </para>
                        <para>As anybody who does much travelling knows very well, the roads are not being properly maintained, not through the fault of the States, but because they lack the necessary finance to do the job properly The various authorities in Victoria are doing as much as they can with the finance that is made available to them. To-day, many roads consist of ribbon strips of bitumen with numerous potholes and having broken or serrated edges. Many are highly dangerous, as will be seen from the figures I shall cite of casualties on the Australian roads attributable to faulty road conditions. The  chairman  of the Australian Road Safety Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> G. Paterson, has stated that at least one member of the average family is doomed to be either hurt or killed on the roads. He attributes the cause of road accidents to incompetence, indifference and intoxication. Last year there were 2,042 fatalities, 46,773 persona] injuries, and 93,480 reported accidents. Road accidents now affect about 50.000 Australian families each year. He also added that, on the basis of distance travelled, the chances of motor cycle riders and pillion passengers being killed or injured were ten times as great as those of other motorists. </para>
                        <para>These figures are very revealing. They have come from the Australian Road Safety Council, and are the latest figures available. During the year ended 31st December, 1956, there were 37,843 accidents involving casualties, due entirely to faulty road's, in which 2,165 people were killed and 48,885 injured. Of these, there were 704 accidents involving casualties due to road surfaces being too loosely gravelled, in which 20 persons were killed and 1,022  injured. There were 805 accidents attributable to wet and slippery road surfaces, in which 34 people were killed and 1,142 injured. Obstructions on the road1' accounted for 138 accidents, in which two persons were killed and 169 injured. There were 494 accidents attributable to other road faults, in which 18 persons were killed and 682 injured, making a total due to faulty roads alone of 2,141 accidents involving casualties, in which 74 persons were killed and 3,015 injured. Those figures indicate that the Commonwealth Government should make more money available to the States so that the proposal submitted by the New South Wales Government for a national roads scheme - a scheme to apply throughout the Commonwealth with particular emphasis on main roads linking capital cities - could be implemented. The figures I have quoted apply to 1956. To indicate that the number of casualties resulting from faulty roads remains more or less static, I shall quote figures for 1954, giving merely the totals and not going into detail. The total number of accidents was 6,192; accidents involving casualties amounted to 2,298; 73 persons were killed and 3,082 were injured. Those figures indicate that the position has not improved. </para>
                        <para>One has only to travel on the roads to realize the dangers to be faced. Although main country roads have been improved in parts, according to the finances available to the States, invariably one finds that to save a few shillings roads narrow at culverts and bridges. What a contrast to the roads in countries like Holland and Germany which I had the privilege of visiting not long ago! In those countries one can travel on four-lane roads without encountering narrow bridges or level crossings. In Australia we are confronted with dangerous level crossings that could be eliminated if the Commonwealth Government were to exercise a small amount of insight and courage, make more money available to the States and implement a nation-wide roads scheme. Although the actual responsibility for the construction of roads rests with the States, there could be some co-ordination on a national basis. Although repeated attempts have been made in that direction, all efforts have failed because the Commonwealth has said that finance is not available. </para>
                        <para>I shall quote an interesting passage from a booklet which gives a ten-year plan for roads in Victoria - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The " target " estimate provides for devoting nearly £90,000,000 to bring the 14,421 miles of C.R.B. roads as now declared (State highways, main roads &amp;c.) up to date in strength, width and serviceability. Short examples of the type of work needed have been embodied in recent years in urgent reconstruction of the very worst old sections. These scattered samples are sandwiched between long lengths of obsolete and patched-up sections which deficiencies the estimated programme is designed to remove in systematic fashion. </para>
                            <para>The dust, corrugations and potholes inseparable from the gravel surfacing which still forms 43 per cent, of the system would be eliminated on 8,027 miles by sealing with bitumen. </para>
                            <para>There are at present 1,291 miles with a 6 ton load limit including 541 miles of State highways. These weak sections which seriously restrict transport would be strengthened to carry the full gross load permissible under the Motor Car Act. </para>
                            <para>A vigorous bridge replacement policy is included so as to remove load restrictions which apply on many weak old bridges. Drivers would no longer be confronted with the " narrow bridge " signs now so common along these roads at structures whose handrails have generally been smashed to pieces by traffic. These bridges would allow for safe passing of opposing streams of traffic. </para>
                            <para>One of the largest items is provision for widening narrow pavements for hundreds of miles where worn edges and rough shoulders prevail along bitumen surfaces in spite of constant patrol work. The fact is that reconstruction has fallen a long way behind the increase in traffic. It has taken five years to widen out the narrow old pavement to 24 feet for 36 miles of the Princes Highway between Dandenong and Traralgon, one of the most important and densely trafficked sections. The plan provides for completion of the remaining 46 miles. On the Hume Highway where so far only 55 miles have been similarly treated 134 miles remain to be widened in the ten-year period, a vitally necessary improvement on this heavily trafficked route. On other major routes old sealed pavements with a width of only 12 feet or 16 feet must be widened to 18 feet or 20 feet as required to enable traffic to manoeuvre with reasonable speed and facility. </para>
                            <para>On numerous steeper hills and at dozens of crests double traffic lines have had to be placed to restrict overtaking. The worst of these would be eliminated by adding " Slow lanes " for uphill traffic and by regrading crests. </para>
                            <para>Scores of open floodways through which traffic must splash its way on primary roads would be raised and culverts provided. At certain important river crossings where flood waters still block or impede traffic for several days at a time bridges would be provided. </para>
                            <para>There are still 581 open railway crossings on our main roads and State highways. A programme of elimination of open and gated crossings has been commenced with limited special  funds. To these the Board is called upon to add substantial contributions, which are included -in the estimated requirements. </para>

I understand that to-morrow night banking legislation will be introduced in another place. Only last year we defeated that legislation, but since then an election has been held. Immediately the results were known the press carried banner headlines telling us that the banking legislation was again to be presented to Parliament, this time in a more severe form. The bankers are shrewder now than they were a few years ago. They have been content to hasten slowly but now they have the whips out and have put the screws on this Government which is the servant and the slave of the financial oligarchy. The Government undoubtedly will fall into line. The Government is going to do that because its supporters depend on these people for their election expenses.

                                <para>- Whenever there is a crisis it will be found that the privatebanks are very active. The basic policy of the private banks to-day is exactly what it was during the crash in 1890 when thousands of people were ruined and again, in the 1930's when we were suffering froma depression. The basic policy of the private banks never alters and, because it never alters, it is relevant now for me to remind honorable senators of what will happen if the private banks get control again. What happened in 1924? The war governments had given the associated banks the right to draw Commonwealth notes without any gold payment or deposited security. The mechanism of this scheme, and the way it operated, were set forth in detail on 13th June. 1924, by the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, whom I should prefer to call " Blank Page ". For all notes drawn under the scheme, the banks had to pay interest at rates varying between 3 and 4 per cent. If Government supporters would only listen to what I have to say they will see something of the manipulations of the private banks. </para>

                        <para>On the sixth War Loan of 1918 the interest rate was 3 per cent. Under the war gratuities scheme, it was 4 per cent. A total of £6,000,000 in war gratuities had to be paid in cash. The Government arranged wilh the banks to pay out, and charge it on a <inline font-style="italic">5$</inline> per cent, loan basis. For this, the banks had the right to draw Commonwealth note* to an account paid to ex-soldiers. Thus the banks paid out nothing, and scooped the difference between the 4 per cent, notes and the <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent. loan. </para>
                        <para>The banks were not satisfied with all this. They did not, in fact, draw the notes, and pay the stipulated 4 per cent. They operated on their right to draw as if the notes were actually in their own vaults. Thereby they avoided interest payments to the Government, and upon these rights issued credits and drew interest from the Government and the general public. </para>
                        <para>In 1920,. the right to issue notes passed from the. Treasury to the Note Issue Board. The banks, continued to exercise their rights and on behalf of those rights increased their bank-manufactured cheque currency. On 23rd1 June, 1923, these rights to draw totalled £8,000,000. The board demanded that the banks should exercise their rights -draw the notes, and pay interest thereon. The banks refused to do so. Early in 1924 the banks demanded that these rights should1 be extended by another £3,000,000. The  chairman  of the board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Garvan, stated that the rights were equivalent to an issue of notes to the banks without interest. He described the proposition as madness. The then Treasurer upheld his view, but the demand of the banks was granted. </para>
                        <para>On 14th October, 1924, the newspaper* announced that the associated banks had delivered their ultimatum and had won on every point. The Government had thus acknowledged defeat. The terms imposed by the banks were, first, that they were to have the right to draw another £10,000,000, and that no interest was to be paid1 on this. Interest amounting to 4 per cent, was to be paid on notes actually drawn. As I have pointed out, they did not draw the notes, but merely operated on their right to draw. On the same date the Melbourne " Herald " stated that traders and others were unable to obtain credit, on the most adequate security, at any rate of interest. The apologists for the associated1 banks announced that the banks would now release credit to the public at reduced rates. The day after the £10,000,000 concession was obtained the banks increased their rates by another 10s. per cent. This was tantamount to imposing an additional levy of £750,000 a year- on Australian exports. </para>

Therefore, Australia's oversea interest bill could only be paid from fresh overseas, loans.. This left the banks with their oversea money to finance the flood of imports. This accusation amounted to an indictment- of the associated banks, as conspirators against the public interest. When the. question was put to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> who- was; then, the Prime Minister, at Lithgow, he replied, " I have yet to hear a satisfactory answer.

                        <para>If the " Little <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Echoes</inline> " on the other side of the chamber are prompted to remind mc that that is a long time ago I would repeat - and I shall keep on repeating - that the- basic approach of private finance is- the same to-day as it always was. Honorable senators can recall many instances of the banks' arrogance. In 1914 the English pound note had on it a promise to pay in gold. On the outbreak of war there was a rush on the banks. Banks cannot, of course, pay out when there is a rush. On this occasion they obtained from the British Government a three-day banking holiday - fixed by legislation. During the interval the printing presses were put to work and they printed the famous John Bradbury notes which had on them merely the words " legal tender ". After the Government had protected the banks by declaring a three-day holiday, the banks lent the Government money at the current rate of interest. </para>
                        <para>If one goes back to 1890 one finds thai thousands of people were ruined because of the actions of private financiers The actions of Government supporters to-night give some indication of what their attitude will be when the new banking legislation comes before this chamber. That legislation amounts to selling out again to private financiers, whose dictates the Government is always ready to obey. Of course, it owes its very existence to funds provided by those institutions and by the physical effort which they produced, in 1949 especially, in having the Government re-elected. I shall have a lot more to say on this subject when the banking legislation comes before us, for I can tell Government supporters a great deal about the banks. Even at this late hour I would appeal to them not to do anything to lessen the strength of the Commonwealth Bank, the greatest institution that this country has for doing good. </para>
                        <para>National projects such as the improvement of our roads and standardization of railway gauges should be undertaken urgently They will not only promote the welfare of the people but would be justified from a defence angle alone. One could mention many other important projects. On present indications it would seem that, if the banking legislation goes through, the Government will be carrying on a scorched earth policy such as it has adopted since 1949 and will continue to give away the people's assets to the vested interests whom it represents. </para>

                                <para>- I do. It seemed to me to contain a deep note of annoyance because the banking legislation will once more be introduced in this place. But surely that annoyance should not be directed at the Government, nor at the banks. It should be directed, if he feels annoyance at all, at the Australian people, who, in the last election, knowing what they were doing, knowing that this banking legislation would be re-introduced, still gave such great endorsement to that legislation and to the Government which introduced it. That that is so is quite clear as soon as we examine the history of this legislation. When it was first introduced, it was discussed in great detail here, in the press and in another place. It was discussed clause by clause, so that everything it intended to do was known withou-t question to the Australian people. I admit that on the second occasion the Opposition in this place refused to allow it even to be discussed, but it had been discussed previously. The people knew it would be brought up again and they endorsed it. So let the honorable senator direct his annoyance at the Australian people. </para>

Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> Labour government, led by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> if it felt that its desired actions for overcoming the economic difficulties of that time were being frustrated, had one clear course and one clear duty, lt could have taken the course which has been taken before now by this Government when it has come up against the same frustration. That course was to seek a double dissolution and take its plans to the people of Australia to see if they would endorse them. The Labour government at that time did not do that. It was within its competence, and its competence alone, to do so, but, having not done so, let members of the Labour party not now attempt to evade responsibility for their lack of action. </para>

                        <para>I now wish to move to a consideration of something which has been discussed at length in this debate before, namely, the statement on Indonesia issued in the form of a communique in this country some days ago. In considering the attack made on this communique by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition in this place, I should like to begin by going over the facts of the Indonesian situation as it has developed since the war. You will remember, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> immediately the war finished the Dutch Government and the insurgent government in Indonesia came into conflict as to which was the proper authority to govern an aggregation of islands known as Indonesia. That conflict developed into quite severe fighting, which was eventually stopped at the instigation of the then Labour Government. Negotiations then took place which resulted in a transfer of sovereignty from the Dutch Government to the Indonesian Government. There was on that occasion a negotiated transfer of sovereignty with the full blessing of the then Labour Government, and, indeed, at the initiation and instigation of that Government, which has taken credit for it on more than one occasion since then in this chamber and in another place. </para>
                        <para>What was this tranfer of sovereignty? Was it sovereignty over one people, over one land? Of course it was not not. It was sovereignty over the Celebes, Java, Sumatra, Amboina, the Halmaheras and an aggregation of islands with different races. Whether that was right or wrong, the point I wish to make is that this transfer of sovereignty over many different races in many different islands was undertaken at the instigation of a then Labour government. Consequently I find it very difficult to understand how the Leader of the Opposition can say now that it is entirely wrong for any such transfer of sovereignty to take place and that it is completely against the tenets of the United Nations. But still he does say that. In the face of the past record, he says that if there should be a negotiated agreement under which Holland of its own free will gave up sovereignty over West New Guinea, that would be contrary to the spirit of the United Nations and Australia should oppose it. </para>
                        <para>I hope that some future  speaker  on the Opposition side in this debate will go a little more fully into that statement and explain how Australia should oppose such a transfer. Should we oppose it by sending troops to prevent the transfer of sovereignty negotiated between Holland and Indonesia, if it were to take place? I do not think we should. If honorable senators opposite want to oppose the transfer, let them tell us whether we should do that. If not, how should we oppose it? Should we go to the United Nations, perhaps, and say, " Here is a country which had sovereignty over a portion of an area formerly known as Indonesia. It has negotiated freely, and in proper conformity with international principles, an agreement to hand over administration to Indonesia. We want you, the United Nations, to prevent that negotiated agreement from coming into force. We want you to send troops, or somehow or other stop this transfer of sovereignty from taking place, in spite of the desires of the country which has sovereignty and the country which wishes to obtain it". </para>

                                <para>-  I now come to the point that has just been raised by the honorable senator. He says, quite rightly, that there is no need to be over-anxious to support it. In this communique, which has been attacked by the Leader of the Opposition in this place, by the Leader of the Opposition in another place and by newspaper leader-writers, there is no suggestion anywhere that this country is going to support such a negotiation. Indeed, it is made perfectly clear that this country now, as always, supports the retention of Dutch rule in western. New Guinea, subject to the right of the Dutch to withdraw if they want to do so. This country is not urging, and will not urge, either Holland or Indonesia to negotiate; but in reply, 1 imagine, to the Indonesian Foreign Minister coming along and saying, " Well, we understand your attitude. We understand that you do not want us there, but is your attitude so intransigent that, if Holland freely gets out, you will still oppose any s".:ch agreement? " it simply says, " We shall not oppose it, provided Holland is willing and thinks it to 'her interest to retire ". There is no question of supporting it, and there is still no answer as to how any opposition could be effective, anyway. </para>

                        <para>The last matter upon which I wish to touch to-night -is one which in the past, perhaps, has been regarded as being something that should not be spoken about too openly, but one that I think should be spoken about openly so that all may fully understand what the attitude of Australia now is. I refer to what has been called the White Australia policy. I have noticed lately statements emanating from various groups throughout the country advocating a quota system in Australia. It seems to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> the arguments adduced in support of that proposal have not been carefully thought out and that the results which would be likely to follow if the proposal were accepted have not been properly anticipated. </para>
                        <para>We are told that it would soothe the pride of those who are now kept out of Australia in some degree if a quota system were to be introduced, but surely it is self-evident, even in the minds of those who advocate such a system, that what they are saying is that we should have a quota system for coloured people only. There is no suggestion of a quota system for English people, or for Americans or Canadians. I repeat that it is quite clear that what they mean is a quota system for people of colour only. How any one can claim that that still is not differentiation to the same degree as it ever was is more than I can understand. </para>
                        <para>I believe there are many people of the countries to our north who would make, and in some cases are making, eminently good Australian citizens and who have a contribution to make to the wealth of this country. But I believe the way in which they should come here is the way in which they are now coming here - that is, that each case should be judged on its merits and that, above all, care should be taken to see that there does not develop in this country, as have developed in other countries, including Great Britain, colonies of people with a skin of different colour from that which we have. The Australian people can assimilate - and are assimilating - and can be friendly with many Asians who wish to come here and be citizens. But I fear that nothing would be more calculated to inculcate a colour consciousness, which Australia has not got, than for there to be in the cities of this country thousands or even tens of thousands of people of other nationalities living in little groups on .their own as they would if they came in under a quota system and if each case was not judged on 'its merits. </para>
                        <para>I felt I should say that, while I have the belief I have outlined, that is, that thousands of Asians can and should come here, each case being judged on its own merits, those who carelessly advocate a quota system will do more harm than good to the cause they seek to further. </para>

                            <para>. - It is my intention to-night to touch upon a matter that has given .me some considerable concern over a long period of time. I refer to the employment situation. In doing so, I direct attention to the news release of the Department of Labour and National Service which made a review of the employment situation as at the end of January last. The first paragraph of the news release refers to the seasonal fall in employment in Queensland and the continued registration of .school leavers entering the labour market for the first time. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>We all realize, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> that the age of children leaving school in the various States varies from fourteen to sixteen years. It seems rather ironical that governments have not paid particular regard to the needs of those children as they leave school. Apparently no provision has been made by this Government to meet that situation. That is a scandalous state of affairs. It demonstrates to me the lack of foresight of this Government in providing employment possibilities for the Australian work force. It is scandalous, too, that in Australia to-day there should be a considerable number of persons unemployed. </para>
                        <para>The volume of unemployment in this country ought to cause everybody considerable concern. According to the department's news release, at 30th January last, 81,901 persons were unemployed, which represented an increase of more than 17,000 since 24th December. In other words, in approximately five weeks the employment situation deteriorated to such a degree that an extra 17,000 people became unemployed. We find that at the end of January last year the number of unemployed persons was approximately 74,000. </para>
                        <para>I think it is reasonable to suggest that, with such a large number of people unemployed, the Australian economy must be suffering. We note that included in the work force of Australia, which is estimated to be approximately 4,000,000 people, are employers and self-employed persons. So the figures published by the department are a complete misrepresentation of the true position. I do not think employers should be included in the work force or be taken into account in assessing the number of unemployed. I have taken out some figures relating to the number of persons who have registered as .unemployed and I find that the trend is for the number to increase. Going back to June, 1957, there were approximately 52,500 persons unemployed at that time, whereas in June, 1958, the number was slightly in excess of -67,000, a considerable increase in a period of twelve months, ft is significant that in the period of only seven months, from June, 1958, to January, <inline font-style="italic">1959,</inline> there were 81,901 unem-ployed. </para>
                        <para>Let us consider the loss, of earnings of those unemployed people. Going back to 1957, and basing the calculation on an average weekly wage of £14, we find that the total weekly loss of wages was £731,000. Coming to June, 195.8, we find that the loss of wages was £940,000 a week. Again, I have taken an average wage of £14 a week, a very conservative estimate, because the average Australian wage is in fact well in excess of that amount. Taking the figure for the seven months to which I have referred, the loss over a period of twelve months would be considerable. In January, 1959, the figure would have jumped to £1,446,000. That is only the loss of wages to the worker, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President.</inline> In addition, the loss of wages would represent a considerable blow to the economy of the country. If that trend is allowed to continue we shall find ourselves in a very sorry state so far as the economic condition of the workers is concerned, and probably also so far as the economy of the country is concerned. </para>
                        <para>At 31st January last, there were 31,486 persons receiving unemployment benefit. Working on the basis on which I worked previously, we find that those persons receiving unemployment benefit would be losing some £441,000 a week in wages. I feel that I have said enough on that point to demonstrate quite clearly the serious situation which has developed as a result of unchecked unemployment. </para>
                        <para>A matter that gives me serious concern is the degree of mechanization which we are facing in Australia to-day, and the advent of automation. When we couple those factors with the unemployment figures to which I have just referred, it can be seen that we do not face a very happy situation. In fact, it is a situation which must cause grave concern, particularly to members of the trade union movement and supporters of ,the Australian Labour party. I appreciate that we cannot expect so many members on the Government side of the Parliament to be greatly sympathetic in this respect, because as yet they have never been particularly sympathetic towards the just claims of the workers for higher .margins, basic wage increases or improved working conditions. My experience in the arbitration court has taught me that that is so. Whenever we have gone to the court for an increased marginal rate, an increase ot the basic wage, or better working conditions, we have found that the employers have fought tooth and nail to defeat the workers and keep them from obtaining conditions that they were justly entitled to have. </para>
                        <para>On the subject of automation, I wish first to refer to a statement made by a gentleman by the name of Norbert Wiener, of the United States of America, in 1955. At that time, there was a very bad recession in employment in the United States. I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wiener</inline> is regarded as one of the creators of automation. He said - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>Let us remember that the automatic machine, whatever we think of any feelings it may have or may not have, is the precise economic equivalent of slave labour. Any labour which competes with slave labour must expect the economic conditions of slave labour. It is perfectly clear that this will produce an unemployment situation in comparison with which the present recession, and even the depression of the 'thirties, will seem a pleasant joke. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">If that gentleman's forecast proved to be correct - and there is no doubt that it could prove to be so - and coupling the effect of automation and high mechanization with the already large degree of unemployment, I think it is time that we took stock of our position in this regard. </para>
                        <para>I do not wish to indulge in a long dissertation on the machines which have been introduced in various forms into industry throughout the world, but I feel it desirable that I should refer to a number of those which operate at present, in order to give an idea of the situation which we in Australia will have to face when automation makes greater inroads into our industry. For instance, the British Railways have installed an electronic computer which works out the wages of 10,000 employees at their locomotive works at Swindon. It is supposed to be the first machine of its kind in the world. It is capable of feeding, processing and punching up to 7,200 cards an hour, and it does quite a fair amount of work in other directions, dealing specifically with the payroll of the undertaking. Of course, I appreciate that there are some advantages to be gained from the introduction of automation, but I think that it is safe to say that the trade union movement does not oppose its introduction. We feel, however - and I think rightly so - that it should be controlled, as should also the situation which may flow from its use, so that employees who become redundant will be channelled successfully and usefully into other industries or other sections of particular industries. </para>
                        <para>I said a few moments ago that there were some advantages to be gained from the introduction of automation. In a certain factory in the United States, on an engine block line there are now 25 men where, formerly, there were 117. The reduction was brought about by the fact that the men now have only to attend to their machines and place their work accurately before the tools which are used to turn out the engine blocks. Another combination of machine tools, attended by nine men, drills the necessary holes in the crankshaft. Formerly that work was done by 39 men. On those two operations alone there has been a great saving in the labour force in that factory. </para>
                        <para>The Ford works and the Volkswagen plant in West Germany have turned over to automatic production. The Renault works in France is one instance in which an increased number of employees has resulted from the introduction of automation. 1 have related a number of cases in which employment has fallen as a result of the introduction of automation. It is only fair, therefore, that I should mention instances in which automation has increased employment. In the case I am about to mention, it is significant that productivity per man has risen considerably as well as overall productivity. In this factory, in 1945 there were 28,000 employees, who produced 12,171 vehicles. In 1955, after the introduction of automation, the factory employed 53,000 men, and its production had risen to 228,037 vehicles. It is significant to note that there was quite an increase in manpower between 1945 and 1955, and a considerable increase in the output per man. In 1945, it required a year's work by two men to produce one vehicle, whereas in 1955 the output was four vehicles per man. That is a much higher productivity rate. </para>
                        <para>I turn now to an instance at Derby, in England, where a mica powder factory with a staff of 17 employees works on a 24-hour basis for seven days a week; in other words, it operates continuously with three shifts per day for each day of the week. Only five men are employed at a time. The seventeen employees of that factory produce 2,000 tons of mica powder per year. Prior to the introduction of automation the factory employed 50 workers, whose production was only 1,500 tons per year. Automation has achieved a considerable rise in production; in fact, the factory now produces 500 tons more mica powder each twelve months and the working staff has been decreased. 1 think it is quite safe to say that the individual worker looks at automation not so much from the point of view of how it affects other people's jobs but of how it might affect him personally. He realizes that automation may make work generally less difficult and will probably increase safety. But whilst he realizes that those conditions might flow from the introduction of automation, he has in the back of his mind the thought that he has to maintain his wife and family over a period and that if he loses his job, due to automation, he may have difficulty in obtaining the wherewithal to maintain his wife and family at a reasonable standard of living during his period of unemployment. </para>
                        <para>Reverting to the motor industry, I mention that the Standard Motor Company in England decided to lay off some 11,000 employees. When that was done, there was a great upheaval by the workers at the factory and a strike of long duration ensued. At that time, the company was prepared, in order to bring about a situation that it desired, to spend £4,000,000 on the installation of equipment. One of the company's spokesmen - I do not give him very much credit for making this statement, but it was attributed to him and I have no reason to doubt its veracity - said "We are not installing this equipment with the idea of employing the same number of men. We cannot carry people just for fun." If employers, in the main, are going to adopt that attitude with the introduction of automation to an appreciable extent in this country we are in for a very bad time. </para>
                        <para>I am particularly concerned about the people who will become redundant in industry as a result of the introduction of automation, and I feel that we should do all that we can to re-train people who will become redundant in particular industries or sections of industries. The people about whom I am most concerned are those who are 35 years of age and over, because having attained that age a person cannot as easily adapt himself to a new industry or a new type of work as a younger person. First, he has not the same aptitude at that age to absorb education. </para>
                        <para>Some authorities have forecast that at some time in the future, a person's working life will be twenty years. Men or women will commence work at 20 or 21 years of age. Up till that time they will be undergoing training to enable them to take their place in industry. Having commenced work at 20 or 2'1 years of age, they will work until they attain 40 or 41 years of age. They will not then be able to compete with younger people, and so will become redundant in their particular industry. If this forecast is vindicated, what is to be done to support young people during their training period, and those who, through age, become redundant in industry? Industry itself, or the government of the day, will have to finance the education of the young people, and consider the question of the livelihood of the older people between the time they become redundant and the time when they attain pensionable age. Although these are difficulties which may not confront us for some considerable time, we must prepare for them now and not wait until automation is upon us. We should learn the lesson that has been learned by other countries - to cushion the effects that automation will have on our economy. We must also have regard to the increased output that will flow from the introduction of automation into our. factories. However, the workers in those industries should share in the wealth that will result. Perhaps the amount that industry will save by the introduction of automation could be devoted to some form of technical education for the young people who will eventually enter industry. </para>
                        <para>I should like to mention to honorable senators the plight of waterside workers at the port of Mackay in Queensland where at one time some 700 members of the Waterside Workers Federation were engaged in handling sugar. Since the introduction of mechanization at that port, the number of employees has dropped to 80. </para>

                                <para>-  No; I certainly do not. Nevertheless, that is the situation that exists at Mackay, and the report of the Australian Stevedoring: Industry Authority for  the  year ended 30th June, 1958, dealing with the bulk handling of sugar at Mackay,, supports my statement. It is significant to note also that the wages of waterside workers engaged, at A-grade ports were lower in 1957- 58 than in. 1956-57. The tendency is to introduce more arid more mechanical aids at the various ports in Australia, which results in the average weekly earnings of the waterside workers being: progressively reduced. Following the installation of wheat silos at Hobart,. Launceston and Devonport it is estimated that over a period of twelve months the waterside workers engaged at those ports will lose some £80,000 or £90,000 in wages. Unfortunately, the savings to the shipping companies that result from the installation of mechanization at the ports, are not passed on to the public. As an example, the operating cost of the " North Esk " for each trip to Hobart has been reduced by approximately £4,000. Where is that money going? It is reasonable to assume, since it is not being handed on to the public fir the form of lower prices for' commodities; that it is going into the pockets, of' the shipping monopolies- inside and outside; Australia. </para>

                        <para>Referring to another aspect associated wilh the onset, of automation, the Lyons company in England has installed a digital computor which computes the wages of 10,000 employees in approximately four hours, work which previously occupied 37 clerks full time. Another significant feature about the trends which have become evident throughout industry to-day is the possibility - in' my opinion,, it is a distinct possibility - of an alarming decrease in the number of apprentices who will be taken into' industry eventually. It should be appreciated that, with the introduction of automation, most industries will become automatic and as a result only technicians will be- required. The' machinist as we know him to-day will no longer be required: There will certainly be openings for semiskilled employees and process workers,, but the apprentices will become a disappearing race.. It has. been suggested that automation can lead te a depression. This is probably prompted by the thought - it could well become; a reality - that automation will result in considerably increased production, indeed" in over-production, and it may be difficult to find markets for that surplus production. </para>
                        <para>Further, consideration will have to be given, to how the profits flowing into industry from the introduction of automation may be shared fairly with the workers. I venture the opinion that the workers will not. receive favorable consideration: from, the Arbitration Court, I say that because I believe that the. Arbitration Court is overlegalized,, if I may use that term; It has the workers, tied hand and foot. No longer are the workers free to take direct action if they feel that conditions are not what they ought to&gt; be,, and, believe me., many conditions still leave much to be desired.. </para>
                        <para>I feel that the- Arbitration Court will not give the workers the conditions and wages' they should be allowed to enjoy with the introduction of automation.. In my opinion, with the introduction of automation, it will be necessary, if the workers are to have justice, to increase the basic wage substantially and to award a greatly increased marginal rate. Further, every worker should' enjoy the right to long service leave, whether he be a permanent or casual employee, provided he has given service to an industry. It is extremely difficult to legislate for the casual worker who moves from- one industry to another, but where a man has been employed in a particular industry, whether it be on the waterfront, in primary production or in clerical work, and he has given a lifetime of service to that industry-; even though he may have worked: for more than one employer, he should be entitled to long service leave. He should be given long service leave for service to a particular industry rather than to a- particular employer. </para>
                        <para>I submit that it will also be necessary to reduce the working week to something below the present 40-hour standard which has operated in recent years. Again,, with a reduction of the working week, there must, of necessity, be an increase in recreational' facilities for the filling in of the hours during which the people are not at work. In my opinion, it will be most essential to- pay attention to that aspect of our life for it must be realized that, when young people have a good deal of time on their hands they sometimes drift into undesirable areas or perhaps, into crime.. </para>
                        <para>I feel that I have said enough on this subject to impress upon those present the fact that the legislators of the Commonwealth have a responsibility to see to it that something is done in the very near future to cushion the effects of automation on the working people of the Commonwealth. I submit that if some of the suggestions I have advanced are given serious consideration the Government cannot help but act in the- way in which the workers- of Australia would wish .them to act. </para>
                        <para>I suggest that the Government would be well advised to appoint a committee to study such new trends as mechanization of industry and automation. I know that a number of committees have been set up by several bodies, including the Australian Council of Trade Unions, to study trends in industry, but, whilst those committees serve a very good purpose, it must be appreciated that such bodies as the A.C.T.U. have not the power to legislate and therefore can do nothing to offset the adverse effects that can flow from the introduction of these new methods. I leave the matter there and trust that the Government will give consideration to some of the suggestions I have offered. </para>

                            then refers to the Australian National. Antarctic Research Expedition and to our stations at Mawson, Davis and Wilkes. For some time I have been of the opinion that instead of chartering Danish vessels to do our Antarctic work, we should build our own. In the last Parliament.

                            had a similar idea and this afternoon he asked the question along those very lines. During the interval between the end of the last Parliament and the beginning of the new Parliament I obtained the relevant figures. I found that up to the end of. 1957-58 season we had spent, no less than £310,000 in charter payments for the use of the two Danish vessels "Kista Dan" and "Thala Dan". This season we are using " Thala Dan " and "Magga Dan" at a charter rate of £652 a day. This works out very expensively - at something like £1'70;000 or £180,000 in a season. When this season's charter has been completed' we shall have spent no less than half a million pounds in this way. I suggest that we build our own ships, thus giving employment to Australian shipbuilders and seafarers. In the event of war; or something else, preventing the Danes from sending us Antarctic vessels we should at present be quite unable to service our stations in the Antarctic. As to whether Australians can operate Antarctic ships-, I need only mention such names as

                            spoke at length on the subject of defence. I gather that honorable senators who took part in the recent " Operation Shop Window " were impressed by the efficient manner in which the fleet was conducted, and the apparent knowledge of modern methods of submarine hunting and naval warfare generally. It would seem that honorable senators were especially impressed by the Navy's skill at submarine hunting. As an old submariner I would warn them of the danger of over-optimism in this matter. No matter how efficient our surface vessels may be, the submarine will always have a very good chance of sinking ships and not being sunk itself. Sound, which travels about five times as fast under water as it does through the air, is the surface vessel's basic aid in finding the submarine, but no matter how good radar, sonar or asdic may be it is often possible to throw it off the scent. Shoals of fish can interfere with detection. A thermal layer of heat generated above the surface of the water will often bend the radar beam as it goes out. Similar thermal layers may be found 100 feet or 200 feet below the surface. The noise of a submarine may be lost by its getting in the wake of a ship. It may also go at full speed backwards through its own wake, thus muffling its echo. There are many ways in which the submarine can compete with the surface vessel. That was demonstrated very plainly during the last war.
                        </para>
                        <para>Under the general heading of defence must come the very necessary work of hydrography. Russia is said to have some 500 modern submarines. Recently we learnt of an atomic submarine going right under the ice cap and being able to dive to far greater depths than we had ever imagined possible. I have no doubt that in years to come, with improvements in structure, the submarine will be able to dive deeper and deeper. Diving bells have, over the years, shown that because of their construction, they can go to very much greater depths than can the submarine. I remind honorable senators that 70 per cent, of the earth's surface is covered with water, but that only about 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, of that tremendous area has been properly surveyed. The position is especially bad in the waters around Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea. Hydrographic knowledge is very important in naval warfare. It is of value to submarines, especially, to know precisely what is below. Our seas contain tremendous mountain ranges, deeps and quiescent volcanoes, but we know very little about them. One can visualize submarines of the future being able to hide in the canyons and caves of these mountains. Such a prospect is not really far fetched. It will probably become a reality within the lifetime of many who are here to-night. I mention these things to show the connexion between defence and hydrography. </para>
                        <para>We have recently discovered something of great interest in the Pacific, just south of the equator. We know that a current flows from east to west, from South America towards Australia and the adjacent islands, at about 2 knots, covering a distance of 48 miles each day. We now know that 400 or 500 hundred feet below it there is a strong easterly stream. This sort of knowledge is of extreme importance to the submarine commander. </para>
                        <para>What is the position in Australia at the present time? The only vessel now available for this work is the old " Warrego ". A great fuss was made recently of the small survey carried out between northern Australia and Timor. It was described as a wonderful piece of work. It was carried out by " Warrego " and two general service ships. They were quite unsuitable and the work was carried out with great difficulty. Neither ship was fitted with an up-to-date echo sounder - not to. mention other modern aids. I understand that Russia has fourteen survey vessels which are really floating hydrographic and scientific establishments. They possess laboratories and are engaged in oceanography all over the world, especially in Australian waters, close to our shores. Indeed, we have Dutch and Japanese surveying teams here as well. They probably know far more about our own waters than we do at the present time. </para>
                        <para>Let me run briefly through what is going on in Australia and New Zealand at present. In Australia, the Royal Australian Navy has, in theory, accepted responsibility for coastal and ocean surveys. A certain amount of work is being done by State governments and some is being done by private companies. In Papua and New Guinea, the Royal Australian Navy will not have anything to do with this work, but we find that two or three naval officers have been seconded to do work up there. There are no operations going on at all in the Solomons and the New Hebrides. As far as oceanic areas and oceanography are concerned, no surveys are being undertaken, but the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is doing a certain amount of co-ordination of oceanography. Nothing is going on in Antarctica. In New Zealand, only one vessel is operating. lt has been loaned to New Zealand by the Royal Australian Navy. There is a Royal Navy supervisor of the survey there. 1 suggest that the only organization suitable for or capable of carrying out hydrographic surveys is the Royal Australian Navy, but at the present time its capabilities are restricted through inadequate numbers of survey personnel. Personnel are continually being changed, due to naval requirements. The men themselves find very little opportunity for advancement in this type of work. I do not mean only the officers, but also those in non-commissioned ranks - petty officers, warrant officers and so on. Then we have obsolete, expensive and unsuitable operational units - to wit, the " Warrego " and her two tenders. There is, in some cases, a complete lack of modern equipment Another difficulty is' the absence of a comprehensive policy. The Air Force takes photographs, the Army has land surveyors running around the place, there is the national mapping set-up in Canberra, and there is also the hydrographic office, run by the Royal Australian Navy in Sydney, which is falling apart. </para>
                        <para>The Naval Board has been, I think, completely disinterested in this work for many years. It is interested in defence; it is not interested in hydrographic work at all. Consequently there is no cohesion. I think of men such as Commander Wheatley, Commander Hunt, Commander Little, Commander Oom and, recently, Captain Tancred. All of them passed through this branch. They would have liked to stay in it, because they found the work interesting, but after a time they were shot down to Melbourne to be Director of Reserves or to take up some other post. There should be a proper survey service which people enter as cadets or as ordinary seamen, learn the job and stay in it so that they can be of value to the country. We should do what the geodetic service in the United States does. We should copy the good examples to be found in other parts of the world instead of carrying on in the way we are doing in Australia. </para>
                        <para>I will not suggest that a Senate select committee be set up, although many committees have been mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech. However, with so many committees being set up, I do not think it would hurt us to have one more to go into this matter and find out what can be done from the naval hydrographic angle in Australia. The committee could also consider what could be done in Papua and New Guinea, where the coastal surveys are even worse than they are in Australia. Prior to  1914,  when the Germans controlled the eastern part of New Guinea and the islands to the east, they commenced surveys up there. Their surveys were very good indeed but, unfortunately, they covered only about  5  per cent, of the territory, with the result that when you are up there, you sail by guess and by God. You are not sure whether a line on the chart is the coastline or not. I suggest that a thorough investigation be made to see if it is possible to set up a proper hydrographic survey unit in Australia. Perhaps to that there could be tacked- on later a fisheries survey - something which I have been trying to get for so long. The two things could be made to run together in the same way as they do in the United States. </para>
                        <para>I notice that the Government intends to set up a committee of inquiry to consider the introduction of a decimal coinage. I hope that we can look forward to a committee of inquiry to consider the introduction here of the metric system of measures to take the place of the rod, pole and perch rubbish that we have been trying to drum into our children for years. </para>

                                <para>- lt is only the decimal coinage system that is mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech. A little further on in the Speech, His Excellency went on to speak about the development of our natural resources. That is something, of course, that I have been suggesting to the Government for years. I have been suggesting that our natural resources, which include fish, should be tapped and used to far better advantage than we are using them at present. A .great song and dance has been made recently about the folding up of a trawler company in Sydney. It folded up only because the State Government, by putting on a 10 per cent, surcharge, made it almost impossible for the company to continue. Our fishermen in Queensland had' to put up with a <inline font-style="italic">Mi</inline> per cent, surcharge on all fish handled by the fish board there. </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para>I was very pleased when, the year before last, the Government, after the sale of the Whaling Commission, established a fund of £880,000 for fishery surveys and for long term loans to fishermen. At any rate,  I  understood that the fund was to be established for that purpose. Certainly a survey trawler, working out of Port Adelaide, is going to operate in the Bight, but my interests, of course, are nearer home - up in the Coral Sea. I am still hoping that some survey work will be done up there. However, I want to deal now with the question of long-term loans to fishermen. Some time ago, we had a very bright lad who bought an old ship called the " Rican Star " in Sydney. She was fitted with an excellent refrigeration plant and had refrigerated space for 480 tons of fish. Not only was  she  well fitted in that respect, but she hadan emergency plant for use in case the first plant broke down. She had magnificent engines. After she had been passed for survey he took her up to Hervey Bay where he worked in conjunction with 40 prawners. It was something that we had wanted for very long. The prawners were able to stay out in the bay. They transferred their prawns to that ship, which was able to take 480 tons at a time. The prawns were then taken to the coast and landed into cold1 stores. </para>
                        <para>A little while afterwards this lad came to me and told me that he wanted capital for repairs. I said, " Certainly. Write to the Director of Fisheries and state your case, and I will write to the Minister. I am sure that you will get something from the long term loan fund for fishermen that has been set up." The request was refused, even though this is one of 'the forms of assistance for somebody willing to take a risk for which we have been waiting. 1 think the Government made a big mistake in this case. This man will become bankrupt, the ship will be laid up, and we will lose that excellent opportunity to build up this industry. What this man has been guarding against has been the loss of his cargo through deterioration. The other day in Sydney I heard about two fishermen, one of whom returned with one ton of mullet and one with half a ton of bream. When they drew alongside the wharf and opened the boxes, they found that the whole of the fish was sour because they did not have refrigeration and because they could not carry sufficient ice for an out-size catch. I felt very sorry about the action of the Government in relation to this man in Queensland, because I had advised him and told him all about this wonderful fund. I hope the Government will give more consideration to such people when they apply for assistance. </para>
                        <para>His Excellency said that the Government had given substantial ass;stance to the Australian shipbuilding industry. I should like to bring to the notice of the Government the position in regard to two vessels, the " Monowai " and " Wanganella ", which are running across the Tasman to New Zealand from Australia. I recall when the " Monowai " was named " Razmak " and was on the Bombay-Aden run. That was over 30 years ago, so I should say that she is now 34 or. 35 years old. The " Wanganella " is much the same age; I can recall her being on the Australian coast over 30 years ago. Those two ships cannot cope with the work that is offering across the Tasman. In any case, very soon they will have to be scrapped. Because of the trouble the companies have had with the loading and unloading of cargo, I doubt very much whether they will replace those vessels. I am sure the Union Steam Ship Company will not replace the " Monowai ". These companies wait till the last minute before they inform intending passengers that they cannot carry them and allow them to book on overseas vessels which come in under our navigation laws with special permission. </para>
                        <para>I submit to the Government that it would not be going too far to suggest that the Australian National Line should think in terms of replacing that service with Australian national ships. To do that would not be too bad. It would give work to our shipyards, in the first instance, and to our Australian seamen. In any case, the " Wanganella " already carries Australian seamen. In addition, it would provide a good service to the travelling public and would prevent the need to use overseas ships on the run. </para>
                        <para>
                            <inline font-weight="bold">His Excellency</inline>
                            also referred to substantial progress in the development of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Substantial progress is being made, but apathy exists in regard to hydrography. The " Lauribada" under Commander Little, which is the only survey vessel up there, has been laid up for six months. In addition they have two most unsuitable tenders This survey work has been taken over by the Administration and is being run as a civil undertaking; it has nothing to do with the Royal Australian Navy. But we must have some co-ordinated scheme, the same as they have in other countries.
                        </para>
                        <para>Further on in his Speech, His Excellency referred to social services. I have another suggestion to make to the Government. I refer to the case of an age pensioner who wishes to do a little work and yet retain his pension. Let us suppose that he starts work on 17th March in any year. His year of income will run to 17th March in the following year. The consequence is that the entitlements of age pensioners are assessed as at different dates. I have had a number of pensioners come to me and say, " Please explain what on earth they are talking about ". It is necessary to go through a long rigmarole to try to explain what the department is doing. I suggest to the Government that it might be very much easier from the viewpoint of departmental administration and in order to save confusion, if the assessment was made for the ordinary financial year from 1st July to 30th June. I see nothing wrong with that idea. </para>
                        <para>I should like to congratulate the Government upon having brought <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Metcalf</inline> to Australia to investigate the: work of, and to help, not only the Australian National Library but also the various libraries throughout the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Metcalf</inline> has helped us in the National Library particularly. Having been a member of the Parliamentary Library Committee for the last nine years, I am seised of the importance of that committee. Some people who have not been a member of it seem to think that it is just another committee, but it is one of the most important committees that we have in Canberra because it is dealing with things that will be going on 100 years hence. </para>
                        <para>There are over half a million books in the National Library. There is an intake of some 30,000 books every year, quite apart from the intake of pictures, works of art and archives in addition to the work of the film unit, micro-film records, newspapers and so on. We have, too, the Nan Kivell collection, which is worth approximately £250;000. Many of the articles in the possession of the National Library are unique and if lost might take 50, 60 or 100 years to replace by gradual collection. The reason I am mentioning this is that the Nan Kivell collection, for example, some years ago was lodged in the basement of the Department of Health and was open to fire, flood and burglary. Because we have no home for it, no real National Library building, there is material all over Canberra. That silly little doll's house next to the Patent Office has not room for a tent. Things became so bad at one stage that it. was necessary to get three Nissen huts, built during the war, and place them in their present position where, according to the fire authorities, they are still a fire risk. I know that, because I have discussed this matter with them. </para>
                        <para>I say very firmly to the Government that the time is long overdue for some decision to be made about whether we are to have a National Library. If things are allowed to continue as they are, the task of the catalogue section will become exceedingly difficult. As it is, I do not know how the  47  girls who are in the section are able to find anything. I have never been able to discover how they find material. People come along and ask for this, that and the other publication, and they might be. in that little doll's house I mentioned, down in the annexe, or perhaps on the roof of the Transport Branch for all I know. </para>
                        <para>When we do build, let us build for 25 years hence and not for two or three years hence. Let us build a library that will fit into what some day will be one of the most beautiful capitals in the world. Perhaps that will not occur in my lifetime, but eventually Canberra will be one of the most outstanding capitals of the world. It will be unique. Even if we spent only £1,000,000 this year, we should make a beginning. At least let us provide some racks in order to get the books off the floor. I feel very strongly about this matter and I trust that the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gorton),</inline> who is at the table, will mention it to the Government. One of the main troubles, of course, is that there seems to be no statutory authority under which we can shelter. We are just sort of pushed on to the Prime Minister's Department. Until such time as we have a ministry under whose jurisdiction we come, there is little we can do. We do not come under the Department of the Interior. </para>

The matter seems to rest with the Prime Minister's Department, but of course that department does not wish to be saddled with additional expenditure, although £1,000,000, in a Budget of £1.300,000,000 is not much to ask. </para>

I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> Gorton who, to me, did not appear to be in the queue. However, he apparently was in it, and he has been appointed Minister for the Navy. I am quite sure that, with his background, he will do a substantial job. One of the mysteries of governments - it is applicable not only to this Government but to all governments - is that when a government gets a man with a tremendous record in the Air Force, it makes him Minister for the Navy. Whether that is an indication of the days that are to come, with atomic power and all the rest, with the Navy under the water and aircraft so far above the earth that they cannot be perceived, I do not know, but I sincerely hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> will play his part in helping the defence of Australia. I feel sure that he will. 1 should like also to convey to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Neil</inline> O'sullivan my congratulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neil</inline> had the extraordinary experience, for a member of the Liberal party, to serve under an Australian Country party leader. That is now history. 1 can remember <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neil</inline> being  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in this chamber to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Cooper, with the rank and file consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin.

                                <para>- I do not know, but it is extraordinary that three members of the then Opposition - a Country party <inline font-weight="bold">Senator and</inline> two Liberal party senators - should now be surrounded by so many colleagues as there are on the Government side to-night. I wish to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Neil</inline> O'sullivan for his period as Leader of the Government in the Senate. I feel that he always tried, so far as was within his power, and having regard to the direction and greater pressure from the rank and file, to give the Opposition as reasonable a go as we gave him when there were three senators on his side of the chamber and 33 on ours. I hope that his elevation will give him and his wife great happiness. </para>

                        <para>To-night, 1 want to deal with two matters which, though simple, are nevertheless fundamental. They tie in together and are inextricably bound. I refer to our lack of housing and our unemployment. The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> cannot be proud of his record while there is unemployment in Australia and while there is a lack of houses. So I put it to him as a direct personal challenge that it is no good parading in this chamber, or before the country, as a successful Minister of a successful Government unless he can solve the unemployment problem and the problem of obtaining houses for all the people who need them. </para>

                                <para>- Let us be modest. To look 25 years ahead should be the standard for all government planning. On many occasions I heard the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ben</inline> Chifley, who led the Australian Labour party, give great credit to industrial organizations of this country because he could see how far ahead they were planning. This is a fundamental thing in government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> has applied it to the building of libraries. I want to apply it to something more fundamental, but just as important in every possible way - the housing problem that confronts Australia. It is a problem that has to be approached in a big way and with wide vision, because unless we plan to solve the housing problem in a manner that carries us far into the future, we shall find that each year and every year, and for as long as any of us is in this Senate, the problem of young people and migrants wanting homes will always be with us. </para>
                            </talk.start>
                        </continue>
                        <para>I put this problem to the Government as one of the easier ones for governments to solve. I do not think that the supplying of houses for the people of Australia is such a tremendous problem. On the contrary, I think that it should be No. 1 on the agenda and that it should be relatively easy to overcome. But what do we find in relation to the housing situation in Australia? We find that we built 25 per cent. more homes back in 1951 than we built in 1957-58. There, straight away, is a condemnation of this Government. We could build 84,000 homes back in 1951. Admittedly, that rate of construction was achieved on a basis of planning laid by the Chifley Government. Construction was carried on and developed to the fullest extent, so that 84,000 homes could be built. But we find that in 1957-58, only 69,000 homes were built, representing a drop of 25 per cent. </para>
                        <para>If that drop of 25 per cent, had been paralleled by a drop in demand of 25 per cent., that would have been logical, but the demand for housing is increasing and must automatically increase as time goes on. There is an extraordinary set-up in this country. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> has said, we are on the threshold of an advancement which is beyond the imagination and comprehension of any one in this Senate to-night. If we could come back to this Australia of ours 25 years from now we would see a country so greatly developed that we would be amazed by what had happened. So surely we should try to do something to assist Australia's advancement. The fundamental thing in a modern, civilized community such as ours is that there shall be available homes for all the people who need them. Not only that, we should make it easy and simple for people who want to acquire homes to do so. </para>
                        <para>I think one thing is always forgotten in the compilation of housing statistics. I was an alderman of the Sydney City Council, where I served as I am serving in the Federal Parliament. Actually, in the city council, I served in opposition for thirteen long years; I have not sat in opposition here for so long. Naturally, I love the city of Sydney - the greatest city in the world. There is no possible question about that. It is blessed by nature, and despite all the efforts of governments and councils as well, it remains the loveliest city in the world. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, they play it very well. There is a factor, because of the great age of the capital cities of Australia, that is not usually realized by those who compile statistics in relation to homes. I quote the position in Sydney, because that is' my (town; I live there. In the words of St. Paul, 1 am a citizen of no mean city. That ls .Sydney. .1 should say that in Sydney there are 40,000 homes that are unfit for human habitation, but people are forced to continue to live in them. 1 know of homes in areas -close .to .the city of .Sydney that are over 100 years old, and people are still living in them. They have to live in them because there is no alternative accommodation available. So, in Sydney, in addition to the acknowledged shortage of homes must be added another 40,000 homes that are unfit for human habitation. I got these figures from the city health officer, whom I know and with whom I worked. There are 40,000 homes so bad structurally that they should be condemned. I just mention this aspect of the matter in passing. We have an obligation to the .people who arc living in those homes. I do not know the extent to which this may be applicable in Melbourne, because that city is not so old as Sydney. But in my quiet wanderings in Melbourne I have seen many homes that are unfit for human habitation. This problem exists in every capital city. </para>

                        <para>In addressing ourselves to the housing problem, we must realize that we have a tremendous responsibility to re-house people who .are living in substandard homes. While this should be one of the simplest problems of government, it is one of the most important. To-:day, there are 21,000 families registered with the New South Wales Housing Commission waiting for 'homes. Therefore, it is of no use for the Government to say that this is a passing crisis. It is of no use for the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to say what he was reported to have said months ago when things were more exciting than they are now. According to this newspaper cutting, months old, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies,</inline> with the air of old Squire Stayput, looked over the estate and found that all was well. The estate was Australia which, he said, was a great estate in good repair, immensely developed, well managed, and respected and trusted throughout the world. </para>

                                <para>-  I am glad to hear a solitary, " Hear, hear! " How could the estate <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> in good repair when incredible problems face so many people in Australia to-day? Apart from the 80,000 people who cannot 'get work, there are those who by right, not privilege, are entitled to a 'home to live in but cannot get one. Yet the right honorable gentleman claims that the estate is being well managed! The New South Wales Housing Commission has a waiting list of 21,000 for homes, and 200 applications per week are coming in. The New South Wales co-operative building societies have applications from 20,000 people who are waiting for homes. There are 1,400 couples being married every week and in addition, coming back to one of the things that is near to my heart, on the Commonwealth's figures there are approximately 115,000 migrants coming to Australia each year. My mathematics -have never been good, but I should say that approximately 2,000 a week are coming in. We do not want them to stay in Commonwealth hostels, and we and they do not want to stay in them. So we must make plans to house not only those who are on the waiting list in all States and the 1,400 couples who are being married every week, but also the 2,000 migrants who are coming in every week under a scheme of which I completely approve. To my mind, there is no reason why the intake of migrants should be restricted to 1 15,000 a year if we in Australia can prepare to accept them, to house them and to give them jobs, because the development of this country depends not only on the Australian-born but also on immigrants. We talk about our relationship with Indonesia. The basis of our security is a strong population. That can be brought about only by a strong immigration policy. Yet how can we bring migrants to this country with a good conscience when there are 81,000 people unemployed - that was the number in January - ;and, there is a back-lag of housing? The solution of those two problems rests with governments. This housing problem -has faced us since the conclusion of the war. It is not a problem that is insuperable or one that cannot be handled; it is one within the grasp of governments. I do not place on the federal Government all the blame for the situation, but I say that, as it is the holder of the purse strings, the federal Government has the greatest responsibility. In co-operation with States, we should be able to solve this problem. </para>

The Australian Council of Trade Unions has made a very close survey of this problem - as have many other people - and it says that the physical resources of this country could instantly enable the building of 80,-000 homes a year, rising to a limit of . 100,000 homes a year. Take my word for it, they all will be needed, as I see it, and as I hope supporters of the Government see it, if this country continues to develop atits present rate! </para>

                        <para>. - I regret very much that I must occupy the time of the Senate at this late hour, but I must mention the case of an ex-serviceman who purchased a home through the War Service Homes Division in the suburb of Pimlico, Townsville. As the Ministerwho administers the division is in the chamber, he would like to be acquainted with the facts of this case so that he will be quite clear as to where he stands. On or about 20th October, 1954, the then Minister in charge of war service homes failed to exercise reasonable judgment in granting an ex-serviceman in Queensland a loan under section 20 of the War Service Homes Act tobuy a home at Pimlico, Townsville, when such home was riddled with borers and, further, that he failed to exercise sufficient control over officers of the War Service Homes Division in their attempts to eradicate borers from the home from March, 1955, until the present time. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The change I have detailed contains two complaints. I shall deal with the first of them, in connexion with which I have evidence to submit. The evidence is, in fact, the statement of the Minister himself. May I say in explanation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that this matter was first raised in the Parliament in another place.Recently, I had correspondence with the Minister about the matter and that correspondence continued until it was closed by the Minister who, in his final letter,referredmetoaprevious communication in which he indicated that nofurther negotiationswould be entered into with respect to the matter.. </para>
                    <para>The facts are that on 20thOctober, 1954, the 'ex-serviceman was granted a Joan by the War Service HomesDivision inQueensland toenable him to purchase a  home  for himself, his wife and his children. The Minister, in writing, indicated to me that prior to the loan being granteda technical officer of the division inspectedthe home and decided that it was suitable -security for the loan andthatthere wasno sign of borer infestation. Although, as 1 have indicated, the presentMinisterdid 'not administer the division in 1954, theinitial offence in this case has continued and -become worse -as time has progressed.If thetechnical officer had made a thorough examination of the home in 1954, he would have found that the housewas infested with borers. They werein the trees felled <inline font-style="italic">by the</inline> timber getters; theywere in the timber that was processed by 'the millers; they were in the timber used by thecarpenters in constructing thehome and they, andtheir eggs, were present in their 'millions in the home when thetechnicalofficer examined the 'building &lt;to see whether it was sufficient security on which to make an advance. </para>
                    <para>The Minister may ask, " Where is your evidence of that? " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I have knowledge of some timbers inQueensland, and I am sure that if the division had asked an experienced miller, a millhand, a carpenter or even an apprentice carpenter to inspect the home to ascertain whether it contained borers or borers' eggs, he would have said, "' Do not advance any money on that home ". However, the advance was approved and the ex-serviceman became the owner of the home in March, 1955. Four months later the ex-serviceman made anexamination of the home and found that it was infested withborers. I produce a piece ofwood as an exhibit for thebenefitof honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. Thisexhibit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> does not contain borers or borers eggs.On the surface the timber appears to be fairlysound, but inside it contains as many holesas a wire door. To prove howrotten this piece of wood is, I now break it apart. Honorable senators can  see  the dust thatcomes from it. This  piece of  (timber has been taken from the ex-serviceman's home and is a sample of the timber of which the home has been constructed. Perhaps that is sufficient evidence to deal with the first complaint. </para>
                    <para>In 1955, the borers were doing well, attending pyjama parties like the young folk on the Gold Coast, and no doubt the young male borers with sharp teeth were chasing the wingless female borers. Goodness knows what was going on! When the ex-serviceman became aware of the condition of the timber in his home, he contacted the War Service Homes Division and was told that he should take up the matter with the Forestry Department. Incidentally, I understand that there is a Commonwealth Forestry Department and a Queensland State Forestry Department which is a subdepartment of the Lands Department. I am not clear to which department the ex-serviceman was referred, although it was stated in the correspondence to be the Forestry Department. When officers of that department inspected the home they found that the timber was riddled with borers in much the same way as the exhibit I have produced. Apparently no action of any consequence was taken by officers of the Forestry Department. They simply replaced some timber here and there. </para>
                    <para>In April, 1956, seventeen months after the home was purchased, the ex-serviceman was told by the division that the vendor had agreed to replace some of the timber in the home. I understand that was done. However, the house was in such a dreadful state that had the vendor replaced all the exterior boards of the home that were infested with borers he would have erected completely new walls. </para>
                    <para>The borers' eggs are hidden in the timber and if the infestation is to be discovered one must examine closely the ends of each board. When the house is lined and painted, unless the technical officer prises off some of the boards and examines them closely, he cannot find out whether they contain borers. In 1957, three years after the house was purchased, the ex-serviceman advised the War Service Homes Division that there were borers in the house, and there has been no replacement of boards since 1956. He also insisted that the borers were still in a thriving condition in his home. </para>
                    <para>In February, 1958  -  three years and four months after the house was purchased - the </para>
                    <para class="block">War Service Homes Division was advised that a few borers were left. Then, for some reason or other, the War Service Homes Division employed a well-known company which is experienced in fumigating homes to exterminate pests, to have a bang-tail muster of the borers in the home. Everybody in the suburb knew that this pestexterminating company was wasting its time in going to the house. </para>
                    <para>Let me point out here that it was found that some of the homes around Brisbane were infested with European borers and in those cases the State government, with financial assistance to the extent of £150,000 provided by the Commonwealth, undertook the extermination of the borers in those homes. No fewer than 2,634 homes in Brisbane have been fumigated. The occupants of an affected home are accommodated in another street, the fumigators place a plastic envelope over the home and get to work and the home is left under the plastic covering for two or three days. This has been found to be the only effective way of killing borers in a home. </para>
                    <para>In March, 1958  -  three years and five months after the house was purchased - there was a further inspection by a technical officer of the Department of Works. I take it he was an officer of the Commonwealth Department of Works. He found that borers were in the home. The ex-serviceman was in a helpless condition. His home was being eaten down around him. He appealed to the War Service Homes Division which advanced him money to treat a few more boards in the home. The money provided was not sufficient to enable the work to be completed; it was enough to pay for only portion of the job, with the result that boards were left in other sections of the home in a borer-infested condition. </para>
                    <para>I raised the matter with the Minister, who said, " That is right, but this man did not make a claim under the insurance provisions of the Act within two years and therefore we are not going to do anything more ". He closed the matter there and then, ls that the way to treat an ex-serviceman who is trying to provide a home for himself, his wife and children? I say that, as an ex-serviceman, he was entitled to the benefit of all the knowledge relating to insurance and general provisions of the act which the War Service Homes Division  had.  1 am now looking at the Minister's colleagues who sit behind him. 1 know if any one of them had such a case, the Minister would instruct his officers to clear the man's home of borers immediately and report back to him when the job was completed. It would be more than the officer's job was worth to neglect to carry out that instruction. In this case, 1 say that absolute inefficiency was shown by the officer who carried out the inspection in 1954, but that does not absolve the Minister because he is the chief administrator of the War Service Homes Division and must face up to the charge I have made. He has been the Minister in charge of this division while its officers have been fooling around in their ineffectual attempts to exterminate the borers in this home. </para>
                    <para>I leave the matter there. Five years after the home was purchased, many of the boards in this man's home are in a borerinfested condition. These borers are alive, and their teeth are sharp. </para>

                        <para>. -  I knew nothing of this case until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> brought it forward, but it presents one of those problems that a reasonably sympathetic Minister and a reasonably sympathetic government should have no trouble in overcoming. When I was the Minister in charge of the War Service Homes Division, I had a slogan which I often repeated. I had forgotten it until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn's</inline> speech recalled it. That is the only reason why I rose to speak. When my secretary or the head of the division brought a case to me, I would say, " You know the slogan - fix it </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There is no reason why the ex-serviceman should be punished in this way. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> has made a complete case. With the social development in Australia in this day and age, this sort of thing should be quickly remedied. It is somewhat similar to the recent immigration case in which a Chinese who had been in Australia for eleven years was picked up in the markets. If the full rigour of the law had been applied, this man should have been deported, but the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Downer)</inline> said that as the police report on the man showed that he had done no harm and that he had played his part in Australia, he should be allowed to stay. I think that the Minister in charge of War </para>
                    <para class="block">Service Homes <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> should set out to do what is fair for the ex-serviceman. The Minister should see to it that the borers are cleared out of the home. Such an attitude would be good not only for the government itself but also for the country. </para>

                    <para>My recollection of this matter runs something like this. First, it was not a home that was built by the War Service Homes Division; it was not a home in the erection of which the War Service Homes Division had any say or share of responsibility. This home had been built by some one else. The eligible ex-serviceman saw it, liked it and wanted to buy it, and the vendor and purchaser came to terms. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of the inspection by the official of the War Service Homes Division is primarily to satisfy himself that there is adequate security for the amount which the division advances. I think it would be difficult to find grounds for the contention that the inspection is an automatic certification that the house is in first-class order in every respect. </para>

                    <para>But that  is not the way in which the War Service Homes Division operates. The War Service Homes Division does not stick to the strict letter of the law. Although I cannot give all the circumstances offhand, I do think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn's</inline> remarks are evidence that there was both sympathetic administration by the division and an endeavour to help this man who had apparently made a bad bargain. </para>
                    <para>Ohe thing that is missing from my chain of recollection is the request to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> called the Forestry Department. 1 have a feeling that in Queensland there is legislation relating to borer infestation and that, under that legislation, when borers are discovered in a dwelling or a building, there is a statutory obligation to get in touch with this Queensland authority. That authority makes an inspection and orders vendors and purchasers to do what is right between themselves. I may be wrong on that point, but there was some good reason why the Queensland authority was brought in. When it was brought in, certain things were ordered to be done, and were done. Not only was that done, but also, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> himself has said, the War Service Homes Division arranged a subsequent inspection of the dwelling and, to the best of my recollection, provided funds for the applicant to make repairs in order to make good the damage that had been occasioned. </para>
                    <para>I think that the point that is being contested at the moment is whether the insurance covered this damage, and I hope that no honorable senator on the other side of the chamber will challenge the sympathetic administration of the War Service Homes </para>
                    <para class="block">Division. I believe that the division strains, in every way it can, to make sure that the ex-serviceman gets a good deal in all these transactions. What has arisen in this case, so far as my recollection serves me, is a claim to put the whole of the responsibility upon the War Service Homes Division, although the division, having gone through the matter and considered it in detail, does not think it equitable that that responsibility should rest on its shoulders. Its efforts in having inspections made and advice tendered, and in getting the Queensland authority in, and lending money to enable repairs to be carried out, are, in its judgment, equitable. </para>
                    <para>However, in view of what the honorable senator has said, I will get the file tomorrow, and will go through it myself during this week. After I have done that, I will let the honorable senator know whether I think that I should go back on the decision. I assure him that I shall approach the matter with a completely open mind and not on the basis that because I had said " No " I cannot go back on that and subsequently say " Yes ". I will have a good look at all aspects of the matter and will let the honorable senator know my conclusions. </para>
