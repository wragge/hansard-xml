                        <para>-  I have a sneaking suspicion that this question has something to do with the poll to be held in New South Wales next Saturday. I think the appropriate way to answer those parts of the question which relate to the new housing agreement is to say that the new housing agreement was hammered out by the Commonwealth and the States, was accepted by the States and was signed by the States. It is a document to which all parties consented. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As to those parts of the question which relate to rental rebates, the situation is that the Commonwealth said to the States, in effect, " Some of the States want the rental rebate system to continue; some of them do not want it to continue; so the Commonwealth will give the money at a concessional interest rate. Those States which want the rental rebate system to be continued may continue it, using that interest concession. Those States which do not want to continue the rental rebate system can use the interest concession in other ways." 1 am not quite sure, but I think the net result was that only two of the States continued with the rental rebate system. </para>
                    <para>Speaking from memory, I think thai while the rental rebate system was in operation and up to the present time, no claims have been made by the States upon the Commonwealth under the arrangement. The system was a good thing on paper. In practice, it gave no advantage to the States, and the States, because of that, and for other reasons, did not continue it. The circumstances are the same to-day. The economic rental that was fixed was sufficient to cover any discounts that were allowed under rental rebate. The economic rental is being continued on the same basis, and it is quite competent for any States, within the limits of the concession that is already made available to them, to continue with the rental rebate system. That being so, a plea for the rental rebate system to be continued is a piece of nonsense. The rents that are being charged in New South Wales at the present time are sufficient to cover rental rebates if the New South Wales Government wants to make rental rebates. </para>

                            <para>-  I did not quite catch the interjection. If I understood the honorable senator correctly, he thinks the States ought to pass a vote of thanks to the Commonwealth.

                    <para>As to the general all-round housing position, let me repeat what I have said ad nauseam. The worst position in the Commonwealth exists in New South Wales. That is due to the utter incompetence of the New South Wales Government. At the end of lune, 1958, the estimated shortage of houses in Australia was 80,000. Of that number, the estimated shortage in New South Wales was 48,000. More than half of the total housing shortage of Australia is located in New South Wales, and 1 say, through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to the people of New South Wales, that the only way to remedy that position is to throw out the Cahill Government. </para>

                        <para>- I am not quite certain of the purport of the honorable senator's question. He is, I think, pointing out that lead and zinc are being sold in Australia at a price higher than the world parity price. I believe that this is correct. Lead and zinc prices are fixed by the people who buy and sell. There is not just one vendor of lead and zinc, and these people must face competition. A number of mines have products, in different forms, to sell. I think that the present higher Australian price is a recent development and results from deterioration in trading conditions overseas. </para>

                        <para>- 1 preface my question to the Minister for Civil Aviation, by saying that on. 11th March a report appeared in the Melbourne press claiming that a decision on the proposed Tullamarine airport would be made within the next ten days. Will the Minister give an undertaking that no decision regarding the Tullamarine proposal will be made until the Boeing 707 jet aircraft has been subjected to noise tests at Avalon, and Tullamarine residents and Keilor-Broadmeadows shire and city councils have been furnished with detailed reports thereon? Further, will he state whether an opportunity will be given to public authorities and other interested  parties  to attend take-offs and landings of 707 jets at Avalon? </para>

                        <para>- First, I should like to say that the report appearing in the Melbourne press - to the effect that a decision in. this matter will be made within ten days - is not correct. Indeed, it is quite incorrect. At the moment some details of the recommendations made by the investigating panel are being considered by the department, following a request submitted by some of the more responsible bodies - people who might be affected or are living in this area. I do not refer to the rather less responsible statements which, I suspect, emanate from the public relations officer who has been employed by some interests to prosecute their case in this matter. The Boeing 707 has undergone extensive noise tests in New York. It has been subjected to these tests by a firm of consultants acting on behalf of the New York port authority, which controls the three airports of New York. Indeed, it is on these expert reports that the recommendations of the advisory panel, and the recommendations in my own department, have been based. I might add that representatives of my department have been in New York while these tests have been taking place. It is not intended that when the aircraft gets to Australia and commences its crew training programme from Avalon it will again, be subjected to these noise tests. I cannot, therefore, give to the honorable senator the assurance which he seeks, but I do say with all sincerity that if any public bodies want to test the noise that emanates from this aircraft they would have no difficulty at all in stationing representatives in the vicinity of Avalon while the crew-training programme is in progress so that they could actually listen to the aircraft in flight. Indeed, I would suggest that if any one wanted to make a really objective test of the noise that emanates from the aircraft he would get at Avalon a better indication of what people who live in areas located near to aerodromes would be subjected to, having regard to the fac: that there is provided an extensive buffer area between the take-off point and the angle of climb of the aircraft. </para>

In view of the fact that the original issue of 50,000 copies has been practically exhausted in a little over two years, I consider that the experiment was most successful. In addition to sales at the main entrance to the House, requests by mail are continually received from individuals, schools and other organizations for copies of this informative book on the Parliament.

Is the Minister aware that the proposed renewal of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union has occasioned concern among many Australians, particularly in view of the Government's failure to take any action over the past three years to remedy deficiencies in the law relating to espionage in peacetime, which deficiencies were pointed out in the report of the Royal Commission on Espionage as long ago as October 1955? Does the Minister realize that the Government's failure to remedy these deficiencies in the espionage law, combined with its decision to accept Soviet representatives in this country without essential legal provisions to deal with espionage, can only strengthen the doubts expressed in some quarters as to the Government's sincerity in the Petrov case? </para>

I think that perhaps one or two of the smaller sections that are of great interest to the customs and shipping agents have been shifted to Perth. When I was there in 1957, I gave an undertaking that those sections which were of interest to the customs and shipping agents, because they had their offices around the Customs House at Fremantle, would remain at Fremantle. By doing that, we were able to give up one floor of the new building in Perth to other departments. </para>

                        <para>-  My question is directed to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in view of your enthusiastic support for a suitable building for Parliament House in Canberra. Is it the intention of the Government to make a start on a permanent Parliament House in Canberra in the near future, or at least to push ahead with plans for it? Is it intended to build this important national building on the hill which at present rises directly in front of the temporary Parliament House, or is it intended to remove the hill and build on a less commanding position at a lower level? If this latter suggestion is not correct, will you inform the Senate of the reasons for the continuing intense earth-moving activities that are at present being carried out on that site and have been for some time past? Will you take steps to have the relief model of the proposed Canberra development scheme, now being exhibited in an inconspicuous place downstairs in the Australian War Memorial, brought to King's Hall, along with a map of the city, so that members of the Parliament may study the proposals in detail when the Parliament resumes after Easter? </para>

As elections in two States are projected for Saturday next, the question is non-political. Has the Minister been advised of a recent statement by the Western Australian Minister for Housing to the effect that at present there is no housing problem in Western Australia? Can the Minister say whether, if that is so, the position has been brought about by a reduction of the intake of migrants by that State from 14 per cent, of the total Australian migrant intake in 1953 to 4 per cent, in 1958, or is it because of an act known as the Unfair Trading and Profit Control Act, which has resulted in the diversion to other States of many millions of pounds from overseas sources which might have gone to Western Australia? </para>

In view of the fact that the annual report on the Commonwealth Railways for the year 1957-58 shows that there was a loss on the North Australia line of £76,000, excluding interest of £73,000, and that on the Australian Capital Territory line of 4 miles 75 chains there was a lo'Ss of £21,000, excluding interest of £1,300, has the Minister decided to close either or both of these lines? Does he consider that their value to the national interest warrants their continued operation? </para>

                        <para>-  I hasten to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> that I have never at any time given any thought to the closure of the North Australia railway, which is a very important line. True it is that it operates at a loss, and true it is that it does not carry this interest charge. It is also true that the operations of the line are kept under the most careful scrutiny and quite regularly - as recently as six months ago - changes were made in the schedules to cut down the loss while continuing to meet the requirements of the people it serves. Notwithstanding that a loss is made on this line, as it is regarded in its developmental aspect as of great importance, it will be retained. </para>

                    <para>The rather short line of something under 5 miles in the Australian Capital Territory falls into rather a different category, and the loss of £21,000 each year, plus interest charges, has to be regarded seriously. Notwithstanding that, however, my own thoughts on the matter are that with the increasing business that is coming to Canberra there is always the prospect that  the  finances of this line might improve, and I also have in the back of my mind the thought that a line should be maintained to serve the capital city in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

                        <para>-  I preface a question to the Minister for National Development by saying that, when referring to the housing lag in Australia, he has quoted departmental figures to support his contention that there is a shortage of 80,000 houses. In view of the fact that these departmental figures have been consistently wrong over the last few years, will he now discontinue using them? Is he prepared to turn to some other source to obtain the real figure of the shortage of housing in Australia? </para>

                        <para>-  I can only dispute the honorable senator's statement that the figures have been consistently wrong. The document from which they are quoted was prepared by the department after a survey of all the statistics that were available. The document gives reasons in support of the logic that was used in computing the shortage. It has been distributed pretty widely throughout Australia; it has gone to all the housing authorities. I notice that the housing authorities themselves utilize the figures in their own publications. 1 notice, too, that other public people who analyse and comment upon the housing situation turn to that report for the information. The report was the result of an original piece of research work. I do not know that it has been challenged, nor do I know of any other source of information to which one can turn. </para>

                        <para>-  My question to the Minister for National Development follows an answer which he gave to a question put to him recently regarding the implementation of legislation introduced by the very efficient Minister for Housing in Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham,</inline> designed to restrict unfair trading practices which were considered to be a major factor in the housing problem in that State. Will the Minister consider means for extending that legislation to other States of the Commonwealth which are experiencing great difficulty in solving their housing problems? </para>

                        <para>- The two honorable senators from Western Australia do not appear to me to be operating on the same wave-length. 1 understood the question addressed to me in this election week to contain the suggestion that the solution of the housing problem in Western Australia had been assisted by a fall in population due to this unpopular legislation. Before the honorable senator asks the other States to adopt that policy, 1 think she had better argue the case at first hand. </para>

The role of the budgerigar in transmitting poliomyelitis is at the moment purely conjecture. However, a proved safeguard against infection with poliomyelitis is provided by Salk vaccine and unvaccinated persons of any age group will be at greater risk from human carriers than from budgerigars. In common with other parrots, the budgerigar is apt to be a carrier of psittacosis and bird fanciers kissing and fondling these pets thereby incur a greater risk from psittacosis than from poliomyelitis. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am sorry that copies of my speech are not available for honorable senators, but they will be distributed before eight o'clock to-night. Some alterations were made to the draft at the last minute and it was not possible to have copies roneoed in time if we were to get the bill on the business paper in the order I desired. </para>
                    <para>This bill proposes, firstly, that the existing liability limit and capital of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation be doubled to enable it to meet the growing demands from Australian exporters for its services. It also proposes a minor drafting amendment to that section of the principal act dealing with conditions of employment. </para>
                    <para>The Export Payments Insurance Corporation was established by the government in 1956 to enable Australian exporters to insure against risk of loss arising from nonpayment of their overseas accounts. As this facility is not provided by commercial insurance companies, it represented a new aid to the Australian exporter. Since the Commonwealth is, in the last resort, responsible for any losses of the corporation it was necessary to stipulate in the principal act a maximum liability figure. This was set at £25,000,000. It was also necessary to provide adequate workingcapital for the corporation. This figure was set at £500,000. The corporation is charged to conduct its business on a commercial basis. The value of business already insured by the corporation is clear evidence of the important role it has assumed in the expansion of Australian exports. </para>
                    <para>In the ten months from September, 1957, to June, 1958, the corporation wrote over £11,000,000 worth of business involving exports to 64 countries. In the following six months the corporation wrote a further £12,000,000 of new business. Not only have the value and number of policies increased significantly but the corporation has covered the widest range of Australian export commodities both primary and secondary. These include wool, both greasy and processed, meat, butter, canned food stuffs, metals, plastics, earth-moving equipment, as well as a variety of other manufactured goods. </para>
                    <para>In recent weeks, the volume of business available to the corporation has reached the level where the existing liability limit as specified in the act is already inadequate. Unless it is raised there is every indication that the corporation will be unable to continue to accommodate the volume of business offered to it. The bill has provision therefore to double the existing maximum liability figure in section 28 of the act from £25,000,000 to £50,000,000. </para>
                    <para>Before deciding on this new figure, the Government carefully considered what were likely to be the future requirements of the corporation. We arrived at this figure of £50,000,000 not only after an examination of the corporation's trading position but also after considering the advice on this matter given by the consultative council of the corporation and the recently formed Export Development Council. These bodies unanimously recommended a level of £50,000,000, and this confirmed the Government's own assessment of what appeared to be a reasonable figure. </para>
                    <para>At the present time, export business valued at £52,000,000 is covered or is under negotiation by the corporation. The current contingent liability resulting from this business is over £24,000,000. The adequacy of the liability limit will be kept under review by the Government to ensure that the needs of the Australian exporter for this facility are fully met. </para>
                    <para>The bill also includes an amendment of section 23 (1.) of the act to enable the capital of the corporation to be doubled to £1,000,000. The capital of an organization of this type is used as a revolving fund. Normally it can expect to have large sums of money either paid to exporters, or earmarked to be paid to them, as a result of claims made. The corporation would normally expect, in time, to recover from overseas much of the money involved, but months, perhaps years, may elapse before such amounts are recovered. It is necessary then for the corporation to have sufficient capital to cover this ebb and flow of moneys. </para>
                    <para>The alternative would be to give the corporation inadequate capital and then have it either - (a) borrow the money from Treasury as the need arises; or (b) return to Parliament for more money when the existing capital is exhausted. Neither method would enhance the stature of the corporation and could lead to delays in the settlement of exporters' claims. </para>
                    <para>The better, and normal, procedure is to provide the corporation from the outset with sufficient capital to perform the function for which it was created. It is because substantial sums may have to be carried by the corporation rather than by exporters, because of events outside their control, that only governments are prepared and able to provide this form of insurance. The capital figure of the Australian scheme is in no way excessive when compared with overseas organizations in this field. The Canadian scheme, for example, has, pro rata, several times the capital of the Australian corporation. </para>
                    <para>The fact that the Australian scheme, which has been operating only eighteen months, has not yet had any substantial demands made on its capital does not mean that these fortuitous circumstances can be expected to continue in the future. The corporation has in fact earmarked some thousands of its money for future settlement of claims now notified by exporters. In the future, the corporation must expect to have a more normal claims experience, and, as the move to raise the liability limit will enable more business to be handled by the corporation, it is prudent that capital should be .provided to match this new business. </para>
                    <para>A further, but less important, reason is the fact that the corporation will be involved in additional expenditure in preparing for the new business which will be open to it to seek. This expenditure takes two forms. First, additional information is required from overseas about both countries and customers in anticipation of business which will be brought to it. Secondly, the staff in Australia will have to be increased, not only on the administrative and technical sides, but also in the promotional field. The majority of exporters or potential exporters are not yet fully aware of the extent to which the Export Payments Insurance Corporation can enable them to quote on more competitive terms in overseas markets, by removing risks which they must otherwise allow for in their costing. Ultimately, this increased expenditure should be met from increased premium incomes resulting from the new business acquired. But in the present circumstances this will not begin to be received until after the expenditure has been incurred. </para>
                    <para>Finally, the need for the increase has been carefully examined by both the Consultative Council of the corporation and by the Export Development Council, both of whom have recommended to the Minister for Trade that this increase was both necessary and desirable to enable the corporation to continue to operate on a commercial basis. </para>
                    <para>The third amendment proposed, that to section  18(3.),  is purely a drafting change designed to clarify the wording of the principal act in relation to terms and conditions of employment. </para>
                    <para>Last financial year the corporation was able to show an operating surplus of  £4,000.  It is the objective of the corporation to be self-supporting and in the long term to show neither profit nor loss. That such excellent results should be obtained during the corporation's formative period holds great promise for its future activity. The arrangements proposed should enable the corporation fully to keep pace with the demands for its services. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>

                            <para>-  Speaking to the point of order, I submit that the select committee's report in which the establishment of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was first recommended, the subsequent proceedings in the Senate, and the second report should be perused at length by the Minister before he denies that it is within the functions of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to report upon the proper scope of clauses in a bill giving power to make regulations. I submit that the question whether the subject-matter of the report is within the authorization of the committee is not a question of order, but a question of substance to be debated on its merits when the motion for the printing of the report is debated. In all conscience, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I ask the Senate not to deny the authority to which the Minister objects, just on a point of order, but to consider it as a matter of substantive procedure. I ask the Senate to take this report into account and consider it in a proper manner on the basis of motion that the report be printed. </para>

The Regulations and Ordinances Committee thinks that it discharges the duty entrusted to it by submitting this report, giving its opinion, in timely fashion, at a time when the bill is under consideration by the Senate. In terms of the report of the select committee which was responsible for setting up the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee can take, not merely corrective action, but preventive action for the information and consideration of the Senate. I hope that the Senate will proceed in the spirit of seeking the utmost consideration of and debate upon the fundamental principles involved in clauses 40 and 41 of the bill, and that points of order will not be used as a means to preclude us from complete deliberation of those principles. </para>

T also support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> expressed wish that full deliberation and discussion will not be thwarted merely by taking a point of order. However, there is a time and a place for everything. The proper procedure, as contemplated by the Standing Order, is for this committee to meet and then to consider and report on all regulations and ordinances laid on the table of the Senate. We have no assurance at present that these clauses referred to in the report - clauses 40 and 41 - will, in fact, be passed. The proper place for them to be considered and adjudicated upon surely is in the committee of the whole of the Senate, not in the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. </para>

                    <para>We will shortly constitute ourselves a committee of the whole of the Senate. That is the place to determine whether clauses 40 and 41 should be passed. That determination is not the province of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee; it is the function of the committee of the whole of the Senate. If in the fullness of time these clauses are passed and regulations are made under them, I trust that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee will most carefully scrutinize these regulations, but I think the committee is rather anticipating its function in dealing with clauses that are under consideration by a committee of the whole of the Senate and giving a forewarning. Let that be done by all means, but in a committee of the whole of the Senate. Later, if obnoxious regulations are made under those clauses, I trust that the committee will bring them to the notice of the Senate, where they can be dealt with. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the view I submit, that does not purport to be the exclusive function of the committee. In fact, from time to time the Senate has taken quite the contrary view. We have had many reports from the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which set out the principles upon which it approaches its task. Those principles have been debated and affirmed by the Senate. If the committee was concerned solely with dealing with particular regulations referred to it under Standing </para>
                    <para>Order 36a (4.), it would have no right to be affirming sets of principles for the future guidance of the legislature. 1 submit that it would be rather against common sense to say to the committee, " You may approach the matter of regulations and ordinances only after damage has been done by their being put through in some obnoxious form ". As the Senate well knows, a regulation becomes operative the moment it is promulgated and, although it is subject to scrutiny by the standing committe and is subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament, very many months may elapse during which the regulation would be effective. The regulation may be one that is lacking in power or which offends against all the principles that have been laid down by the committee. I think it is against plain common sense to say to the committee, which derives its title and functions from its name - the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, expressed in very general terms - that it is hidebound and has to confine its attention only to regulations and ordinances that have in fact become operative. </para>
                    <para>So, on those grounds, I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in his opposition to the point of order. I summarize them as follows: First, Standing Order 36a (4.) is not exclusive; secondly, it is plainly against common sense to hold otherwise; and, thirdly, I point to the many occasions upon which the committee has affirmed the principles upon which it functions. I submit that, if the committee was confined merely to consideration of regulations and ordinances that came before it, it was out of order, with the full concurrence of the Senate, in laying down general principles. T repeat that for those reasons I oppose the point of order. </para>

                            <para>- I support the point of order that has been taken by my colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge).</inline> I refer . in particular to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> comment that the Standing Committee of Regulations and Ordinances proceeds in accordance with principles and procedures that are laid down by the committee itself. I remind the honorable senator that those principles and procedures are set out in the fourth report of the committee. In fact, I think they have been set out in more than one report of the committee, but this proposal came before us at short notice and I have not had the time to go through all the reports of the committee in the way in which I should like to have gone through them. 1 said that the committee itself, in its fourth report, set down the principles upon which it operates. To my recollection, those principles have stood the test of years; they have not been departed from. The principles that the committee adopted as its guiding stars were as follows: That it would scrutinize regulations to ascertain whether they were in accordance with the statute; that the regulations did not trespass unduly on personal rights, and liberties; that they did not unduly make the rights and liberties of citizens dependent upon administrative and not upon judicial decision; that they were concerned with administrative detail and did not amount to substantive legislation which should be a matter for parliamentary enactment. </para>

                    <para>I do not discern in those principles or in practice any proposal that the committee has what might be called an anticipatory power - that it can anticipate what the Senate will do or what its decision will be, and proceed to examine and scrutinize in advance something which may or may not happen. In other words, it seems to me to be quite contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> says, and quite contrary to good sense and orderly procedure, that a committee should proceed to present a report upon a bill before the Senate without knowing whether that bill will be translated into an act. I can see no alternative, in orderly procedure, to the committee's having to wait until such time as the legislation is passed and the regulations are made. Who is to say whether, when the regulations are enacted, they will offend against the principles which guide the committee in its examination? It may well be that, the committee even though it does not like the terms of the legislation, will say, when the regulations are drafted, passed by the Executive Council and tabled in the Senate, " There is nothing in these regulations to which we take any objection ". It seems to me to be wrong in principle and in practice for a committee of the Senate to interrupt deliberations upon a bill and object to something which, when it comes to fruition, may not in any sense be objectionable to the committee or the Senate. </para>

The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is based on the procedures of the British House of Commons. In the House of Commons, in regard to certain regulations quite the reverse procedure is followed to that which is followed here. Regulations do not take effect until fifteen sitting days after they are laid on the table of the House of Commons. Here, regulations become effective immediately, but may be disallowed by either House within fifteen sitting days after they have been laid on the table. So it will be seen that we have had only a partial stating of the case to-night. </para>

                    <para>What the committee is trying to do is to draw its power and inspiration from the Mother of Parliaments, and to put the machinery in motion to prevent regulations from becoming operative before we have had a chance to do anything about them. The point has been taken on this occasion because the whole crux of the matter is that the provision in the bill relating to the payment of  £7,500  compensation commences with the words " Subject to regulation ". Instead of making the relative provision one of legislative enactment, the Senate is asked to make it the subject of regulatory power which, of course, takes it completely out of the hands of the Parliament. I think that a narrow view has been taken. Because of the nature of the Senate as a States' House, the whole of our proceedings should be based on wide terms. You yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> during the years that you have been in the chair, have always taken a very wide view, particularly in regard to debates and matters of interpretation. </para>
                    <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has pointed out, when the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was originally set up, it was given- power to take preventive action. The only way in which preventive action can be taken is for the committee to do exactly what it has done on this occasion. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> was asked to restate his case, he said that he based it on Standing Order  36a. 1  suggest that he would have been more truthful if he had stated that he based it on a part of that standing order. He said before that he based his argument on paragraph  (1.),  but of course he did not. Paragraph  (3.)  provides that the committtee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records. The paper that it has sent for on this occasion is the bill that is before the Senate. We have sent for that paper and we have examined it. </para>
                    <para>We are alarmed at the excessive regulatory powers that the Government is attempting to write into the Statute Book. We suggest - and this is the very point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> made - that substantive legislation is being by-passed and that the Government is trying to use the regulatory power to take the place of the head of power under which we work. Instead of using substantive legislation, the Government is using the regulation-making power. I do not think that there is any shadow of doubt that that is being done. We are entitled under paragraph  (3.)  of Standing Order  36a  to send for papers. We have done that. After due deliberation, we have presented a report to warn the Senate so that it may take action before the damage is done, before it passes a bill which would allow an undue use of the regulation-making power. </para>

                            <para>- I might or might not like the provisions of clause  41  of this bill, but that is not in issue at the moment. I hope that the very enthusiastic members of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, of which I was once a member, do not make it the issue. After all, we are only debating a point of order relating to a motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> in regard to the deliberations of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, and that point of order rests on Standing Order  36a.  My submission, briefly, is that the powers of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee flow exclusively from Standing Order  36a.  The committee cannot take unto itself additional power. In this case, I suggest that it is anticipating an act of this Parliament and taking objection to it. In effect, it is saying, " Clause 4 1 of the bill contains something that we do not like, and, as the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, we object to it and ask that that objection be noted by this Parliament and debated ". f think that the committee is far exceeding its powers, as denned by the Standing Orders. The only power that the committee h?s is contained in Standing Order 36a, which gives it very wide power over regulations and ordinances that have been properly tabled. </para>

                    <para>In this case, no regulation has been tabled. I suggest that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is endeavouring to take over the powers of the Parliament relative to a clause of this bill. The committee should wait until regulations are properly promulgated. Then by all means let us have a debate on the merits of the regulations and on whether they are properly worded, whether they are proper for delegated legislation, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood's</inline> expression, and whether, in fact, regulations should be made at all under clause 41 of the proposed legislation. </para>
                    <para>I have very often objected to delegated legislation and to the Ministry taking over the power of the Parliament per medium of delegated legislation. That is something that is always apt to creep into our laws. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. I</inline> also object to any section of this Parliament - in this instance it happens to be a committee of the Parliament - taking unto itself the powers of the Parliament. The power of the Parliament in this case is quite clear. We have already before us a clause of a bill. No committee, including those of the Mother of Parliaments, on whose procedure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> rested his Argument. has the right to take from a parliament the power to pass a clause. T stand on that argument because T feel that it is a most important one. Important rs the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is. and important as its work is, it has no right to supersede the powers of Parliament. I therefore support the point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge.</inline></para>

                            <para>-  The debate on the point of order to this stage has revolved around the merits of the committee and its right to make such a report. To that extent, the debate has not been oriented in the correct direction. The motion before the Senate is one for the printing of the report, on which the Minister has taken a point of order to the effect that the motion is out of order. Let us have a look at the Standing Orders that are particularly directed to the tabling of reports and the moving of such motions. When those are looked at, I think that the Senate will come to the conclusion that, regardless of the substantive merits or demerits of the report of the committee, or of its right to make such a report in the present circumstances, at least there is ground for the presentation of the report followed by the motion that has been moved. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the position in ordinary circumstances. Leave the matter in dispute out of it for a moment. At least all regulations which are within the period of time during which the Senate can disallow regulations, are referred to the committee. But, beyond that, all regulations at any time passed by this Senate stand constantly referred to the committee. In other words, the committee has a very greatly extended power and competence. I think that, quite contrary to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> submits, this chamber is not trying to derogate from the powers of the Parliament but is trying to assist the Parliament in the exercise of its own powers. If you look at the report of the committee you will see that it does not purport to attract any authority to itself. The committee merely draws the attention of this chamber to what it considers to be its powers and to certain dangers inherent in matters before the Senate. It suggests a certain course of action to the Senate in the process of its debate. Quite contrary to that being a derogation of the powers of the Senate, I think it is obviously ancillary to it and for its comfort, solace and assistance. Therefore, the Senate at this stage, rather than resenting the intrusion of the committee, should welcome the interest and the attention that have been given in this narrow but important field by the deliberations of an expert and experienced committee which has chosen to draw the attention of the Senate during the passage of a bill to things that it thinks are inherently dangerous. The committee has done so rather than allow the Parliament to proceed, and allow regulations to be made in pursuance of the bill as it stands, when it becomes an act. The committee has shown a red light to the Senate and asked it to halt and consider the position in the light of the experience of the committee. </para>

The motion is for the printing of the paper, and in terms of Standing Order 365 we have no option but to decide that question irrespective of the contents of the report. On the other matter, that is within the competence of the committee, and in exercising that competence it is acting in an assistance to the Senate. </para>

                            <para>-  The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> has submitted that the motion for the printing of the report is out of order. Divers arguments have been placed before the Senate as to whether or not it was in order for the committee to furnish the report. I submit that there is no substance in the point of order, and I remind the Senate that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was appointed as a result of reports and recommendations for the appointment of such a committee that were brought down by two special committees of the Senate. It was provided that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee should examine acts, bills and regulations and take preventive action in the case of any attempt being made to take from this Parliament its right to introduce substantive legislation. The committee has power to examine regulations made under an act of this Parliament and to submit a report to this chamber, so that corrective action can be taken. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> makes a fluent but inane interjection. The committee has brought this report before the Senate for its consideration. It is right that it should do so at this time, so that corrective action can be taken in order to prevent the Senate from being placed in a ridiculous position. I point out that administrative regulations cannot be made until substantive legislation is passed, and it is the duty of the committee to see that a regulation is in accordance with the Statute. Therefore, all the talk of this committee trying to abrogate the right of the Senate is so much tommy-rot. The position is exactly the reverse. The committee is reporting to the Senate that if this proposed legislation becomes law the powers of enactment will be handed over to delegated authority and will be taken away from the Senate. We have brought this matter before the Senate at this stage so that if this bill becomes law, we will not be faced with the need to examine the regulations at a later stage and recommend their rejection. The Senate is being given the opportunity to discuss now a position which will become more difficult to handle in the future when, as I have said, if the proposed legislation in its present form becomes law, the committee will be faced with the duty of recommending the rejection of certain regulations. The committee should be able now to examine, within the framework of the bill, the regulations and ordinances necessary to carry out the expressed policy of the Parliament. There is no substantive legislation whatever in the provisions of the bill to which the committee has directed its attention. The insertion of these provisions giving power to issue regulations is a complete sell-out to the Executive of the powers and functions of the Parliament. </para>

                    <para>The committee has submitted a report to show how objectionable and how wrong that practice is. We are asking the Senate, to consider at the appropriate time that very vital principle of democratic legislation. We contend that the obligations and the rights of those who will have to suffer or enjoy this legislation in the future should be clearly defined by substantive legislation and not by regulation. The report of the committee is intended to assist the Senate to operate as it should do - as a house of review. </para>

                    <para>As to the merits of the paper, it is of importance that the Senate consider some of the history of the appointment of the committee. Standing Order 36a was incorporated in the Standing Orders in 1932 following the report of a select committee which was appointed to consider, report upon and make recommendations as to the advisability or otherwise of establishing standing committees to report upon statutory rules, ordinances and certain other matters. As a result of that comprehensive report, which was presented on 9th April, 1930, the standing order to which I have referred came into being. The following statement appears in paragraph 23 of the report: - </para>

                    <para>I suggest that the committee, having called for a relevant paper - in this instance the bill itself - should at this stage exercise a preventative power, as it were, and close the stable door before the horse escapes. I consider that this report has merit also. Therefore, I submit that the proposal of the Minister for Civil Aviation is out of order for two reasons, first, having regard to the provisions of Standing Order 365 to which I referred, and, secondly, because the report of the committee is the result of a valid exercise of the power of the committee. The Senate should not accept the Minister's proposal. </para>

                            <para>- In taking issue with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> I assume that the Standing Orders are in their present form to enable proper and orderly debate in this chamber, and that they have been formulated in the expectation that honorable senators will comply with their requirements. If that is so, they undoubtedly support the contention of the Minister for Civil Aviation to the effect that it is out of order at this stage - indeed, possibly, at any stage, but certainly at this stage - to move for the printing of the report now before us because it is a report from a committee which, whether it has the power to make a report or not - I think it has not - nevertheless anticipates an order of the day on to-day's business paper. The report purports to set in motion a debate or to encourage the Senate to arrive at some decision on a portion of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Bill which is listed on the business paper as Order of the Day, No. 1, Government Business. If that is so - and it is so - then the point of order surely must be upheld. </para>

                    <para>I should like to point out that during our discussions this morning a good deal of attention was given to the question whether we had power to submit a report at this stage. We members of the committee feel satisfied that we have the power, and that we should be failing in our duty if we did not present the report at this time. The Senate, on the other hand, might not hold that view and, whatever ruling is given, it will be of great value as a guide for the future conduct of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. </para>

                            <para>-  Let me say, as  chairman  of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, that I am amazed at the reaction of some Government senators to this motion. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee is a standing committee of the Senate. One of the objectives of that committee is the preservation of the rights of Parliament against usurpation by the Executive. The committee is constantly working towards ensuring that Parliament, not the Executive, runs Parliament. We hear it said from time to time that control of Parliament is slipping from the hands of the parliamentarians, and that Parliament is being run by the civil servants. This committee is at all times concerned with ensuring that it acts according to the requirements of the Parliament. The essence of the report which the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has submitted to the Senate is emphasis on the fact that in at least two particular cases there will be coming before the Senate legislation which will give the Executive power to make regulations which could override what Parliament has done. </para>

                    <para>There is nothing personal in this matter. We members of the committee have a high regard for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge.</inline> He is a most co-operative Minister. I, as  chairman  of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, have interviewed the Minister twice to-day and I was received with the utmost courtesy on each occasion. I repeat that there is nothing personal about the matter. It is a simple parliamentary question. I believe that the Minister will be prepared to accept an amendment that will take away some of the powers that would otherwise go to the Executive. </para>
                    <para>Again, I must say, in fairness to the Minister, that I believe he is conscious of the necessity for keeping as much power as possible within the hands of Parliament, but we members of the committee take the view that if the legislation which is coming before the Senate is passed in its present form, there is a danger that certain power might drift from Parliament to the executive, and we feel it our duty to draw the attention of the Parliament to that fact. I emphasize that in making that point the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is not trying to run the Parliament. </para>

I look upon the Senate as a very dignified institution, as an institution that should be held in the highest of esteem by all the people of the Commonwealth. I emphasize that in defending the rights of Parliament we are defending the rights of the highest forum in the country and when I speak as I do I am treating the matter very seriously indeed. </para>

                    <para>In submitting its report at this stage, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is acting as custodian of the rights of this Parliament; it is not seeking to take unto itself any of the rights of Parliament. The Senate should be very grateful at having such a vigilant Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I have been a member of that committee since 1949 and I have seen more Government senators than Opposition senators slide from it because they felt that its work was too dry and uninteresting. I am the only one of the Government senators who were on the committee in 1949. In all fairness to the Opposition senators and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> the Queensland </para>
                    <para class="block">Labour party's representative on that committee, I must say that on all occasions the deliberations of that committee have been conducted strictly in accordance with the principles of its establishment - on a non-party basis. I am certain that every member of the committee works according to the highest ideals of parliamentary practice and I resent any indication by one of my colleagues that the report now submitted is untrue. I point out that the honorable senator who makes the suggestion was at one time a member of this committee, and he got off it. </para>
                    <para>Speaking on behalf of all members of the committee, and especially for myself, as a layman who has remained on the committee ever since 1949, I can assure honorable senators that its work is not easy. If one is to do one's job properly as a member of that committee, one must really exercise one's mind. </para>
                    <para>I want to make it clear at this stage that the Minister knew that I would be submitting this report to-night if he intended to persist with the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Bill as at present drafted. As I said before, there is no conflict between the Minister and the committee. </para>

There is no keener supporter of the Liberal-Country party side of this Senate than I, but I am not so blind as to believe that every amendment suggested is an affront to the Government. That is not my outlook on parliamentary life. I look upon the bigger, basic things in Parliament and the narrow-minded view some of the government senators are taking on this question does not say very much for them. </para>

                    <para>In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> took the right point on this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> indicated quite clearly that before submitting its report the Regulations and Ordinances Committee went into the matter thoroughly, and the fact that it has reported in the way in which it has done is proof positive of the fact that the Senate's purpose in establishing the committee in the first place was to guard against the taking of power from the Parliament and placing it in the hands of the Executive. Every time the Regulations and Ordinances Committee poses anything there is a suggestion that it seeks to take away the power of the Parliament. When we submitted a report in connexion with import licensing, the same suggestion was made. I say this very clearly: When the Government puts me on a committee to act as a member, I act according to my conscience, as a member of this, the highest parliament in the Commonwealth. I shall always act accordingly and I believe that the committee also acts in that way. It acts in the interest of Parliament, not in its own interest, and if the Government does not think that we are doing the right thing it can put some one else in my job at any time. I know that since 1949, government senators have slid off the committee as quickly as they possibly could do so. </para>

                            <para>- This appears to me to be a perfectly simple question. We have a committee which has the right and duty to discuss regulations and, if necessary, to advise us to disallow them. I have always heeded - and will always heed - any such report, but this report appears to me to be an attempt to influence a bill that we intend to make a statute. On that ground, I would prefer that the report be withdrawn and I shall either support the point of order or, if that fails, vote against the paper being printed. That is something that I certainly do not want to do because T think that to reject deliberately a motion that a paper be printed would be disastrous to the attempts that some of us are making to have working committees. That is why T regret the motion and would prefer that the  chairman  of the committee withdrew it altogether. </para>

The committee has taken upon its shoulders the burden of removing the very thing that the honorable senator wishes to uphold - the power of this assembly. I remind him that we have not even passed this bill yet. The things of which he complains are not even in operation, and what he had to say would have been more properly said at the committee stage of the bill. No regulation is yet in operation. How can one ask that a regulation be not allowed when it does not even, exist? With all due respect to the vigilance of the honorable senator, I think that he has gone off before the event. He has anticipated our right to debate this matter in the House and in the committee and I am, therefore, strongly opposed to everything that he had to say on that score. </para>

The Minister is completely out of order, and off the course, in trying, by way of a point of order, to prevent a paper from being printed. The Standing Orders that have been quoted are almost mandatory on the point that the committee must bring down the paper and ask that it be printed. If the Government does not wish the paper to be printed it can vote against that happening. That has been done hundreds of times in this Parliament. However, I appeal to the Minister not to virtually lay down a procedure which will govern the future operation of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. If the point of order is upheld, that fact will go onto the record and it will be assumed that the Senate has decided that a committee shall have no anticipatory powers. That might be a good thing; it might be a bad thing. Certainly, I think that it is a matter for separate debate and cold, calm decision. I do not think that the upholding of a point of order should be allowed to become a permanent indication that a committee cannot do what has been proposed to-night. </para>

We have had similar motions on the notice-paper, and they have stayed there for weeks and months. They have not been discussed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton's</inline> suggestion notwithstanding, discussion does not automatically follow the printing of a paper. The approach of the committee should be considered separately - it should be given the right to-night to print the paper, and the Government should discuss the matter of the anticipatory powers of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in the joint party rooms. After all, the Government can lay down the powers of this committee. I do not wish to confuse honorable senators, but I would suggest that we should keep the larger issue for wider debate at a later stage and treat the question of the printing of the paper as a separate matter. </para>

                    <para>. - Last night I promised to give further consideration to a suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that in assessing damages for death the rule that damages shall be reduced by reference to the benefit accruing to the dependants from the estate of the deceased should be mitigated. I have now given consideration to the matter and I do not feel that I can support the suggestion. As far as I can ascertain, no such provision has been made in the legislation of the United Kingdom or of any Australian State except Tasmania. Tn Tasmania in 1943. a provision was made to the effect that in assessing damages the value of such portion of the estate of the deceased person as passes to members of his family shall not be taken into account except insofar as such value exceeds £2,000. In 1955 that figure was changed to £5,000. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Honorable senators will, I am sure, agree that the Commonwealth would need to be convinced of the merits of the Tasmanian provision before adopting it in the face of the fact that no other State had adopted it, although it had been in force in Tasmania for nearly twenty years. The merit of the provision depends on what it is that the legislature is seeking to compensate. If the theory is the traditional one that the relatives are entitled to be compensated only for their pecuniary loss it is quite logical to take into account, by way of reduction, the benefits accruing to them from the estate of the deceased. </para>
                <para>One cannot help thinking that the real motive behind the special provision made in Tasmania was the mitigation of the harshness of the rule confining damages to pecuniary loss. Nevertheless, it appears to be in conflict with the accepted principle at present applied by all other Australian courts in assessing pecuniary loss. What the present bill does is face the problem squarely by way of a provision especially removing from the court the fetter of the old rule relating to pecuniary loss only. It may be urged that on this reasoning even the exclusions contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the clause should not be made, but those exclusions are well established under State laws generally and I feel that we should repeat them in this legislation. For those reasons, I cannot accept the honorable senator's objection. </para>

                    <para>.- I am obliged to the Minister for that full statement of reasons and considerations. I trespass on the attention of the Senate only because of the importance of this matter, particularly to people of less affluent means. I point out to the Minister that a contract for insurance is excluded from consideration in the case which we are considering - where a breadwinner has been killed in an air accident and his widow is claiming compensation from the aircraft company. It is said that if the widow derives moneys from a life insurance policy, those moneys should not operate as a reduction of the damages that she has claimed. Every one of us supports that principle, because the insurance policy would be the product of the deceased's thrift and it would be an iniquitous inequity that it should be used to reduce the compensation payable by a wrongdoer. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Then we come to paragraph (b), which deals wi|th superannuation. Superannuation, both in the commercial and public service field, now amounts to very substantial figures. Superannuation is sometimes payable in a lump sum and sometimes by way of an annual pension, but the sums are very substantial indeed. When a widow becomes entitled to superannuation, that superannuation should not operate so as to reduce the damages that she is entitled to claim from the aircraft company. The case that I am urging is this: You have a working man and his wife who have put their savings, not, with the aid of the Commonwealth Government, into superannuation, nor into a life insurance policy, but into a home. Because the husband's home accrues to the widow by virtue of his will, the value of that asset, to the extent to which its enjoyment has been accelerated by the accidental death of the husband, is insisted upon as a legitimate deduction from the widow's recovery. </para>
                <para>I am not here to engage in needless contention, but I cannot deny that I get a little relish from supporting principles such as I am contending for now. I think the denial of these principles spells an outlook that is a little determined to fail to see that the widow of the working man is just as entitled to adequate consideration as is the widow of a public servant or the widow of a company director whose superannuation will be ample. If a public servant or a company director is killed in an aircraft accident, we exclude the consideration of that superannuation benefit - not with my disapproval, although I think the time has come to qualify the extent to which it is excluded. My researches cannot be as extensive as those of the advisers of the Minister, but it gives me considerable pride to know that a precedent exists, as he says, in Tasmanian legislation. If it exists there alone, then, as old Shakespeare said, " The fewer men, the greater share of honour ". Tasmania can claim a unique honour in urging this reform. </para>
                <para>So that the matter may be fully considered, just let me read from one of the law reports a case tried in Victoria in 1934. A widow claimed damages for injury to herself and her child arising out of the death of her husband as a consequence of alleged negligence of the defendant. The widow was the sole beneficiary under her husband's will. The defendant alleged that the mishap was due to contributory negligence on the part of the husband. The judge held that, after ascertaining the total damages, if any, suffered by the plaintiff and her child and apportioning the damages between them, there should be deducted from the amount awarded as the plaintiff's benefit the net benefit received by her under her husband's will. Do not let me mislead the Senate. If a home is worth £5,000, you do not deduct £5,000, but you deduct the benefit of the accelerated enjoyment which the widow is deemed to derive by the fact that her husband was killed by accident at the age of 40 instead of dying from natural causes - perhaps I am being optimistic - at the age of 65. I speak for myself, with but little of my span to go. </para>

                    <para>. -  I venture to say that few in this Senate were not shocked when the Minister conceded the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that the courts take into account in assessing damages in cases of injury or death in air accidents all the property that a deceased breadwinner might leave to his widow. I should like to picture to the Senate the type of case that might arise. It has already been made plain that a court in assessing these damages is not to take into account a sum paid or payable out of a superannuation, provident or like fund. Let us assume that the greatest disaster of all happens and that a member of the Senate suffers death in an air accident .as a passenger.  His  widow is entitled, in terms of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act, to a pension of £10 a week. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That is the first position 1 should like the Senate to look at. That pension will not be taken into account, or be capitalized, having regard to her expectation of life, and used to reduce the damages in her case. But if an ordinary civilian widow is involved, who gets a pension of £4 a week as a civilian widow, the value of that pension over the period of her expectation of life will be capitalized and used to reduce the amount of damages otherwise payable. Who in the Senate feels proud and happy about that? Who is proud to think that the widow of a parliamentarian getting £10 a week on the death of her husband in an air accident does not have that amount accounted in mitigation of damages, but that the widow of an ordinary civilian who becomes entitled to a widow's pension will have that pension assessed, capitalized and used in mitigation of damages? I hope the Senate clearly understands that that is the position. </para>
                <para>The Minister is not quite accurate in saying that only one State in Australia has made a provision prohibiting the courts from taking into account social service payments. It is clearly defined in Tasmania in two respects - I shall deal with one only now - that social service payments are not to be used in mitigation of the damages an airline operator might have to pay. In section 3 of the Compensation to Relatives Act of New South Wales there is a similar provision. That section provides that widows' pensions, miners' pensions, invalid and age pensions and the rest, together with any amendments that may be made to those pensions, are not to be taken into account in assessing damages, or in mitigation of damages that may be payable to dependants. I sought the opportunity to-day to examine the position in other States, but 1 must confess that others had been in the field ahead of me and that every book I wanted had disappeared from the Library. I have no doubt that, if I were to look just now, I would find them scattered around this chamber! But I do know what the position is in two States on the question of social services in mitigation of damages. </para>
                <para>Now I come to the question of including, in mitigation of damages, property that devolves from the deceased onto his widow. I would say that the position there is very fluid. It is not so narrow that Tasmania is the only State which disregards some portion of it up to £5,000. I understand it is the practice in New South Wales for judges to direct juries not to take such an element into consideration in mitigation of damages. But at this very moment there is an appeal pending before the Full Court of that State against a direction of that nature made by a judge of the Supreme Court. So that matter is coming up for acute review in New South Wales at the moment. Having regard to the long practice of courts both here and abroad of taking property so devolving into account, it may well be that the easier position operating in New South Wales at the instance of judges will be tightened up. So I point out to the Minister that, apart from the Tasmanian legislation, the trend in New South Wales is not to take that factor into consideration. This Government ought to be moving with that modern, far more liberal tide. </para>

                        <para>- Having regard to the long-established practice of the judges, quite apart from law and precedent, if the Full Court reversed the practice 1 would expect any government in that State to legislate to reverse the effect of the decision. That is the modern trend, the humanitarian trend. 1 invite the committee to consider the plight of a civilian widow whose husband was killed in an air accident. Let us assume that she has a family of young children, and that there is a home and possessions of the value, we will say, of £7.500. Let us assume that damages are proved at least to the sum of £7,500. Pursuant to the position the committee now faces, the court will say, " As a result of your husband being killed you now become the owner of assets to the value of £7,500 that you did not have before. Therefore, you will get nothing." Imagine the plight of that widow with young children, unable to go to work herself, and debarred from the widow's pension because of the property she possesses. What is her only outlook? It is to sell the domestic home which has been run at a reasonable standard and go into sub-standard lodgings in order to provide money to keep the family together and to keep them fed, clothed, and educated. She has to sacrifice the one great asset that has been built up through the joint efforts of her husband and herself. When that is made plain, it presents the bill in an entirely different light. I venture to say that the widow of very few parliamentarians would benefit under this legislation. </para>

                <para>I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> warning to the committee a moment ago that the whole value of the property is not necessarily brought into account. Yesterday the honorable senator referred us to a South Australian case in which one judge - it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dixon, as he then was, but who is now Chief Justice of the High Court - said that it may well be that the value to be taken into account is the speeding up of the ownership to the lady. It is not necessarily that for the first time she becomes possessed of the asset; there is the fact of her continuing possession, and it is supplemented by complete ownership in addition to the hitherto right of ownership. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I point out to the honorable senator, as in the case 1 cited a moment ago, that it may be obligatory upon a widow who has small assets in the form of a home and furniture to sell them in order to live from day to day and from week to week. That is not a very happy position. 1 point out, too, that in Victoria the deduction of property on the accelerated value basis has been affirmed by the courts. In 1954 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Sholl, in Darrack v. Ennis applied the principle of accelerated value and not of full market value. So there will be a substantial deduction from damages in respect of any property of a deceased devolving upon his widow. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Let us examine the position under this measure. Three classes of people may participate in the £7,500. One participant is the employer, if the person concerned has been injured for a long period and he has had to be paid workers' compensation. There is also the executor, in respect of loss of profits, funeral expenses and things of that nature and, finally, the widow, children and other dependants. If the amount that is to be available between those three classes is again to be reduced by the value of assets that the deceased left to his family, it can be said that the cover given is relatively insignificant. This matter arises not only under this clause, which deals solely with the Warsaw Convention, but also in another part of the measure where  the  Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol are brought together. It applies also, in clause 38, to the domestic situation in Australia. So <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> in inviting the committee to consider the principles involved in this clause, is merely taking  the  first step in pointing out how far those principles extend through the bill. </para>
                <para>We of the Opposition direct attention to the fact that these principles, in  the  present context, affect only international air travellers. But presently we shall  be  considering the domestic position of Australia. Whilst the former position is of importance to overseas travellers who are Australians, the real scope and ambit of the provision will be felt far more in this country than in relation to overseas travel. In those circumstances, I invite honorable senators to consider whether they have not a feeling of regret that these facts were not before them at a time when they were considering other motions, and to consider whether they have denied themselves the virtue of an opportunity to examine calmly the legislation of the States, to see what is the modern trend, and to see what the courts are deciding. </para>
                <para>I venture to say that a federal parliamentarian would be in a better position to-day where the airlines provide a voluntary insurance of £2,000. At least, his widow would get that with certainty. But it is by no means certain that she would recover any portion of the £7,500 if her husband left a home worth approximately £7,000 and a few other assets, including furniture. It is exceedingly unlikely that his widow would get any benefit at all. I do not direct attention to that case because honorable senators are in any special position; I mention it in order to drive home to the members of the committee just what the facts of the case are. </para>
                <para>On hearing the second-reading speech and in considering the ambit of the bill, one naturally felt that here was a certain cover for one's family if one died in an air accident. Now, it has been disclosed, thanks to the immediate intervention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> that those damages can be offset by the value of property that you leave to your wife or, as she would be in this case, your widow. I invite the committee to watch this position particularly. I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to make any change. That is retrogressive in that at least two States have adopted the principle of discarding social services in calculating damages, and it is the practice of the courts in New South Wales to disregard completely property that devolves. The Minister indicated that this legislation probably would be a model for the world. In this respect, I hope that it is a model that will not be followed and that we shall reshape it before we let it go forth. </para>

                    <para>. -  As 1 am not a lawyer, I do not propose to enter into the legal arguments on this matter. Although the Minister has stated that we have had this bill before us for three weeks, the lay members of the Senate have been more or less frightened off by the legal terminology and the unusual phrases that we find in it. It is not until the more or less everyday aspects of the bill are brought home to us that its full implications become apparent. Since there is no immediate haste to pass the bill, I should very much like to see further discussion postponed until later, so that we could investigate all the propositions that have been discussed. For instance, I think that, like myself, the women senators on the Government side do not wish to see any injustice perpetrated through this legislation. We do not want to legislate sectionally, particularly for the women members of the community, so that one section will be placed in a better position than another. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Minister said that legislation had been approved only in Tasmania - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has shown that it also has been approved in New South Wales - so he meant that it was not much good and that, we should not take much account of it. Of course, that attitude is quite wrong. This is the Commonwealth Parliament, and it should give a lead to the States in these matters, particularly in relation to social services, a matter over which the Federal Government has power. I am not at all happy about this bill. I think that there are some very objectionable features in it. 1 regret that I did not notice one of those features in time to bring it to the notice of the Minister previously, but I intend to do so while the committee is considering the clause with which it is now dealing. I refer to the payment of damages to the dependants of people who have been killed in air accidents. In referring to the classes of people to whom those damages shall be paid, we actually incorporate in legislation of this Commonwealth Parliament the term " illegitimate child ", a term which, for many years, 1 have been fighting to have expunged, if not from the vocabulary, at least from the statute-book. Of course, there is no such thing an an illegitimate child. A child may be brought into the world through the illegitimate association of its parents. Why should the stigma thai attaches to that term be perpetuated in legislation of this Parliament? </para>

Set out on that page is section 10 of the Fatal Accidents Act of that State. The section provides that, in assessing damages, there shall not be taken into account any sum paid or payable on the death of the deceased under any contract of assurance or insurance. There follows, however, a footnote in the following terms: - Notwithstanding this section, deductions may properly be made in respect of premiums which would have had to be paid by the deceased had he lived. Two cases, including one from the Privy Council, are then cited as authorities. The purpose of paragraph (c) is to avoid the odd result of the Tasmanian legislation mentioned in the footnote. </para>

                <para>I wish to say something in respect of the matters referred to by Senators Wright, McKenna and Vincent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> asked what the Government was doing in respect of widows' pensions, in relation to this and similar legislation. I thought that I had made it clear that the Government is giving attention to the whole question of widows' pensions, but obviously, until a general survey of the whole situation is completed it feels unable to move and for that reason is not prepared at this time to give a direction to the courts as to how widows' pensions and other social service benefits should be treated. </para>
                <para>Much has been said about the items  to  be taken into account in mitigation of damages in the case of dependants of members of Parliament, or others for that matter, but of members of Parliament particularly, and I wondered as the criticism was being made whether members of Parliament would be better off without this legislation. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggested might be the case in respect of at least some members of Parliament. The fact is that these items, are not subtracted from the £7.500 but are set off against otherwise proven damages and then the statutory limit is applied. I shall give an example. Suppose that damages without taking into account items in mitigation are £12,000, that items in mitigation are £4,000, this would leave a balance of £8,000: and in that case the limit of £7,500 would apply. In other words, the £4,000 would be deducted not from the £7,500 but from the larger amount. </para>

This is one matter, which, I confess, concerned me after I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> speak last night, and I particularly asked my officers to get for me examples of judgments which might help me in my examination of the matter. It does appear to me that the rule in connexion with the succession of property is not as harsh as might at first appear. 1 think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> who referred, last night, to the case of the Public Trustee v. Zoanetti. I was interested to read the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dixon, as he then was, on that case. He said - </para>

                    <para>When the widow succeeds to property, whether under the will or on the intestacy of the deceased, it may he a question whether the full value is deductible. The true view may be that the devolution of the property upon her has been accelerated and not caused by his death, or, as, for example, in the cass of a house in which she and her husband resided, she may have enjoyed in her lifetime some of the advantages which her ownership will give. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The suggestion of Chief Justice Dixon that the full value of the property may not have to be taken into account has since been fully confirmed - this case was in 1945, which is rather later than the 1934 case that was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> - by a decision of the Court of Appeal in England. Indeed, the Court of Appeal has gone much further and held, in a typical case, that no deduction whatever was to be made in respect of a house in which the widow was living. The case referred to is Heatley  v. </para>
                <para class="block">Steel Company of Wales Limited, reported in All England1 Reports 1953, at page 489.

                    <para>The plaintiff does not thereby come into some large sum of money of which she never had the handling before. She will simply continue to live in this house and provide a home there for the children until it is sold, and if and when it is said she will have to get another house.  Her  two younger children are likely to be living with her for a long lime, and her two elder children are still dependent on her. </para>
                    <para>In the circumstances the court cannot see that any sum requires to be deducted for the value of the house. A successful sale of the lease might produce £1,200, but the plaintiff would then have to find another house to provide accommodation for the children and she would be lucky if she could rent one. Therefore, she is in just the same position as before and has not benefited on this account by her husband's death, except, possibly, by some nominal amount. </para>

Indeed, he may well recall - I think I mentioned this matter at the time - that the convention made world history because it was the first time that agreement had been reached by a group of nations which were prepared, at that time, to innovate. </para>

                <para>We find a rather different group of nations and a rather different set of circumstances when we come to consider the Warsaw Convention. The original Warsaw Convention was done - I believe that is the correct expression - in 1929. When the meeting in connexion with the Hague Protocol took place the suggestion as to the application of a provision relating to the enforcement of judgments was informally taken up with all the parties. It then became obvious that if any attempts were made to write such a provision into the protocol vast differences of opinion would arise and, in the interests of unanimity, and having regard to the fact that such a provision had not been incorporated in the Warsaw Convention, the suggestion was not proceeded with. However, I am informed that international actions, enforcement of judgments and the like, are governed by the ordinary principles of international law. </para>

                        <para>. - The (bill, as printed, contains references to definitions in the Air Navigation Regulations. This was a convenient form of definition which may be open to the objection that it constitutes legislation by reference. I agree that it would be preferable to have the definitions spelled out in the bill itself. We do not mean to distinguish between charter operations and regular public transport operations, both of which may be described as operations for the carriage of passengers or goods for hire or reward. We propose, therefore, to define the expression " commercial transport operations " and to use it in place of the other two expressions. Honorable senators will have read the draft amendments distributed, and I shall move the amendments at the appropriate stage. </para>

                <para>We felt also that the absence of any specific reference to charter operations might give rise to some doubt as to whether liability under the bill falls on an airline operator carrying passengers on charter flights where the passenger's contract of carriage is with the charterer of the aircraft rather than with the airline operator. The third amendment is intended to remove doubts on this point by providing that the contract between the operator and the charterer is deemed to be a contract for the carriage of passengers or baggage. The rights and liabilities of the passengers and the charterer, as between themselves, is a matter outside the scope of this bill and may be regulated by the contract between them. </para>
                <para>The fourth proposed amendment will substitute the expression " commercial transport operations " for the expression " regular public transport operations or charter operations " in clause 27 (1.) of the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise again to comment on the loose wording of the clause under discussion. The Minister proposes to strike out the definition of " charter operations " and insert a definition of " commercial transport operations ". My experience in courts leads me to believe that the proposed amendment, as worded, can apply to passengers only or cargo only when carried in an aircraft used for hire or reward. Take the case of an aircraft that is carrying both passengers and baggage. The proposed amendment does not cover both operations, as it were. An aircraft registered to carry passengers might also carry some cargo without being registered as a cargo carrier. In cases where two operations are involved, the courts usually separate them. For instance, under this proposal, the court would say either that the aircraft was carrying passengers or that it was carrying cargo. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I have found that it is essential that the words " and/or " be written into legislation. This ensures that when an aircraft is carrying passengers and cargo, both operations are covered. The wording of the proposed amendment is too loose. It places a passenger on a plane, which is also carrying cargo, in a most difficult position. The same difficulty arose in connexion with other legislation dealing with compensation. That position has been corrected recently and, as this is really a compensation measure, I submit that the provision should read " and\/or ". That will cover a passenger irrespective of whether the plane is also carrying cargo, and will clarify the position. I ask the </para>
                <para class="block">Minister to give this matter serious consideration, and I have made the suggestion because of the loose wording inserted in legislation from time to time. </para>

Surely it would have been much wiser to frame the clause so as to extend the provisions of this part, which are applicable to interstate trade, to all intra-state trade by air carriers operating by virtue of any constitutional power of this Parliament which would be gained hereafter by constitutional amendment or by reference on the part of any particular State. </para>

                    <para>. - The defence " that the carrier took all necessary measures to avoid the damage " has been retained, following the pattern of the international convention. In the case of baggage, there is no justification for depriving the carrier of the defence. The convention powers thought that in the absence of the defence there would be a flood of small, and perhaps spurious, claims by passengers alleging loss or destruction of baggage. The carriers would find great difficulty in resisting such claims if they did not have at least this narrow defence. </para>

                <para>The committee will notice that an action is not to lie against a carrier in respect of damage unless there has been a complaint by the passenger in writing within a certain very limited period. The period varies from three days to 21 days, according to the nature of the baggage. Those limits are quite arbitrary and conclusive, and if not complied with no action whatever for damages will lie. </para>
                <para>I regard that as a very harsh provision and at the second-reading stage foreshadowed an amendment enabling a court to extend the limits wherever that appeared just and equitable.

Accordingly, I do not address myself to any argument in its support. 1 merely move formally - </para>

                    <para>At the end of the clause add the following sub-clauses: - " (3.) A court having jurisdiction in actions under this Part in respect of baggage may, by order, grant leave to a person to institute or continue an action in that court in relation to baggage notwithstanding that there has been a failure to complain in accordance with the last preceding sub-section within the time fixed by that sub-section, where the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so by reason of special circumstances. " (4.) Sub-section (2.) of this section does not apply in relation to an action in respect of which leave has been granted under the last preceding sub-section.".  1 conclude with the comment that it is possible that an aircraft, either landing or taking off, will capsize and a large number of passengers will be injured, rendered unconscious, or at least sent to a hospital. Possibly the last thing they would think about would be lodging a complaint in respect of their baggage. If the Minister agrees with the proposition, I feel I need not advance my argument in favour of the amendment any further. </para>

                    <para>At the end of the clause add the following sub-clause: - " (2.) Nothing in this part shall exclude or limit the liability of a carrier or his servants or agents, for damage resulting from negligence.". </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The previous clauses impose on carriers strict liability to a limited amount - liability which accrues in a case where damage is caused with or without negligence. When I speak of negligence,  1  mean ordinary carelessness. So the liability imposed by the bill is imposed on the carrier whether he or his servant has or has not been careless. Then it is provided that that is the only civil liability which the carrier undertakes. But clause  37  provides that nothing in these provisions is to exempt the carrier from indemnifying an employer who has paid workers' compensation in respect of a deceased or injured passenger, or is to prevent the carrier from remaining liable to contribute to any damages that any tortfeasor, or joint wrong-doer, has caused. </para>
                <para>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that where the carrier or his servant has been negligent and that negligence has caused damage by way of injury or death to a passenger, his liability shall be preserved and not limited to  ?7,500.  I put this viewpoint before the committee because I think a fundamental principle of the greatest importance is involved. If the Minister opposes the amendment, I ask him to be so good as to instance one case in the conduct of commercial operations in Australia where any person taking the advantage and benefit of our laws for the purpose of commerce enjoys an immunity, either total or limited, from paying compensation for the negligent conduct of his undertaking. </para>
                <para>One of the principles of our law which is almost as fundamental as is the oxygen in the atmosphere we breathe is that any person who is injured by a negligent or careless action is entitled, as an individual fundamental right, to claim compensation in respect of the injury inflicted. I submit that no case can be established in favour specifically of commercial aviation carriers entitling them to an exceptional immunity from liability, where they have been careless, for compensation in excess of  ?7,500. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be quite happy to do that. The commercial aviation carrier has no right to be in the unique position of being exempted from liability above  ?7,500  for negligence, as this bill proposes. The argument that I have to meet, I understand, is that the bill has imposed on him a strict liability, irrespective of negligence, up to  ?7,500.  On  a  formal basis, there is some attraction in that argument; but it is a formal argument only. It is a mere husk of an argument, a mere shell. When you examine it, there is no meat in the egg. </para>

                        <para>- Not as  1  understand it. When you are considering liability for negligence, it is a truism, I think, that the greater the potential for damage the stricter is the standard of care that you are expected to exhibit. So, too, if you are dealing with potentially dangerous instruments, such as a munitions factory,  a  sulphuric acid plant, or firearms, the care that is expected of you is of the strictest character. Dealing with commercial operations in which the potential danger is, I submit, extremely great, to say that you are substituting a strict liability for a liability for negligence has a very slight shade of meaning when you are considering the degree of care involved in the statutory liability, as distinguished from the degree of care required before the statute was passed. </para>

                <para>Involved in the same argument which I am answering at the moment also must be the cases in which evidence is not forthcoming to enable plaintiffs readily to prove negligence. I agree that that is so. But, due to the exceptional circumstances of aviation, that is only adding evidence to enable a plaintiff to rely upon the doctrine which is relied upon, I understand - I hope that I shall be corrected if I am wrong - tully in America, where the plaintiff, unless the defendant can show an absence of negligence, is entitled to succeed. That is what we call in legal terms, which I hope to be able to mouth here without offence to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty,</inline> res ipsa loquitur.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> reminds me of the legislation in Australia with relation to government railways. I am obliged to him for doing so. I referred to this matter during the second-reading debate yesterday, and I spoke of the quite anomalous limitation of liability due to the circumstances of the colonies which imposed that limitation and to the fact that in those times governments had not passed legislation to enable their subjects to sue them because they claimed the royal prerogative that the king could do no wrong. They allowed compensation to be paid as a matter of grace or favour, so T suppose they thought they had given a considerable evidence of their generous disposition when they allowed compensation of tin to £2.000. But those circumstances, based upon the special position of the Crown. T do not regard as in any way analogous to the matter we are discussing. </para>

                <para>When I invited the Minister to put forward instances of a commercial undertaking being given, by British or British dominion legislation, immunity from damages in consequence of the negligence of it or its servants. I did not have that anomalous situation in mind. When I sneak of " negligence ", <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman.</inline> T remind you that we already have referred to in this statute negligence of the ordinary variety, but we also have a reminder that negligence may take the form of conduct so criminal as to be conduct with the intent to cause damage, or so grossly culpable as to be conduct which, in another context, is described as reckless, with the knowledge that injury will result. When we realize that this bill, if unamended, will exempt air carriers from liability in excess of £7,500 in the case of that gross negligence, and also in the case of that criminal negligence, the enormity of the proposition that they should have a privilege in that respect appears to me to be unanswerable.

                    O'SULLIVAN (Queensland) [10.46]. - There is, no doubt, substantial merit in some of the points raised by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline>
                    but this is a question of plus and minus. Where would we be without this measure? The position would be that the airline authorities could contract themselves out of liability, as the shipping companies do. We have the advantages that the airline authorities cannot contract themselves out, and that damages are payable, not on proof of negligence, but merely on proof of damage, which must save a lot of litigation. People who may be injured at least will have the comfort and consolation of knowing that there will not be any tedious litigation to establish negligence. That is a very substantial advantage. What is taken away is the right to unlimited damages, but that is more notional than real. Clause 31 must be looked at. Upon payment of a fee, an air traveller may obtain extra cover. The clause does not specify the rate, but T think it is 2s. per £1,000, so that for the payment of £1 he may obtain insurance cover for £10,000. The air carrier will give that additional cover on payment of that comparatively nominal extra fee. So really, the passenger will receive much more, as the result of this legislation, than will be taken away from him.
                </para>
                <para>There is another advantage, too. in respect of the rate of insurance and the freight rate which the air carrier may charge. I should imagine that the effect of the liability for damages of up to £7,500, without proof of negligence, on the assessment of charges for air tickets would have been worked out actuarily. The airlines would know that they would have a certain number of passengers per flight, and therefore a certain number of passengers per year, and they would be able to assess fairly accurately what the extra cost would be. But in the event of liability being completely unlimited, there necessarily would be a very substantial increase in fares. I read recently, in respect of an air disaster where the liability was unlimited, that the amount involved was something like £500,000. </para>

                        <para>-  1 do not know, but I should imagine that they would not. The point is that those costs would be incorporated in the transport charges. If the companies know that the maximum liability is £7,500, they can assess accurately the amount by which they need to load their tickets to meet that contingent liability. If the liability were completely unlimited, quite conceivably ruination could befall an airline company. It would be very difficult for a company to get cover for such an astronomical amount. However, to sum up, I say that without the measure the passenger would be infinitely worse off. He is losing his right to claim for proven negligence a higher amount than £7,500, but he gets the advantage of a statutory provision of £7,500 without proof of negligence. I think the Latin phrase res ipsa loquitur - the thing speaks for itself - sums up the position. Negligence is inferred prima facie, with the responsibility falling on the defendant to rebut it. So far as I understand, this has never been done in the case of an aircraft accident. </para>

First, he referred to the amount of money that it would cost if there were provision for unlimited liability. From the point of view of economics, I know that the insurance of aircraft and that sort of thing costs the people running them a considerable amount. But that factor pales into insignificance when compared with the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that inherent in all British law is the right of action for negligence. If we put one against the other - the cost against the waiving of the negligence claim - quite obviously we must come down on the side of maintaining British law. After all, if the cost factor had predominated, there would not be on the statute-book of Australia legislation to provide for workers' compensation and the like. </para>

                <para>The committee of inquiry found that there was negligence on every hand. The pilot, it suggested, should never have been allowed to fly. The report stated that the loading officer did not load the plane correctly. No record of repairs of high precision instruments had been kept. There was no evidence that the mechanics who handled the plane were competent. In its summing up, the committee said that just for one of those reasons alone the airline company should have had its charter taken from it. I suggest that if the witnesses had given sworn evidence in a court, it would have been accepted as being strongly in support of negligence on the part of the company. After summing up the evidence, the committee - and I should like the Minister to comment on this - made exactly the same suggestions that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has put forward to-night, and contradicted the proposition that has been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Neil</inline> O'sullivan. </para>
                <para>Obviously, that committee had a much greater opportunity than this chamber has of examining a particular crash. After taking into consideration the loss that resulted from the crash, the committee recommended that there should be an automatic right of recovery up to a maximum amount and that, in addition, there should be nothing to prevent a person from suing, on the grounds of negligence, for unlimited liability. </para>
                <para>I suggest to the Minister that that is fairly strong evidence because it is the one occasion - the only one that I know of - when a committee has been able to examine a specific crash and apply itself to what should be done in the future. </para>

                        <para>- The witnesses who gave evidence were expert witnesses whose evidence would have been acceptable if they had been summoned to appear before a court. I emphasize that the committee's recommendation was exactly the same as what is being asked for to-night. Some important principles are involved. First, we should preserve the right to sue for negligence. I suggest that merely because a certain provision would cost somebody a large amount of money we should not waive this important principle of British law. </para>

                    <para>. -  I was entirely in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> when I said, during the second-reading debate, that this provision is the critical feature of the bill. There is not any question about that. Nor can there be any question that the alteration of the common law that the bill proposes to make is in the nature of a revolutionary change. That does not dispose of the problem in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> mind, or the complicated provisions of this measure. Merely to say that it is a fundamental change or a revolutionary change does not help us one scrap. We have to go much further than that and ask ourselves what is the nature of the change and whether or not it is a beneficial change. That is the real issue that we must look at. </para>

                <para>I think all honorable senators will agree with the first proposition that I want to make. There can be no doubt at all that in many cases the potential plaintiff who has the responsibility of proving negligence in an aircraft accident is up against it for lack of evidence. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Neil</inline> O'sullivan has mentioned1, one does not necessarily invoke the law of res ipsa loquitur in an accident. One has to prove, as a matter of law, the question of negligence. I think it would have been quite easy for the Government to introduce a very simple piece of legislation which in effect said two things: first, there can be no contracting out in the case of a carrier, and secondly, that the plaintiff could retain his common law right to proceed for an unlimited amount if he could prove negligence. </para>

                        <para>- It would have been very simple, I suggest, for the Government to have done that. That might have pleased <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> and it might have pleased <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> up to a point. But I suggest that the Government has gone a long way further than doing that. It has examined the merits of such a proposed alteration to our law and I think, on balance, that we must accept the fact that the Government's contentions have got a great deal of merit. The first one, as I have said, is the difficulty of a plaintiff in establishing negligence. The difficulty of a plaintiff in establishing any evidence is a profound one when you consider the number of airline cases one could get; and when you consider the high cost of litigation in cases when witnesses have to be brought from half-way round the world, I shudder at the possible cost of litigation in order to establish negligence. As every one knows, the high cost of litigation is a serious matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I apologize for detaining the Senate at this Late hour, but I feel it is necessary in view of what I might term a new development in political controversy in another place, a development to which I shall refer as political scavenging, a phrase that was coined by a former friend of mine. Unfortunately, due to the operation of the present electoral system, my party is not represented in the other place. If representation were based on the percentage vote obtained at the election, we would have eleven or twelve members in that chamber. The practice to which I refer, and to which newspapers give their attention, is the raking-up of cases of certain persons who are alleged to have criminal convictions, referring to their association with political or trade union matters, and then stating that they are members of the Australian Democratic Labour party, hoping that people will assume that members of the D.L.P. generally have criminal tendencies. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I am surprised that that practice has developed in the other place and I pay tribute to Opposition senators for not descending to that level. During the election campaign in 1954, following the split in the Australian Labour party in Victoria, an attack was made upon a member of the A.L.P. who was alleged to have criminal convictions. Great indignation was expressed by the Labour party - no doubt rightly - at the fact that such matters should be brought into politics. </para>
                    <para>I read with regret in the press last year reports of a statement made by the then honorable member for Darebin, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> W. Holt, in which he went to great pains to point out that a trade union official had been convicted of embezzling the funds of his union, that he was an industrial grouper and, no doubt, was associated with the D.L.P. Apart from the political aspect, on ordinary humane grounds I am sorry that such matters should have been raised. The man had been tried and convicted, and had paid his debt to society. The tradition exists in British communities that when a man has paid his debt to society his crime should not be brought up against him except in very exceptional circumstances. The man in question was married and had children, and was trying to earn a living. He should not have been attacked. </para>
                    <para>However, I point out to honorable senators that the honorable member who brought this matter to light did not mention that the succeeding administration in the union concerned was elected on a unity ticket of A.L.P. members and Communists, and that a similar case of embezzlement occurred in which the assistant secretary was accused of not accounting for all the money in his care. While the industrial grouper was tried, convicted and sent to gaol as a result of the legal action taken by the union, the Communist assistant secretary was allowed to resign without any penalty being imposed on him at all. In fact, the union made the pious declaration that it did not know what had happened to the money. If I had wished to rake up such matters, I could have mentioned three cases of union officials, members of the A.L.P., who were in similar trouble at about this same period, but I forbore to do so because I did not think elections should be fought in that way. </para>
                    <para>I have been constrained to bring this matter before the Senate because of a statement made within the last week or two, strangely enough by the new honorable member for Darebin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Courtnay)</inline> during his maiden speech. I have always understood that maiden speeches should not be provocative. If the speech to which I refer had been in that category I should not have mentioned it, but it was not. In the course of his remarks the honorable member said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Yet two gentlemen - I shall call them gentlemen for the moment, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> I shall give you their criminal records later, although I may say now that both were members of the Democratic Labour party . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The honorable member alleged that two persons had criminal records. At a later stage in his speech he gave details of the criminal record of one but did not mention the other. In effect, he traduced two persons but produced evidence against only one. He gave the man's name and listed a series of convictions, presumably obtained from a police file.  His  action was opposed to the policy of his party in Victoria which took strong exception to any reference being made to police files on members of the party. One of the convictions to which the honorable member referred was for being found on licenced premises after hours. Looking round this chamber, I feel constrained to say, " He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone ". </para>
                    <para>I do not know whether the honorable member's statements are true, but apparently he attacked the man concerned because he is a trade unionist. If a man has convictions, can he not still be a trade unionist? If I were so minded, I could quote, from my knowledge of the Labour party extending over a long period, many cases of gentlemen with whom the honorable member for Darebin is associated in trade unionism who also have criminal convictions. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the Liberal party also is not without its black sheep. Why should any person rake up a man's criminal convictions and then go to the great trouble to say that he is a member of the D.L.P.? As I have said, I also could rake up similar cases, but that is not the way a political fight should be waged. I have never objected to the methods adopted by any person in fighting elections. Everyone is entitled to fight in the way that is most congenial to his nature. If I am attacked, I never have any difficulty in defending myself and, should this matter of criminal convictions be raised again, I shall know how to defend myself. We should all adhere to certain standards. 1 am pleased to say that those standards have been observed in this chamber, but not, I regret to say, in another place. The honorable members to whom I have referred should realize that certain standards ought to be observed in political controversy and, if they are observed, Parliament will be a better place. </para>

The honorable member for Yarra was then a prominent person in the peace organization which was banned by the Labour party as a Communist subsidiary during the five years preceding 1950. He was almost unknown in his present party until the split occurred in which the Communists were given an opportunity of open prominence.

F. Cairns is well known to be and of whom T should say he is a supporter. What is the interest in this matter? The case in respect of which he is so bitter - the case of the Hurseys - is a case in which these people are defending their rights against what they concede to be Communist tactics which have become so entrenched as to cause them to resent politi cal levies in the interests of opposing political parties. The honorable member's bitterness comes from the fact that the Hurseys succeeded in the law courts against a union of which four of the five executive officers were Communists. And this man shows his resentment in a malicious form by resorting to typical Communist tactics in smearing me in my professional capacity. I have said sufficient to refute such smear tactics and I rise to express my resentment and contempt for such a despicable performance under the privilege of Parliament. </para>
