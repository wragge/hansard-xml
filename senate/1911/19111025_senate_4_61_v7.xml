          <para>- On Friday last I unintentionally voted in favour of the third reading of the Naval and Military Decorations Bill, which I had opposed through its passage. When the question was put I did not hear any one but myself call for a division, and until I heard the bells cease to ring I was not aware that a division was in progress; after you, sir, had named the tellers it was too late for me to cross the floor. As I have been twitted with having spoken in one way and voted in another, I wish to put it on record that the vote was given quite unintentionally on my part. </para>

          <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was speaking to the second reading of the Electoral Bill the other day I interjected that in South Australia there were at least two party newspapers. I am reported - and I do not blame the reporters for the error; perhaps I did not speak very clearly - as having said that the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> was " a dirty rag." I did not mean to make that statement, and it would not be true if I did. I meant the <inline font-style="italic">Critic,</inline> and I think that it is a dirty rag still. I desire to withdraw the statement in reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> and to let it be properly understood that it was the <inline font-style="italic">Critic</inline> to which I referred. </para>

            <para>. - On Friday last, when discussing this crude, ill-advised, and badly-drawn measure, I dealt with the abolition of postal voting, and endeavoured to show that the odium of refusing a vote to those who will be too far away from their homes on election day to be able to record it at a polling booth, except, perhaps, at the cost " of a day's pay, to women in ill-health, and to aged and infirm persons, must rest on the Labour party. It is their responsibility altogether. The more comprehensive system of absent voting which was referred to by the Minister of .Defence in his speech is confined to two classes, namely, sailors and those who may be at sea. That is proved in the memorandum compiled by the Chief Electoral Officer, who states distinctly that those persons alone will benefit by the provision. I think I have shown that there is no provision in the measure referring to a by-election, and consequently that, if there should happen to be a byelection, a man who is outside his own district will not be able to record his vote unless it is intended to throw open the whole of the polling places in the Commonwealth. I wanted to know how the system of compulsory enrolment is going to be enforced. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council said that the Department may call out the military or use the police for the purpose, but it seems to me that that part of the Bill will be a dead-letter. I do not see very well how it can be enforced. </para>

Persons are coming of age every day. The Constitution gives to every adult person the right to vote, but how long are persons to be allowed after coming of age before they will be required to go and register their names on an electoral roll? </para>

              <para>- I am glad to hear that announcement from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and I presume that the Labour party will, as usual, take credit for all the good things which happen in the Commonwealth. I feel quite sure that they have assurance enough to appropriate any kudos. What time is a woman to have after she changes her name by marriage before she is to be bound to inform an electoral officer of the change, in order that she may appear on the roll under her new name? There is nothing in this Bill dealing with the matter, and under the provisions for compulsory enrolment a woman in such circumstances might incur a penalty through ignorance. Why should we compel people to enroll and then compel them to vote when there is no guarantee that they will secure representation as a result of their vote? </para>

              <para>- No, but it compels him to enroll, and the idea in compulsory enrolment is that electors may exercise the franchise. My complaint is that when a man is enrolled and has voted, he is given no assurance of representation on account of his vote. Why is it that people are indifferent in this matter? Why is it that every political organization worries about getting people on the roll? </para>

              <para>- I am willing to take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson's</inline> word for it that the Liberal party are guilty of all the crimes under the sun, moon, and stars. I hope the honorable senator will be satisfied if I admit as much as that. Let me say that there is no party so wicked as the Liberal party, and no party so virtuous as the Labour party. Now that I have made that admission, I may be permitted to proceed without interruption. I ask why people are indifferent in this matter, and why, notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson's</inline> interjections, all kinds of efforts are made by all political parties to have people enrolled who they think will vote for them? Why is it that people do not voluntarily enroll themselves? It is because it may be quite useless for them to do so. I will give an instance. I take the division of Hindmarsh, and I ask of what use is it for any supporter of the Liberal party to record a vote in that division? He will know that there is not one chance in one thousand that he will ever secure the election of a man for that constituency to represent his views. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I am taking the total number of votes polled. The Liberal party polled 1,997,029 votes, and did not gain a single seat. I have not the slightest idea that such a thing will happen at the next Senate election, but if it did the result would be that the whole of the representation of the Commonwealth in the Senate would be held by one political party. I say that, no matter what party that was, it would be a calamity. </para>

              <para>- I arn glad to say that I am thoroughly opposed to my leader. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> On that point. I hold that there should be majority rule in Parliament, and that there should be minority representation. We have single electorates for the House of Representatives, and the preferential vote might be adopted in that case. It is only a kind of homoeopathic dose of proportional representation. It is all right so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. It simply secures the representation of a relative majority in single electorates. I ask why we should not adopt a system of true proportional representation? That is the only safe, sound, scientific and democratic principle to adopt. It was advocated by the late Thomas Hare as far back as 1853, though some such system had been adopted in Denmark to a certain extent two years before. It was indorsed by so high an authority as John Stuart Mill, who in his <inline font-style="italic">Autobiography</inline> makes reference to the subject in the following terms - </para>

          <para class="block">That is the testimony of a great political economist. Miss Catherine Spence, who was one of the finest women Australia has ever known - a reformer, both social and political, a philosopher, a philanthropist, a novelist, and an out-and-out Democrat - advocated a system of proportional representation for a great many years. Miss Spence passed away not long ago, and I am only sorry that she did not live long  enough to see some such system adopted throughout Australia. All thoughtful persons admit that single electorates and block voting are unsatisfactory. This is what the Prime Minister of Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> said, when approached upon the subject - </para>
          <para>I agree that it is impossible to defend the rough and ready method which has hitherto been adopted as a proper or satisfactory explanation of the representative principle. It is not merely that under our existing system a minority in the country may return a majority of the House of Commons, but what more frequently happens, and what I am disposed to agree is equally injurious in its results, is that you have almost always a great disproportion in the relative size of the majority and minority in the House of Commons as compared with their relative size in the constituencies. </para>

              <para>- That may be so, but the truth of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> said was proved at the British elections of 1906. On that occasion the Ministerialists polled 3,395,811 votes, and secured 513 seats. If they had secured seats in proportion to votes polled they would have had 387. The Unionist party polled  2,494,794  votes, and secured only 157 seats . If they had secured seats iri proportion to votes they would have had 283. The Ministerial majority in votes was 901,017, but their majority in seats was 356, whilst they were only entitled to a majority of 104.

          <para class="block">There can be no greater condemnation of the system of single electorates and block voting than that conveyed in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill's words. Speaking with regard to the representation of minorities, the late Lord Acton said -  - The one pervading evil of democracy is the' tyranny of the majority that succeeds by force or fraud in carrying elections. To break off that point is to avert the danger. The common system of representation perpetuates the danger. Unequal electorates afford no security to majorities. Equal electorates give none to minorities. Thirty-five years ago it was pointed out that the remedy is proportional representation. It is profoundly democratic, for it increases the influence of thousands who would otherwise have no voice in the Government ; and it brings men more near an equality by so contriving that rio vote shall be wasted, and that every voter shall contribute to bring into Parliament' a member of his own opinion. </para>
          <para class="block">If that be true - as I think it is - Lord Acton's testimony in favour of adopting the system which I am now advocating is certainly strong. No Democracy, with adult suffrage, is complete without proportional representation. I know that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is an ardent advocate of this principle. I have heard him discuss it with great earnestness and fervour, supporting it very strongly. Therefore, I fully expect his help and vote for an amendment which I intend to pro-, pose to secure proportional representation' in the election of senators.   </para>

              <para>- I am advocating this principle, not from any party standpoint, because a great question of this kind ought to be considered above party. When you are seeking to get the very best system of representation, you should not, at the same time, seek advantages for one. party over another. You should desire to secure advantages for the people generally.. When an elector knows that  His  vote will  count if it be recorded, he will use it. That is the point on which I insist in regard to compulsory enrolment. If you want people to vote, encourage them in every way, not merely by putting their names on the electoral rolls, but by inducing them to record their votes at election time. When a man knows that his vote will have some effect, he will take a greater interest in an election. He will know, even if he belongs to a minority, that he has an opportunity of securing the representation of that minority in Parliament according to its strength. Under the present system, you may get minority rule. The system which I advocate is simplicity itself. With the system of education which we have in Australia any voter is capable of going to a polling booth and marking his ballot-paper according to his preferences. For the returning officer, the working out of the results is simply a mathematical proposition. I am not asking the Senate to take a leap in the dark. The system has been adopted, and wherever it has been tried it has been proved satisfactory. It was adopted in Belgium with excellent results, and has also been tried in Tasmania. The Tasmanian elections of 1909 gave each party representation according to its strength. The Tasmanian Legislative Assembly is the only legislative body in Australia truly representative of the people. The system adopted there gave each political candidate a run for his money. </para>

            <para>The working of the system from the point of view of the returning officers was an unqualified success. No serious difficulty of any kind was found in conducting the scrutiny. Scrutinies for two of the districts were carried out in country towns where the number of persons available for the choice of a staff was small. But here, as elsewhere, no serious difficulty was found. </para>

          <para class="block">From the point of view of the electors, it is interesting to know the number of informal ballot-papers. The results show that the number of informal votes throughout Tasmania, excluding one electorate, was iess than 3 per cent., whilst in the case of the electorate of Wilmot it was only 3.44 per cent. The average was 2.86 per cent. In the face of these figures, the idea that the elector does not know how to vote is absurd, because 2.86 is a very small percentage. It will be found that, under the Federal system, at the last election for the Commonwealth, the proportion of informal votes was considerably higher than that. I believe that in one case it was as high as 5 per cent. The system, therefore, has been well tried. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Braun,</inline> the burgomaster of Ghent, says - </para>

          <para class="block">The evidence of these gentlemen, coming as it does from a country where the system  has been in operation for a considerable time, ought to carry some weight with the Senate. We cannot adopt the system for the House of Representatives, but we might insert in the Bill a provision for proportional voting which would be a step towards the other system. I intend, in Committee, to submit an amendment which, if carried, will, I believe, render unnecessary provisions for compulsory enrolment and compulsory voting. The voters will then take so much interest in the elections that I think they will voluntarily enroll and vote. More than that, a Parliament elected under the system will, I hold, faithfully represent the people as a Parliament ought to do. I propose to ask the Senate to insert, as new section 150, the following provision : -  (1.) In elections for the Senate the voter shall mark his vote on his ballot-paper by placing the number 1 in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom he votes as his first preference and by placing the numbers 2, 3, 4 (and so on as the case requires) in the squares opposite the names of the remaining candidates so as to indicate the order of his preference for them. (2.) Where an elector votes before a Registrar before polling day or where an elector votes in accordance with the regulations relating to absent voting, the manner in which a voter shall mark his vote on his ballot-paper shall' be prescribed by the regulations, but so that the principles contained in the preceding sub-section relating to the marking of first and other preferences shall fie observed. </para>

              <para>- The provision does not even say long primer capitals. It does not describe the kind of long primer which has to be used, but simply refers to bare long primer. Does not the Honorary Minister think it necessary to insert great primer ? And would it not be better to define the sort of great primer ? Great primer expanded Gothic, for instance, would be broad enough to carry the announcement over two columns of the newspaper, and then there would be no mistake about its publication. It would catch the eye immediately, and persons would say, " Hallo, we have the newspaper now, and here is the advertisement for which we have been looking." I would point out to the Honorary Minister, who knows all about the printing trade, that as the provision stands the newspapers might get long primer hair-line condensed, and the print would be so fine that no one would be able to read the advertisement. If my honorable friends opposite must have this provision enacted, why not provide for the use of characters about which there can be no mistake? I am sure that the Honorary, Minister will recognise the force of my remarks and provide that the announcement must be published in types so large that " he who runs may read," and there can be no mistake. He ought, however, to make an exception. I think that, in order to carry out the principles of the measure, he ought to provide that Labour newspapers shall be excepted from the operation of this provision. I do not think it is fair to make a Labour newspaper advertise these matters. They are altogether too pure to descend to anything that would be wrong, or to do anything which might be unfair to electors generally. I hope that on this provision the Honorary Minister will move an amendment exempting Labour news- papers from its operation. Not for one minute do I wish to see them laid open to a penalty of£500. I have too much respect for them. I recognise their integrity and honesty, and so on; and so I do not desire by any chance that they shall be laid open to a penalty of that amount. I hope that the Minister will take my suggestion into consideration. Proposed new section  172A  reads -  (1.) Every organization, association, league, or body of persons which has, or person who has, in connexion with any election, expended any money or incurred any expense - </para>

              <para>- Surely the Minister should be quite willing to do what I have suggested. According to an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this morning, two delegates have been expelled from a party because they would not pay some political levy. It shows that we need to be careful in this matter. It proves that money is collected and spent for political purposes. The extract reads - </para>

          <para>Recently p. McNeill and T. Johnson, delegates from the South Seaham and West Wallsend miners' lodges respectively, were expelled from a meeting of the delegate board because they would not pay a levy imposed on behalf of the Political Labour League. A meeting convened by the two delegates was held at West Wallsend. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline>Hoare, who presided, stated that their political freedom was endangered by the attempt of the Colliery Employes' Federation to force its members to contribute to the P.L.L. Every effort had been made by the industrial workers of the world, the Socialist Labour party and others to frustrate the attempt of the Colliery Employes' Federation and the Political Labour League to take away from the men the liberty that has been so dearly paid for by the pioneers of the working class organization, but in vain. In his opinion the time had arrived when all those who wished to preserve their political freedom must sink their differences of opinion and appeal to the Equity Court to restore the rights these political coercionists had taken away. He stated that similar meetings would be held in other centres. </para>
          <para class="block">Here is distinct testimony that levies are made and that money is collected to be paid to a Political Labour League simply to help forward matters at elections. If that is so, I feel quite sure that the Minister cannot refuse to make it perfectly plain that when trade unions collect money from their members in this way, and use it for electioneering purposes., they should each make a return showing how much they have spent, and how it was spent. </para>

            <para>- On Thursday afternoon we had a long and a bitter speech from the Leader of the Opposition. In this Chamber we have had many lengthy speeches, but it is long since I heard a speech which occupied so much time, and meant so little, as that which we heard from his lips. It occupied about 180 minutes, and I should say that, during the major portion of that time the honorable senator was engaged mainly in shadowsparring. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator began by attacking two or three minor provisions of the Bill because, in his opinion, they were superfluously worded. He then said that, because there were one or two unimportant printer's errors in the Bill, it was worthy of condemnation, and had been hastily drawn. Then he worked himself almost into a white heat on the assumption that the Bill contained something which he afterwards found it did not contain. </para>

              <para>- Let me remind the honorable senator that in the first Federal Parliament the only State that was represented on adult suffrage was the State of South Australia. I well remember a meeting held in the supper-room of the Melbourne Town Hall after the establishment of Federation when an amendment was proposed, that the franchise for the Commonwealth should be an adult franchise - one adult one vote. And such was the bitter opposition shown to that proposition that a division was called for, and those in favour of it won only by a small majority. </para>

              <para>- I shall say that the honorable member had the cool audacity the other night to say that we wished to deny to sick' women the right to vote, although when he had the opportunity to do so he refused in the Victorian Parliament to confer the right to vote on women. Now the honorable senator has the boiler-plated impudence to get up in his place in this chamber and say that the Labour party do not desire a full or complete roll because it would mean disaster to them. Let us examine that statement. For the election of the first Federal Parliament we had not a full or complete roll, and Labour secured eight members in the Senate and sixteen members in the House of Representatives, or a total of twenty-four. At the next Federal elections, with fuller and more complete rolls, Labour secured fifteen seats in the Senate and twenty-four in the House of Representatives, or a total of thirty-nine. From the next election, with a still larger and more complete roll, due to an increased population and better facilities to enable people to get their names on the roll, the Labour party came back with fifteen in the Senate and twenty-six in the House of Representatives, or a total of forty-one. And at the last Federal election, with the biggest roll in the history of the Commonwealth, and the highest percentage of electors voting, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> s reasoning, the result should have been disaster to the Labour party. But what happened ? We came back twenty-three strong in the Senate and forty-two strong in another place, or a total of sixty-five. And we are here to-day. </para>

              <para>- We are here, and if there was anything in the reasoning of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> we should be in a hopeless minority, because of the completeness of the roll, and the big percentage of votes recorded at the last Federal elections. Every member of the Senate, I hope, is desirous of bringing about the most complete and satisfactory roll for the Commonwealth. I believe every one will admit that to-day there are innumerable names on the rolls which ought not to be there, and that no matter what pains or care are taken by the Electoral Department and its officers it is absolutely impossible to bring about an entirely satisfactory roll. In the departmental memorandum it is shown that although the Electoral Department may know that an elector whose name is on the roll for a particular division has removed to another division, as soon as the name is removed from the roll of the division which he has left it is automatically removed also so far as an election for the Senate is concerned. That is an injustice to the elector. It may happen that the names of persons who have long since left the division will remain on the roll for it, and although such persons, are entitled to vote somewhere their votes may considerably influence an election in a district where they do not reside. I say that the persons who live in a division, and only those persons, should vote at an election for that division. The way to bring about a better roll is to adopt compulsory enrolment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that we shall need to Kaye one-half of the population chasing the other half to bring compulsory enrolment about. We have considerably over 2,000,000 electors on the Commonwealth electoral rolls. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> imagine for a moment that we shall require one-half that number to bring about compulsory enrolment? Let us examine the queries presented to us By the Opposition in regard to the difficulties of compulsory enrolment. In the first place, let me say that policemen , are going from door to door to-day armed with copies of rolls, with cards which have to be filled in, and with copies pf regulations, which are supplied to every householder. Thousands of copies of these regulations have been printed and circulated. I believe that everybody in the Commonwealth is to-day aware of the fact that compulsory enrolment is to be, or, as a matter of fact, has been initiated, and that if they do not comply with the terms of the regulations they will be liable to be punished. </para>

              <para>- We propose to leave cards at every place which people usually frequent. But, before we do so, we do what has not been done in connexion with income-tax or land-tax returns. We circulate a regulation notifying every one in Australia over the of twenty-one years that, after a certain date, they must enrol themselves as electors, and that, if they remove from one electoral division to another, they must notify the Electoral Department of the change, or otherwise they will be liable to a penalty. When I was referring to our proposal to abolish postal voting I mentioned that 29,249 postal votes were recorded at the last Federal election. It is interesting to note how these votes were recorded. New South Wales being a larger State, having a larger population, and the people being more scattered than in Victoria; a larger number of votes by post might have been expected to be recorded there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> himself urged that extra facilities should be afforded  to people to vote in States with scattered populations. Now what are the facts. In New South Wales at the last election the number of votes recorded by post was 6,219. </para>

Victoria is a smaller State than New South Wales, and its population is much more compact. Consequently, the difficulties in regard to voting in this State are not nearly so great as they are in New South Wales. Yet the number who recorded their votes by post in Victoria was 14,049 - more than twice the number who voted by post in New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I have already given those details for the State of Victoria. In New South Wales 2,894 males, and 3,325 females voted by post; in Queensland there were 1,638 males and 2,382 females; in South Australia 960 males and 791 females; in Western Australia, 1,127 males and 850 females; and in Tasmania 530 males and 703 females. It will be seen that in Western Australia the number of males who voted by post exceeded the females. It must not be supposed that .because we intend to abolish postal voting under this Bill, those who voted by post at the last election will be entirely disfranchised. I do not think that anything like that number will fail to record their votes at the ballot-box. The probabilities are that a considerable number of those who recorded their votes by post at the last election will take other means to vote when they find that the old system is no longer operative. </para>

              <para>- No matter what system is adopted somebody will suffer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> remarked that the Minister of Defence, in introducing this Bill, had said that we intended to introduce a substitute for voting by post in the form of absent voting, and he complained that we intended to provide for that method of voting by regulation. He was very indignant that such a provision should be left to regulation. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is not unmindful of the fact that absent voting at the present time is left to regulation. </para>

          <para class="block">In other words, if we want a healthy roll, we should, according to the honorable senator, say to all electors, men and women, that the obligation to secure enrolment is theirs, and that Parliament will not bother about them. Therefore, the fewer facilities we give people to secure enrolment the better. I am, however, of opinion that by placing facilities in the way of electors to become enrolled, we shall secure a healthy roll, and that by simply leaving the matter in the hands of electors, we shall obtain nothing better than an unhealthy system, and one deserving to be condemned. I venture to say that if we were to abolish the card system, and were to dispense with the services of the policemen, contenting ourselves with saying to the electors, " On a certain day you have to enroll, and if you do not you will not be able to vote," we should have smaller polls than we have today. </para>

              <para>- I am satisfied that the system of compulsory enrolment now proposed will give us a better roll. a much less costly roll, and a roll that will afford more satisfaction to every candidate who stands for election, either for the Senate or the House of Representatives. The honorable senator argued that compulsory enrolment ought to be followed by a system of compulsory voting. But it would be impossible to make compulsory voting effective. I defy any honorable senator to devise an effective scheme. </para>

              <para>- It is possible to compel people to enroll, and by so doing you can insure a fuller roll. By means of a completer roll you will get a larger percentage of votes recorded at elections. But at the same time it would be impossible to compel men and women to record effective votes. We all believe in voting by ballot. The secrecy of the ballot must be maintained. You cannot tell whether a vote recorded by any particular person is effective or non-effective unless you nullify the ballot system.  1  feel sure that there is no desire on the part of any honorable senator to do that. </para>

              <para>- I believe strongly in compulsory enrolment, but nothing up to the present has convinced me of the possibility of compulsory voting; because, while you might be able to compel any number of men and women to go to the polling booth, you could not, because of the secrecy of the ballot, compel them to record effective votes. Why should you introduce a system that would exempt from punishment those who would go into a polling booth and wilfully render their votes informal, whilst punishing those who stayed away from the poll altogether? </para>

              <para>- I am satisfied that the proposed system of compulsory enrolment will lead to a higher percentage of votes being recorded at each general or by-election. It must have been the experience of thousands of persons who have interested themselves in elections that those who have made the greatest noise about the defects of the electoral system were those who had not taken the trouble to enroll themselves In many cases this was due to sheer carelessness. But if people .know that they will render themselves liable to be punished if they do not enroll, and do not notify the Department of a transfer, thousands of names will be added to the rolls which are not upon them to-day. In attacking this Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said inferentially that it is a class Bill. </para>

              <para>- Anyhow, my honorable friend will admit that he dealt with that aspect. But I would point out that the elimination of the <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> will have the opposite effect to that which he anticipated. During the last few years a number of cases have been contested in the Court of Disputed Returns, and in half-a-dozen cases which I can cite Parliament has been appealed to for monetary assistance to the respondents. The most recent case - Crouch <inline font-style="italic">v.</inline> Ozanne - the Judge said was frivolous. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ozanne</inline> was put to a considerable expenditure of effort and money, and all the costs which he could get from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch</inline> were <inline font-style="italic">£100,</inline> although his costs amounted to considerably more than that sum. I think that, in the Riverina case, the costs of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter</inline> amounted to considerably more than £100. In about half-a-dozen cases Parliament has been appealed to for monetary aid to those candidates against whose return petitions had been unsuccessfully lodged. The elimination of this maximum of .£100 will cause a candidate to hesitate before he goes in for a speculative chance, and some of these appeals have been merely speculations. An unsuccessful candidate will hesitate before he appeals to the Court against the return of the man who has been declared elected when he knows that if the costs should be high, and he should be found to blame, he will have to bear his share of responsibility. In respect to the appearance of the Electoral Branch, I believe that, in the Crouch <inline font-style="italic">v.</inline> Ozanne case, charges were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch</inline> in respect to the administration of some of the departmental officers on election day. But those officers and the Department itself had a complete answer to the charges, but they were not allowed to appear. To give the Department an opportunity to appear when its officers are involved and its administration is attacked, and to empower the Judge to award costs against those who, in his opinion, are at fault, is, I think, a step in the. right direction. </para>

              <para>- If the concession is to apply to a candidate who scores 250,000 votes, why leave out a man who represents a party, which, though small in number to-day, is growing in strength every year? The same thing might well be said of the Labour party. A few short years ago the votes it polled were small in number as compared with those which it polls to-day. If this proposal is to apply at all, it cannot have a one-sided application. It should have a general application. Therefore, it should not be entertained for one moment that any candidate standing on behalf of a party should have the right to demand a recount. </para>

              <para>- I am satisfied that the provision in the Bill will grant enlarged facilities to candidates to get what they have not been able to obtain under the principal Act. . I do not see that any member of the Senate need have the slightest fear on that score. I now desire to say a few words in .respect to the provision relating to advertisements in newspapers' The other day, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was, as I have said, shadow-sparring for an hour, or thereabouts - and I meant that in all seriousness - he singled out for special criticism a newspaper which has won a name for its fairness and the mental pabulum it provides from week to week. It is owned and controlled by working men, and cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be called a hireling press. It is co-operatively and collectively owned. I venture to say that, with the exception of those lines which men in their spare moments contribute, every line it prints is paid for, and paid for as well as every other newspaper pays for its contributions. That it is a party newspaper is undeniable. It would not be worth calling a newspaper if it were not. It came into existence over twenty years ago. It was started in Queensland, and by a few men who blazed the track and knew what persecution and martyrdom meant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> may laugh, but this is a sad and serious story. These men blazed the track, pioneered the bush, and were black-listed from one end of Australia to the other. One of the first editors of the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> - which, in my opinion, has been rightly called the workers' bible in that State - was a man who made great sacrifices. His opinions could not be bought and sold like some opinions can be bought and sold in the journalistic world nowadays. </para>

              <para>- On Thursday last, sir, an attack was made on this newspaper, and  1  am endeavouring, in my humble way, to reply to that attack. I am trying to point out, if you will permit me to proceed, that to all newspapers, whether they are party organs or what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> called hireling press organs, the Bill applies ; it makes no invidious distinction in regard to one newspaper or another. </para>

              <para>- The Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> was edited at the commencement by William Lane, who, I understand, gave up a position worth£600 a year, to take a position at a salary of <inline font-style="italic">£200</inline> a year, in order to advocate the Labour cause. Other men contributed money and brains to the newspaper. Later, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> was established; and almost simultaneously with the birth of those two weekly Labour journals, there came into existence a Labour party. The two newspapers I referred to are essentially party organs advocating the Labour party's platform. There are in Australia to-day other party newspapers. There is a newspaper in Adelaide which had a humble beginning, and which is known as the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> It has grown, until to-day it is a daily paper having, I understand, a larger circulation than any other daily paper in South Australia. There is to-day in Tasmania a Labour daily called <inline font-style="italic">The</inline><inline font-style="italic">Post.</inline> There is in Broken Hill to-day another Labour daily. These newspapers have been brought into existence by great sacrifices on the part of men who, in some cases, have put their all into the ventures, and by many who have gone into the business of canvassing day and night. There will, I sincerely hope, be in existence before another twelve months have passed a daily morning newspaper published in Sydney and controlled by the working classes. </para>

With regard to the compulsory levy of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> speaks, I may inform him that, at one time, those who believed in the establishment of the proposed newspaper were in a minority, but by persistent effort they have become a majority. Those who were in the minority a short while ago are now as enthusiastic about the establishment of this daily morning newspaper as they were previously in their opposition to the proposal. This newspaper will spring into existence, and, from time to time, other morning newspapers published in the interests of the Labour party will also be established. The clause of this Bill, against which such strong criticism was levelled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> will apply to them equally as to every other party organ in Australia. </para>

We want our political opponents to publish their reports in the same way. It is because we cannot get them to publish what it costs them to conduct elections and referenda that we desire this provision of the Bill to have a general application.

              <para>- We have no objection to the expenditure of money, but we have a strong objection to the violation of the Act of Parliament which limits the amount of money which may be expended in connexion with elections or referenda. That a seemingly unlimited fund was available for some people at the last referenda was evidenced, not by inch advertisements, but by double and treble column advertisements, by special illuminations at the street corners, and by thousands of extra large posters on hoardings throughout Australia. We do not object to that, but we want to know who pays for it, and whether there has been any violation of our electoral law in connexion with it. </para>

Some of the statements made do. no credit to men and women who call themselves fair-minded. There ought not to be any member of the Senate, or any person outside, no matter to what party he belongs, who is not in favour of the abolition of paid canvassers. Canvassing is a. violation of the vote by ballot. If we believe in the secrecy of the ballot, why should we permit men or women to go from, house to house asking electors for whom they intend to vote ? , </para>

Let me say, in closing, that I believe that this Bill will make for the purity of elections. I believe that it will insure a bigger and a more complete and a much more satisfactory roll than we have had since the commencement of the Commonwealth. I believe. that some who have taken strong exception to its provisions will find, after it has been in operation for a time, that they have been mistaken, and that some views that they have expressed in regard to the injury it is calculated to do them or their party will be found to be groundless. I commend the measure to the Senate feeling satisfied that when it reaches Committee it will be found to require very little amendment. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">-Colonel CAMERON</inline>(Tasmania) [5.19]. - The first question that occurs to me in connexion with this matter is, What necessity is there for the Bill at all, or for any of the alterations of the existing law which it proposes ? It seems to have been intro- . duced for two main purposes. The one is  to  introduce a system of compulsory enrolment and the other, which seems to me to be quite unnecessary, is to abolish the postal voting system, without any attempt being made to meet the injustice that will arise in consequence. I do not wish to impute motives, and I dislike the imputation of motives by honorable senators on either side. But I should like to say that if fault can. be found with the operation of the postal voting system, surely the administrators of the existing Act are strong enough to see that those who violate its provisions incur the penalties provided for such violation. It seems to me that it is merely a question of the proper administration of the law, and that it is quite unnecessary to pass an amendment which will inflict injustice upon certain people. No one can deny that the abolition of the postal voting system will inflict injustice upon two classes of people who have hitherto been' given, and who ought to receive, some consideration. I do not ask for sympathy, but for consideration and justice, for these electors. There ought to be no adoption of the methods of the Chinaman, who burns a house down in  order  to destroy an unfortunate rat. That is what is proposed by this drastic Bill - to repeal an honest endeavour in the existing Act to give all classes of voters at all events an opportunity to register their wishes at an election. It is not a question of whether the Labour party did not receive as many postal votes as their opponents. If that be true, the position may be reversed at the next election. I think the reasonable attitude to observe is to consider whether we shall be right in doing a serious injustice to a certain class of people, when all that is necessary to remedy any evil arising from the existing law is that it shall be administered in such a way as to make an example of any one who has been shown to have violated its provisions. I understand from what has been said that cases of the abuse of the postal voting system are known, and I ask, if that be so, why the Government do not make an example of the persons concerned? If I were in a position to administer a law of the kind, I should certainly, before proposing so drastic an alteration of it, endeavour to put it into, operation and deal out justice to those who have violated it. </para>

              <para>- Then let the law be put into operation, and thus prevent similar evildoing in the future. It would be the proper course to follow. Even if only a few persons, to put the matter in the most favorable light for this Bill, take advantage of the postal voting provisions of the existing Act, why should we deprive them of their natural right to be placed in a position to record their votes. That is a very serious point. I trust that the regulations will be so framed that justice will be done to all classes of persons. </para>

              <para>- I hope it is not. Therefore I trust that the honorable senator will support the view that I am expressing. With regard to canvassers, I do not pay very much attention to what is proposed, though very much is made of it on both sides. I am satisfied that canvassing will go on in some shape or form as long as politics endures. All that I wish to insist upon is that canvassing, if it takes place at all, shall be conducted in a clean, straightforward, honest way by both parties. 1 f one party canvasses in a particular manner, I see no reason why the other should be penalized. I warn honorable senators on the Ministerial benches, who now occupy, their places so pleasantly, so confidently, and so modestly, that they will not be there always, and that before many years have passed, they may have to give place to advocates of quite a different system of politics. </para>
