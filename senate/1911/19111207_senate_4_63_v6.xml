If the statement be true, has the. Minister given consideration to the representations which were made to him by the Premier and representatives of Tasmania in respect of the selection of a temporary site for. the College, in that State ? </para>

                        <para>- My attention has been directed to the paragraph in question, which is not quite accurate in stating that a decision his actually been arrived at. The position is that, as the various eligible sites suggested have been put before me, I. have referred them to Captain Chambers for report.  His  reports are still under the consideration of the Government. Captain Chambers will leave to-night to report on a suggested temporary site at Jer vis Bay, and in response to the. representations which have been&#34; made by the Premier of Tasmania, . by the honorable senator, and by other representatives of that State, he will proceed to Tasmania next week to report on suggested sites at Hobart and Launceston. No decision will be arrived1 at until all these sites have been inspected. </para>

After that, there may be re-engagements for from five to seven years. Regulations are now being framed on these lines in connexion with the Naval College and training. </para>

                        <para>- No. Those periods, speaking from memory, are five, seven, and twelve years. Under our previous regulations enlistment was for three years. But then, of course, we had only a very small service. Now that we are going in for a more up-to-date service, we want to follow more on the lines of the Imperial Navy, and the shortest period of service which we have found compatible with efficiency is five years. The boys will be taken into the training ship to be trained for the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the ships. The age at which they will be taken in has not yet been definitely laid down. Regulations on the subject are being drawn up, and probably the age will be from fourteen to sixteen years. The boys will remain on the ship for about eighteen months or two years. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Obviously, * we do not wish to go to the trouble and expense of training boys only to find that at the end of eighteen months or two years they want to leave us and enter other employment. We wish a boy when he comes to us to definitely make up his mind - and his parents, too - that for at least seven years he will remain in the Navy. Therefore, we want a provision that, with the consent of his parent or guardian, a boy shall enter into a legal contract to remain for that period. Then in regard to the cadets - those who are to be the future officers - we wish to inaugurate a system by which all our officers shall go through the Naval College; so that a boy will make up his mind that he is going to take to the Navy as a profession. We propose that the Naval College shall be established on the same lines as the Military College - that is to say, the absence of wealth will not be a bar, because we shall pay the expenses of each boy. There will be no cost to the parents. There will simply be an examination, and merit and ability will be taken into consideration in regard to admission to the College. We have laid it down that when a boy comes in as a cadet he must enter into a contract, with the consent of his parents; to serve for twelve years, because in his case, as in that of the Military College, we shall give a very valuable education. Every boy will be taught science in its higher branches, and the engineering branches will be made a strong factor, so that a boy who has gone through the course, and obtained an education there at the expense of the Commonwealth, will be fit for almost any kind of civil engineering in other walks of life. We think it is only right that a boy who is to receive that training should enter into a contract to let the Commonwealth have the benefit of his services. </para>

                            <para>- The rank and file will have to work up step by step, but the boys who go through the Naval College will be, first, midshipmen, and then sub-lieutenants. The difference in the .training is necessitated by the fact that a boy who goes into a modern warship as a sub-lieutenant has to be, in fact, an engineer. He has to deal with complicated machinery, and, therefore, he must have a scientific training. Each boy will have to go through a course at the College - probably a six-years&#39; course - before he is put into a ship. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but Captain Chambers says that in Australia it will be wise to make the age a little higher than in England. He has not definitely made up his mind on the subject. The regulations are still under consideration. It is imperative to catch the boys young. However, that is not affected by this provision. If we are to keep them for twelve years we want to be in a position to make a binding contract with them, and this Bill gives us authority to do so. The other part of the Bill refers to a very important matter. Clause 3 deals with the question of command which will arise when our ships form part of the squadron composed of Imperial and Dominion ships. As honorable senators know, in future the Fleets of the Empire will consist, unless, of course, an alteration takes place, of the United Kingdom Fleet, the Canadian Fleet, and the Australian Fleet. Each will be, to all intents and purposes, a separate Fleet under separate administration and control. But at the recent Conference in England an agreement was arrived at that, as these Fleets will each be represented on the Pacific Station and the China Station, and may, in time of war, have to operate together in the Pacific or in other waters, it is advisable in times of peace that opportunities should be given to them to come , together for joint manoeuvres and training. With that object in view it was agreed that action should be taken by the three Governments concerned to make mutual arrangements by which, in the event of the ships of the Fleets coming together by the orders of their </para>

If that happens to be an Australian or a United Kingdom or a Canadian officer, he will be in command of the combined Fleet. Clause 3 gives power to settle that question of command so far as our Fleet is concerned.

                    <para>In our Naval Defence Act of last year we applied the Naval Discipline Act to our Forces. Previously, of course, we had rigorously scanned that Act, provision by provision, to see its effect, and satisfied ourselves that it contained nothing which could not be safely applied to our Forces. The clauses which I have read mean that the Admiralty have entered into an agreement with us that before they amend the Naval Discipline Act in any particular, or the regulations made thereunder, they will submit for our consideration the proposed amendments of the Act, or the proposed regulations. Therefore, we shall be consulted in the first instance, and know what we are asked to accept. The object, of  course,istohavea a uniform system with uniform regulations throughout the whole of the three Fleets, which may at any time have to operate together in time of peace or war. On one occasion our two torpedo destroyers were placed for a week under the- orders of Admiral King Hall, commanding the station here, and carried through certain training operations. He expressed great pleasure at the work which the boats did, and the commander of them also expressed to me his feeling that great benefit was derived by them from the joint training. The torpedo destroyers are intended to operate with larger vessels. When they , there able to carry out the training which, on the one hand, the squadron would not have been able to carry out without their assistance and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> we had a practical illustration of the benefit of combined training. In  191 2-13  the Australian Unit will be on the Australian Station, and the British Squadron will be withdrawn. But it is anticipated that from time to time British ships from the China or some of the other stations, will periodically visit Australia. When these ships do come to Australia, where our Fleet will be the superior Fleet, under this arrangement they will be under the control of our officers, if they are. placed with our Fleet for training. </para>

                            <para>- No; if a British ship was merely visiting Australia, and was not placed by the British Government at our disposal, or under our orders, she would simply have to pay the usual courtesies which a British ship now has to pay to the Admiral on the station. If a British ship not belonging to the Fleet on the Australian Station enters Sydney Harbor, the Admiral in charge of the squadron will no doubt make a courtesy call upon the Commander of the ship, but will not take any further cognisance of its presence. Exactly the same course would be followed if a . ship belonging to the British Fleet came to Australia when our Fleet was here. But if the British Government sent a ship here, and at the same time placed it under our orders, it would be while here under our control. If a British Fleet came herewith an officer in charge senior in rank to the officer in charge of our Fleet, he would have no power to take command of our ships until the Commonwealth Government placed them under his control. So that local autonomy is provided for in every contingency. We are proposing a similar provision with regard to the establishment of courts martial which may be necessary under the circumstances to which I have been referring. We might, for instance, send one of our ships to New Zealand to co-operate there with vessels of the China Squadron, and place it under the orders of the British Naval Commander. At present, as the law stands, if one of our senior officers on board that vessel -committed a crime for which he would render himself liable to court martial, no court martial could be constituted to try him, because there would not be sufficient officers on the ship to constitute a Court. Under this. Bill it is proposed that in such circumstances officers of the; British ships may be called -upon to constitute the court martial. Similarly, if a British officer on a ship in our waters committed an offence there would not be sufficient officers of the necessary rank on the vessel to constitute a court martial by which he could be tried, and under the provision now being made our officers of sufficient rank could sit on the court martial. It has to be remembered that a court martial to in,vestigate an offence by an officer must be constituted of officers senior in rank to the officer charged with the offence. </para>

                    <para class="block">When we were dealing with this question the Admiralty submitted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and myself, as the Australian delegates in connexion with this matter, a Bill which it was proposed to introduce in the House of Commons, in which, in order to give effect to this proposal, there is conferred upon the Governor-General in Council in Australia the powers of the King and the Admiralty. That .Bill has been introduced in the House of Commons, as we have seen from the cable I have quoted. If this Bill be carried, and if the Imperial measure is also carried, we shall be placed in exactly the same relation to the British Admiralty as they will be to us. I desire here to pay a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who, I am sorry, is not present in the Chamber at this moment. When ,the Imperial Bill, to which I have referred, was submitted to us in London, we found that it was of a rather technical character. I knew that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had always been a strong advocate of an Australian Navy. Away&#34; back in 1903, when the Labour party practically stood alone on this question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was one of the men who stood by us in our desire for the creation of an Australian Navy. He fortunately happened to be in London when we were attending the Imperial Conference, and, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> consent, ;&#93; consulted him as to the legal form of the&#39; Bill submitted t.o us.&#39; He was able to suggest .one&#39; or two amendments . which &#39;.he considered would more fully safeguard our position. We were very thankful to him for placing his legal services at our disposal, and enabling us to have the benefit of his advice. I take this opportunity of publicly thanking the honorable senator for &#39;the advice he gave at the time. We felt that we could accept it&#39; with confidence, knowing that he had always been a strong advocate of the creation of an Australian Navy. I have now dealt with: the whole of the matters contained in this Bill, and I trust the Senate will pass it without delay. It seems to me that the issues are clear-cut, and there is no doubt that the provisions of the Bill will give effect to the principles of the Naval Agreement. On our return from England, the agreement was at once submitted to the Law officers of the Commonwealth, and they were asked to  prepare  a Bill which would bring our Naval- Defence Act into conformity with the terms of that agreement. This Bill is the result of their consideration ; and I now ask the Senate to give the  Government  the necessary legislative power fo act under our law in conformity with the agreement entered into by the Australian representatives at the Imperial Conference in the belief that they were expressing the will of the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - Although the subject of naval defence is opened up by this Bill, and is necessarily a very tempting one, I do not propose to yield to the temptation further than to make a very few observations upon two of the proposals in this Bill.  With regard to one of them, the more important to which the Minister has referred, I welcome it as evidence of the fact that once again the various sections of the British people are showing their capacity for solving a problem which apparently no other section of the human race has so far been able to solve successfully. I refer to the problem which arises from the desire for local control working side by- side with Imperial unity. This has been one of the difficulties always confronting us when we have considered the creation of a local navy. I do not mean to say that the arrangement now proposed represents the last word which can be said on the subject ; but it does seem to me that, so far as we  have gone; the difficulty is being met very satisfactorily by the  arrangement arrived at at the Imperial &#39; Conference, the- working&#39; details s of which &#34;this Bil&#39;l.is; intended  to give effect to. I say this, because the proposal still leaves the Australian people the control of their local affairs, and at the same time provides a working hypothesis by which our section of the Navy may be worked satisfactorily with the main branch of the Naval Force. For this reason, I welcome this Bill. I ask the Minister when he replies to the debate to deal with another point. We all recognise the necessity of placing the standards of our service on an equality with those of the Imperial Navy, as otherwise an interchange of officers and men would be impossible. It is admitted that our standards must be as high, and our tests as severe, as are those of the British Adniirally. I understand the Minister to say that the term of apprenticeship proposed for our Fleet is shorter than that of the Imperial service. I wish to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that there is no danger that that may be regarded by the Admiralty as submitting our officers to a less severe training and examination than those which Imperial officers will have to undergo. It will be admitted, I think, that if there is any danger of the kind steps should be taken as early as possible to remedy the defect. On more than one occasion, the Minister of Defence has himself stressed the point that we must have our officers trained as well as are those of the Imperial service. The. question I put to him specifically is whether this can be secured under the proposals made, so as to prevent the possibility of any question being raised at Home that our officers will be called upon to serve a shorter period of training, and will it may be, possess less practical experience. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.10&#93;.-I should like to add a word or two to what has been said. This is a matter in which a great many of us have taken a very considerable interest, and in connexion with which we have had to endure a certain amount of misconstruction on the part of many of the. public. It has been suggested that in establishing a fleet unit of our own in addition to units established by other of the over-sea Dominions and the Imperial Fleet, we are doing so at the expense of discipline and effectiveness. There has been another objection raised on. the ground that it would be better to &#39;have one Imperial &#39; Naval Force for the protection of the whole of the British Empire. I join with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mil</inline>
                        len in congratulating, not only the Minister of Defence, but all who have had to deal with this great subject, upon the ingenuity of the means proposed by which the different Fleet units may be worked together under one Imperial control. There can be no question that, if the Navy is to be effective in time of trouble, the Fleets must be worked together as a unified force, and there must be no such thing as divided control. In order that the people of the country may realize the value of a Navy, it is necessary that they should have the power of control such as is proposed to be exercised by the Government under ordinary circumstances. It should also be recognised that the establishment of a Navy in our own waters is calculated to inspire our people with a feeling of patriotism which could not be engendered in other circumstances, or by the adoption of another course such as a contribution to the upkeep of the Imperial Navy, without any measure of local control or management. I know that when the first Naval Agreement was entered into many years ago, one of the stipulations made by the State. Governments was that the Australian Squadron should not be taken out of Australian waters without the direct consent of the State Governments. We know, however, that efficiency must depend in naval matters on the power of concentration in the event of war. I think that the people of Australia should realize to the fullest that the establishment of our Navy is not only a marked evidence of the National spirit of the country, but also of the feeling of unity with&#39; the Imperial Service. However much some persons may have been in favour of a contribution to the Imperial Navy, that could never have been as effective and valuable as a means of Imperial defence as the system which has now been adopted.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                        is to be congratulated upon holding the position of Minister of Defence during such an important period in the naval history of this country. It is an opportunity given to very few men to be enabled to assist in consolidating and creating what is really an Imperial Defence, based upon such a system that other over-sea Dominions that have not yet determined to establish a naval unit may be in a position to see how, by the adoption of the same course, they may more effectively assist Great Britain than they have hitherto done. We know that our cousins in New Zealand have agreed to pay for a great ship to form part of the Imperial Navy. The value of that gift is not so great as the impetus that will be given to the cause of Imperial defence by the course now adopted. For some years past, relying upon the alliance with the Japanese nation, the Imperial Navy has been materially reduced in strength in these waters. I am not speaking merely of Australian, waters, but of the Pacific generally. We have been led to believe that it was necessary, through existing political circumstances, and the possibility - which I hope will never be realized - of serious European complications, to concentrate the Navy in Home waters. Therefore, we have, to a great extent, been compelled to rely upon that alliance for the protection of this  country. Under certain circumstances that might be unsatisfactory. But we shall, under the new system, have ships of a first-class character in our waters. We shall have not merely a unit, but a complete squadron - that is to say, a Naval Force of such a character that it will be most effective in. the event of a necessity for its employment in war. We all understand that one  of the great principles of defence is not only that a country should be ready to protect its rights and interests, but that it should at the same time be able to make such a show of its power as will prevent the possibility of complications arising. Without going&#39; into these questions at length, I may point out that we have been made to realize lately the great power which Great Britain exercises in international affairs. That power is due to her strong navy, and her means of defence and offence. We, as a portion of the Empire, realize that we are now doing our share of that great work, which should devolve upon all members of the Empire. The question raised by  Sena&#39;tor Millen  as to the efficiency of the training to be given to cadets must come under the serious consideration of the Defence Department and of the Minister. I assume that the expert advice that will always be available, and can be obtained at any time by the Minister, will enable him to make certain that the amount of training it is intended to give to the cadets will be sufficient to  qualify them to take their position alongside those who have been trained in the Imperial Navy, so that there will be no fear on the grounds of efficiency at times when command is placed in the hands of Australian officers. .

                                GOULD. - 1 dare say the honorable senator thinks so. I feel that this is a most important question, and one that must be dealt with on absolutely the best lines, iri order to create an effective body of seamen and officers. One matter that may call for explanation from the Minister relates to the result of courts martial. There is a proviso in this Bill to the effect that a sentence of death passed by any court martial on any member of the Naval Force shall not be carried into effect until it has been confirmed by the Governor-General. One can realize that that is a proper provision under ordinary circumstances. But in the event- of war breaking out, and it being necessary to pass sentence of death by a court martial, it would be quite impossible for every case of the kind to be reviewed by the Governor-General - that is to say, by the Executive - before it was carried into effect. I presume that this provision is meant to apply  rather to times of peace than to times of war. We know that justice has to be administered, probably rather roughly at times, during warfare. It is often necessary to take strong measures. In the event of it being found necessary to condemn a man to death in time of war, such a sentence should not have to be referred to the Government of the day. I do not desire, however, to say more about that now, except to commend to the best consideration of the Minister the point that there may be a necessity for introducing other legislation at a future time. I congratulate the Minister upon the introduction of the Bill. I congratulate him upon the success so far achieved since our entry into what was, a little time ago, regarded as almost unknown waters. I hope the result may be not only to strengthen the forces of Australia, but to strengthen the efficiency and power of the Imperial Navy - the Navy of that great nation of which we all are, as we ought to be, proud to be members.

I hope that under no circumstances will men be turned out in  connexion, with our Navy unless, they are  properly trained and fit to take their place alongside the men of any navy in the world. If the Minister is prepared to tell us that he and his advisers are satisfied with the period that it is intended that these men shall be under training before they become officers and take command, I cannot dispute his statement. But those in control of the British Navy have had many years of experience, and it is significant that they have not seen their way to shorten the time of training. It is an acknowledged fact that the seamen, petty officers, and officers of the British Navy are, as a rule, superior to men of equivalent rank in any navy of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard naval officers in other services than the British say so. I have heard the same from officers in the mercantile marine. I am anxious that our officers and men shall be as efficient as are British man-of-war&#39;s-men to-day. I saw the statement some time ago that it takes at least seven years to turn out a properly equipped man-of-war&#39;s-man. That being the case, I ask the Minister to satisfy my doubts. I hope that he will be in a position to assure us that the term allowed will be sufficient to turn out thoroughly equipped officers and men. </para>

                        <para>-24]. - I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on his good fortune in occupying the position of Minister of Defence when this great project of an Australian Navy is reaching completion. I understand, although, of course, nothing definite has yet been fixed, that the training of officers for the Navy is to occupy a period of something like six years, including the time spent in the training cruiser fleet. That, as some honorable senators may be aware, is longer than the present period in England. There the period of training for a cadet is two years at Osborne, two years at Dartmouth, and six months in a training cruiser, which is supposed to complete the actual training. But, of course, a naval officer&#39;s training, for -the very reason that has been indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and by the . Minister, goes on perpetually. As he is concerned with a very complicated machine - as modern warships are - his training hardly ever comes to an end. Every day there are new improvements - enlargements of battle-ships, new inventions in connexion with munitions of war, and so forth. </para>

                            <para>- During that period, of course, there are examinations to test efficiency. Nowadays there is very much specialization in the Navy, and an officer undertakes special duty in a particular branch. The selection of officers for, particular branches of the service &#39; in England is now left entirely to the Admiralty authorities. Whenever a boy goes , as a cadet to Osborne, his parents have to sign an undertaking that they will consent to his being entered for any branch of the naval service to which his aptitude, training, and inclination lead the Admiralty to think he is best fitted. That is because of the high degree of specialization now required. One class of officers specializes in torpedo work, another in submarines, another in gunnery. A high degree of technical training is required for each branch of the service. I was exceedingly pleased to hear that it is the policy of the Government to have, in case of&#39; ordinary seamen, an agreement by which, after a period of eighteen months, or whatever period of training may be considered necessary, he shall be obliged to serve in the Navy for a period of seven years. I think it would be disastrous to our Navy from the point of view of the efficiency of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> if we had not some such provision as that. In fact, if any complaint is to be made it is that the period is too short. That, however, is a matter that can always be altered. Experience will teach us what is necessary for efficiency. I again  congratulate the Minister! It is something to be proud  of that we are now in the position of having the nucleus of a navy - in fact almost &#39; an efficient service - within sight in our Australian waters. </para>

                            <para>-Colonel CAMERON (Tasmania)  &#91;3.28&#93;.  - I should like to join in expressing my satisfaction that this movement for the establishment of an Australian Navy has been brought to the satisfactory point that has been reached. Without touching upon technical details, which are practically outside the consideration of any member of the Senate. I should like to dwell upon the broad principle, which has been at stake in connexion with the defence of Australia. The defence of this country has been thrown to a very large extent upon the shoulders of the people, who should bear the burden. That has been the basic principle underlying- the whole movement of Australian nationality. The second point that I desire to emphasize is that, if the Bill means anything, it means that the future standard of efficiency of our Navy cannot be anything less than that of the Royal &#34;Navy itself ; also that provision has been made for the services of our Navy wherever its services may be required. I am extremely gratified that the Bill provides for the bringing about of so satisfactory a result. </para>

                        <para>. - There is one point that I should like the Minister to make quite clear to us. I understand that, whoever may happen to be in command of our own Navy, will have secret instructions from the Government. But this Bill provides that, whenever our Navy may be acting with any portion of the Imperial Navy, the senior officer present shall take command. That being so, if the senior officer &#39;be an officer of the Imperial Navy, will he not have secret instructions from the British authorities, and if those instructions should clash with the instructions given by the Commonwealth Government, which will prevail ? Is it not possible that our Navy may be placed under the control, for example, of the officer in charge of the China Fleet, and that he will actually ignore the secret instructions issued  Dy  the Commonwealth Government ? In other words, is it not possible that, under this Bill, we may hand over our own Navy to the charge of a British officer without the Commonwealth Government being consulted in any shape or form? </para>

                        <para>. - In regard to the point which has been raised concerning the length of service, I merely wish to say that the regulations bearing upon it have not yet been framed. I have merely quoted the terms which have been suggested by members of the Naval Board, who are now engaged in drafting regulations. I said that there would probably be two terms - seven years and five years. Those who sign on for seven years will get a slightly higher rate of pay than those who sign on for only five years. But since I moved the second reading of the Bill, I have been informed by an Admiral of the British Navy who happens to be visiting our shores - a brother of Admiral Henderson, the distinguished Admiral who furnished us with a very valuable report - that there are 5,000 men in the British Navy to-day who are under a five years&#39; engagement, and that the tendency of recent years has been to shorten the term of engagement. So that, if our regulations provide for two terms, our practice will accord with that which obtains in the British Navy to-day. When I spoke of  a  period of six years for training, I had  in  mind the whole period which will be covered from the time that a lad enters the Naval College. Portion of that time will, of course, be spent on a training cruiser. I would also point out that the danger which had been foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell cannot possibly arise. No British officer can take command of our ships unless they are placed under his control by the Commonwealth Government, and the Commonwealth Government will not give him any instructions different from those which were given to him as a British officer. </para>

Each ship would be quite. independent of the other. I have to thank the Senate for its cordial reception of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Should that result be brought about, it does not seem fair that  any officer of our Navy should be at the mercy of a decision which may have been arrived at by a court martial composed partly of officers of the Imperial Navy. It may be urged that the Governor-General has to give his consent to the capital penalty being carried out, and that, whether or not that consent is forthcoming, will depend upon the advice of his Ministers. But I understand that the prerogative of mercy can be exercised by the Governor-General quite independently of the advice of his Ministers. I think that Parliament should have a final voice in this matter. </para>

In the first place, no sentence of death can be carried into effect without the consent of the Governor-General, and under the Acts Interpretation Act, the &#34; Governor-General &#34; means the Government of the day. If this Parliament were to enact a law abolishing capital punishment, then the Governor-General in Council could not confirm any sentence of death which might be recorded. There is no need to amend this clause. All that has to be done by Parliament is to pass a measure abolishing the punishment of death under any Federal law, and then the Governor-General cannot confirm a sentence of death passed upon a person. Up to the present Parliament has not passed such a law. </para>

                        <para>. - I thank the Minister of Defence for his courteous explanation of the position, but I had no intention of attempting to abolish capital punishment by an amendment in this clause. I recognise that every such question must be dealt with on its merits. But when an honorable senator asked by interjection whether we could bring such a case before Parliament, I replied that more than once when Parliament has deemed that an injustice, was being done, it has practically compelled a matter to be reconsidered. I do not share the feeling which is so frequently expressed in the press, and by members of Parliament, too, that politicians should have no voice in the determination of these questions. They should be the last court of appeal if there is a belief that anything wrong is being done, or is going to be done, by any branch of the Public Service, whether it be the Naval or the Military, or any other. 1 believe that in the very rare instances where such a thing was likely to be done, Parliament would, with due decorum, give to any case the most calm, fair, and non-party consideration. It should have, the last say, quite irrespective of whether we abolish capital punishment or not. It was not my intention, I repeat, to try to abolish capital punishment by a side wind. Seeing that a general court martial will consist partly of persons not responsible to us, or our Ministry, Parliament ought to  have the last say as to whether a death  sentence shall &#39; be carried out or not.

If a sentence of death ought to be reviewed in this case, it ought to be reviewed in all cases, otherwise it is tantamount to saying that a general court martial will do something which the other court martial will not do. . If the amendment is inserted, the effect will be that these cases, if ever they should occur, will be reviewed by Parliament, and other cases will not be reviewed. Under the Naval Discipline Act, practically only two classes of cases are punishable by death, namely, treason in the face of the enemy, and murder. Apart from those two cases, no offences are punished by death to-day under the Admiralty. </para>

But from his own remarks when he was talking about capital punishment it seemed necessary to remind him that there are capital offences over which this Parliament has no jurisdiction. There are capital offences over which it has jurisdiction; but the honorable senator was speaking, as far as I heard him,&#39; with regard to capital offences generally. I agree with the Minister that we have -very properly constituted some capital offences under Federal jurisdiction, but that does not affect the question of capital offences outside our jurisdiction. I am inclined to think that the Minister is quite right in what he says, and that mine was not altogether a senseless interjection, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has said, because he did not limit his remarks. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether, if the Minister had not spoken, I would have supported my leader in this matter. Of the two cases in which the death sentence can be inflicted, I think that the offence of treason is altogether too vague and indefinite. We ought not to lightly allow any citizen to pay the last penalty without making the fullest investigation into the case. This is, I think, a matter which might possibly be better left to the Parliament than to the Executive. Ministers are so closely engaged in reading and signing papers that they really have not time to go into the evidence in these cases. In these circumstances, they are more inclined, I think, to take the view of the court martial than to dip into the evidence. Parliament is qualified to conduct an inquiry by reason of the diverse views which are held by its members. An alert Opposition, for instance, might bring out some points which would be favorable to a condemned person which otherwise would not be elicited by an overworked Ministry. </para>

But I believe that we have arrived at an age when this barbarous method of punishment is altogether out of touch with the community. I recognise with the Minister, however, that this is not the measure in which to deal with the question of its abolition. To my mind, one of the offences which the Minister mentioned does not justify the infliction of this awful penalty. Many things may constitute treason. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, it is one of those things which we ought to handle with particular care. A hundred things may happen in the face of the enemy which may look like treason. A humane soldier might let somebody off instead of doing what he ought to do, and that is butchering him at once ; and the person let off may secure an advantage by the humane act of the other man. The duty of a sentry is to shoot immediately a man who does not answer his challenge. Suppose that, out of humane consideration, a sentry refrains from so acting, and a person is let off, it may be concluded by those iri charge that he has really given a position away. All that may look like treason. </para>

                            <para>. - I rise to protest against the continual suspension of the Standing Orders. I recognise that the Senate, as the Second Chamber of the Federal Parliament, is the House in which there should be the most careful supervision of all legislation brought forward. It is impossible for honorable senators to have a proper understanding of the effect of all the legislation proposed under a system by which the Standing Orders are so frequently suspended. They should not be suspended at any time without grave and serious reasons. I do not say that I would never vote for the suspension of the Standing Orders, but this is the second or third occasion within the last day or two on which I have heard a similar motion submitted. As one who desires to maintain the position of the Senate as the revising Chamber of this Parliament, I say tha.t honorable senators should be given the fullest opportunity to consider every measure submitted, and I enter my protest against these continual suspensions of the Standing Orders. </para>

                    <para>I desire to clear away a little misunderstanding that may have arisen with respect to. the course of action intended to be taken by the Government. Honorable senators are aware that when we are approaching the close of a session it has always been the practice to put contingent notices of motion on the paper for the suspension of the Standing Orders. I have acted only in accordance with that practice. These contingent notices of motion can be brought into operation on the receipt of messages from another place, and the adoption of this course in this instance affords me the earliest opportunity to move the second reading of this Bill. When I have done so, it will be open to the Leader of the Opposition, or any other member of the Senate, to move the adjournment of the debate. I said that the debate might be resumed at a later hour of the day because I do not desire that before  10  o&#39;clock this evening we should find ourselves in the position of having no other business to go on with. </para>
                    <para>SenatorMillen.  -  Is the honorable senator holding out an inducement to us to talk upon other matters until  10  o&#39;clock to-night ? I believe we might do so if that were desired. </para>

                            <para>- I am holding out no such inducement. The Minister of Defence has another Bill to submit. There is the motion for the printing of the Budget papers to be discussed, and private members&#39; business may also be taken. But if it is the wish of the majority of honorable senators, I am quite prepared to agree to the debate on the second reading of this Bill being resumed to-morrow. That was my intention all along. But I wish to prevent any mischance in the circumstances to which I have referred. I might have postponed the second reading of this Bill until after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had submitted his business. I refrained from doing that because I wished to give honorable senators an opportunity of fully studying the Bill which is now under consideration. This is one of the measures which the Government consider themselves under an obligation to introduce and carry. </para>

It may be considered by a great number of people that it does not fall far short of presumption for those who have not had 3 much experience in financial matters reintroduce legislation of this ; description. Up to the present time, however, it must be admitted that the results of the financial policy of the Labour party, both in the Commonwealth and in the States, bear favorable comparison with the results of any other section of the community. Everything that we have done up to the present time in financial matters has met with the approval of the people of Australia, not only in connexion with taxation systems, but also in other respects. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that I will endeavour to exercise all my intelligence in the explanation that I shall make. By the exercise of my imagination, I can go a long way back in the history of banking. I can realize its commencement. Banking to-day is a very different thing from what it was in its origin. The very term &#34; banking &#34; does not, in its original signification, embrace the financial affairs of a Government like ours. The original idea was that people wanted to put their money in a safe place. I can imagine times when the weaker, the more timid, and the less aggressive members of a community would hand over their valuables to a chief, or to the more powerful in their tribe to be taken care of. That, I suppose, was the real origin of banking. The idea was to place valuables in safe keeping. . But the time came when the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few created the idea that use should be made of the valuables so stored. It was a secondary move on the part of those intrusted with this wealth to lend it out to persons, not for the purpose of returning interest to depositors, but to make profit for themselves. Then, as civilization grew, those owning the wealth that was thus deposited for safe keeping in the hands of responsible and reliable individuals, came to the conclusion that they also ought to get some benefit out of the investment of their valuables. Consequently, interest came to be paid to what are now known as depositors. It has now been considered advisable to establish a bank common to all the people of the community, in which all the people can safely deposit their surplus wealth, and receive, not a very small portion of the earnings of that wealth, but the full benefit. Consider the enormous sums that have been distributed within the last couple of hundred years amongst the shareholders of banking institutions. </para>

I can assure the honorable senator, also, that the Common wealth Bank is going to be placed in no more favorable a position than any of the other banking institutions in Australia in regard to Commonwealth notes. The bank will have in. its possession no note for which it has not given a sovereign. The honorable senator knows that, or ought to know it. </para>

I, however, hope that the day will never come when Commonwealth notes will be either at a premium or at a discount. I hope that they will always be at par. I have already referred to a bank as an institution for taking care of the surplus wealth of the people. I have incidentally referred to the time when the possessors of this surplus wealth received consideration from those who were taking care of it. I have mentioned, in reply to an interjection, that the Labour party has for twenty years had on its programme a proposal for the establishment of a State Bank. At the time when this plank in our platform was adopted, the Commonwealth was not in existence. Then we could only think of State Banks. Now we are proposing to establish a Commonwealth Bank. I have reminded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> that if there were anything in the world that emphasized that idea in the minds of the members of the Labour party, it was what occurred iri 1893, when all these banks went smash one after another. </para>

If New South Wales had not gone to the assistance of the Bank of New South Wales, if Queensland had not gone to the assistance of the Queensland National Bank, and if other States had not promised similar assistance to various institutions, the disaster would have been greater than it was. I merely wish to show that if, prior to that date, there had been  any doubt in the minds of members of the Labour party, that financial crash supplied the necessary evidence as to the wisdom of the policy which they have advocated ever since, and which they are now endeavouring to bring into operation.

                            <para>- I hope I shall be permitted to make points in regard to the banking institutions of Australia, and the necessity which exists for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank. If honorable senators will refer to a return which was laid on the table of the Senate not long ago - I think at the request either of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> - they will find that it sets out the liabilities and assets of the different banking institutions of Australia, as well as the dividends which have been paid, and the reserves which have been built up by those institutions. Honorable senators have only to look at that return, and to take five-year periods, between 1880 and 1890, to note that, during those periods, these banks greatly increased the amounts which they held in fixed deposits, and . deposits without interest. But, during the next five-year period, these deposits materially decreased, and a very large amount of capital disappeared entirely. From another return I can show that, during the same period, twenty-two prominent citizens. of Victoria became insolvent, their liabilities amounting to nearly , &#163;3,250,000, and their asset&#39;s representing only&#163;28,000. A large amount of the so-called capital which then; existed in the commercial and financial affairs of. the country, was of a spurious . nature, and that. system- was encouraged by the rotten, system which obtained . previously. </para>

I wish also to show that this &#163;3,250,000, which was confiscated by pro eminent citizens in Australia, who are now strong opponents of the Labour party, was taken from the poor. It represented the investments of the poor in building societies and other financial institutions. It was gathered together by these prominent citizens, with all the, hands that they could stretch out, and it Was absolutely confiscated. Very few of them have gone to the destitute asylum, or are asking for old-age pensions. A sufficient portion of that money stuck to them to enable them to live in affluence to-day. </para>

If honorable senators choose to trace the period from 1895, when the crisis terminated, till1910, they will find that the capital, deposits, investments &#38;c, in the banks have greatly increased, because the Labour party has grown and has created greater confidence in them. This may be regarded as a boast, but it is a boast which I am going to make on every possible opportunity. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is. Honorable senators will also find, by reference to the return to which I have alluded, that even from 1880 to 1890, and from 1895 to the present day, a large proportion of the surplus wealth of the. general population of Australia was deposited in these banks, for which the depositors never received a single penny. The whole of that benefit found its way. into the pockets of the shareholders through the management of the directors. </para>

                            <para>- I am not suggesting that they are. No honorable senator need imagine that I entertain any animus towards the directors, managers, or shareholders of banks. I have had some business with banking institutions, and I have always been treated fairly by them. I am not finding fault either with the shareholders, the managers, or the directors of our private banks. I am merely dealing with the system which prevails. I say that the enormous amount of wealth which is represented by deposits at call in these institutions confers a benefit only upon a few individuals. The great majority to whom it belongs receive no benefit more than that which the poor little savage received from the big savage to whom he gave the hind leg of a chicken to mind for him. That is exactly the. position. I leave it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger to illustrate it better if he can. But if that &#163;57,000,000, or any proportion of it, were in the Commonwealth Bank, and the manager of that bank could make use of it in the interests of the institution, who would benefit? Obviously, the people of Australia would be benefited indirectly. Is not that a better condition of things? We say that if the Commonwealth Bank takes care of money for the owners of it, and can, in addition, make a profit, the remainder&#39; of the public will share in that profit. I wish, also, to point out that there is a great similarity between the&#39; institution which we propose to establish and even the Bank of England : itself. There is a very great similarity, as well as a difference. </para>

                            <para>- That does not matter. Sometimes I like to forget things. I do not want to remember all the unpleasantness in this world. When the Bank of England was established this money was contributed for the purpose of assisting the Government, which had guaranteed to contribute &#163;100,000 from the Consolidated Revenue every year. That was a very substantial interest on the amount subscribed by the promoters. I feel sure that honorable senators do not wish me to trace the history of the bank up to the present time. It has had a varied history, and is a great institution to-day. There is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth Bank, if established on safe lines - and we have the authority of the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> that our&#39; bank is being established on safe lines - from becoming in the same period of time as great an institution as the Bank of England. It must be remembered that it is considerably over 200 years since the latter bank was established. Honorable senators must not look at the small amount of capital with which our bank is going to be started. I consider that it will be quite sufficient, because the public will deposit their surplus wealth there, feeling quite certain that it is the safest institution in existence. </para>

Apart from any profit and any benefit which may be conferred upon the public, it must be remembered that to a very great extent the Commonwealth Bank will influence the rate of interest which borrowers will have to pay to other institutions in the future. 1 am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, and other senators from South Australia, can bear testimony to the facts which I am going to put before the Senate. I think it was in  1894,  or shortly afterwards, that we, in South Australia, advocated the establishment of a State Bank. At that time few persons were getting money out of any of the banks at less than  8  per cent., and authentic instances have been quoted where certain persons have had to pay as high as  12  per cent. </para>

I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> had no necessity to go to his uncle when he was in London. Consequently, I do not know how he has acquired so much experience. He must have been either a pawnbroker or a customer to know as much as he does. But I suspect that he is only guessing, which I advise him to refrain from. At that time in South Australia there was even a greater agitation against the establishment of a little State Bank than there is against the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank to-day. The agriculturist - the poor producer about whom we hear so much - was told that every kind of disaster would follow in its wake from the financial point of view. Since its establishment, however, the rate of interest has come down, even in the big financial institutions, to as low as4&#189; and5&#189; per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going into those matters. I could give hundreds of illustrations as to how the State Bank has operated. If the Commonwealth Bank does not give direct benefits to the whole people it will so influence the interest, the transactions, and the conditions in financial institutions that the whole people will be bound to benefit. With these preliminary remarks I shall explain the provisions of the Bill. Part I., which includes clauses1 to  4,  deals with preliminary matters, such as the commencement of the Act by proclamation, and the definitions, &#34;the Bank,&#34; and &#34;the Governor.&#34; Part II., which includes clauses  5  to  10,  refers to the establishment of the Bank ; the powers and authorities which it is to possess, and everything appertaining to the establishment of a truly financial institution, with the capacity to operate in any direction that any other financial institution can do. Part III., which contains clauses  11  to  20,  deals with the management, the appointment of the Governor and Deputy Governor, the functions of those two officials, the appointment of officers by the Governor, the seal, who is to use that seal, and how it is to be used. Part IV., which embraces clauses  21  to  34  contains general provisions in connexion with the depositors. Then we come to a very debatable part in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger seems to take much interest, and that is the establishment of a Savings Bank branch. What objection can there be taken to the establishment of a Savings Bank by the Commonwealth? Has it not in the Constitution a direction to enter into banking of any description?&#39; </para>

                            <para>- No crushing is intended. The honorable senator might as well say that the Commonwealth Bank to do ordinary business is being established for the purpose of crushing other banking institutions. Nothing of the kind. If other banking institutions crush out its bank the Commonwealth will have to put up with that result, and if the Commonwealth Bank ultimately supersedes the other banks, the latter will have to put up with the result. It will still be carrying out the doctrine .which the senator has been preaching for so many years : the survival of the fittest. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that is exactly what will happen. The Savings Bank branch is not to be established by the Commonwealth for the purpose of crushing out the State Savings Banks. I recognise that State institutions in common with other financial institutions which have anything to do with the States, have carried out a very good work, and in some instances in a very good way. But that is no reason why an institution established by the Commonwealth should not bring benefits which cannot otherwise be obtained while we have different State institutions and private institutions running under Commissioners at the same time. </para>

                            <para>- There are dozens of places where it would be quite convenient for our Savings Bank to establish branches which the State Savings Banks have neglected to establish, and so enable the poorer people to make deposits of their savings. In the back-blocks, about which we hear so much, no provision of this kind has been made hitherto. It may be all very well for honorable senators to rise here and say, &#34; The State institutions will establish branches when they find it necessary.&#34; They will do it as soon as an attempt in that direction is made by the Commonwealth.  A  bank of this description established by the Commonwealth in their interest can give greater conveniences to the great Savings Bank depositing public. South Australia is making a little noise at the present time, but the depositors in its Savings Bank have no Government guarantee with respect to their deposits if it should go wrong, or if the management should be defective, or if it should lead them astray. Any man may say, &#34; Oh, but the Government would be compelled to come to the assistance of the Savings Bank.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must admit that the guarantee of the Commonwealth at the back of a financial institution is a greater security than would be the guarantee of one, or two, or three, or four, or five of the States. Consequently we shall be able to give a greater guarantee of security to depositors in the Savings Bank branch of the Commonwealth Bank than can be given by any other institution in the Commonwealth. I have next to refer to the power given in Part VI., of this Bill, clauses  54  to  61,  enabling the Commonwealth Bank to issue debentures. This provides the way in which the Bank is to obtain its capital. Originally the Treasurer will be prepared to advance  . &#163;1,000,000  to the bank to set it going. The bank will then have power to issue debentures, and Part VI. of the Bill includes the provisions regulating the issue of debentures by the Bank. Honorable senators can have no objection to that. When these debentures are taken up the Bank will be able to pay the  &#163;1,000,000  back to the Treasurer, we shall find that, with this power, neither the Treasurer, the Bank, nor the public, will be at any disadvantage. The. last part of the Bill, including clauses  62  to  64  contains the necessary miscellaneous provisions. </para>

                <para class="block">This Bill deals with two matters which, though important, will not, I think, be found to be contentious. One part has reference to the training and drills for senior cadets. Under the existing Act the training provided for is four whole days&#39; drill, twelve half-day drills, and twenty-four night drills, and it is provided that day drills shall be of not less than six hours duration, half-day drills not less than three hours, and night drills not less than one and a-half hours. This was laid down by the Defence Act of  1909,  and was not disturbed by the amending Act of  19 10.  In July last this training, was put into actual operation. </para>

                        <para>- No; not for the training of senior cadets. It left the period of training for them as it was laid down in the Act of  1909.  Since July last we have given the closest attention to the matter, and we have received letters from all over the Commonwealth complaining of cases of hardship, and suggesting that the drill is of too severe a character. From time to time I have instructed the Department to apply the provisions of the Act as leniently as possible in drafting regulations; We have endeavoured in every way to meet the objections raised to the rigorous nature of the drill and the conditions under which it is . carried out. But we have been forced to the conclusion that, in a very large number of cases, the time laid down for the drill is too long. This is especially the case in country districts where many lads have to walk as much as three miles to the place at which the parade is held. The drill is, of course, in the first year of a most uninteresting character. The lads have to go through squad drill, and there is little or nothing in it to appeal to their intelligence or to arouse in them a spirit of emulation. It is, therefore, rather monotonous for them. It is also very tiring to those who have not been accustomed to such training. To the trained man the drill is not tiring, as it becomes largely mechanical. But there can be no doubt that the training now required is very severe upon lads who may have had a long tramp, perhaps, after a long day&#39;s work, and have to travel some distance home after drill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so, because those who know the drill go through it, to a great extent, mechanically. Then, when we are dealing with lads who are attending school, it must not be forgotten that the modern educational system imposes a very severe task upon boys. They have to go through a difficult school curriculum. They are often loaded up with home lessons and we find that when a lad attending school, has to attend a night parade, though it only occupies an hour and a-half , it is some time before he reaches his home. It may be asked why we did not think of all this in 1909 ; but it is only after experience we find that many things require alteration. The training now provided for was proposed by a previous Government ; but we are not sheltering ourselves behind that, since I admit that if we had been in office at the time, we should probably have done the same thing. There was then no experience of the system- to guide us. We have since had experience of its working. I have given the matter close study and attention. I have personally investigated many complaints, and have had reports made by officers explaining what has taken place in reply to complaints made by members of Parliament and private individuals. We have, in the circumstances, been forced to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to recognise that we have asked too much of the Senior Cadets, and to- alter the course of training provided for now, rather than to allow growing discontent, based upon genuine cases of hardship, to be fostered, which might eventually prove inimical to the principle of universal training. We have been fortified in this decision by the expression of opinion of officers responsible for the training, and also-officers of the Military Board, who have assured me&#39; that&#39; we can safely make the reduction in the hours of drill provided for in this Bill -without impairing the efficiency of the Senior Cadets when they are turned over to the Citizen Forces. It is proposed now that this training shall consist of drill extending over sixty-four hours in each year,, but cadets will be at liberty to attend voluntary parades in addition if they please. With this amount of training for four years, they can be turned over to. the Citizen Forces at eighteen years of age&#62; and should be better trained and disciplined than is what we call a recruit to-day. That is all we desired to accomplish by the Senior Cadets&#39; drill. It was intended to provide that a lad, on entering the Citizen Forces, should be the equal in discipline and training of a person who had gone through what is known as the recruit course. I am advised that this can be accomplished by sixty-four hours drill per year. We have, therefore, taken power in this B;ll to reduce the duration of -parades for the Senior Cadets only. We do not deal in this Bill with the Citizen Forces at all. Their hours of drill will remain as they are to-day. We are, of course, wise after the event ; but it must be admitted that it was somewhat of an inconsistency to lay down the same period of training for a boy as for a man. It was hardly treating the boy fairly. In the case of lads residing in the country dis.tricts, we are taking power, if necessary* to dispense with night drills altogether. Many of these lads could come ..into the parade-ground for a whole day drill with much greater convenience than they could come for two or three nights per- week,- or even at night-time at all. Many of them have to travel over bad roads, and in winter, in some, districts, it is a hardship that they should be compelled to attend, .drill at night. . This Bill will give the Minister power to proclaim that, in certain -districts, the drill may be done in half or whole day parades.  </para>

                        <para>- This is no doubt a concession; but I do not think it will be dangerous. We have a number of area officers, and it will be to their interests, and the interests of those under them, to make their lads as efficient as possible. That will be specially the case in future, because we are initiating a series of competitions - each company in a battalion against each other company - to see which is the best in the battalion ; the best in each battalion against the best in other battalions to see which is the best company in a brigade; the best in each brigade against the best in each district ; and the best in each district against the best in other districts to ascertain the best company in the Commonwealth. If the drill is not carefully attended to, a company may fail to get into these competitions at all, and that must count against the officer in charge, and militate against his promotion. There will, therefore, be every inducement to area officers to try to make their companies as efficient as possible. The other principal clause of the Bill is intended to bring it into conformity with provisions dealing with the infliction of punishment upon those who endeavour to disobey the law regarding compulsory training. At the &#39;present time, if a lad attending a parade disobeys legitimate orders, or does not behave himself, he can be taken before a magistrate and subjected to a penalty, and the penalty can be recovered. But if that lad does not come to parade - if he simply absents himself - we can proceed against him, and a penalty can be inflicted. The penalty, however, cannot be recovered until he reaches the age of eighteen years. The section containing that provision was inserted in the  1909  Act. It was an extraordinary one, and is practically rendering the Act in this respect nugatory. Recently, I asked the Inspector- General to pay some surprise visits to the training areas around Melbourne. He did so&#34;, and furnished me with a report. He found that  40  per cent. of the cadets were absent without leave. When inquiries were made amongst the area officers as to the reason for the great number of absences without leave, invariably they gave as a reason that the lads have got to know that we cannot recover penalties against them until they reach the age of eighteen. Consequently, they are beginning to absent themselves in great numbers. </para>

                        <para>- They are; but you cannot get a lad under eighteen years of age to look at the matter from that point of view. It is difficult enough to get a boy to think about present dangers, without expecting him to pay heed to what may happen to him four years ahead. The area officers tell us that the provision is worse than useless. In fact, it is almost an inducement to cadets to remain away from parade. The Act is very inconsistent in this respect. A boy who regularly attends his parades, but who disobeys an order, can be dealt with straight away. But a boy who stays away from drill altogether cannot be touched for four years. It really is a most inconsistent position. I, therefore, came to the conclusion that if this movement is to be successful, if we are to get these lads trained, we do not want to bring them into barracks for punishment four years hence. We want to give them their training now. </para>

                        <para>- In some cases it went up to  40.  The average was somewhere about  30.  In one case, there was only 7 per cent. of absentees, but that was the best instance of the lot. We do not want to take these lads into barracks. It is far better that we should be able to inflict punishment upon them now. We want to let the lads know that they must attend their drills, and that if they do not, the punishment will not be deferred for four years. It would be highly inadvisable to let them accumulate punishment, and then  bring them into a barracks, where&#34; they would be subjected to all the associations of barrack life, which I regard as harmful to lads of that age. There is one other provision to which I direct attention. One clause of this Bill <inline font-style="italic">relates</inline> to the interference of- employers with lads attending drill. This clause effects no alteration in principle, but merely in phraseology.- We are adopting the phraseology of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which is considered to&#39; be better and more far-reaching. The wording is better. While we were dealing with the Defence Act, we thought that we might as well make the wording of this provision conform with that of the Arbitration Act. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the Minister of Defence desires to get this measure through to-day, and for that reason, I propose to make a few remarks upon it now. I shall deal first with the matter which the Minister touched upon towards the close of his speech, when he referred to the absentees, those . unwilling defenders of their country. The Minister very properly stated that the section now in operation was in the original Act of 1909. Without looking at that section, it must be obvious from his statement that there was an oversight &#62;n the drafting, with the result of making the section operate as was never intended. Therefore, there can be no debate as to the desirableness of making an amendment. It is, however, a matter of some regret to me to find that so large a percentage of our lads have taken advantage of a loophole of this kind. </para>

Of course, as he stated, we were moving in the dark when the original measure was passed. It is only by experience tha&#39;t we can be guided as to the direction in which amendments should be made. Is there any reason to suppose -that the medical examination of these recruits is all that it ought to be. That is- a very important factor, for this reason: whilst a certain period of training might be considered sufficient for youths declared to be medically fit, it might be too stringent, and might impose too severe a strain on lads who were not so physically capable. I hope that the medical examination in this country is quite on a par with that in older countries-. The results of the medical examinations speak volumes for the physique and stamina of young Australia, because of the quite abnormal percentage of those declared fit - that is, as compared with similar examinations in Great Britain and Germany - but I have some fear that those examinations are rather lax. I sincerely hope that I am wrong. It is a matter to which the Minister should give some attention. He might make inquiries as to whether these lads are being passed through in a more or less perfunctory way, or whether they are really subjected to that searching medical examination which ought to be at the basis of compulsory enrolment. With regard to the one other matter which the Minister mentioned - that with regard to relaxing the regulations in districts where climatic conditions render it advisable - the honorable senator himself recognised the danger of the provision in the Bill. It seems to me to be stretching leniency to ari extreme, when you allow inclement weather to be taken into consideration to the extent, not of giving the cadet the option of postponing the time of training, but of exempting him altogether. I do not quite know how frequently these inclement days may give rise in the imagination of cadets to a. desire to absent themselves from drills. Seeing that according to the Minister&#39;s own figures so large a proportion of them show a desire to absent themselves whenever they can&#39; find a reasonable excuse for doing so, I do not know to what extent they will be moved to find excuses for their absence if we allow inclement weather to be taken into consideration. It is easy to see that this concession may be used to cut down die period of training- - sixty-four hours a year - to such a point that a cadet would really be inefficient at the end of his term. I suggest the advisableness of trying to devise a regulation which- would put a limit to this exemption. The regulation might provide that a cadet should be forgiven for absenting himself three or four times on account of the weather, if he made up for those absences on other occasions. Otherwise the deduction from his drills would be a very serious one, and might result in a boy not being the equal of his comrades in efficiency .of training. I think the Minister might -consider the desirableness of such a regulation as I have outlined. I certainly would put a limit to it. If, by reason of bad weather, a boy is not able to turn up to drill well and good. But if that goes on three or four times, and he is allowed to escape his drill, he will lose a certain portion of his value as a factor in the defence of this country.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> - A boy who lived in a very wet district might lose half his training. </para>

                        <para>- If a boy persuades himself that the weather, on a particular occasion, is altogether unsuited for a free young Australian to go out and drill in, he can also persuade his area officer, who may be- living some few miles from the residence of the boy, and, therefore, cannot speak with&#39; authority on the presence or absence of passing storms at the time. The boy might use these opportunities in such a way as- to cut down his hours of training very considerably. </para>

                        <para>- He certainly would if he were a member of the Rae family, lt does seem to me that the Minister is opening the door too wide here. I urge upon him that there should be some limit. If- it was found that a boy, by reason of inclement weather, was accumulating absences to an extent beyond a fourth of the time - that is thirteen hours out of the total period-^1 he ought to make it up on some days when the weather was more favorable. Unless the Minister does that, I fear that while he is stopping the 40 per cent, of absentees from&#39; one cause he will&#39; simply create 40 per cent, of absentees from another. The Minister was quite right in saying that there should be no suggestion of imprisoning a boy at the end of his cadetship. That would not make up for the lost training which he should have had. By the time he reaches the age when he can be passed into the ordinary forces he should have been thoroughly trained as a recruit. No imprisonment for neglect of that training would make up to the Commonwealth that which the boy had missed through absenting himself from his drills. For the rest we can only regard this Bill as one of many which we shall have to pass as experience discloses weaknesses in our defence legislation. From time to time we shall have to deal with measures of a similar character. Therefore, we can regard this as one of a series of measures which experience will dictate, and which we can deal with without any party criticism at all. I am sure that the Senate will be only too pleased to assist in passing these very necessary amendments of the law. </para>

                    <para>.- I am rather pleased that this Bill has been introduced. At the same time I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the wet weather provision is rather too lax. I think that if some by-law could be made rendering a youth responsible to put in periods of drill at some future date to make up for drills missed, that would be better than exempting him because of the wet, and giving him an opportunity of freeing himself from an obligation. The&#39; reduction of the period of night drill from one hour and a-half to an hour meets with my approval. We must remember that we are robbing our young men of a great deal of that leisure which is very valuable to them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether one and a-half hours of setting-up drill will make a boy more vigorous than one and a-half hours of football. But- it is no use shutting our eyes to the fact that,, under our compulsory military training system, we are robbing our youth of a great deal of their leisure, which they have hitherto utilized to advantage. I ask the Minister to give these lads an opportunity to become exempt from drill for the period, during which they would otherwise have to undergo it. They should not be obliged, to attend parade if they can prove, by means of an examination that they are already sufficiently well drilled.  1  recollect that, in 1885, a New South Wales contingent sailed from Sydney for the purpose of taking part in the Soudan campaign. The effect of its departure on the partially-paid companies in that State was to deprive each of those companies of ten or twelve regulars. lt became necessary, therefore, to fill up the ranks with recruits. But at the Easter encampment, which was held five weeks later, these recruits were not the awkward members of those companies. As a matter of fact, they were much more efficient than were many of the older hands. Consequently, I say that it is idle to compel youths and young men who have already attained proficiency in drill to attend parade year after year, especially when their places might well be taken by others who are now shut out, because only a limited number can be drilled under existing conditions. I hope that the Minister will bring this matter under the notice of those who are responsible for the training of our cadets. It must be recollected that we occupy a peculiar position in regard to the drilling of our Australian youth. We have 11 large number of quick-witted boys, and I fear that we are compelling them to undergo the same routine that is undergone by the youth of older countries, whose environment makes them less alert, and, consequently, slower to learn. In New South&#39; Wales for years past,-our public school system has, in the most effective way, performed the setting-up drill. As one walks along the streets of Sydney, he cannot fail to notice the difference between the smartness of ; the&#34;, public school lads of  to-day and that of those with whom I went to school. </para>

It is a mistake for the Commonwealth to. train our young men to become stalwart defenders of our country, if another authority is in a position to forbid their indulgence in manly exercises I hope that the Minister will give serious attention to the suggestions which I have made, and that the total period of training for our youths will be shortened in the case of those who can demonstrate by examination that they have attained the necessary standard of proficiency. </para>

                        <para>- But the. two things are not antagonistic to each other. I think that .a reward should -be granted to the individual &#39;for superior&#39; merit. &#39; I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that, to exempt from further drill youths who show the necessary efficiency, would be an incentive to them to excel in their -work. The Minister of Defence has admitted that the early part of their military&#39; training must be very monotonous to lads.&#39;&#39; I quite agree1 with &#34;him. But it must &#39;be exceedingly irritating to one who has attained the necessary proficiency,&#39; to be kept side by&#39; side with members of the awkward squad. I believe that our Defence system will have to be amended from time to time as experience discloses its defects. We must also look carefully into the causes of non-attendance at drill&#39;s. It is not sufficient for us to punish those who&#39; fail to attend. We must find out why they are disinclined to attend, with a view to removing the cause of their disinclination. We all recognise the wisdom of the old adage that &#34; Prevention is better than cure.&#34; There is another matter to which. I desire to direct attention. Upon two or three occasions, the press has chronicled the fact that &#39;certain lads have refused to attend parades because they are .the sons pf unionists and were asked to drill with the sons of black-legs. I know that the law cannot differentiate between unionists and non-unionists, and I do not desire it to do so. But, in districts where industrial disputes have occurred, the idea has been inculcated that our cadets may at some future period be called upon to take up arms against unionists. That feeling- whether it be rightly founded or not - is, to a large extent, responsible for the bad odour attaching to our compulsory training system at its very inception. This is very unfortunate. I believe that while the ostensible reason for the enrolment of the youth of this country is a desire to defend it against a hostile foe- </para>

                        <para>- While the ostensible reason is to render them efficient to defend their country against possible foreign aggression, they are afraid that their services will be called into request for quite other purposes. I ask honorable senators to look at the question in no narrow party or class spirit, but to realize that if this feeling is allowed to grow, it will militate, no matter what laws we may make, very seriously against the effectiveness of our compulsory military system; in fact, it may even lead to an absolute break down. While I do not anticipate that just now, I do say that already it is a canker at the root of the system which is leading a very large section of the people to offer a kind of passive resistance, which may at any time blossom out into a very active resistance, and so render the scheme absolutely ineffective, and cause its entire break down - unless that possibility is guarded against. I trust that honorable senators will not, in any prejudiced spirit, close their ears and remain deaf to this matter, but will realize that it is one which is going to be of very serious import to this country. If this tendency is not guarded against in time, it may do irreparable damage to a system which I hope to see made the most effective military system in . the world. To be that, it must be clear that it is based entirely on the citizenship idea of defending the country against outsiders, and is not in any way to be used for quite other purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I remember what took place. I know that no request was ever made for the Citizen Forces to be used; and if it had been made, I should have replied that there was absolutely no necessity for making the request, and, therefore, the military would not be sent. I do not suppose that in Australia there were half-a-dozen persons who ever thought that the military ought to be sent to Broken Hill. </para>

                        <para>- This question, of course, has very little to do with the Bill j but, as it has been raised, I must say a few words, otherwise it might be assumed that there was no reply. There is a certain section of people who are making these statements; but I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> knows that they are opposed to universal training in any circumstances. One has only to read their publications to see that. </para>

Knowing that people will not listen to them when they assert that there is no danger of foreign aggression, they try to bring in something to which they will listen, and so they hold up this bogy that the Citizen Forces are to be used for suppressing industrial discontent. </para>

                        <para>- It is a false statement, and it has been used by these persons because they are against universal training for any purpose. Does not the honorable senator know that some persons argue that there is no danger of foreign aggression? They say that the Germans, the French, and the Japanese have no hostile intentions towards us, for they are our brothers. They recognise the brotherhood of man, and say that these nations have none but the best intentions towards Australia, and that it is only the capitalist who has any idea of invading our territory. All that kind of thing I have read in their publications. The persons who circulate this statement, which I believe they know to be false, are aware that there is not the slightest intention to use the Citizen Forces for other purposes. </para>

                        <para>- The purposes for which our Citizen Forces are to be used are clear to the mind of every sensible person in Australia. With regard to the suggestion of Senators Rae and Gardiner as to the period of training, as far as that can be carried out, it is carried out. The least advanced men are often put into a squad by themselves, and given squad drill in order to bring them up to the standard of the others. At a camp, I have seen a certain number of men taken from a company because, by their behaviour on march, it had been made clear that they had not gone through the recruit course, and, during the period of the camp, they have been kept in a company doing recruit drill, while those who showed that they were further advanced, were taken through more extended training. As regards physical exercise, it will, I feel sure, comfort <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to know that in the competitions which we are introducing, the companies are not to be judged merely on military exercises. Rifle shooting is one thing for which so many points are to be given, and so, too, with military, and various forms of physical, exercises. The competitions will be carried out in different localities on a given day. So much money will be given for that purpose, and the committees will be instructed that, in addition to the military and other exercises which they are to arrange for, they must arrange for athletic sports. We have also told the area officers throughout Australia that if any drill-halls can be made available to the cadets who are attending the parades, as a sort of gymnasium and store for keeping their gloves and other accessories in, to do so. I may say that on a recent parliamentary visit to the Military College, &#34;there was great disappointment at the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I was told that a certain cadet had been anxiously looking forward to a meeting with him. </para>

                <para class="block">When I inquired the reason, to my astonishment, I was informed that he had conquered every other cadet in the College, and was looking for fresh scalps to add to his belt. I was ashamed that there was nobody in the parliamentary party who was prepared to step into <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> place. I want to give the correct figures of the absentees at the surprise visit of the Inspector-General on the 1 8th November. Twelve companies were inspected, and the number absent without leave from the companies averaged 34.9 per cent. </para>

I am fain to confess that I am largely of opinion that the last medical examination was too lenient.

                    <para>. - On this clause, I should like to refer to a matter which I gathered from some of the Minister&#39;s remarks had been referred to in the debate on the second reading, namely, the liability of the Defence Forces to. be called out for the purpose of quelling civil disturbances. It ought to be made clear in a Bill of this kind that, under no circumstances, except perhaps in the case of actual rebellion, on the part of a section of the community, should the Defence Forces be called out for any purpose in that connexion. We saw how the soldiers were used by the British Government during the late railway strike to defeat the railway men. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot tell what circumstances may arise in Australia. We know how things stand at the present moment, but we have not the slightest idea of what will take place within ten or fifteen or twenty years. I am strongly opposed to any calling out of the military in connexion with industrial disputes, or anything of that kind. I think it is a thing which ought never to be done. Whatever disturbance of that kind may arise ought to be put down under the authority of the police. As I have said, we saw what happened in Great Britain during the recent railway strike. We know what happened in Great Britain during the recent railway strike. The Government of Great Britain were prepared to go even further than they did. They intended, if the strike continued, to call out the military, and compel them to act as railway porters, engine-drivers, guards, and in every other position connected with the railway service of the country. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Our soldiers are sworn to obey orders. I do not imagine for a moment that a Labour Government would call out the military in this connexion. But suppose that, by some unfortunate turn of the political wheel, the capitalists of Australia - represented by Senators Walker, Gould, Vardon and Millen - were to get into power again, and industrial disturbances became rife, what would happen? Would they not call out the military? Would they not call out the young bloods of Australia and tell them to fire low and lay out the strikers? Of course they would. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order. As the honorable senator says the Opposition are fit for anything, we ought to be given an opportunity to show whether we are entitled to that reputation. I ask your ruling, sir, as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is in order in discussing an amendment of the Defence Act which is not covered by the order of leave. This is a Bill to amend sections 127, 134, 135 and 142 of the Defence Act. It is for that and no other purpose. I would suggest, without pretending to read into the mind of the Minister of Defence, that he was very careful to obtain a restricted order of leave, bearing in mind a discussion which took place in this Chamber some little time ago on a motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> which specifically raised the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is now attempting to discuss. </para>

                        <para>-  I submit for your consideration, sir, a very simple test of this matter. It is this : Could <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> on the clause before the Committee submit an amendment to give effect to the views he has expressed? It is obvious that he could not. The discussion is beyond the order of leave, and such an amendment would not be relevant to the clause, which simply deals with the title of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- I should be very loath to restrict discussion in any way, but it does seem to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> remarks were outside the order of leave and scope of the Bill, which is a Bill to amend sections 127, 134, 135, and 142 of the Defence Act. The clause at present before the Committee deals with the short title and citation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, it would not be competent for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> to move any amendment upon this clause to give effect to his ideas. I must rule in the circumstances that the honorable senator was travelling beyond the scope of the clause before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- It is perfectly true that, when blundering draftsmanship is pointed out, Ministers may be inclined to adopt remedies suggested by the Opposition ; but, speaking generally, we cannot fail to recognise that, because of their large majority in the Senate, they are much less careful to pay heed to criticism from the Opposition ranks than would be the case if parties were more evenly divided. The preponderance of their majority makes them careless. If I wanted further confirmation of that statement, I have only to look at the Ministerial benches at this moment. In view of our experience, which is not intermittent, but continuous, it is evident that there is but little inducement to discuss a measure of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- I. should like to do so, but if I did, the  President  would at once remind me that I was breaking one of our Standing Orders by quoting speeches made in another place during <inline font-style="italic">*</inline> ie current session. I do not intend to touch upon the genera&#93; question of arbitration. We have quite recently had one debate upon that subject, when the whole principle underlying our arbitration methods and dealing with industrial troubles was reviewed. Although I was then in a minority, I seized the opportunity of expressing the views which I strongly held, that arbitration had failed, and will continue to be a failure until there is an entire change of mental attitude on the part of the great body of industrial workers of Australia. I justified that view. </para>

                        <para>- Before the sitting was suspended, I intimated my intention to be extremely brief in my observations upon this Bill, brief not only because of the reasons which I have already advanced, but because I do not believe that this measure will confer any advantage upon the public servants who are immediately concerned, or upon the general public, who to a considerable extent, though less directly, are also concerned. The Bill marks the nearest approach to Gilbertian legislation of which the Government have yet given us an example. Its advocates ask us to believe that Parliament is incompetent to determine the conditions surrounding the employment of our public servants, and, therefore, they propose that we shall invoke the aid of the Arbitration Court. But whilst we are asked to affirm that Parliament is incompetent to determine those conditions, they still leave it to our public servants to say whether or not the aid of die Court shall be invoked. Now, if Parliament be incompetent to deal with this question, surely there ought not to be any doubt as to whether the Court&#39;s assistance should be sought - surely it ought not to be left to the public servants themselves to say whether the aid of the Court should be requisitioned or not. </para>

The advocates of the Bill say, &#34; We pin our faith to the Arbitration Court, and these matters shall be referred to it, as the most competent body &#34;to determine them.&#34; But not only are we asked to say that the Arbitration Court is the best body to determine them, and yet it shall not be necessary to invoke its aid, but we are invited to declare that, although Parliament is incompetent to decide what are fair wages to pay to our public servants, yet it shall retain the power to do the very thing which it is incompetent to do. Now, if Parliament be incompetent to :deal with this matter, we ought to say so plainly, and put it beyond its power to interfere. The Bill also in effect declares that the Public Service Commissioner is incompetent to decide not only what is a fair remuneration to the various grades of the service, but what is a fair remuneration to the individual members of it. Yet, curiously enough, it falls back upon that officer the moment the public servants decline to appeal to the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator believes that, he will sound the death-knell of thib Bill. If Parliament be incompetent to deal with these questions, I invite my honorable friend to be logical, and to &#34;go the whole hog&#34; by saying that it shall not retain the power of veto after the Arbitration Court has dealt with any claim. We know that the Public Service is seething with discontent, not merely in regard to the rates of wages which are paid, but in regard to a hundred other points. Is it to be supposed that the granting of the right of appeal to the Court upon one point will settle the whole trouble? Is it to be supposed that public servants, who are fretting under the belief that they are suffering injustice will cease their fretting the moment the right of appeal to the Arbitration Court is granted to them upon one matter? </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell believes that it will, he will be disappointed. Let me summarize my objections to the measure. In the first place, the Bill leaves it to our public servants to ignore the Arbitration Court if they choose ; and, in the second place, it allows Parliament to ignore any award which may be made by that Court. If that is not an approach to Gilbertian legislation, I do not know what is. Just apply these two statements to any other contention which may arise between sets of bodies or individuals. </para>

                        <para>- I say that ultimately Parliament must face the difficulty. This Bill merely postpones the trouble. Let us take our position clearly upon one side or other of the fence. Either let us say that this Parliament is competent to deal with the conditions of employment in our Public Service, or let us declare that it is not, and let us affirm that when the Arbitration Court has given an award this Parliament must obey it. It is merely trifling with our public servants to pretend, while we are still retaining parliamentary responsibility, that we are giving them the verdict of an untrammelled Court. If we analyze the measure, we shall find that all it does is to substitute the  President  of the Arbitration Court for the Public Service Commissioner. It may be urged that technically the  President  of the Court will be armed with enlarged powers compared with those which are vested in the Public Service Commissioner, inasmuch as the former may make an award providing for the payment of rates higher than those set out in an Act of Parliament itself. </para>

                        <para>- Now what do the Government propose to do with the Arbitration Court? They do not propose to give the Court one bit more power than the Public Service Commissioner possesses today.. What they do say to the Court is - &#34; You can make whatever award you like, but if an award is outside the Act, if you have gone beyond your authority,. Parliament claims the right of review.&#34; That means that the Judge will be merely making a recommendation to Parliament to be adopted or rejected as it may think fit. The- Commissioner enjoys that right today. He has on more than one occasion sent down a recommendation. </para>

                        <para>- Even intelligent people occasionally make a mistake or a lapse, and seeing how soon they recovered from that lapse, I am sure that the honorable senator and I can be equally gratified in the matter. I want to point out that under the Act the Public -Service Commissioner can make a recommendation to Parliament in any terms which he may think fit. If he thinks that he is prevented from granting an adequate wage by any section of the Act he has merely to send down a recommendation to. Parliament, which it can consider. That is all that the Judge can. do under this Bill. The Commissioner can, within the powers of the Act, grant wages which Parliament has approved-, and the Judge can do no more. The Commissioner can send down a report, while the Judge will make an award, which will come to us, and will be held in suspense,, as it were, until Parliament has expressed its approval or disapproval. </para>

                        <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in dealing with the present state of affairs, drew a most harrowing picture, and I have no doubt that he was moved by his personal&#39; experience to refer to the regularity and persistence with which a provision of the Act is broken, and that is the one which is supposed to prevent public servants from approaching members of Parliament. Every honorable senator knows that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> was speaking with a very close regard for the truth when he stated that the section is frequently broken, both in the letter and in the spirit. But does he suppose that members of Parliament will be relieved of that importuning by the mere passage of this Bill ? Does he not see that it opens the door wider and wider to it? What is going to happen? Suppose, for instance, that the Judge sends down an award which is slightly in excess of something allowed by the law. Honorable senators an the other side will not be able to fight their way from the door of the chamber to the public thoroughfare without being accosted by a number of public servants, importuning them to vote in support of the award. </para>

It is clear that the public did not ask for it. There has been no request from any section of the public anywhere that we should shirk our duty, and delegate to somebody else the work and responsibility which has belonged to Parliament ever since it has had an existence. If the public did not ask for the Bill, did the Public Service? </para>

                        <para>- There has been a petition against the Bill from a very large section of the Public Service. In view of the fact that it was attacked in the other House, and that the party to which I belong has given a sufficient indication of its want of faith in the proposal, one might have assumed that the Public Service, with all the machinery ready for the purpose, and the activity which it has displayed on so many occasions, would, if it had wanted the Bill passed, have sent some intimation to Parliament, through the proper constitutional channel, that it was in favour of its enactment. </para>

I am trying to look into the facts, and the facts as they present themselves for parliamentary consideration are - and no one will deny my statement - that a large section of the Public Service have declared their opposition to this proposal j but as regards the other and larger section, no effort has been made by them, or on their behalf, to place before Parliament that they are in favour of the proposal. All I can do is to say that the only pronouncement from the Public Service at the present moment is hostile to the Bill. </para>

Why, I repeat, was it brought forward? I can only find one reason which accounts for its appearance, and that is that it has been brought in merely to save the face of the Government and their party. </para>

                        <para>- No. What I do say is that all that the Labour party have given the Public Service falls so far short of what they promised when in opposition that they are bound to look for a more honest attempt to redeem the pledges by means of which votes were obtained very largely at the last election. The Government in their twilight hours see all these chickens coming home to roost. They see the public servants demanding that an honest attempt shall be made to redeem the promises made to them. Not long since, honorable senators on the other side promised the public servants that if they were returned to power, they would lead them out of the winter of their discontent into the bright summer of complete contentment. Where are they to-day? The Government are now having their promissory notes forced under their nose for redemption, and with the date of redemption clearly staring them in the face, they say, &#34; We cannot meet these bills; can we shirk them?&#34; They are endeavouring now to avoid the redemption of their promises by handing the Public Service over to the Arbitration Court, while at the same time they carefully retain the right to veto any award of the Court that does not suit them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has made an interjection or two which would suggest that he has been a consistent believer in the principle of the Arbitration Court for the settlement of grievances of public servants. If my memory does not serve me falsely, the honorable senator was associated with a Royal Commission that inquired into the grievances of a large section of the Public Service. May I ask him whether there was any expression of opinion from the public servants who came before him on that Commission, in favour of the reference of their grievances to the Arbitration Court? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator need not ask me whether I accuse him of inconsistency. It will be seen that it is unnecessary for me to do that, when I have finished. 1 point out that the Royal Commission that inquired into the grievances of the officials of the Post and Telegraph Department, the largest body of public servants we have, arrived at a decision that there was but one course which stood out pre-eminently as the best to adopt in the interests of the public and of the service. That course was not the course proposed by this Bill. To the extent to which the Senate indorses the proposal contained in this Bill, it will sign the death-knell of the proposal recommended by the Commission. I assume, without any reservation whatever, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie signed the report of the Postal Commission believing that, as the result of the exhaustive labours of the Commission, it recommended the best course in the interests of the public and of the service. But if he supports this Bill, he will be absolutely kicking his own report out of doors. He will be telling the public servants, whose hopes were brightened when they perused the report, that they have been fooled, and that it was never intended to give effect to it. I venture to say that one of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill is that the Government may be relieved of the necessity of giving effect to the report of the Royal Commission. They had to do one of two things, to adopt that report or to find some substitute for it. They had not the moral courage to say that they would absolutely reject the report, and they have consequently brought in here this spineless, ineffective, anaemic substitute. If this will supply a cover under which the Government and their supporters can shrink from the consequences of the reckless promises made when in Opposition, I have no doubt they will take full advantage of it. But if they think for a moment that the public servants will accept this Bill as an honest attempt to redeem the promises to which I have referred, they will find themselves woefully mistaken. The public servants watch too keenly what goes on in this Parliament. Although our honorable friends opposite made promises light-heartedly the public servants took them seriously, and they now ask for their redemption. </para>

That was not&#39; due solely to the change of Government&#34;, but to the fact that it was the Labour party which had offered so much, and the public servants naturally said, &#34; You have offered so much ; you are now in a position to redeem your pledges, why do you not do it.&#34; That was a very natural inquiry on their part. </para>

I do not think for a moment that this Bill will settle the great difficulty with which we are confronted. We may postpone its settlement. We may be able to hold the Public Service at arm&#39;s length until the Court is called upon, i? it is called upon, to adjudicate upon these matters. But if honorable senators opposite believe that a decision of the Arbitration Court will set right all that is wrong in the Public Service they are making a tremendous mistake. No provision of this kind would remedy the grievances of the public servants. What I believe we require is a. re-organization of the service from top to bottom. We require the adoption of the business methods which obtain in big enterprises outside, and which will enable the public to get a better return for their money without .unduly pressing upon any member of the Public Service from the lowest to the top rung of the ladder. That will not be brought about by_this Bill. If we had to consider merely a question of wages, although I should still have very little faith in it, there might be some justification for trying this last suggested expedient. Seeing that the service is troubled with grievances in one hundred-and-one forms, we cannot hope to bring about satisfaction iri it by this expedient for dealing with one out of the many grievances from which public servants suffer. Holding these views, there is but one course open to me in regard to this measure. I do not suppose that I shall address myself to its provisions at any length in Committee. I feel that the measure is ineffective, and that it will fail in its object. And I feel also that it is an attempt to induce this Parliament to shirk its responsibility. I am aware that Parliament cannot shirk its responsibility to the public servants. Although we may postpone it by this means for a few days, weeks, or months, sooner or later, like the ghost in the story, it will confront us at every turn unless we resolutely grapple with it. This measure does not grapple with it, but pushes it on one side. The time, however will come when we can no longer escape it, and must grapple with it. </para>

Before I deal with that, let me point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and those who sit with him, that when the question of the management of the Public Service first came up for consideration in the Senate it was contended that the service should be placed -under the control of a Public Service Commissioner, from whose decisions there is no appeal.

My colleagues of the Labour party in the Senate, on that occasion, in common with myself, took up the attitude that, by putting the Public Service into the hands of one man we should be shirking the responsibility which the electors of Australia had put on us. We have been fully justified in the position we took up, because there has been nothing but discontent in the service ever since. There can be nothing else expected so long as such a huge service is placed under the control of one man.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his party have always opposed compulsory arbitration, and have contended for voluntary arbitration instead of it. This Bill embodies the principle of voluntary arbitration, but nevertheless we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> opposing it. It is quite plain from the tricky tactics of the party opposite that no means of settling wages difficulties would meet with their approval. The Ministerial party recognises that these laws are merely experiments, and that it is only by trying them that we shall find out the best means of settling these difficult questions. We have never contended that this or that law would prove a final cure for all the evils&#34; of the wage system. We know very well that no law yet passed will do so. But we have said that each successive proposal that has been made has embodied the best means discovered up to the present time, and that therefore we are prepared to put it into practice. As far as the Public Service is concerned, we recognise that no satisfaction is to be obtained from putting the whole interest of the service into the hands of one man, no matter how able he may be. I have never said a word against the Public Service Commissioner personally. I believe him to be the best man we could find in the Commonwealth for the work that has been imposed upon him. But if he were even twice as able as he is, the task is too great for him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> is, and has been ever since he was appointed, in the position of an employer.

                        <para>- Yes. We believe in arbitration as a means of fixing wage conditions. That principle has been in our platform for many years. Now that we are in office we are living up to our principles, and surely there is nothing inconsistent in that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to the Labour party as having made lavish promises that they have not been able to redeem. I deny that we have ever made any promise, except that we would do justice to the public servants. We are now endeavouring to redeem that promise. We are no more pledged to the civil servants as such than are our political opponents. I say again that there is nothing inconsistent between this Bill and the report of the Postal Commission which I signed. I must admit, however, that I am sorry that we were not more explicit in our references to this question. There is nothing inconsistent between the staff committee proposed to be established by the Commission and the voluntary means of laying the case before the Arbitration Court .proposed by this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- He is quite at liberty to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> has said things about members of the Public Service who were examined by the Royal Commission that I think were entirely wrong. He has reflected upon certain gentlemen whom I know very much better than he does. Their ability is well known to me. I know that he has made a very great mistake in some cases, and probably, if the errors were pointed out to him., he would withdraw the remarks which he has made. He is, however, quite competent to speak for himself, and at liberty to hold his own opinion. I contend that Parliament is not at all fitted to deal with wages questions. This Parliament cannot summon witnesses and listen to both sides. It cannot sit and determine an issue as an Arbitration Court ran. Yet we are told that Parliament should take the responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- We are not giving up our responsibility, but we are passing it on to another tribunal. Finality, however, is retained by this Parliament, which will have the last say on every question with which it has power to deal. We are setting up a tribunal which will be properly constituted for examining witnesses and hearing both sides. Parliament is not fit to do work of that kind ; and, as a matter of fact, was not chosen to do it. We are elected to make laws, not to constitute ourselves an Arbitration Court. I think that this is the best and only possible solution of the whole question. The Labour party long ago adopted the principle of arbitration. We were elected to this Parliament to support that principle, which we put into practice at the first opportunity. There should, therefore, be nothing surprising in our support of this measure. Some Parliaments in the past have ignored the principles upon which they were supposed to be elected, but this Parliament is going to stand by the principles which it laid before the country. The principle of arbitration, having been a well-known plank of the Labour party for years, we are now endeavouring to put it into practice in connexion with the Public Service. </para>

                            based his attack on the allegation that the party of which I have the honour to be a member made certain promises on the hustings to do certain things if returned to power. I have had considerable experience on the hustings; but, throughout the electoral campaign, I never heard any member of this party make any particular promises to the Public Service. I deny that they did so. The only promise we made was that if returned to power, we would endeavour to put our platform into operation. That is the reason why this Bill is now before Parliament. We on this side are attempting to redeem a pledge, and I welcome the attempt to do so. I will give one or two reasons why I think .the Bill ought to be supported. The public servants of Australia are to-day cursed by the system of confidential reports. A public servant may be pursuing the even tenor of his way, but, without his knowledge, reports are being piled up in the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s office as to breaches of regulations, or alleged acts of misconduct, without the knowledge of the officer. All of a sudden, like a bolt from the blue, the Commissioner comes down upon him. What is his remedy ? All that he can do is to appeal from Caesar to Caesar, because the representative of the Commissioner in the State where the officer works is the principal member of the Appeal Board, and adjudicates on the very decision that he himself has given.

                        <para>- He can appeal as a member of his organization. The tendency in Australia to-day is for all people, whether they are public servants or not, to organize. During the past two years, we have been establishing records in the formation of organizations. These officers, through their organizations, would have a right to appeal to the Court, which will hear evidence on both sides, free from the dictation of any representative of the Commissioner. The Judge would be able to demand those secret files which very often the public servant does not get an opportunity to see when he is put upon his defence. I candidly admit, however, that there are some weak points in the Bill. Time will find out what they are. It is  a  piece of experimental legislation. But  a  fair trial ought to be given to it. It marks a step in the right direction. The Leader of the Opposition fastened his criticism upon clause 15 of the Bill, which gives this Parliament power to review any decision of the Court in the event of that decision contravening any law of the Commonwealth. I recollect that only a little while ago honorable senators opposite raised a great storm of indignation because the Government attempted to take power away from Parliament. Now, when it is proposed to retain to this Parliament some tittle of power, their protests are equally loud. On this occasion, therefore, as upon others, they are discharging their duties as Oppositionists. A great deal of emphasis has been laid upon the fact that civil servants importune members of Parliament. Personally, I think that &#34;importune&#34; is the wrong word to use. I say that every public servant should have the right at any time to approach his representative in the National or a State Parliament. At present he has riot the right to approach members of Parliament freely. He must do so under cover. Should it be known that he is doing so, he is liable to a penalty for a breach of the Public Service Act. But whilst our public servants do not enjoy the right to freely und unreservedly approach members of Parliament with their grievances, the Public Service Commissioner is at liberty to approach Parliament at any time.  His  reply to certain witnesses who gave evidence before the Postal Commission after their lips had been, closed, is conclusive testimony of this. At that time they dared not approach Parliament, even by circular, for fear of being charged with a breach of the regulations. I have been a member of this Parliament for four and a-half years, and during that period civil servants have met me and made representations to me. I have welcomed those representations because they came from citizens of Australia. As regards the 4,000 public servants who have petitioned Parliament not to pass this Bill. I say that they have merely exercised what was their undoubted light. But, because they are opposed to the Bill, it does not follow that the measure is wrong. Time and again when the Tariff was under consideration, miles of petitions were presented against certain of its provisions. But the Tariff, nevertheless, became law. It is for this Parliament to determine whether the Bill under consideration will inflict injustice upon any citizen of Australia. Personalty, I consider that it will give our public servants an opportunity to free themselves from any injustice under which they may be labouring to-day. In conclusion, I merely wish to add that the present Government have done more to relieve our civil servants of their grievances than has any other Government which has held office in Australia. But, notwithstanding that circumstance, I say that our Public Service is too vast a concern for any one man to control. Consequently, I desire to relieve the Public Service Commissioner of some of his powers without parting with any of our own. This Bill provides a better means of enabling civil servants to obtain justice than exists to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - In directing attention to this Bill, I wish to assign one or two reasons why I intend to support it. Like other honorable senators, I had the privilege of hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> indulge in the mild heroics to which he has treated this Chamber. He endeavoured to convey the impression that his opposition to the measure is really the result of the absolute strangeness of the principles which are embodied in it. It is perfectly true that up to the present time there has never been a possibility of our public servants obtaining access to the Arbitration Court. But the necessity for giving them that access has always been apparent. Yet at no time previously have we attempted to give them the advantage which is enjoyed by every other man in the community. Now I say, without hesitation, that if there be one institution which is incapable of dealing with the grievances of our public servants, either from the stand-point of their conditions of employment or of the rates of wages which are paid to them, that institution is this Parliamnt. Its incompetence in this connexion is so apparent that, to my mind, it is beyond argument. If equity and fair play are to be meted out to our public servants, obviously it must be through some tribunal which can with calmness and deliberation review every circumstance brought under its notice, and which can then pronounce its judgment. Can such a judgment be obtained upon the floor of this Chamber? I go further, and say, without any desire to depreciate the ability of the Public Service Commissioner, that he is incapable of comprehending either the conditions of employment,  or the adequacy of remuneration, of our public servants. He may be highly competent to deal with the administration of particular branches of the service, indeed, he may be quite fit to deal with the administration of two or three Departments; but when we come to consider the magnitude of our Public Service,  I  refuse .to believe that there is a man in the Commonwealth who is capable of understanding and of dealing justly with its members, throughout all its ramifications. Therefore, the public servants should have every facility or right which is given to any other citizen. I am sure that  1  voice the feelings of a very large majority of the public servants when I say that they are all manly enough to recognise that that is all which they ought to seek ; and the Bill, if I understand it rightly, aims at nothing more. It says, &#34; You shall no longer be compelled to bear the stigma of secret reports,&#34; as indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> That those reports are made, the Commissioner cannot deny. He knows that he does receive secret reports ; that they are made in such circumstances that the public servants concerned have no knowledge of the fact; and, therefore, are not in a. position to defend themselves. Surely the Public Service should not, any more than any other service, be a secret society, nor should any opportunities be taken to injure men and to prevent them, on many occasions, from obtaining promotion to positions to which they have a right to expect to rise, and also from receiving the whole of the emoluments which they ought at all times to receive, merely because a report had been presented, to the Commissioner, probably three years before, that they had done some things with which they had never been made acquainted. That sort of thing has been going on, and consequently public servants have been suffering. Taking the position assumed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I do not think that even Parliament would be capable of doing justice to situations arising out of such administrative methods. The only justice which it could do would be to sack the Commissioner for having at any moment allowed himself to be made a creature of by receiving reports of that character. I feel sure that the Judge of the Arbitration Court will place a true value on such reports, as well as upon the conduct of the men who were responsible for the presentation of them. I believe that in the Arbitration Court the Public Service may hope for justice and equity, and that is all they should, I think, ever ask for. Whilst we must recognise that the servants of the Commonwealth have a perfect right to justice in every sense, we have also to realize that the interest of the public must be considered; and that being so, I hold that the Arbitration Court is the most likely medium by which the interest of the servants and of the public will be faithfully recognised.  1  fail to see how it could ever be recognised by a Commissioner. I am aware that certain recommendations have been made by, or through, a certain process, which may have, to some extent, ameliorated the conditions of the employe&#39;s. But the tests which are being applied to show whether men are competent or not - tests which I cannot discuss on this occasion - will be given their true value when the case for the Public Service is placed before the Arbitration Court; and on the weight of that evidence, a great many of their grievances will, I feel sure, be remedied. The Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to make great capital out of the fact that, never under the Commonwealth has there been so much discontent in the ranks of the Public Service as there is at the present moment. I am not prepared to accept his statement as regards the discontent ; . but I am prepared to say that never before has there been a time in the history of the Commonwealth when the public servants felt themselves so free and untrammelled to voice their feelings as they do at the present moment, buoyed with the hope that there is a chance of getting immediate redress. It is because of that fact that we hear so much of the Public Service to-day. Probably, if the public servants of four or five years ago had said half so much publicly as they say to-day, very many of them would have been discharged. It is a very great pleasure to me to know that our employe&#39;s feel so free and unfettered as to be able to ventilate their grievances in no uncertain terms. I believe that the proper course is to give to them all the facilities for getting redress which are given to any other service in the kingdom, and nothing more. </para>

The honorable senator has not quoted a single case to prove the contention which he attempted to set up.

Does he realize that under its provision no Judge of the Arbitration Court will be able to deal with individual cases, and that his duty will be merely to determine the rates of wages for classes and for sections, not for individuals. The Judge may have the right to determine the conditions in which men shall labour, but he will have no power to take into consideration and deal with individual grievances. If there are individual grievances, such as the honorable senator has indicated, they should be dealt with in an entirely different way. How could a Judge take into consideration the fact that

Where an  Act  of Parliament, such as our Public  Service  Act, has stated that there  shall  be certain rates of pay - a maximum and a minimum - for particular classes of public servants, and it is not proposed to repeal that Act, either directly  or indirectly,  is the Judge of the Arbitration Court going to say to Parliament &#34;  You  have dealt with this matter entirely  by  your Statute. Instead of the rate of pay  for  a particular class ranging from  &#163;150  to  &#163;250,  it ought to range from&#163;200 to

The Court may, where it thinks it proper to do so, make an award which, in the opinion of the  President  of the Court, is not, or may not be, in accord with a law or regulation of the Commonwealth relating to the salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms or conditions of service or employment of employees ; but in that case the  President  shall send to the Prime Minister, and to the Attorney-General, with the certified copy of the award, a statement of the laws or regulations of the Commonwealth with which, in his opinion, it is not, or may not be, in accord. (3.) The Prime Minister shall, within fourteen days after its receipt, if the Parliament is then sitting, or if not then within fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament, cause  the award, and the statement (if any)  of  the  President,  to be laid before both Houses of  the Parliament.  (4.)  If, before the award is laid before the Parliament, the Attorney-General advises the  Prime  Minister that in his opinion the award  is  not in accord with any law or regulation of the Commonwealth referred to in the opinion,  the  Prime Minister shall cause the opinion to  be  laid, together with the award, before both Houses of the Parliament. (5.) If, in the case of an award accompanied  by  such a statement of the  President,  or opinion of  the Attorney-General, as is above referred  to,  either House of the Parliament, within thirty  days  after the award with the statement or  opinion  has been laid before both Houses, passes  a  resolution disapproving the award, the award shall not come into operation. </para>

                <para>So that is what the honorable senator is building his case on. I notice that the expression &#34; but subject to the Constitution &#39; &#39; is used. The Constitution provides that Parliament shall speak by its Statutes. Under the Constitution, we can repeal our Acts only by the way in which we pass them. If we could do otherwise, what an absurd position should we not be. placed in! If that were possible, the Senate, by a resolution, and without going through the form of an Act of Parliament, might say, &#34; We will not have this Act any longer in force,&#34; and the House of Representatives would be powerless. In the same way, the House of Representatives might pass a similar motion, and the Senate would be powerless. Do not honorable senators see the ridiculous position in which their arguments would place them? Where would be the safety of the community under such a proposal ? Are there members of the Senate who would take advantage of a provision of that character to destroy an Act of the Parliament arrived at by deliberation of both Houses? </para>

                        <para>- No; the honorable senator is not dealing with the Bill as it is. A resolution of either House would annul a decision of the Arbitration Court, and it can only be brought into operation if both Houses of the Parliament refrain from moving any resolution to annul it. If the honorable senator will put the matter in that way, he will be correct. </para>

                        <para>.- Well, I will put it in that way, and I ask whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> knows of any Government that has ever held office in any British-speaking community that would be prepared to permit an award or report by a Court to override an Act of Parliament. I say that the Government that would be prepared to do that would be recreant to their trust. It is the duty of the Government to administer the law as passed by the Parliament of the country. I have already said that the Judge of the Arbitration Court will be unable to deal with individual cases. He must take the service <inline font-style="italic">in globo,</inline> and decide the wages to be paid for particular services, and the conditions under which they shall be rendered. If, in the administration of a Department, an injustice such as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> were perpetrated, quite another tribunal would have to deal with the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The only difference in this case is that the testimony given at the inquiry would be on oath before the Arbitration Court. If honorable senators were to contend that the position of the public servants would be strengthened by the appointment of three Commissioners instead of one, I should not object to such a contention. I quite recognise the unsatisfactory nature of an appeal, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said, from Caesar to Caesar. That could be avoided by having these inquiries conducted by three Commissioners. I remind honorable senators, however, that, notwithstanding all that may be said of the independence of the position of the Public Service Commissioner, he is still the servant of Parliament, and in a much more strict sense than the Judge of the Arbitration Court could or ought to be. Under this Bill, it is proposed to call upon the Judge of the Arbitration Court to make awards. I would ask honorable senators how awards of the Court have already been dealt with. They have been treated by many people with contempt when they have not been in accord with their own views. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting what has frequently occurred. I need only refer to what happened recently in Sydney, when a certain section of employes in direct opposition, I admit, to the advice of their own executive, insisted upon a course of action entirely contrary to that which they had agreed to take. Suppose that the Judge of the Arbitration Court makes an award, strictly in accordance with the law, and sends his report to this Parliament, and suppose that, instead of grading officers who had been in the service for five years at&#163;150a year, he considered that the service they rendered was worth&#163;175 a year, and the award would still keep them within the maximum of their class. Then, suppose that Parliament would not consent to the award. What would be the position? We should have invoked the Judge of the Arbitration Court to deal with the matter, and, because we did not agree with his decision, we should decline to give effect to it. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament sends a matter to the Court, and, because the decision does not accord with the views of the Government, or the party behind them, they bring their political power to bear, and deal with the  President  of the Arbitration Court as if he were an ordinary servant of Parliament, instead of the representative of an independent tribunal. If the Judge of the Arbitration Court were to say that the payment to be made to officers of a particular class in the service should be less than they are at present receiving, Parliament probably would not accept that; but if we are going to send these cases to the Arbitration Court, we should be prepared to accept the decisions of the Court when they are within the provisions of the Statute. If we think that our public servants are not properly paid, or properly graded, we should alter their condition by Statute. When the Civil Service Act was introduced into the Parliament of New South Wales many years before the establishment of the Commonwealth, a Civil Service Board was appointed to deal with the grievances of public servants, because it was said, amongst other things, that members of Parliament were being constantly importuned in connexion with individual cases. </para>

                        <para>- He has that right. But the question was asked, &#34; Why should public servants be compelled to go to members of Parliament to secure justice?&#34; A Civil Service Board- was appointed under the Act to which I have referred, and it was intended that it should be free from political influence. It was considered that the adoption of that course would be in the best interests of the Public Service, members of Parliament, and the country. If we appoint a special body to deal with all these matters, why should it be necessary, or desirable, that a member of Parliament should be invoked, in order to bring the power of his political position to bear upon a Public Service Commissioner in dealing with the grievance of a particular public servant ? </para>

I think that the Government are making a mistake in taking this matter up. in the way they are doing. If grievances exist there are more efficient ways of dealing with them, methods more consonant with the principles of government, than are contained in this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, although a member of the Postal Commission, has announced that he will support the Bill. Of course, every Labour man, every member of the Caucus, is going to vote for it. </para>

                        <para>.- Exactly ; but if the honorable senator believed that this was the best method of dealing with public servants&#39; grievances, why did he not mention it in the minority report ? Instead of that, with the true gallantry that has always distinguished him, he occupied that report with taking up the cudgels on behalf of female members of the Public Service. Honorable senators will find that, though this Bill involves a strange departure from the practice hitherto pursued by Parliament, it will not be so effective as a remedy as some profess to believe. It places the question &#39; in a really absurd position. If the contention is that, by resolution, the Court may as it sees fit override Statute law, unless this Parliament chooses to prevent it, it will be a most novel procedure. </para>

When my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> occupies the position that Ministers do at present, it will be time for him to indicate on behalf of his Government what remedies they suggest. I am speaking simply on my own behalf. I have indicated that I shall be prepared to see three Commissioners appointed to control the Public Service. I am prepared to assist in bringing about such a reform, but I am not prepared to assist honorable senators opposite in entirely abrogating the rights of Parliament and handing them over to a Judge. I believe that such a method would be wholly unsatisfactory. I shall not trouble honorable senators very much in Committee concerning this Bill, nor will I do anything to obstruct <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> will of the majority. At some future time Parliament may have an opportunity of reviewing a good deal of the wildcat legislation that has been enacted by this Parliament. When that time comes, the country will be afforded an opportunity of breathing and being relieved from the oppression from which it is suffering in consequence of the adoption of all sorts of novel expedients to which the party now in power have not given the consideration that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> public interest demanded. </para>

                        <para>- There is danger ahead of which the honorable senator need not remind me; but we need not. think of that at present. There are certain specific reasons why I favour this measure. We may divide the Public Service into three classes. First, there is the professional class, which we need not trouble about in considering a Bill of this description. Secondly, there is the clerical class. I have no hesitation in saying that I know of no clerical service in any part of the world that enjoys better conditions than does the clerical service under the </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth. These conditions have prevailed, not only under the present Ministry, but under previous Governments. Some members of the service may have grievances against the Commissioner, but they are generally of a temporary character, and not serious in their nature. No one need complain about them. But when we come to the third section, the General Division, I am compelled to say that, though I have always believed in having a Public Service Commissioner, and though I believe such an officer to be more necessary under this measure than he was before at any time, I do nevertheless feel certain, although I am not prepared to allege deliberate motives, that the Public Service Commissioner, as an individual, apart from his office, has absolutely failed even to grasp the ordinary principles that should be applied to the work of labourers and artisans. </para>

                        <para>- The Commissioner has his faults, but I believe him to be an exceedingly capable officer. I want him to be retained. I wish to help him ; but, nevertheless, I venture to say that there is not a trade whose members are employed in the Public Service, in which, if it were not for the generosity of the trade unions, and for the stretching of their rules, there would not be trouble. That consideration applies to nearly every branch of the General Division. </para>

                        <para>- The trade unions do. If the Commissioner wants a painter, instead of engaging a man at the ordinary rate that prevails in his trade, the Commissioner makes him commence at  &#163;12  per year less, and gives him two annual increments. I admit that the man gets three weeks&#39; holiday in the year. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that artisans employed under the Public Service Commissioner are better off in that respect than outside employes. But, nevertheless, were it not that the unions have waived claims in the case of men entering the Public Service - were it not that they have not insisted on the observance of the rates which are paid for outside labour - it would be impossible for workmen to enter the Federal Service without leaving the unions to which they belong. I believe that all honorable senators are agreed on the principle that the National Government should be a model employer. I do not mean that it should throw away money needlessly, or conduct its affairs uneconomically. But it should be a model employer of labour. When it employs a tradesman he should not receive one single copper less than is paid to a similar workman outside the service. I consider that the Public Service Commissioner has failed to grasp that principle as far as the General Division is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking from the point of view of one who has a great deal of sympathy with the Commissioner. I recognise the largeness of the task that he has had before him. I thoroughly understand the magnitude of his work. This Bill also will be principally used by the General Division. I do not believe for one moment that the Clerical Division will make use of it. They do not require it. Therefore, they will simply go on as they are doing at present, under the Public Service Commissioner. This Bill does not involve any interference with the present position so far as they are concerned. </para>

It is impossible to hear him make a speech, whether one agrees or disagrees with him, without admiring the cleverness with which he puts his case. I greatly admire the honorable senator&#39;s ability. I concede him what he is entitled to in that respect. He said that we never heard of strikes in the Public Service until the present Government came into office. All the talk of striking in the service, however, has been on account of conditions of labour fixed by those Governments which preceded the present Ministry, and not on account of conditions fixed by the Labour Government. Therefore, these threats to strike were a condemnation of preceding Governments. The present Government have attempted to remove grievances. </para>

                        <para>- It may ; but does the honorable senator mean., to tell me that he lacks the courage to say &#34; No more&#34; when he believes that members of the Public Service are getting what we believe to be a fair thing? I believe that the great majority of the members of this Parliament have the courage to say &#34; Enough&#34; when they believe that officers are being fairly treated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that the Government had introduced this Bil&#93; because they wanted time to breathe. In what way does the Bill secure to the Government additional time to breathe? The Government have to find the money to enable any award of the Court to be complied with if that award has the effect of increasing the wages payable to our public servants. But the honorable senator might have added that the present Government, instead of wanting time to breathe, have permitted the public servants of the Commonwealth to breathe as free men for the first time in the history of this country. What Government was it that issued regulations according freedom to the civil servants of Australia? Can any honorable senator point me to a single instance in which a public servant has abused that freedom? Yet it was predicted that all sorts of evils would flow from those regulations. I admit that there is discontent in the Public Service to-day, but that discontent is not greater than it was previously. The truth is, that it finds a more ready expression to-day because the &#34;gag&#34; has been removed. In the past our public servants were not satisfied with their conditions, but they dared not voice their dissatisfaction. </para>

Simply because they remember -the old days, when neither the body nor the soul of the average civil servant belonged to him. </para>

                        <para>- If Queensland enjoyed better conditions, I congratulate the honorable senator upon the fact. But I know that in Victoria, because public servants asked for fair conditions of labour, and opposed percentage reductions of their salaries, they were disfranchised and created a special class, distinct from the ordinary body of citizens. Realizing that the same class of politicians have hitherto been in power in the Commonwealth, our public servants have feared a similar visitation. </para>

                        <para>- At all events, it is there. A great deal has been said about the power of Parliament to veto an award. But the officers of the General Division have no fear of that. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can show me a way in which to make the decision of the Arbitration Court final, I shall be found supporting him. I believe that it ought to be final. But, although Parliament has the power to veto any award, I believe, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, any award will be final. Is the veto something which the workers have need to fear? Time after time, in connexion with Wages Board decisions in Victoria, not Parliament, but a Liberal politician, has exercised the power of veto. </para>

                        <para>- I supported that strike in opposition to an award which I did not consider fair, and I would do the same thing to-morrow. I believe that this Bill contains the most scientific proposal for remedying the grievances of public servants which has yet been submitted to Parliament. It will not remedy all their grievances, but it will remedy nine-tenths of them. In nearly all cases in which bad feeling has been engendered amongst the members of the Public Service, that feeling can be traced to a dispute in regard to wages. Some officer has failed to do his duty by recommending, perhaps, the payment of an increment. As a result a public servant has got his senior officer &#39; &#39; set, &#39; &#39; to use a colloquialism. Then, because the Public Service Commissioner has failed to recommend an increment, a &#34;set&#34; has been made against him. All these grievances will disappear under this Bill, because public servants will feel that when they appeal to the Arbitration Court they will have a full opportunity of ventilating them. I believe that the Public Service Commissioner should appear before the Court in the same way as any private employer. All over Australia we have practically denied the individual employer the right to fix the rate of wages which shall be paid in any industry. Why should not the Public Service Commissioner occupy the position of the common employer? </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable senator does not want to go to the Court himself. At any rate, I do not. Under this Bill, if a body of public servants believe that they are labouring under an injustice, they will make a claim to the Public Service Commissioner. If that officer believes the claim to be fair,- he will either grant it or a conference will be arranged, and a compromise arrived at. If the men are satisfied, they will not invoke the aid of the Arbitration Court ; but if they are not satisfied, they will have&#39; the right of appeal to that Court, just as has any other worker in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that the Bill is any good. The best title for it would be &#34; A Bill for an Act to enable some members of Parliament to shirk their responsibility.&#34; I have not observed that our public servants anywhere arc anxious for this measure, but I did see a petition which was presented to this Parliament, and which was signed by  4,000  of them, in opposition to it. It has been said that it is impossible for the Public Service Commissioner, to satisfy the members, of the Public Service generally. If that be so, why did not the Government take the first step, towards bringing about a better state of affairs by adopting the recommendation of the Postal Commission and appointing a board composed of practical men who are acquainted with the service and with all its conditions? Such a step would be more likely to prove successful than will any attempt to transfer power from the Public Service Commissioner to the  President  of the Arbitration Court. The latter is not more likely to give satisfaction to the service generally than is the former. But if our public servants could appeal to a board of practical men, they might get something better - a great deal better - than they will get under this Bill. </para>

                <para class="block">The measure will simply give them a right to one more appeal. They will be able to appeal from the Commissioner to the Arbitration Court. That tribunal can refer any case to a Judge of a State Court or to a stipendiary magistrate for hearing and determination. If the claimants be not satisfied with that determination they will have a right of appeal once more to the Arbitration Court, so that they will simply get another appeal, because the Bill provides &#34; that an appeal from the award shall lie to the Court at the instance of a claimant organization or of the Public Service Commissioner, or of the Minister of a Department affected by the award.&#34; As the hour is late, sir, and the Minister is agreeable, I ask permission to continue my remarks to-morrow. </para>
