I was touching on the question of depriving respectable mothers of their votes yesterday when an unfortunate disruption took place. 1 had shown that, according to the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> even after he had watered them down as much as possible, there were still some thousands to be considered. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and we were given what was believed to be the actual minimum, and even at that it was shown that there were several thousand women, at any rate, who would be deprived of an opportunity of voting. I want it to be known that the Ministry and the Labour party deliberately intend to take away from these people, as well as from those who are old, infirm, and unable to get to the polling booth, the opportunity of voting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> made an extraordinary statement with regard to an abuse of the postal voting system which he alleged occurred in Tasmania. He said that in one constituency  300  postal ballot-papers - practically one-half the number of postal ballot-papers issued - had been sent to one address, where they were evidently manipulated, because they were signed and sent in without the persons who had applied for them receiving them. lj for one, cannot understand how that could be possible. Under the Act it was the duty of the Returning Officer to take the postal ballot-papers and to compare the signatures on the certificates with the signatures on the application. If he did not make that comparison to satisfy himself as to the validity of the postal votes, he altogether neglected his duty. If the Returning Officer did make a comparison such a fraud as is alleged would have been detected, because no man could copy the signatures of  300  persons with such accuracy that the imitations would pass when compared with the genuine signatures. Such a thing would be utterly impossible. It is laid down in section  119  of the Act that the Returning Officer -  -shall compare the signature of the elector on each postal vote certificate with the signature qf Uie same elector on the application for the certificate, and shall allow the scrutineers to inspect both signatures. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>The Returning Officer has not only to compare the signatures himself, but he has to hand them over to the scrutineers so that they may inspect them. If  300  postal ballot-papers were manipulated in the way alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> I fail to see how it was that the Returning Officer, if he did his duty, did not detect the fraud. It is also provided that the Returning Officer -  if he is not satisfied that the signature on the certificate is that of the elector who signed the application for the certificate, and that the signature purports to be witnessed by an authorized witness shall disallow the ballot-paper without opening it or separating it from the certificate; but if he is so satisfied he shall accept the ballot-paper for further scrutiny. </para>
                <para class="block">If the Returning Officer and the scrutineers at one polling place passed  300  postal bal. lot-papers on which the signatures were forged they were not doing their duty, and they ought to have been punished in the way the Act provides. It is put forward as a reason for abolishing voting by post that there have been some abuses. No matter what system is adopted, it will be abused by some people, and to abolish the facilities for people to vote by post because of a supposed fraud is doing an injustice to the people who wish to vote by post. I have shown that if the provisions of the Act were properly carried out fraud would be reduced to a minimum. We are now asked to cast the whole voting by post system on one side. It is said that there is to be constituted a more comprehensive system of absent voting. Under the system of absent voting proposed there are not the same safeguards as are provided in the Act with regard to postal voting. The Government say they are going to. provide these safeguards by regulation. The safeguards in connexion with absent. voting should be provided in the Bill as are the safeguards in connexion with postal voting in the Act. Matters of such importance should not be left to regulation. All the provisions against fraud should be set out in the measure itself, and the regulations should simply deal with details. People who are unable to attend any polling booth are to be deprived of the opportunity of voting, and the Ministry are going to allow people who are away from the division in which they reside to vote at any polling place in the Commonwealth. Safeguards should be provided in the Bill in connexion with absent voting similar to those which are provided at present with regard to voting by post, so that the opportunities of fraud may be reduced to a minimum. </para>

                    <para>.  - After the division that was taken on the amendment proposed on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, it seems to be hopeless to expect the Government to reconsider the step which they are inviting Parliament to take, of abolishing voting by post. At the same time, I do not think we ought to allow that step to be taken without registering a protest. In addressing myself to the amendment proposed on the motion for the second reading - an amendment designed to emphasize the fact that what we should seek in an amendment of the electoral law is to extend, rather than to curtail, facilities for voting - I referred to the fact that there were 29,000 odd votes cast by post at the last general election, and in making reference to that number, I said that they represent, in strength, practically a constituency . </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend may rest assured that I shall not fail to deal with that aspect of the matter before I finish. In looking through the figures in connexion with the last general election, I find that in New South Wales the largest number of votes was recorded in Dalley, where 26,143 votes were cast, and that the smallest vote was in Cowper, where 13,109 votes were cast. In Victoria, the largest vote polled was in the electorate of Bourke, where 30,959 votes were recorded, and the smallest poll was in Wimmera, where 17,774 votes were re corded. In Queensland, the largest vote was in Herbert, where 23,184 votes were recorded, and the smallest in Kennedy, where 14,076 votes were cast. In South Australia, the largest and the smallest votes respectively were Wakefield, 18,342 ; and Adelaide, 15,363. In Western Australia, Swan topped the list with 25,302 votes, while Coolgardie is at the bottom with 13,834 votes. In Tasmania, in the Denison electorate, 12,701 votes were recorded, and in, Wilmot 9,966 votes were recorded. Taking the constituencies polling the greatest number of votes in each of the six States, we find that Bourke, where 30,959 votes were cast, was the only electorate in the Commonwealth which polled as many votes as were recorded by post. We find that the constituency recording the greatest number of votes in Tasmania - Denison, with 12,701 votes - did not poll 50 per cent, of the votes recorded by post. The Honorary Minister has just reminded me, although I did not need reminding of it, that not all of the 29,000 odd postal voters were persons who necessarily depended upon postal voting to register their votes ; that they were not all persons who might not have voted otherwise, and that, therefore, they were not all persons who would be disfranchised by the abolition of postal voting. I have not forgotten that. But let my honorable friend not forget that those 29,000 odd electors did not represent the whole of the people who might have voted, and voted only by utilizing the postal voting system. They did not represent the large number of people for whom the then existing facilities were not sufficient. There were many others who were unable to register their votes, and many who would have been unable to do so no matter how easy the conditions or how great the facilities. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend&#39;s recollection must be very meagre. When I was a Minister I did introduce a measure which extended the facilities and multiplied the opportunities for postal voting, at the same time surrounding those opportunities with safeguards. We were then taking a step in the right direction - a step forward. Now we are asked to take a step backward - to get out of line with ourselves, out of line with our States, out of line with every institution of a representative character in the Commonwealth.

                <para class="block">I  may give an illustration. I said last evening, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was speaking, that, notwithstanding the fact that he asserted that this system of postal voting was the creation of the Labour party, it had actually been in existence in Tasmania before the Commonwealth came into being. We used the system of postal voting in connexion with the referenda on the Federal Constitution in 1899 and 1900. The system was applicable to the first Tasmanian Federal elections. In connexion with the Tasmanian University, the system of postal voting is used in regard to the election of members of the Council by members of the Senate. I, as a member of the Senate of the University, receive a postal ballot-paper  in  connexion with each such election. That is an example apart altogether from political elections. So successful has the system been in Tasmania, that it has been extended to institutions removed from ordinary politics. In making reference to the figures relating to electorates, I have pointed out that the largest votes at the last election ranged from 30,959 in Bourke, Victoria, down to 12,701 in Denison, Tasmania. The smallest polls ranged from j 7,774 in Wimmera, Victoria, to 9,966 in Wilmot, Tasmania. Those figures, of course, do not represent the voting strength of the constituencies. The enormous vote given in Bourke represents only 75.40 per cent, of the total number of electors on the Bourke roll. In Wimmera the vote represents 57.31 of the voting strength of the constituency.  In  all those instances the number of votes represents only a percentage of the full strength of the roll. I have a right to assume, therefore, that the 59,000 odd votes recorded under the postal system represented only a proportion of the persons who were eligible to vote under that system. So that when I stated that we were practically disfranchising one whole constituency, I erred well within the mark. 1 should have been more correct had 1 said that we were  in  effect disfranchising the strength of two constituencies. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not neglect to deal with that point. Of the 29,000 odd voters, it may rightly be said that a certain proportion would have been able to vote at the ballot-box if they had &#171;ot been permitted to vote by post. What that proportion is I am not prepared to say. I doubt whether the Minister in charge of the Bill, or any other honorable senator, would hazard a conjecture. But, putting aside altogether the proportion who would have been able to vote otherwise had the postal voting system, not been in existence,. I venture to say that the remainder of the 29,000 represents only a proportion of the persons who would have been disfranchised if there had been no postal voting system in existence. I instanced Herbert as the constituency which recorded the largest number of votes in Queensland, and Kennedy as the lowest. Herbert&#39;s record was 23,184 votes, and Kennedy&#39;s 14,076. By a singular coincidence, in each of those cases, the total vote polled represented 61.53 of the voting strength of the constituency. It will therefore be seen that 14,076 represents 61 per cent, of the total voting strength of the Kennedy constituency. Consequently the total voting strength of Kennedy does not equal the total vote recorded under the postal voting system. . In Wakefield, the top constituency, in South Australia, and in Adelaide, the lowest in the State, the percentages were respectively 58.91 and 53.17. In Western Australia, Swan polled 64.26, and Coolgardie 55.74. In Tasmania, Denison polled 64.57 per cent.., and Wilmot 55.92. We have to reckon in those percentages the number of postal votes cast. We also have to remember that a large proportion of those votes were brought to the poll by excitement and by all the influences that operate in connexion with elections. Is it not reasonable to assume therefore that the 20,000 votes by post represented a like proportion of- the eligible persons who might have voted under the postal voting system? Therefore I say again that I am well within the mark when I assert that this proposal of the Government will disfranchise the equivalent of one constituency in the Commonwealth. Indeed, I make bold to say that I should be nearer the mark if I were to assert that the abolition of the postal voting system will disfranchise the equivalent of two constituencies. Now I will come to the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has . suggested. He asks me whether it is not my view that a proportion of the 29,000 persons who voted by post cast their votes illegitimately.  1  am not in a position to answer the question. Statements have been made here during the course pf the debate which make me inclined to say that nobody should.; be reckless enough to assert that th.e whole of. the votes were cast legitimately. </para>

                        <para>- I should not. What I think we are entitled to know is this : What proportion of those  29,000  votes were cast illegally, illicitly, and wrongly ? Has that proportion been ascertained by a calculation, or have the officials any ground for making an assumption ? We have no information whatever on the point. We simply have generalizations. Before we take the step of disfranchising thousands of electors it is essential that we should know that the evil is so great that by no less drastic means can it possibly be prevented. These are the most drastic means that could be taken to remove the alleged evil whose existence we have evidence of only in vague generalizations, and the extent of which no one has even attempted to estimate. In connexion with the amendment to which I referred just now in response to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> I would point out that in  1906  an election was held under the Electoral Act of  1902,  as amended by the Act of  1905.  As I have said already, the Act of  1905  not merely recognised the postal voting system, established under the Act of  1902  and once previously used in  1903,  but it extended the facilities for the use of that system by adding to the list of persons eligible to witness applications for postal voting papers. In every way the members of the Senate and of another place not only recognised but extended the operation of the principle. In  1906  a general election was held. After that election a number of prosecutions took place under the authority of the Minister for various alleged electoral offences, and not only offences charged in connexion with voting by post. I have some idea, but I should like to know certainly, what was the number of the alleged offences in connexion with which it was thought desirable that prosecutions should be instituted at that time. I have very vivid personal recollections of the time. A number of complaints of alleged offences against the Electoral Act in various particulars were submitted to the Department from the several States. I can say unhesitatingly that in every instance the data supplied was submitted to the Crown Law authorities of the Commonwealth, and in no circumstances, no matter who the person was, or to what party he or she belonged, was any quarter given. Whenever there was the slightest chance of successfully maintaining a prosecution, a prosecution was ordered. I have in mind one particular instance... The case was submitted to the Department, and brought under my notice as Minister of Home Affairs charged with the administration of the Electoral . Act. I asked that further inquiries should be made, and&#39; further information was forwarded. At this stage representations were made that it would be a harsh thing to prosecute, and that no Bench could possibly find the prospective defendant guilty. The papers were sent on to the Crown Law Department for advice. While advising that a technical prosecution lay, the Crown Law Department expressed some doubt as to the ultimate success of a prosecution if it were instituted. The papers came back to me, and believing that if there was any doubt at all I should regard the public interest as of more importance than, in that particular instance, a private and temporary misfortune, arising from a prosecution, I ordered the prosecution. Here again I was confronted with difficulty. When the papers went on to the Crown Law Department so that the necessary steps might be taken to prosecute for the alleged offence, it was found that in the centre of population where the prosecution was to lie there was not a single member of the legal profession who would consent to represent the Commonwealth in the matter. The person against whom the offence was alleged was very popular and highly respected.  Her  case seemed at the first blush to be one of extreme hardship. The offence charged against her was that she had loitered in a polling booth after having been requested by a police officer, acting under instructions from some one in authority, to remove from it. She refrained from moving out of the polling booth as she was bound to do under the law. It was pointed out, and subsequently abundantly proved, that she was very deaf. But these were matters, not for the Minister, but for a Court to settle. When we got to the stage of prosecution every legal gentleman in the centre of population declined the brief. I instructed the Crown Law authorities to retain counsel in Melbourne to go forward to the centre of population in question and prosecute. The prosecution took place, and it was successful. Whatever may have been the merits or demerits of the case the lady in question, prominent and popular though she was, and afflicted, as  1  have said, was found guilty and penalized to the extent of a&#163;5fine,and about the same amount in costs. If there were these flagrant violations of the law in regard to postal voting in connexion with the 1909 elections and the referenda in 1910, where are the prosecutions? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> last night made reference to what might be called a wholesale list of breaches of the provision of the Act at the Denison election. That was in 1906. I had charge of the Department just after that election, and was associated with the large number of prosecutions. I had no recollection, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> was speaking, of ever having heard of the cases to which he referred. </para>

                        <para>- I had been saying, in the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> that numbers of alleged breaches of the Act in various particulars were reported, and in every instance in which there was the slightest ground for believing that a prosecution would be successful it was ordered. I fail to see that there can have been much real cause for complaint in respect of the alleged breaches of the Act of which we have heard in vague generalizations in the course of this debate, unless some evidence of them can be supplied in the shape of action taken by the Department. The Electoral Act is to-day as it was in 1906, and if the offences of which we have heard so much took place in connexion with the last referenda or the last general election, Ministers must have been singularly remiss in their duty in not instituting some prosecution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has stated that he intended at some time to ask for all the papers received by the Department in connexion with alleged violations of the Electoral Act. I hope he will do so. I should be glad if honorable senators had fuller information as to alleged breaches of the Act in the past, and the action that has been taken on them. But I certainly think that this is a tardy recognition of the right way to proceed with the amendment of the law. The information should have been placed before the Senate before we were asked to deal with the measure. If it had been supplied before its introduction here, or soon afterwards, honorable senators would have had an opportunity of considering whether or not there had been such flagrant breaches of the Act as to justify the drastic course which we are asked to follow. It has been asked more than once during this debate, why the innocent among those who have availed themselves of this system should be punished as well as the guilty ; but so far I have not heard the slightest attempt from the other side to justify that course. It is suggested - not in so many words but in effect - that it is a. question of choosing the lesser of two evils, but instead of choosing the lesser evil the Government have chosen the evil which they think will pay them best. There is no means of balancing one evil against the other. We know what the evil of this disfranchisement will be. We recognise that a large proportion of the 29,000 - which, as I say, does not represent the full voting strength of those who were entitled to vote - will be unable to vote by any other system than the one now in force. We recognise that the abolition of postal voting will disfranchise them. We can weigh the extent of that evil, but we cannot weigh the alleged evil which it is intended to obviate by abolishing postal voting. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody on the other side has chosen to give us even the wildest guess at the extent to which intimidation has been carried on in regard to postal votes. And, if he did, one would have to consider to what extent similar practices have been adopted in connexion with votes which are not postal votes, and then one would have to conclude how far such practices were associated with any system of voting, postal or otherwise. But we are simply asked, on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the Minister, that certain intimidation and wrongful practices have existed, to sweep away postal voting - a system&#39; which, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> told us last night, he and his friends anxiously looked forward to the establishment of some years ago. Having tried the system in 1903, and extended it in 1905, we tried it in its extended form in 1906, and when it is decided to abolish it, surely we should have some substantial grounds shown for taking that step. Have any substantial grounds been advanced? None beyond vague generalizations, to which I referred. Their accuracy can be gauged by the fact that if the evils exist, so far as prosecutions were concerned the Minister stood idly by and took no action. </para>

                        <para>- I know that ; but the honorable senator seemed to imagine that the proportion of these persons to the total number of 29,000 odd was so inconsiderable as to merit nothing more <inline font-style="italic">os</inline> less than neglect, as far as the right to vote was concerned. I take it the other way. What is the use of our going into heroics about extending the franchise, about adult suffrage, about conferring: upon our womenkind the inestimable boon and privilege of selecting their representatives to make the laws of the country <inline font-style="italic">iwhat</inline> is the use of all the rhodomontade, because that is all it would be, when we hold out this absolute bar and disqualification to the exercise of the privilege? We are asked to say that the exercise by woman of her highest natural function, the discharge of. her most important civic and patriotic duty, shall, and must, be an absolute bar to the exercise of this right which we boast we are conferring upon the other sex. If it is an advantage to give to the girl who has just attained her majority the right to vote, is it not equally important and advantageous, is it not equally our duty, to see that the same right is preserved for the mothers of the nation? With one hand we are asked to give the franchise to the women, and with the other to take it away at the most critical and most important occasions in a woman&#39;s life. No justification has been put forward for this proposal, and the disfranchisement of any section of the community, large or small, must be justified on the most solid grounds. No solid grounds have been advanced for that disfranchisement, nor for the other disfranchisement which will necessarily follow the abolition of postal voting.  1  think that Ministers will have cause before long to regret this backward step which they are taking. No Government, least of all the Government which is in office to-day, should have committed itself to such a course. There can be no justification for the disfranchisement of a constituency, however small, perpetually; and I think that the Government realizes that there can be no justification. It has offered none, apparently it will offer none; and I think it will realize, before long, that this is a step which it will have very great cause to regret. </para>

                    <para>. -  In connexion with the dividing up of electorates, this clause provides that in the case of the arrangement made being disapproved of, and a subsequent arrangement being made, the new map need not be circulated in the same way as the original one was circulated. In the event of there being a disagreement in connexion with the dividing up of electorates, and the Commissioner being charged with the duty of laying down other boundaries, I do not see why the procedure should not be the same as in the first case. The matter affects the same people, and they should have the opportunity of expressing their opinions. Previously they have had two chances to have their opinions on the proposed new arrangement expressed, but under this clause they will have only one. No reason has yet been given why, in the second case, the map is not to be exhibited. What reason is there for making this material departure ? </para>

It has been found by experience that the exhibition of a map a second time makes it very difficult indeed to prepare the rolls in connexion with an impending election.

                    <para>. - As I stated on the second reading of the Bill, in a measure compulsory enrolment has been initiated already. At the present time, policemen armed with the existing rolls go round to the various houses and leave cards to be filled in by the occupants of the houses, and those cards have to be sent to the Electoral Office. The policemen not only leave the cards, but they do something in connexion with the matter of compulsory enrolment which is not done in any other matter in which compulsion is exercised. There is compulsion in regard to vaccination, military training, and the furnishing of income tax and land tax returns. In connexion with those matters, and others where compulsion is enforced, the only intimation which the persons affected receive regarding the penalties which will be imposed on them if they do not comply with the law is usually a paragraph in the press, which is sometimes placed in an obscure position. They learn in that way that such and such a thing must be done by a certain date. In connexion with compulsory enrolment, every policeman who goes round with rolls and cards - I may say that cards will be available at almost every place which the public frequent - leaves at every house a copy of the statutory rules. The men and women who get the cards are told by the policemen what is to be done with the cards, and they also get a copy of the statutory rules. One of these statutory rules is as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>- That is being done, but there are many places where the cards have not been left. I understood that, under the clause, people would be compelled to look after the enrolment of their names themselves and would not have intimations sent to them in future. If it is understood that cards are to be left at people&#39;s houses for the purposes of enrolment, and cards are not left, the people cannot be held culpable if they are not enrolled. &#34; Some confusion exists. People will be following this debate, and it ought to be made perfectly clear what the duty of every person is in connexion with enrolment. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government and the Department are extremely anxious to give every possible opportunity to electors throughout the Commonwealth to understand what compulsory enrolment really means, and what their obligations are. With a view of assisting them, cards are being left at their houses - I hope in every case - but when the present rolls are compiled if will be the duty of every person over the age of 21 who is entitled to be enrolled to look after his enrolment himself. Every such person will be held responsible if he is not enrolled after the compilation of the present roll. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister seems hardly to have appreciated the seriousness of the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> We propose to introduce a system of compulsory enrolment. A system of compulsion means that the compulsion is upon the individual. In this instance, it means that the Government is going to compel the individual to enrol. But while in one breath the Minister says he proposes to send round the policemen to enrol electors, with the next breath he tells us that electors will have to look after their own enrolment. </para>

                        <para>- Surely we- are going to start the new roll under the compulsory system? What is going to happen? The Government inform the electors that they are going to send round cards. In time, it will be found that some electors have not responded by filling up the cards. The Government will then, I presume, take action against them. The elector who is charged before a magistrate will give evidence, and declare he never received a card. Thereupon the Bench will naturally say that the fault lay with the Department. It seems to me that there is only one of two courses to follow. Either the officials should take the responsibility of enrolling electors, or they should get out of the road, and let the responsibility of enrolment rest upon the elector. </para>

If we are to have compulsory enrolment, each individual elector must be made&#39; to understand that he alone is responsible for his enrolment, and that he must not rely upon the officials, except so far as he may expect to get from them such assistance as will enable the compulsory enrolment system to be made comparatively easy in its working. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to know why cards are being sent round at present. I understood from the memorandum of the Chief Electoral Officer that the idea of enforcing enrolment by means of the card system was to simplify procedure. But what is the good of sending round the cards at present unless care is taken that they are sent to every elector, and that they are filled up? Two cards were left at my residence some time ago, with an intimation that they were to be called for afterwards; but I feel certain that cards have not been left with every elector.&#39; Either the officials of the Department are going to take it upon themselves to secure a perfect roll, or they are going to throw the responsibility on the elector of enrolling himself, imposing penalties upon him if he does not. The Government appear to be mixing up the two things. </para>

                    <para>. - Is there any particular object in the amendment before the Chair? The professed object is to insure a system of compulsory enrolment. But I fear that if we insert&#39; the word &#34;shall&#34; instead of &#34;may,&#34; the amendment will give rise to more confusion than it removes. It may remove difficulties in one direction, but only to give place to others. Moreover, it will conflict with other provisions in the Bill, and in the principal Act. Section 13of <inline font-style="italic">tba.</inline> Act provides that &#34;The Governor-General . &#39; may &#39; divide any division into each State to be Commissioners for the subdivision of electorates. Section 22 provides that if Parliament does not approve of a proposed distribution &#34; the Minister may &#34; direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution. In section 23 subsection 2, which provides for the issue of a proclamation, the language used is &#34; such proclamation may be made.&#34; In section 24 it is provided that &#34;The Governor-General &#39; may 1 divide any division into subdivisions by proclamation.&#34; In many other parts of the principal Act, also, the word &#34; may &#34; is used. Here it is proposed to use the word &#34;shall&#34; to express the meaning which elsewhere is expressed by the word &#34; may.&#34; As a rule, in drafting Acts of Parliament the word &#34; may &#34; is used in connexion with the Crown, where &#34; shall &#34; is used in connexion with a private individual. Legislation is not so drawn to oblige the Crown, or to oblige Parliament, but it is so drawn to oblige an individual. The word &#34; may,&#34; when used in connexion with the Crown or with Parliament, carries the same significance :is &#34;shall.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- - I do not propose to reiterate what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said, because I suppose that more discussion has taken place in the Senate over the use of &#34; may &#34; and &#34;shall &#34; than over any other words used in Acts of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has, however, submitted an unanswerable argument by pointing out that throughout the principal Act &#34; may &#34; is used wherever the Crown or Parliament is referred to. It is a well understood rule of interpretation in the Law Courts - and it is one which appeals to the common sense of a layman - that where certain words are used throughout an Act of Parliament the same thing is intended to be conveyed by the Legislature. But when the Legislature uses two words it is assumed that different meanings are attached to them. In this case, if two words are to be used, it will be assumed that Parliament meant different meanings to be conveyed. The Minister tells us that he knows what his colleague&#39;sintentions are. But it seems undesirable to create ambiguity. I also direct attention to another cause of confusion. Cards are at present being distributed to electors for the purpose of enrolling them upon the roll, which is being compiled under the existing Act. After this Bill passes it is intended that the elector shall make a further application for enrolment upon another card. That will be the first compulsory enrolment. But the clause goes on to provide that once an elector has made his application, and been enrolled, he need not bother any further, no matter how many subsequent proclamations are issued - unless, of course, he removes his place of residence. An elector has to make one claim for enrolment, and one only. But, in this instance, electors, having filled up the cards that are at present being distributed, will be required, by Act of Parliament, to fill up other cards six months later, ir&#187; pursuance of a proclamation. I am certain that a great deal of confusion will arise from electors believing that the cards which are being filled up at present are the cards which&#39; they are required to fill up in accordance with the compulsory enrolment provisions. The trouble has arisen through the Electoral Branch, of the Home Affairs Department having initiated the card system without having legislative authority for it. This trouble is going to grow. There will be thousands of electors who, having made the one application on the card system; will consider that that is sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- It is a most natural impression for an elector to have. He is told that he has to make an application for enrolment on a card supplied for the purpose. Thousands of electors will believe that the cards they have recently filled up are those which have to be filled&#39; up under the compulsory enrolment system. I am certain that there will be a great deal of .confusion, and much undeserved discredit will be thrown upon the system. The trouble has arisen, as I have said, because the Department has pushed1 the card system into use ahead of legislation.. The result will be that electors who have filled in cards - for which, according to my reading of the Bill, there has been no legal warrant - will believe that that is sufficient, and will not fill in cards issued as the result of a proclamation under this, clause. </para>

The proclamation provided for in the clause must be made after, and not before, the passing of this Bill.

                        <para>- Then why legislate to say that quite unnecessary work shall be done? As soon as the Bill is passed, and the Act brought into force, the Department must carry out the provisions of the proposed new section32a, and no enrolment prior to the passing of this measure will meet the demand of that section. When we provide that an elector who has once enrolled his name need not make application for enrolment again, he may be pardoned if he confuses the card which the Government are asking him to sign to-day with the card which he will be asked to sign later on under this Bill. </para>

Under this proposed new section, an obligation will be laid upon electors to do something after a proclamation issues, and that must refer to the proclamation which it will be necessary to issue after the passing of this measure to bring this provision of the law into effect. We must issue a new proclamation, or these compulsory provisions will not become operative. We have no power to compel any person to become enrolled until that proclamation has been issued. Having, by the issue of the proclamation, assumed the power to compel people to enroll, they must do so; and, no matter how many applications for enrolment may have been sent in by electors before the issue of a proclamation under this proposed new section, the obligation to apply to be enrolled will still be upon them under the provision now under review. </para>

                        <para>- I consider that, if any person is on the roll now, the proclamation need not necessarily require that person to put in an application for enrolment. He will have already done so, and his application will have been accepted; and 1 take it that the compulsion will apply only to those who are not enrolled after the issue of the proclamation, or who, having been enrolled, have in the interim changed their residence. On the other point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I should like, with all deference to the honorable senator&#39;s legal knowledge, to submit that it is about time we said what we meant in an Act of Parliament. In ordinary daily conversation the words *&#39; may &#34; and &#34; shall &#34; mean something very different. In this case, we are not proposing to leave anything to the option of the Governor- General, and it is right that we should use the word &#34; shall.&#34; If the word &#34;may&#34; were used, the inference might be that he could do what is proposed now or in ten or twenty years&#39; time. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that later. If in this case we use the word shall,&#34; that word will operate in the elector&#39;s mind, and he will understand that the provision involves compulsion throughout. If the use of the word &#34; shall &#34; in this case is found to be inconsistent with the wording of subsequent clauses, the inconsistency can be referred to as they come up for consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has referred to cases in which it is provided that the Minister &#34;may&#34; do this or that. But we know that, in the ordinary performance of his duty, the Minister will do what is provided for, and it is unnecessary to bring compulsion to bear upon him to secure the performance of what he will regard as his departmental work. If we are to have compulsion - and I am rather sorry to see it adopted myself, because I do not like compulsion in anything - we should let that be understood from the first by the use of the word &#34; shall,&#34; and so leave no doubt about the matter in the minds of the electors. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister was somewhat mysterious when explaining why the word &#34;shall&#34; was substituted for the word &#34; may &#34; in this case. He said that the alteration was the subject of a consultation between himself and the Crown Law Office. But he gave no reason why the consultation was held or the decision arrived at. Since the consultation was upon the change of &#34; may &#34; into &#34; shall &#34; as affecting the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General, it must have been considered very important, and the reasons for the alteration ought to be given to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; that is in accordance with the constitutional maxim that every schoolboy ought to know. I like to address the term &#34; schoolboy &#34; sometimes to honorable senators. The Governor-General must act on the advice of his Ministers. The word &#34; shall &#34; is rather an ugly word to apply to the King or representative of the King, and the difficulty is overcome in the use of the word &#34; may &#34; by the fact that if the Governor- General were unwilling to carry out the advice of his Ministers they would at once hand in their resignations to him. In this measure, the words &#34;shall&#34; and &#34;may&#34; are used in different clauses, and the Governor-General might contend that one section is permissive and. another mandatory, and might claim to exercise his discretion in connexion with permissive provisions. Such a thing is not likely to happen, I admit. </para>

                        <para>- Why substitute the word &#34;shall &#34; for the word &#34; may &#34; ? Why not follow the usual verbiage of Acts of Parliament? This provision makes the Governor-General quite ridiculous. We give a discretion to the Minister time after time by the use of the word&#34; may,&#34; but it is proposed to use the word &#34;shall&#34; in the references to the Governor-General. In the circumstances, I think we are justified in asking the Minister to tell the Committee some of the reasons which induced the Crown Law authorities to advise the use of the word &#34; shall &#34; instead of the word &#34; may &#34; in this instance. </para>

This is a provision for compulsory enrolment, and it does not deal with the matter of discretion. The whole compulsory principle might be defeated if the Governor-General is given discretion in the issue of the required proclamation. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The Governor-General may appoint three persons in each Slate to be Commissioners, one of whom, if his services are obtainable, shall be the Surveyor-General. . . . </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Each State shall be distributed into Electoral Divisions, equal in number to the number of members of the House of Representatives,to be chosen therein - </para>

                <para>There is no doubt that the State has to be divided; that is compulsory. Then it is provided how the Governor-General may appoint three persons. I take it that &#34;may&#34; is not used there in an optional sense at all. What I am drawing attention to is that invariably, whether the word is used in an optional or obligatory sense in respect to the Governor-General, we have used the word &#34; may.&#34; If we now adopt the word &#34; shall &#34; we may do a perfectly good thing, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> in making- the meaning abundantly clear, but the advantage of it will be more than counterbalanced by the disadvantage of the confusion arising in the interpretation of the word &#34; may &#34; used elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- That would involve the amendment of the whole Act, and several other Acts. If we were to put in the Bill a clause to the effect that wherever &#34; may &#34; is used in the Act, it is to be taken as &#34; shall,&#34; we should then use &#34; shall &#34; in cases where &#34; may &#34; is used in an optional sense. By adopting &#34;shall&#34; in this clause, we will cast doubt on the use of &#34;may &#34; where no doubt exists at present in respect of a number of other sections of the Act. How far-reaching the consequences may be it is hard for me or anybody else at this juncture to say ; but I think that the Minister will be well advised in adhering to the established practice in draftsmanship. He need not entertain any doubt as to what will be the consequences of the adoption of the word, but he must indulge in a good number of speculations as to what will be the consequences of using &#34; shall &#34; in this provision and &#34; may &#34; in several other provisions, in which a duty is assigned to the Governor-General. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that one would search an English Act in vain to find &#34; shall &#34; used in relation to the King. It should be remembered that the Governor-General is the representative of the King in the Commonwealth. Suppose that we say that the Governor-General shall by proclamation do a certain thing. He cannot move except on the advice of his Ministers. When the Ministers come to the Governor-General and say that they desire a proclamation to be issued, he may sign it. Wherever the King or his representative is referred to in an Act &#34; may &#34; is used, because the responsibility lies with his Ministers. It would&#34; create confusion throughout the Electoral&#39; Act if in this case we altered &#34; may &#34; into&#34;shall.&#34; If we are to have compulsory enrolment, the Government will have to take steps to secure that enrolment, and one of those steps will be for them to go to the Governor-General and ask him to issue a proclamation. Surely honorable senators will not depart from an old-established custom, especially when they know that we cannot use an imperative term in regard to the King, and, therefore, not in regard to his representative. </para>

The Defence Act is based on the principle of compulsion. Compulsory service is created in the Act. But what do we find in section 140? It says that the Governor-General may by proclamation exempt from training certain persons. </para>

                        <para>- We all know that. But, notwithstanding all that knowledge, it has been the invariable practice of Parliament, for excellent reasons, not to make any distinction as to the acts of the Governor-General, and to always use the word &#34; may.&#34; Because, as a matter of constitutional practice, &#34; may &#34; means &#34; shall &#34; with a certain alternative only attached to it, that is, where he will not take the advice of his Ministers in matters arising under an Act in which &#34;may&#34; is used. Ministers have a power over the Governor-General all the time, because if their advice is not taken they can at once tender their resignations. Once or twice it has happened. Fortunately it does not often occur. </para>

                        <para>- Why is &#34;may&#34; right when it is used throughout the Defence Act, which is based on compulsion? What mysterious thing has happened in the consultation between the Minister in charge of the Bill and the Attorney-General ? If the object of this alteration is only to give effect to compulsion, the whole Defence Act is gone. Do honorable senators want compulsory enrolment to be more fast and more binding on the Governor-General by employing the word &#34;shall than they want the Defence Act to be binding on him so far as administration and authority are concerned? Is he to say, &#34; 1 am more distinctly bound down by Parliament in the compulsory enrolment provisions of the Electoral Act than in the Defence Act&#34;? Unless there is some new legal light thrown on the matter by reason of the consultation with the Attorney-General, the more his proposal is explained and analyzed, the more indefensible it becomes, and the assumptions given by the Government supporters only help to make the thing more ridiculous. </para>

                    <para>. - I again ask the Minister to consider the point I raised as to the possible confusion in the minds of the electors, who are to-day filling in a card and making a claim, as to the obligation which is sought  to be thrown upon them by this clause. It seems to me that the difficulty &#39;is bound to arise. I ask the Minister to seriously consider whether it is worth while to launch this Bill with the almost certainty of confusion arising in the minds of the electors? The Minister will see what I mean if he reads the clause with the words &#34; as directed by a proclamation &#34; omitted. The clause now states - </para>

                <para class="block">I say that the proclamation mentioned must mean a proclamation after the passing of this measure, but the Minister, in his statement just now, showed that he intends it to apply to claims filled in before the passing of this measure. Under the clause it is mandatory on an elector to make his claim after the proclamation is issued, but the electors are filling in their claims to-day. I say that they will have to fill in other claims. The Minister says he does not desire that, but I say that, if we pass the clause as it stands, the electors will have to fill in other claims. If the Minister agrees to the omission of the words &#34; as directed bv a proclamation,&#34; the necessity of electors having to make two applications will be obviated. If those words were left out, the enrolment which is taking place to-day would be made good. It is obvious that, under the clause, electors will be put to a lot of unnecessary trouble. The omission of the words &#34; as directed by a proclamation &#34; would validate the enrolment which is now taking place. </para>

                        <para>- The proclamation is clear, and can be easily understood by every man and woman who receives a copy, of it. Paragraph 3 of the proclamation provides that it shall be the duty of each person in a State who is entitled to enrolment as an elector to fill in and sign a form of claim for enrolment in accordance with the directions contained in the form. The proclamation goes on to provide that the elector shall hand the form so filled in and signed, or cause it to be handed, to a collector, or forward it to the Electoral Registrar for the subdivision in which he claims to be enrolled. </para>

                        <para>- We have power to compel the people to enroll, and we have issued &#39; a proclamation telling the people that they must enroll. They have been supplied with cards, and when they have filled in those cards and forwarded them to the Electoral Office no policeman or Department will chase them with an intimation that further cards must be sent in. At some time it may be necessary to issue a proclamation saying to the people throughout the Commonwealth that on a certain day, or at certain periods, cards must be filled in, but those who have been supplied with cards, and who have returned them, will not be required to fill in new cards. I believe I am correct in saying that almost every person entitled to vote has been supplied with a card, in this State, at any rate. If people who are entitled to vote in the other States have not been supplied with cards, they will be supplied with them, because it is the desire of the Government that everybody shall have the fullest and freest opportunity to enroll. When the people get the cards and send them in, there will be no obligation on them to send in other cards unless they move from one district to another. </para>

                        <para>- It is clear, from the fact that the Ministry have brought in proposed new section  32,  which sets out specifically that there is power to compel electors to enroll, that they have the gravest doubt as to whether section  32  in the Act gives them the power they claim. I have no hesitation in saying that it is necessary to pass proposed new section  32  if it is desired to compel electors to enroll. The power to compel electors to enroll is not contained in the Act. It follows that the proclamation that has been issued will be ineffective for the purposes of this measure. Only a proclamation issued after the passing of the Bill can be effective. If the Minister likes to take up an obstinate attitude, and to jeopardize the successful launching of this proposition, I cannot help it. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it will be compiled in our own way. I have not the slightest doubt the Minister intends that. I wish to point out that in previous Bills we strained a great many clauses for the express purpose of enabling us to meet the States, in order that a joint roll might be used for State and Commonwealth purposes. It is quite obvious that the introduction of this new element will not only destroy the arrangement made with Tasmania, but will render still more difficult the fulfilment of that hope which has been held out to us of at some time having a joint roll for the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- It is provided in sub-section  2  of proposed new section  32A  that the regulations &#34; may prescribe penalties not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> for any contravention of any regulation.&#34; Why should not the word &#34; may &#34; be changed to the word &#34; shall &#34; in that case as well as in the two instances in which that has already been done? If enrolment is to be compulsory, there must be penalties provided for people who do not enroll. The Minister has amended the clause to provide that the Governor-General in Council shall do certain things, and I think that if we are to pass the clause we should provide that there must be penalties inflicted if the regulations are broken. We must not leave it optional for penalties to be prescribed, or the clause will have no effect. Unless the amendment I suggest is made, any person reading the section will say, &#34; The first part of the section is compulsory, but the second part is not compulsory.&#34; </para>

We do not want to pass legislation in such a way that it will be a cause of confusion afterwards. This is not the first time that Bills have been so ill -considered that the High Court has had practically to sweep them off the statute-book. We have defended the use of the word &#34; may &#34; as used elsewhere, because, when used in regard to the Crown, it signified action. But here the word is not sufficient. It is not intended to give an option to the individual elector. The object of the Bill is to compel him to enroll. If it is to be left optional with him, the system of compulsion breaks down.

                    <para>- - I wish to ask the Minister whether there will be power by regulation to exempt from compulsory enrolment sections of the community who have conscientious objections to participating in elections in any way? I think there is a section who decline to take any part in electoral affairs. Do the Government reserve to themselves the right to allow such persons to excuse themselves from enrolment ? Their objections are worth considering ; and this is the time for considering them. I make the suggestion in a friendly way, feeling sure that it is not desired to harass unduly any section of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - Of course, there is in this community a section that objects to any form of compulsion. Some strongly object to parliamentary institutions of any kind. There is, for instance, the Anarchistic section, who believe, with Emerson, that &#34; the best government is the worst government.&#34; Some believe that no good will come to this earth, or to these sunny lands of Australia, until people refrain from exercising the vote on election day. There is another section, strongly Socialistic - I do not know whether they are as strong in other States as they are in Victoria - who very vigorously advocate their objection to the Liberal party, the Labour party, and to all parliamentary action. I must admit that I have a great admiration for some of them, because of their sincere and consistent advocacy of their principles. Such people, if they do not object to enrolment, would certainly object to the exercise of their votes. I do not know, however, of any religious sect that objects to enrolment. </para>

I have risen to offer an opinion on the question of the use of the words &#34; may &#34; and &#34; shall.&#34; Whilst I am in accord with the principle of compulsory enrolment, I should certainly oppose the insertion of the word &#34; shall &#34; in this sub-clause, because the effect of it would be that the provision as to the infliction of a fine would be made quite rigid. It would have to be imposed even when there had been no attempt to avoid enrolment. </para>

                    <para>.  - We have not <inline font-style="italic">yat</inline> had an answer from the Minister to the objection which has been raised. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was wrong in his contention. It will be left to the magistrate hearing a case to say whether a fine shall be imposed or not. All that we can do is to prescribe that persons failing to comply with the Act shall be liable to a fine. We cannot enforce the payment of a particular fine in every instance. We can provide that the penalty shall be&#39; ^2, but the magistrate hearing a case will have the power to say that the penalty in that case should be only a shilling, or it might be the costs of the prosecution. No one contends that the. Minister should have the power to impose all fines. The Government propose that the Governor-General in Council &#34; may &#34; prescribe a penalty or not; but in dealing with the issue of a proclamation they use the word &#34; shall.&#34; The Committee is entitled to some consideration, and the Minister cannot expect to force the Bill through by refusing to answer reasonable questions I ask him now to say why the word &#34; may&#34; is used in some of the clauses and the word &#34; shall &#34; in others ? </para>

                <para>That does not necessarily imply that the Government will shrink from imposing a penalty upon any person for refusing to be enrolled.

There is a power then to impose necessary penalties, but that may have reference to any form of offence under the Bill, and not merely to a refusal to become enrolled.

                <para class="block">I do not wish to deal with persons who merely say that they object to vote at an election, but I think the regulation should be so framed as to exempt from enrolment persons who send in applications for exemption on the ground of conscientious objections. If there are conscientious objectors - I do not care whether they are many or few - and they desire to escape the troubles which all who are compelled to enroll will have to go through, it is, I think, only fair to give them the alternative, if they conscientiously object to fill in cards of application for enrolment, of filling in cards of objection to enrolment. That should be considered sufficient to exempt them from being compelled to have their names placed on a roll for elections in which they have no desire to participate in any way whatever. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; they will never enroll their names on a parliamentary or a burgess roll. City valuators generally put their names on burgess rolls because they are ratepayers, but they never exercise a vote and never go near a poll. I in tended to move a similar amendment by proposing the insertion, after the word &#34;shall,&#34; of the words &#34;unless he or she has conscientious objections to so doing. &#62;r But the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> covers the ground quite as well. I think that the conscientious objections of any person should be respected. We have recognised this in the Defence Act, and have provided that those who object to fighting need not go into the firing line. </para>

                        <para>- Admitting that, 1 say that the principle of consideration for conscientious objectors is recognised ir&#187; the Defence Act, and no harm will be done if the same principle is recognised here. The number of persons who conscientiously object to record a vote may represent but a very small percentage of our people ; but that is no reason why we should not give them an opportunity to make a declaration that they have conscientious objections to vote. I support, with all my heart, the proviso submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> We shall do no injustice to any one by adopting it. </para>

                        <para>- They are obliged still to take a very important share in the defence of the country. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> must recognise that it is quite possible that some people will suddenly awaken to the fact that they have a political conscience, and, having an aversion to being compulsorily enrolled, may conveniently fall back upon his amendment, if it be agreed to, to escape the obligation which this measure would otherwise cast upon them. I think that the place of those who have no desire to take part in elections should be down near the South Pole, far removed from human society. But while the honorable senator might desire to* meet the wishes of a very insignificant number of such persons, he must see that his proposal would open a door by which the provisions for compulsory enrolment would be defeated. A man might say, &#34; My conscience leads me to believe that it is not right that I should be called upon to be enrolled against my will. I shall, therefore, on the ground of conscientious objection, refuse to be enrolled.&#34; If that course were followed to any extent, this measure would become an absolute nullity. I am sure that honorable senators do not desire that. While we might like to take into consideration the feelings of the people to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has referred, the amendment might be taken advantage of to escape enrolment for entirely different reasons. I think it would be very unwise to agree to the- amendment.&#39; </para>

                    <para>. - I sincerely hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will not get anything like a following for his amendment, because we might as well abolish compulsory enrolment if we once allowed those who state that they have a conscientious objection to enrolment to stand in a different position from those who are prepared to take an active and intelligent interest in the government of the country. There are some persons in the community who have a conscientious objection to compulsory education, but no person nowadays will say that a provision should be inserted in the Education Act that those who do object should have an opportunity of keeping their children away from educational institutions, and that the children should be left to grow up in the way which their parents &#39;thought fit. There are persons who have a conscientious objection to any kind of work being performed on a Sunday. We had an instance of that kind of objection in Victoria a short while ago, when a Premier, not long deceased, was waited upon by members of a religious organization - I think it was the Lord&#39;s Day Observance Society - who had a conscientious objection to the running of trains on Sunday afternoon. He, after listening to the arguments advanced, said that he had been impressed by what they had stated, and that he would consider, and, I think, consult the Cabinet, as to the advisability of giving effect to their conscientious objection to the running of trains, not merely on Sunday afternoon, but during any part of that day. When it was proposed to stop the running of the afternoon trains it was all right, but when it was proposed to stop the running of all Sunday trains it was a different thing. I have not heard any more of these persons since that time. The stopping of the church trains would, of course, have made a considerable difference to some members of the deputation. In the community, too, we have a very large -number of persons who have a conscientious objection to war. Quakers do not believe in war, or in militarism in any shape or form. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; those I have known have been exemplary citizens. During the progress of the war between Great Britain and South Africa, some of these persons were called by all sorts of offensive names. Epithets were hurled at them by so-called Christian people, who ought to have been ashamed of themselves for indulging in such language and conduct. But, after the war was concluded, it was found by a number of thinking persons that the Quakers had taken up the right attitude. The Quakers in Australia petitioned Parliament, and circularized every one of its members, in regard to compulsory military service, because of their conscientious objection to militarism or war in any shape or form, but we did not exempt them in the Defence Act. If war did break out, they would have to perform work which would be perhaps less pleasant to them than the work which otherwise they would be called upon to perform. </para>

                        <para>- Why should we legislate for a section of the community, who, it is alleged, will not exercise the franchise if their names are on a roll ? We are not legislating at the present time for compulsory voting, but for compulsory enrolment, and we want every adult citizen to be on a roll. I cannot understand why. any objection to enrolment is raised. It may be that these people have a conscientious objection to enter the arena of politics. That is another matter, and they are not alone in that regard. I could name at least half-a-dozen organizations - fairly strong numerically, and pretty strong mentally - which object to compulsory enrolment, to compulsory voting, and to parliamentary institutions, but we are not going to legislate for such persons yet. I hope that the Committee will not seriously entertain the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> because, if to-day we were to permit one small section to be free from the obligation of compulsory enrolment, to-morrow, or the day after, somebody else would be moving for some other organization or sect to be freed from that obligation. Once we opened the door, we would create a danger in regard to a system which we want to be given a fair and legitimate trial, and for that purpose it is, in the opinion of the Government, imperative that all adult citizens should be compulsorily enrolled. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to support the amendment. I do not think the Minister&#39;s arguments are sufficiently sound to furnish anything like a valid objection to it.   His  arguments, if they are sound, mean that parliamentary institutions are only maintained by compulsion, that they are in such general discredit with the people that if we once allowed what he termed the open door in regard to these matters the number of persons who object would increase and increase so much that eventually there would be no one left to elect any of us. I consider that, if parliamentary institutions are falling into such discredit with a majority of the people, if we once allow the liberty permitted by the amendment by-any-by there will be no one left to elect members of Parliament, and, I suppose, no one left to be elected. . If there is anything approaching to such a position it is clear that parliamentary institutions have outlived their usefulness, and society will be prepared to manage things differently. I feel quite certain that the Minister does not believe that the amendment, if carried, will do more than perhaps give the Department a little trouble in seeing that it is not abused. To imagine, as he does, that the opening pf this door will lead to fearful disasters is, I am sure, a mere rhetorical flourish. Let us examine for a moment the value of his comparisons. Why do we have compulsory military training? It is for the purpose of defending the Commonwealth against aggression which we think could not be fairly accomplished, with the means at our disposal,, in any other way. But does any one argue for a moment that the abstention of a limited number of persons from enrolling for conscientious reasons would lead to a breakdown of our electoral system? Can any one imagine for a moment that a person who has no conscientious objection to enrolment will go to the trouble of filling up a form in order to escape enrolment, and thereby cause a breakdown of the electoral system ? If there is any argument in favour of compulsory enrolment at all, it is that a vast majority of persons desire to vote, that as they can please themselves when they enroll the policy of drift which is common to nearly all of us will lead them to put off the day, and as the election, approaches they will. find that they have not the means of voting, however much they desire to vote. It will merely be a method of promoting and inducing persons to fulfil their duty, as it were, to save themselves, as we so often require to be saved. I take it that the Minister himself believes that the bulk of the people of the Commonwealth are behind him, or he would not propose compulsory enrolment. That being so, the bulk of the people would have enrolled if there had been no compulsion, and, therefore, will not refuse to enrol any the more now that there is compulsion.&#39; It has frequently been urged that a policeman has no terrors for a man who is not an evil-doer, either actually or in intent. If a policeman has no existence for a well-doer, in the same way this compulsory clause will not affect a man or a woman who has always enrolled, but it is supposed to affect a person who has a conscientious objection to vote. It seems to show the inconsistency of the whole business of compulsion when we compel persons who have conscientious objections to the whole of the electoral machinery, to enroll, and yet permit them to refuse to exercise the suffrage. Speaking broadly, those who do enroll, and who believe in parliamentary institutions, are the proper persons to run them, and those who have to be driven to vote at the point of the bayonet are not of much use to any party. I think that, in our laws, we should, as far as possible allow the utmost freedom to those who have conscientious objections. Certainly no one would go to the trouble involved in filling up the card or form which would secure him exemption unless he had a conscientious objection, because the trouble involved therein would be quite equal to the trouble involved in enrolling. I trust therefore, that the good sense of the Committee will be in favour of passing this amendment, notwithstanding the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> I can see no danger whatever, if our parliamentary institutions are worth preserving, in allowing people who have conscientious objections the right, not only to voice their objections, but to give effect to them. </para>

                    <para>. - One of the arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> as an objection to the amendment, was that education is compulsory. He quite seriously said that there are people who have conscientious objections to educating their children. There is no analogy between that case and the case with which we are dealing.

                        <para>- It is an injury to the children in the first place, and to the State in the second place. No injury is done to the State by allowing aman&#39;s name to remain off the roll. A child is unable to protect himself, so the Government steps in. It provides that he must be educated, and protects itself by having an educated people. In connexion with people who have conscientious objections to enrolment I would point out that we can make the means of getting exemption more difficult than the means of getting on the roll. We can so frame these provisions that those who have conscientious objections to being enrolled will not be saved any trouble. This is purely a matter of whether those who are strong are going in any way to consider the weak. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt the people to whom I refer could even hold their own in biblical quotation with the honorable senator. I, in my humble way, am endeavouring to prevent Caesar taking more than his share, whether Caesar, is represented by this Government or some other Government. There is another section in the community who have conscientious objections to voting. I refer to the Anarchists, who have higher ideals than the Socialists. The Anarchists believe that the community should be a law unto itself. They believe that the people should be so pure that they would not injure any one, or do any wrong, and that, therefore, no laws should be required to regulate the community. The Anarchists believe that they, and other people, are so pure and good that Governments are out of place. They believe that our form of government is merely government of the weak by the strong, and that many powers are exercised in the name of government which should not be exercised at all. If there are people who conscientiously object to participating in the government of the country, why should we compel them to enroll ? Very few people will be affected by the amendment proposed, and if they are few in number, and are weak because of their lack of organization, the greater the reason why we should consider their objections. We will not only be doing no injury by allowing this exemption, but we will be showing even to those few people that this Senate and this Parliament are prepared to consider the claims of any section of the community. It is reasonable for any man to refuse to have his name enrolled, and we should respect his objection. This Parliament, in my opinion very wisely, gave the franchise to women. Quite a number of good women in this community refuse to exercise the franchise. Quite a number of them refuse to have their names placed on the roll. If they conscientiously object to having their names placed on the. roll, and refuse to be enrolled, I suppose they are to be hauled before the Court by the Federal Government, and fined. I did not put these aspects of the question in moving the amendment because I thought it spoke for itself. I thought that the Government would deal with this measure in the same way as nearly every other measure is dealt with, and that any reasonable proposition put forward would be accepted. In connexion with military training I recognise that the danger which menaces Australia compels us to prepare against an invasion, and, therefore, every able-bodied man should be trained to resist an invasion. It is necessary also that there should be compulsory education, but compulsory enrolment is not necessary. No injury can be inflicted on any one by people who have conscientious objections to enrolment being exempted. The State does not suffer in the slightest degree. </para>

                        <para>- I would make it more difficult to get an exemption than to get on the roll. Some Legislatures have made vaccination compulsory. If I were living in a community where vaccination was compulsory, I would have to go to gaol on account of my objection to vaccination, on my own behalf and my children&#39;s behalf. I am prepared to go to any extent in maintaining my objection; and I want to put before the Senate die interests of other people similarly situated in a matter which is not of so much importance to the community. If the Government refuse to accept the amendment, I hope the Senate will carry it. It is not proposed that those people who have conscientious objections to enrolment should be allowed to be exempt simply by remaining idle. The regulations for exemption can be made as drastic as possible; but those who do not wish to enroll should be allowed to say Whether or not their names shall go on the roll. </para>

                        <para>- The only prominent Anarchist I know of in this neighbourhood is one whose name usually figures in the press when he has called for the. protection of the police. Evidently he wants some system of government more often than most people. The case of the Quakers has been referred to. The opinions of the Quakers are well known. The objection which they hold to political matters has nothing to do with enrolment. I am quite sure this Parliament, and every other Australian Parliament, has always respected the religious scruples of people when passing legislation ; but it has not been shown that there is any religious sect in Australia - and we have members of almost every religious sect in our midst - the members of which hold that it is a wrong thing to enroll their names on  a  parliamentary roll. There are reasons for enrolment other than the use of the roll merely for election purposes. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to provide certain statistics ; and how are you going to provide those statistics unless you have a roll of this kind? </para>

                        <para>- This roll will be of assistance in connexion with Census returns, and for statistical purposes of a hundred and one kinds; and we should have it for that purpose, if for no other purpose. Some reference has been made to the exemptions under the Defence Act, but I do not know that &#34;those who are exempt get any advantage. Because we find, reading the Act, that, whilst they may be exempted from taking part in the fighting, they are not exempt from service. Those who refuse to serve in the ranks may be requisitioned for hospital service, and other duties. The persons exempt under the Defence Act are Judges of Federal and State Courts, ministers of religion, members of Parliament, persons employed in lighthouses, and persons who satisfy the prescribed authority that their conscientious beliefs do not allow them to bear arms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and those who are supporting the amendment have failed to point out a single religious sect which entertains religious beliefs in antagonism to compulsory enrolment. </para>

In a free country it is a man&#39;s inherent right to vote as he likes. If that be admitted, does it not follow that he has an inherent right not to vote if he does not choose to do so? Who is injured by his refraining from voting? He does not injure the rest of the community. He may injure himself, but that is his affair. There may be a number of candidates standing for election from the whole of whom an elector entirely disagrees. The whole of their principles may be&#39; antipathetic to him.

                        <para>- If that were permitted, the negative vote cast against some candidates would be overwhelming. It is tyranny to force a man to exercise his voting power when he does not choose to do so. I am against compulsory enrolment altogether, and I do not believe that the provisions of this Bill in regard to it are worth the paper on which they are printed. It is argued that the Government of the country compels people to have their children educated, and also compels youths to participate in the defence of the country. But the reason why we insist on the education of people is because it is believed that an uneducated person is a menace to the community. Similarly, we insist on a certain amount of military service because we believe that that is essential to the safety of the community. But because we believe that the national welfare and the national safety require persons to do certain things, it does not logically follow that the national well-being requires every person to vote. I do not care how few may be the persons who have conscientious reasons for not voting - their motives ought to be respected. We are very careful under our Constitution to keep separate the State and the Church. We guarantee liberty of worship to every individual who comes under our jurisdiction. That, in itself, implies respect for the conscientious beliefs of the people. Why not respect their conscientious scruples in regard to enrolment and voting ? </para>

I doubt whether there is a deliberative assembly in the world in which a responsible Minister would make such a frivolous remark concerning a serious question. Of course, I regard this compulsory-voting proposal as. more or less of a circus demonstration on the part of the Government, and probably the Vice-President of the Executive Council is doing his best, to bring the circus part of the business into&#39; prominence. </para>

He explained why it was necessary to substitute the word &#34; shall &#34; for the word &#34;may&#34; in two other parts of the proposed new section, and it was only natural that I should ask whether the word &#34;may&#34; should not be altered to &#34; shall &#34; in the latter part of sub-section 2. I should like the Minister to explain that he is satisfied that these penalties can be enforced without the substitution of the word &#34; shall &#34; for the word &#34; may.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">A person entitled to enrolment might be liable to penalties for breaches of three or four of these regulations, and I wish to know if there is any simple and easy means of enforcing this proposed new section if we pass it. It is of no use to insert a clause in a Bill if it is going to be a dead letter, and I think that is what is likely to take place in this case. The Minister of Defence, in introducing the Bill, told us that about 20 per cent, of our population live a nomadic life, and are continually on the move from one district to another. It is going to be a big* contract to see that all those persons conform to every regulation which may be laid down in connexion with compulsory enrolment. Unless there _ is some way of easily and speedily detecting those who fail to comply with the regulation under this provision, it will not be worth the paper on which it is printed. The Government might have indicated what they intend to do by regulation to insure that this provision shall be a living force in the measure. So far as I can see at present, I do not think that the proposed new section will be of any use in the betterment of our electoral rolls. </para>

In no sense can they be regarded as citizens of Australia. When they became entitled to be enrolled, they might be on the eve of returning to the country from whence they came. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s interjection is disheartening to one who is trying at this stage to perfect the Bib. I have fought some of the provisions of the measure, and will fight others; but I am dealing now with a matter which should not be open fo a suspicion of party feeling. Numbers of persons visit Australia as members of theatrical companies, as tourists, wool-buyers, and men in various walks of commercial life. They may stay here in the one electoral district for six or seven months, and so become entitled to be enrolled. This Bill makes provision that if a person is entitled to be enrolled he shall be enrolled. I am suggesting, to the Minister merely that he should take some power by regulation to deal with such cases. It may be said that sojourn in Australia is not residence, but if the Minister will look at the Act he will find that the qualification is in respect of a person not under twenty-one years of age, male or female, married or unmarried, who has lived in Australia for the prescribed period. There is no question of domicile, but merely of residence, in Australia for the prescribed period. If a person is entitled to vote the compulsory provisions of this Bill will apply to him. The Minister should take, for himself or the Department, the power by regulation to say that no one who is merely a visitor shall be compelled to enroll, since he would in no sense be a citizen of Australia. It is not desirable to load up our rolls with the names of visitors of that kind. I suggest that the Minister should take power to frame a regulation to meet cases of that kind. </para>

From time to time, as he has stated, persons engaged in the musical, theatrical, and other professions, and wool-buyers come to Australia, but I do not know that it will be safe to say_ that because they may live here for only six or eight months they should be relieved altogether from responsibility in regard to compulsory enrolment. I do not expect that any one of them could give a guarantee as to how long he will be in Australia, unless, of course, he was under a specific engagement with musical or theatrical <inline font-style="italic">entrepreneurs.</inline> But to meet any case of seeming hardship or apparent injustice- </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has quite overlooked the fact that it is of no use to talk of remedying anything by regulation unless the power to frame a regulation is taken in this measure. If, however, the clause is passed as it is, he will not be able to make a regulation to provide for these cases, because it is obligatory that everybody who has lived in Australia for a certain time, and in an electoral division for a certain period, has to enroll. I am not dealing with the provision from the stand-point of an injustice being done.  1  do not know that it would be a particular injustice to ask any one who had lived here for six months to enroll his name. The point I urge is that it is undesirable that we should have on our electoral rolls the names of persons who are not citizens. These rolls are supposed to represent the people in whose hands rest the political future of this country. To load them up, even with a sprinkling of visitors, seems to me to be entirely undesirable. </para>

The reason I urged why this provision was open to criticism was that it was quite novel to have what I termed a little moral lecture set out. Nowhere else in the Bill do we find it set down that this, that, or the other thing is the duty of a person. Even the clause, which states that the Registrar shall be the Electoral Registrar under section 61. does not set out that it shall be his duty to do so and so. It says that he shall do a certain thing. Similarly in this clause, with a desire to be simple and brief, we ought to say that the elector shall do that which a previous clause imposes upon him. </para>

Instead of loading up the clause with unnecessary verbiage, why not make it absolutely plain that every person who is expected to do a certain thing shall do it? Surely, if an amendment is to be rejected, no matter how good it may be, simply because it comes from this side, it is a poor compliment to pay to the Ministry or to the draftsman of the Bill.

I cannot see what good their retention can do, and certainly their omission would make the provisions clearer and plainer. At present they tell persons what is their duty. I think that every man has an idea of what his duty as an elector is, and he does not care to have a lecture addressed to him in an Act of Parliament. The Minister will not accept an amendment from this side. He has simply stated that these words are in the provision, and must be carried. I ask him if he really thinks that there is any danger in omitting them? I am sure that no one on this side wishes to lead him into a trap. I do not wish to take any course which would weaken the Bill. In fact, I think that this clause would appear much stronger to an ordinary person if the suggested amendment were made. Surely the Government are not going to take up the stand that, no matter what amendments may be proposed, it shall not be made. The Minister recognises, I think, that the words objected to are not required. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the statement of the Minister, which I am sure the House will accept as an extremely satisfactory one, I have a suggestion to make. It is obvious that some time must elapse before the Department can furnish the Minister with the information asked for in some of the paragraphs of the motion, but the information asked for in a great number of other paragraphs would be available in a. comparatively short time.I would suggest that as soon as the Department is in a position to furnish the information asked for in a number of the paragraphs it should be presented. It is hardly desirable to hold that information over until the whole return is complete. When the Minister has obtained it, he might present it to the Senate, and later on supplement it with the information which it will take a longer time to compile. </para>

                    <para class="block">I  am sorry that honorable senators on both sides of the House will not accord this motion the same genial treatment that was accorded to the motion which has just been dealt with. I feel convinced that no person with any real regard for democratic government can seriously oppose this motion. I think I might well ask our democratic Government to accept it, and to endeavour to embody the principle which it contains in the law. I have been met with one or two objections, which I will deal with briefly. I have been told that the Constitution Act stands in the way of the Defence Act being framed in the manner which the motion affirms to be desirable. I have not studied the whole of the Constitution recently, but the only section I recollect bearing upon that question is section119, which provides that the Commonwealth must protect every State against invasion, and. at the request of any State, against domestic violence. </para>

                            <para>- As far as I can see, that is the only section of the Constitution which bears upon the subject-matter of my motion. But I think that it is an entire misapprehension of the meaning and effect of the section to say that my proposal is a negation of it. For one thing, I do not ask that any part of the Commonwealth, or any State, should be exposed to domestic violence. I do not seek to bring about a state of things in which one State might take up arms against another, or in which a State might take up arms against the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am not desirous that any such condition of things shall arise as that any part of the Commonwealth shall bc exposed to domestic violence or to aggression from any other part. Nor do I think that the terms of my motion, if translated into law, would have such an effect. I do not think that it would prevent the Commonwealth from doing what was necessary in the event of an insurrection, or an industrial upheaval, or such an event as occurred in connexion with the wire-netting seizure. I do not wish to shirk the consideration of such possibilities, but .1 do not think that my motion would have the effect of allowing domestic violence to proceed unchecked. J. will, however, pursue my own line of argument, and my critics can deal with the subject in. their own way afterwards. </para>

                            <para>- I am going to endeavour to show, in my own way, that my motion is quite consistent with the views I have just expressed. In the first place, I wish to point out that no one can seriously contend that in any civilized country of the world - or, at any rate, in Australia - there would be any possibility of inducing the majority of the electors to consent to a system of compulsory military training and service were it not for the fear of outside aggression. The menace (of attack from Germany, or from Japan, or from; any other Power which may hereafter loom up on the international horizon - the fear that&#39; some foreign Power may, at some time, cast covetous glances on Australia, and ultimately carry out its designs by invading this country - is really at the bottom of the whole- system of compulsory military training, and the justification for its institution. I venture to say that no one will seriously contend that there would have been any possible chance of securing universal military service with: in the Commonwealth were it not for that fear. It is  only since that fear has loomed up largely, and in a tangible form, owing to the success of Japan in her war with Russia, that people have seriously considered the possibility of invasion, and sought to provide against it. Of course, for as many years back as I can recollect there were periodical Russian and other scares from time to time. But they were mere flashes in the pan, and never seriously aroused the whole people to. a realization of the possibility of danger from a well-defined quarter. That possibility has been the real cause for the agitation for compulsory military service becoming crystallized in the form of legislation. The same reason also has probably actuated other civilized countries which have adopted compulsory military service or conscription. If .it were possible to banish entirely from the minds of the community those fears, which, undoubtedly, do exist - that no matter how peaceful our intentions may be we may be menaced by an outside foe - it would be impossible for any Government or any Parliament to enforce any system of compulsory military service. I say, therefore, that a person who is compelled to enroll in order that he may do his share in defending his country in its hour of need is so enrolled for that purpose and that only ; and that were any other purpose, or any other object, set forth as the justification for universal military training, it would be the death knell of the system. That leads me also to state this point of. view. No person who voluntarily becomes a member of any permanent military force can be otherwise than aware of the fact that he must obey orders, go wherever he may be sent, and do whatever he may be told. He accepts service under those terms and conditions, and with the clear knowledge that the requirements that I have indicated&#39; may be expected from, him at any time. But the Government of the Commonwealth now gives no choice - and I say rightly so - to the young citizen, as to whether he shall serve or not. The law of this country says to him, &#34;You must serve.&#34; If he says he does not wish to do so, or if his parents say, &#34; Why should He ? &#34; the only answer is : &#34;As every man enjoys the measure of civilization and liberty which our Constitution provides for us, it is his duty to do his share in defending those advantages, and in defending the great possession which he shares with the rest of his fellow-citizens in this continent.&#34; The demand for service from our youths and men is based entirely on those grounds. My contention, therefore, is that as the young soldier is enrolled for one object, and as that object is the only justification for compelling him to serve, the defence of this country against aggression should be the only duty imposed upon him. If anything more is wanted from him in the nature of military service he may, if he pleases, volunteer; but he should not be compelled to serve otherwise. If there were no system of compulsory military service at all, there would be nothing to prevent a man from serving under whatever banner he chose or in whatever service he chose. Therefore, if my motion were carried, there would be nothing to prevent every one of our recruits who is now enrolled from volunteering for the suppression of domestic violence. But my object is to lay down the principle that not one of these compulsorily enrolled recruits shall be compelled to bear arms against his fellow Australian citizens if he does not&#39; desire to undertake that service. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> allusion to the Pinkerton gang refers to the possibility of the raising of paid mercenary troops by some huge capitalistic concern such as Carnegie&#39;s, in America, where capitalists, not being able to avail themselves of the services of the Federal troops, armed private detectives - a privately-enrolled soldiery - to shoot down strikers. But that is absolutely the opposite to what would occur under my motion. The argument used by many persons in jus,tification of compulsory enrolment is that if there were any domestic violence, one side would be as well prepared as the other. I have heard numbers of workers and Labour supporters say that they only approved of compulsory military training, and only consented to it because, whichever side was on top for the time being, the other side would be well able to defend itself, possessing die training and the arms to enable it to do so ; so that, if there were any trouble of the kind, the two sides which took a hand in it would be almost on equal terms. But I point out that if there were an industrial upheaval, a strike of a serious nature, a revolt, or anything of the kind, the position would be this : that the persons employed by the Defence authorities would, in the pursuance of their duties and obligations, be able to shoot down any one who resisted them, whilst the persons who resisted, and who utilized the training and the arms they possessed to defend themselves, would, in the eyes of. the law, be traitors and rebels, and liable to be shot or punished in some other way. So that, whilst the two parties might contend on physically equal terms, there would be no real equality between them, because, while the one party would be doing its duty, the others would be traitors. Where equality comes in under such circumstances I. cannot see. I contend that, in the event of such an occurrence as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred to just now, the position would be this : First of all, you have a certain number of paid soldiers in the Commonwealth, and probably we shall always have some. There must be a staff of permanent artillery men and of officers and instructors. You would also have all those who might be willing to volunteer for service, no matter how enrolled. These would constitute a powerful force. But no one should be compelled to shoot down his fellow Australians, or run the risk of being ordered to do so, simply because he obeys the law with regard to compulsory military service.. He should be excused from that kind of service, and kept to that for which the system was created, namely, to defend the country from outside aggression. In reference to the wire-netting episode in New South Wales, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has mentioned, it has been said- and it was urged at the time of the occurrence by some individuals - that the Federal troops should have been called out to effect the arrest of those who acted under the orders of the State Premier at the time ; and that, by force, the wire-netting should have been restored to the place where it was landed. But could any one say, in view of the excitement that prevailed at that time, that the result of the forceful seizure of the netting would have been as satisfactory as what followed from the action which the Federal Government took? The Law Courts were resorted to in the ordinary way to determine whether the State Premier acted rightly or whether the Federal Government was in the right. Was anything lost to the &#34; peace, order, and good government &#34; of the Commonwealth because, instead of the hasty counsels that some urged being followed, the Government gave an opportunity for heated feelings to cool down, and appealed to the Law Courts in the ordinary manner ? Let. us see what would have happened if compulsory military training had been in force at the time, and the desire of those who wanted military action to be taken had been carried out. I am prepared to say - and I think that honorable senators from New South Wales will agree with me, both those who sit in Opposition and those who sit on my own side of the Senate- </para>

I honestly believe, and I think the other New South Wales representatives will agree with me, that the State Premier, by&#39; his dramatic and perhaps rather tactful move - from a political point of view; - fired the imagination of a very large proportion of the people of New South Wales, who were with him in the wire-netting raid. </para>

There might have been civil war within the State, and father, son, and brother might have been shooting each other down. It is rather far-fetched, I admit, to suppose that any sane Government would force things to that length when the matter might be settled in a Court of Law.

                            <para>- I cannot reply to three or four interjections at a time. Supposing the principle affirmed by my motion had been a part of our Defence Act at the time, as well as the principle of compulsory military service, if it had been considered necessary to conduct military operations against New South Wales, probably a large majority of the citizens of the other States would have been found willing to suppress the revolt in New South Wales, and to shoot down its citizens. But in that case no citizen of New South Wales would have been called upon to imbrue his hands with&#39; his brother&#39;s blood, or against his will to shoot down his father, at the word of command of any authority. Further, let me say that even those citizens of New South Wales who believed in suppressing the rebellious State would have been just as free to do so had my motion formed a part of the Defence Act as they would be under the Act as it stands. Again, the paid officers and men of the force in New South Wales would have been free to take part in suppressing that State. </para>

                            <para>- Some would be paid, and what I say would apply only to them. When they take pay as soldiers, they accept the risk of having to fulfil these unpleasant and, perhaps, revolting tasks. But, under the Defence Act, we force every citizen, against his will in many cases, to become a soldier, to fulfil the patriotic duty of defending the country against an outside foe. But we may also, unless the Act is amended in the way I suggest, force him to shoot down father or brother should there be a disturbance in any part of the Commonwealth. That is an absolutely unfair, unjust, and undemocratic position to put any man in, and still more to put a boy in. For some years the defenders of the Commonwealth under our Act will be under the age of twenty-one years, and for all time there will be in succession a certain proportion of them under that age. It is entirely unreasonable, in my opinion, to provide that a mere boy may be compelled at any time to shoot down his fellow Australian citizens at the word of command of any Government. We may not always have a Government as democratic as that now in office, though we may have one more democratic. Still, we must bear in mind that, in times of crises, men possessing supreme temporal power are prepared to go to any length, and to strain any law. in order to put down by force what they believe to be inimical either to the welfare of the country or their own rule. I do not pretend to try to bring about the millennium, when all our swords will be converted into ploughshares, pruning hooks, or other crude agricultural implements, but I do say that those who take up arms very much against their will, and who, in their hearts, are opposed to all forms of militarism, and consent to compulsory service only because of what they deem to be the absolute necessity of defending this country against foreign invasion, should not be swerved from the duty on which practically all people are agreed into the performance of quite another duty, in order, it maybe, to accomplish the designs of some ambitious authority over which they have little or no control. The adoption of my motion would never deprive Australia of the power to suppress any revolt or insurrection so long as the Constitution and laws of the country are worth preserving. When a country has sunk into such a condition of decadence that the people have lost all confidence in its forms of government and its rulers, when insurrections spring up at all manner of times and places, the probability is that it would be a good thing if the Government of such a country were wiped out of existence. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that Senator W. Russell will not contend that I have been any more backward than himself in advocating reforms through the ballot-box. I say that it is only when a country has sunk to such a low condition that it is not possible by political means to secure industrial peace and contentment that the people will revolt against all governmental agencies. In such circumstances, we should find people fighting amongst themselves, no matter how beautiful the paper Constitution under which they lived. So long as we have a form of government in accordance with the will of the vast majority of the people, we need have no fear of any serious insurrection, or any resort to violent revolutionary methods such as those at present adopted in China. It is only when a democratic government absolutely fails, becomes a mere shadow, and ceases to be effective, that the people in any large numbers resort to violence and revolutionary methods. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator had read the history of America he would know that slavery would have been abolished, perhaps by peaceful and gradual methods, many years before the Civil War took place, if the Senate, bolstered up by the State Rights theory, had not prevented that being done in accordance with the desire of the democratic majority in the House of Representatives. No paper Constitution can prevent a civil war when the people have lost faith in the forms of government of a country. In the case of minor revolts, or small insurrections, on the part of ill-advised sections of the community, 1 have no hesitation in saying we should be able to get volunteers to suppress them in any part of the Commonwealth if they believed those taking part in them to be in the wrong. What does the allusion to the United States prove? It proves that while a very large and important section of the people refused to obey the will of the majority, it did not require a compulsorily enrolled military defence force to quell the revolt. Great and serious as it was, the Civil War in America was conducted by voluntarily enrolled soldiers. So that the reference to that war tells in favour rather than against my proposal. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s interjection has no bearing upon my remarks. I am a strong advocate of compulsory military service, and I very much regret that the place in which I live puts members of my family beyond the reach of training, because an inefficient and incomplete system does not permit the training of youths unless they are within a few miles of a railway. I am sorry, that our system is not more complete and effective than it is. While I am a strong advocate of compulsory military service, I believe it cannot be justified for any other purpose than that of operations against outside aggression. I object that a force raised for one purpose should be compulsorily used for another. No member of the Senate, and no member of any Government in Australia, would ever dare to propose compulsory military service for any other purpose than the defence of the country against possible outside aggression. That being so, what right has any Government, more especially one which claims&#39; to be democratic, to use all its power and machinery to set up a citizen defence force, avowedly for one purpose, and then presume to use it for a purpose that is not only opposed to the spirit of the age, but opposed to the objects of the people of Australia when they consented to the compulsory military system? To repeat, to some extent, what I have said in regard to industrial upheavals, there will always be plenty of persons who are compulsorily enrolled willing to give their services whenever they may be required to suppress any rising or insurrection. All that my motion asks is that no man shall be compelled, by the terms of that service, to use his arms against a fellow-Australian. A man who cannot see the very wide difference between the service which should be exacted from a person who is compelled to enter the Military Forces whether he likes it or not, and the service which may fairly be asked of one who voluntarily becomes a paid soldier, probably does not wish to see it. In all seriousness, I urge the adoption of my proposal in the interests of the compulsory system. It will cut the ground from under the feet of those who base their objections to compulsory service on the argument that it is only building up a strong military force, which may ultimately result in the arms of that force being turned against the people who have created it and paid for it. If honorable senators wish to reconcile this system with the views and principles of the average Australian, they must first convince him that it is not raised for one purpose ostensibly to be used for another purpose actually, but that it is raised for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is the defence of Australia against outside aggression ; that if any means are required to protect any portion of Australia from domestic violence other measures will be brought into use to fulfil that end, and that no compulsorily-enrolled and compulsorily-trained citizen shall be compelled to bear arms against a fellow-Australian. If this motion is not carried now, I have no doubt that the publicity which will be given to the principles I have endeavoured, in my humble and feeble way, to give utterance to will be widely taken up and dealt with by abler men, and that I shall see the triumph of the proposal which I have the honour to submit. </para>

                            <para>- Towards the close of his address, the honorable senator asked, &#34; Why should we compel a person to take up arms against a fellow- Australian against his will.&#34; Let me ask the honorable senator the same question in a slightly different form. &#34; Why should we compel a person to take up arms against foreign aggression when he may be quite favourable to it ?&#34; In our law we have the power to compel the son of a Frenchman - I take this illustration because I think that France is the nation least likely at present to attack us - to resist aggression from the country of his birth. He may desire to see the flag of his forefathers waving over Australia. And yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has no objection to such a person being compelled to take up arms to prevent France from effecting a landing here. The honorable senator also made a statement which shows the entire lack of necessity for any such alteration of the law as he suggests. He said, &#34;So long as we have a Government which is representative of the people there is no fear of any domestic outbreak in Australia which will make it necessary to call out a military force.&#34; Exactly so; and there you have the only thing which needs to be stated to show that no such alteration of the Federal law as is proposed is necessary. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator also made a statement which had not much to do with the question, but which I am going to contradict, because it has been made so often. He incidentally remarked that the majority of our defenders are under the age of twenty-one years, and that we. have no right to force them to take up arms against their fellows. The Defence Act does not lay the obligation of active service on persons under the age of eighteen years. The reason why I take this opportunity to make this contradiction is because a well-known journal has repeated the statement almost weekly, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> although it ought to know, because it has been a strong advocate of compulsory military training, that persons under the age of eighteen years are under no liability to bear arms in active service, and that the number of the adult forces outnumbers very considerably those who are over the age of eighteen and under the age of twenty-one years. I take this opportunity to point out first that the statement is not correct, and secondly that those who are over the age of eighteen years and under twenty-one years, and who cannot be called children by any means in Australia, are outnumbered by the adult forces. While in the latter part of his address the honorable senator said that it was absolutely impossible to believe it; in other parts he seemed to contemplate a time when some great question is going to be settled by an appeal to arms, and he desires that the people shall then be free to take whichever side they like without being branded as traitors. </para>

I would also point out that no persons would be foolish enough to take up arms to-day in a modern State unless they first of : all had some sort of military organization, possibly a secret one.. The State has an organization ready to hand in its police force, and in the case I mentioned the State would have had an organized police force bound and sworn  to  obey its orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would put the Federal authorities in the position of having on the spur of the moment, and after the revolt had occurred, to organize a police or military force to enforce the judgment of its Court. He apparently had no objection to the State having an organized force to enforce its law, but he objected to the Federal authorities having art organized force. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said that universal military service was not brought about for the purpose of suppressing domestic violence. I heartily agree with that, in fact we all do. I am glad to believe that nobody in Australia is so pessimistic as to think that we cannot settle our differences, whether they are between State and State, or between State and Commonwealth, without an appeal to arms. I, at any rate, am optimistic enough to believe that we can. I suppose that if, after the close of the War of Independence, the people of the United States had been told by any person that within a certain time their sons would be taking up arms one against the other, that the people of the Northern States would be seen in armed camps prepared to fight against the people of the Southern States, they would have branded him as a fool, and laughed at the idea. Yet that came to pass. One of the bloodiest wars in history was fought in that country between people with like ideals, of almost a common stock, with a common religion, and in a republic with the freest and most representative form of government on earth at that time. </para>

                            <para>- With a clear recollection of that war, can we shut our eyes as to what is possible in human affairs? I would draw the attention of honorable senators to the fact that a nation exists by law. Law is the only element so far discovered by which communities can be kept together in units as nations. We have in order to maintain ourselves as a nation to uphold the laws of our nation, not only against foreign aggression, but also against internal aggression. The whole duty of government is summed up in that. It is to uphold and enforce the law. The people of Australia have declared that they will have a military system for the defence of Australia as a nation, and I say that that does not merely mean that we will defend Australia from foreign aggression, but that we will defend the laws of Australia, no matter from where the attack may come, if that attack takes the form of force. There is a legitimate way in which  our  laws can be altered, and the people of Australia have declared emphatically that if those laws are to be altered, they are to be altered through the ballot-box. I say that if any person takes up arms in Australia to alter the law by force, the community is justified in meeting force with force, and preventing him doing what he desires to do. Therefore, I say that our Defence Force is raised and maintained not merely  for  the purpose of defending the country against foreign aggression, but  Also  to defend the laws which have been framed, through Parliament, by the majority of the people of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> says he does not object to the section in the Constitution which has reference  to  the protection of a State against domestic violence. He said he is not desirous of any portion of a State being exposed to domestic violence. That is a very pious wish. We are all anxious and hopeful that  no  portion of a State may be exposed to domestic violence, but if there is a revolt by a State against the other States, or by a portion of a State against the other portions of the Commonwealth, that pious hope will not carry us very far unless we are prepared to say that if that State, or part of a State, takes up arms against the community&#39;s wish, as expressed in the laws  of  the Commonwealth, then the rest of the Commonwealth will take up arms to defend the laws which the majority of the people have made through Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> says that if his motion is given effect to, it will not interfere with that protection from domestic violence, but that it will prevent any member of the Defence Force being used to suppress domestic violence. At present,  as  far as I know, the only way by which the Commonwealth Parliament is able to protect itself, or a State, from domestic violence, is by its Defence Force. We have not the control of the police forces of the States, except so far as, under our Federal Constitution, the Courts and the police of the States are called upon to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth. But the police are maintained and disciplined by the States, and not by the Commonwealth. The peculiar portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> address to me was that he is quite prepared to maintain a permanent force, and allow it to be used to suppress domestic violence. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator says, &#34; You should only use a volunteer force,&#34; he is forcing us into this position. Either we must organize a volunteer force in a time when there is no domestic violence for the express purpose of suppressing domestic violence, should it occur, or wait until that disturbance occurs, and then appeal for volunteers to suppress it. I wish to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> apparently overlooked the fact that under our Defence Act the volunteer system will in a year or two be swept away. We will have no volunteers, as such. We will have only a citizen Army, maintained on the: basis of compulsory training and. enlistment. No domestic violence- can occur that cannot be easily suppressed by the police, unless it is organized violence. To&#39; say that the Commonwealth, which has to defend the law, is to be&#39; placed in the position, of having to wait until violence is organized, and has expressed itself by acts of violence before it proceeds to organize a volunteer force to suppress that violence, is ridiculous. I want to put the position in this way. In my opinion, the Commonwealth has the purest form of Democracy that any country has yet reached. The will of the people finds expression upon its statute-book by&#39; the votes of the majority of the people. There are no class or property distinctions in the franchise of the Commonwealth Par:liament. There is, therefore, no class law, and no class rule. The Defence Force is raised for the express purpose of protecting the Commonwealth, and enforcing the laws which have received the approval of the majority of the people, who expressed their views through the ballot-box. This Government, or any Government, if there is to be government, has the obligation of defending the laws which are upon the statute-books, of the Commonwealth, whether the attack on the law comes from without or from within, and I say that anything short of that is anarchy, and not government at all ; anything short of that is licence, and not law. No Government can be true to its trust unless it is prepared to take up that position. Civil war in Australia, as I have already said, is inconceivable. The policy, not only of the present Government, but of the party it represents. is to have a citizen defence force as opposed to a standing army. Our policy is directly opposed to the idea of keeping a standing army for the suppression of domestic violence, or for protection from foreign aggression. If the laws of our country are opposed by force, are we to allow the&#39; lawless minority to tyrannize over the peaceful majority? We say that the people have expressed their will. If they do not approve of the laws, they can alter them. We say that the Defence Force of the Commonwealth has been raised for the express purpose of defending those laws, and it is a legitimate thing to use the Defence Force for that purpose. My earnest request to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is to withdraw the motion. I think it is absolutely unnecessary. I think many of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> own statements prove it to be unnecessary. It contemplates one of two things - either that you shall raise a standing army if there is any danger of domestic violence -and if there is no danger the motion is unnecessary - for the purpose of suppressing domestic violence, or that you shall give to any minority in the Commonwealth the right to defy, by armed force, the laws made by the majority, and, until they do that, you shall take no action, but, when they do it, you shall appeal for volunteers to defeat them. No such proposition would receive the support of any deliberative assembly, and I am satisfied that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is so ill-advised as to take the motion to a vote, he will be in a hopeless minority. The motion is unnecessary, uncalled for, and unwise. </para>

                        <para>. - If any proof of the necessity of this debate were needed, and if any further confirmation of the strength of the position put before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> were needed, we have it in the exaggerated arguments and statements of the Minister of Defence. He commenced by saying, in effect, &#34; Why should we compel a person to take up arms against a foreign foe?&#34; and he immediately pointed out that we would compel some Frenchmen to take up arms against their country should this land be invaded by France. I say that the Commonwealth has no power to do such a thing. The son of a Frenchman within our walls can claim the protection of his nation, and he need not become naturalized. </para>

                            <para>- The fact that the honorable gentleman has to quote such extreme cases shows how much at sea he is upon this matter. What is the intention of the motion? It simply says that those whom we compel to undergo military training in order that we may be prepared to repel an invasion shall not be used for the purposes of participating in a domestic brawl. Now) if the whole of the government of this Commonwealth were under the charge of the Commonwealth Parliament, and if it rested with this Parliament to say whether the troops should be sent out or not, there might be something in the contention put forward by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> but he must know that if a request for military assistance to put down domestic violence were made by the Premier of any State, although that violence might&#39; have been brought about by the action of the Government of that State, the forces of the Common wealth would have to be . used for its suppression. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to look forward to any such impossible thing as civil war. No one would be fool enough to take up arms without secret organization. We are free from the possibility of anything of that kind, but we are not free from the possibility of a State Government trying to precipitate a riot with a view to strengthening its position. I have seen that occur at Broken Hill, and so has the Minister of Defence. I have seen the police force of New South Wales try to create a riot in the interests of the party controlling New South Wales at that time. Just imagine the contingency that might arise if the Wade Government were returned to power in New South Wales. I hope to God that will never occur. There might be a dispute at Broken Hill over  3  matter in which the miners were absolutely in the right, and that Government, exercising the tyranny which it exercised in the past, might endeavour to disperse a public meeting by means of the armed police force of the State. The people, heated and excited, and objecting to the encroachment on their liberties, might resist. At the request of the Premier of New South Wales, the Minister of Defence would have to call upon the Defence Force to suppress the disturbance. Who would be the first members of the Defence Force who would have to be called out? They would be the sons of the miners whose liberties were being ridden over roughshod. </para>

Let us imagine a case occurring in Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie. We will say that, instead of having, as is the case at present - a Labour Government, in Western Australia, the opponents of Labour were in power, and that &#39;some great industrial trouble arose there. Suppose that such trouble occurred as has happened in other parts of the world, when the down-trodden toilers have revolted. I was in Great Britain when the railway strike occurred there. If there was one thing more than another that made me feel warm, it was to see the signal-boxes and the railway stations occupied by armed soldiery with fixed bayonets, ready - for what? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows that what I say is true. There is no objection to the Government maintaining and preserving order. The objection is that, under the pretence of training young men for one purpose, the Government could use them for quite another. The objection is that whilst the laws of this country impose upon the young men the obligation of drilling, they may at present be called out and utilized for quite another purpose than that for which they are being trained. Suppose there were trouble at Broken Hill, and the Wade Government was in power. The riots that occurred at Broken Hill during the last strike were due solely to the bad management of the police force, in my opinion. Suppose that matters had gone a little further. Suppose that similar trouble occurred tomorrow, and that an application was made to the Federal Government to call out the Defence Forces. In that event, the sons of miners on strike would be called out to fight against their own fathers. We can not escape from that position. </para>

                            <para>- I am not trying to exaggerate the position. I am trying to put reasonable probabilities before the Senate. The Military Forces in any one State may be called upon to put down by armed force men who are asserting the rightful claims of organized unionism, or endeavouring to obtain a better wage. It might be said that, in the course of their efforts, they had created a state of domestic violence that entitled the State Government concerned to claim assistance from the Commonwealth. But I say that it is a most unreasonable thing, a most unfair, and unjust thing, to say that our young men should be compelled to join the Military Forces and be trained to defend the country against invasion, whilst at the same time the laws of the country give power to order them to be called out by the Commonwealth to shoot down their fathers and their brothers. The people of Australia are the most democratic people in the world, and I maintain that this law can be altered. I venture to say that the Act of Parliament which enables such a condition , of things to be brought about would never  have been passed had it been realized that it contained such a provision. There are very many who would never have voted for it had they understood what it involved. As far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;</inline> s proposal is concerned, it simply asks the Senate to consider the undesirableness of mixing up the training of our young men to defend the country against invasion with the utilization of armed force in any other way whatever. The resolution declares that these young men ought not to be used as a police force, or in any other manner, to suppress disorder, simply because a State Premier - possibly anxious, above all things, to create disorder - may declare that he needs Commonwealth assistance. </para>

                            <para>- The situation would be still more unfortunate if there were a Commonwealth Government in power which refused to carry out the constitutional obligation. I would rather see the Commonwealth Government carry out the terms of the Constitution, irrespective of the consequences, than see them false to the position which they occupy by declining to do the clear duty that lay before them. It is because I &#39;want to clear the way of difficulties such as may occur in the future that I feel so strongly on this question. There has recently been a strike at Mount Lyell. Fortunately, there has been no breach of the peace there. With the present Tasmanian Government in office, had there been a breach of the peace, what would have occurred? The men are out on strike for a good cause. If ever a strike could be justified anywhere, this strike was. Conditions of tyranny have prevailed at Mount Lyell, perhaps, unequalled in any other country. Time after time men have been discharged, simply because they dared to act in certain capacities for their union. That sort of thing has been going on for years. Those who do not know that it has been going on have been simply sitting inside, and not making themselves acquainted with what has been occurring. The grievance that led up to the strike has been the fact that man after man, who has become a leader of his union, has had to forfeit his position as a workman there. </para>

                                himself has suffered from the treatment, to which I refer. What would have been the position if domestic violence had occurred at Mount Lyell ? Suppose that the Tasmanian Government declared that a state of domestic violence had occurred, and that they required the assistance of Federal troops? The most convenient Federal troops would probably have&#39; been the compulsorily-trained troops of the State. Consequently this most democraticGovernment, and its most democratic party, would have made themselves the laughingstock of the democratic world. The Government would have to carry out the obligations of the Constitution, which it is their duty to obey. They would have had&#39; to send troops to shoot down men who had been fighting the battles of Labour for years.

                            <para>- The motion is not intended to relieve them of their constitutional obligations. I do not wish to relieve them. But I do say that the young men, whom the law of the Commonwealth compels to become trained troops, ought not to be called out under any circumstances to fight against their fellow-Australians, who, in many instances will be fighting their own battles. It is not a question of the Federal Government shirking responsibility. I said before, and I say again, that I would not support a Government for five minutes if I thought that it would shirk its responsibilities for one moment. If the Constitution needs to be altered, alter it. If our Defence Act is wrong, let us, in times of  peace and quiet, when there is no panic ; and no violence, alter it, and bring it down to the grounds of reason and common sense. But we have a Government in office which, with its supporters, represents, I venture to say, the most democratic party that exists in any country in the world, and yet we have listened to a Minister giving utterance to the most Tory sentiments ever expressed in a democratic assembly. The Minister&#39;s speech made it appear that he put constituted authority before every other consideration. </para>

                            <para>- He never met them in a fair, manly and straightforward spirit. He did not answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> arguments, and he failed to meet the point that, under the pretence of training young men for the defence of this country, they  are being drilled so that they may be used for a different purpose altogether, without being told that they may be required for such purpose. The Minister of Defence, and those who support him, cannot deny for a moment that the people who are entitled to say what is domestic violence within their State, according to the reading of the Constitution, are the Executive Government of that State. There is no getting away from that position. The decision is not left to this Parliament, but to the ExecutiveGovernment of the State which claims that there is domestic violence within its territory. Take the present elections in this peace-loving Victoria. I venture to say that if the party who are hanging on to office thought that they could create a condition in which they could lead the public for the time to believe that domestic violence was occurring, they would gladly do so - just as a drowning man is supposed to grasp at a straw - in order that they might remain in power a little longer. I dare say that the crowd, who would be excited if they were being unjustly dealt with, and would not submit to their tyranny, would be the lawbreakers. Under our democratic Constitution, a Federal Government is in the unfortunate position that, if a State Government says that domestic violence is occurring within its territory, it is compelled to send a Federal force to quell the violence. </para>

                            <para>- Let us take even- the absurd proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> If the riot assumed such a magnitude that the Government of New South Wales thought it necessary to have the assistance of the Defence Forces, I venture to say that the Commonwealth Government would not be worth their salt if they did not give an order for the Defence Forces in Sydney to be called out immediately -for that purpose. We are right up against that proposition. We have instituted a system pf compulsory training, under which we compel every youth and young man to be drilled ; and I quite agree with that policy. But, side by side with the requirement for a young man to fit himself as an efficient defender of Australia, we have no right to say to him that he shall be put, if need be, in the position of shooting down his fellow-man for fighting for something which he considers just. I remember that, when the unfortunate strike was proceeding in Eng&#39; land a few months ago, the officer in charge of a detachment ordered a soldier to fire at a man who was climbing over a fence. The soldier refused to obey the order, was brought before a Police Court; and punished. He was asked to do an outrageous thing. He was under military law, and I suppose he should have done the thing; but he did not, and he had to pay the penalty. A distinction must be made between a man who volunteers for paid service and a man who in his full manhood accepts a duty which may put him in an unenviable position. When the former is taking the oath of allegiance he knows that, the moment he becomes a member of the Defence Forces, certain possibilities may happen. He joins the service knowing full well what his responsibilities are. But that is altogether different from the position of the compulsorily-trained men. Some of them may enter upon their training reluctantly. They may regard it even as an infringement of their liberty, as it compels them to give up their Saturday afternoons - to give up the leisure - which, perhaps* they were putting to better use. While we compel men, against their will, to undergo this drilling we go a step further, and do a grave injustice to them by saying, &#34; Not only shall we compel you to do this, but in a case of domestic violence occurring within a State we shall compel you to be at the bidding of a State Government, which may use your services to suit its own ends.&#34; I do hope that honorable senators will try to view this matter in the light of the experiment which we are trying. Take the section of the community which I represent here - the unionists. How often have we, as unionists, found ourselves up against the injustices of State Governments ? When we had everything to recommend our claim - when it was being fought out by law-abiding citizens, as peaceably and as reasonably as could be expected, how often has the stupidity of the governing forces put many of these law-loving and law-abiding citizens in a false position? As recently as at Broken Hill, in the shearers&#39; strike, and in, the strike of 1890- </para>

As regards what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith was reported to have said at the time, I have never uttered a charge against that gentleman on a platform, and never will do so. I have only repeated what I heard directly from a principal who was engaged in the business. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was Premier, and was confined to his bed with a broken leg. The desire of his colleagues was to use force to put down the strike, but, with his greater foresight, he saw that the trouble would expend itself if dealt with in a statesman-like way, and so Sydney was saved from bloodshed on that occasion. Do honorable senators think that we are past all these troubles? Do they think that we are any nearer to the millennium when there will be only good government and good laws ? I recognise that we are only at the beginning of our troubles, and because we are at that point, I desire to have the law of this country altered so that when the people who have to struggle the hardest for the little they get are engaged in an industrial struggle, a Government which is not sympathetic shall not be able to turn the arms of their children against them in their, fight for better conditions. That is the posi-tion now. The honorable senator who is at the head of the Defence Force can make the most of his Tory attitude in placing before the Senate the absurd inferences which he drew, but which he had no right&#39; to draw, from the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> He tried to twist them, and put the honorable senator and his supporters in the position of persons who are trying to carry some wild or absurd proposal. We are trying to make more acceptable to the people, who disagree with it the system of compulsory training. Smoothly as the system has been working, let there be in one part of the&#39; Commonwealth a great strike which stirs the hearts of the workers ; let there be one section of organized labour fighting for better, conditions, and one bullet fired by compulsorily-trained soldiers, and your compulsory-training system will crumble to pieces like dust. </para>

                            <para>- What hope will there be for a system which is now in its infancy being nursed and brought to&#34; maturity if honorable senators turn the sympathies of the workers against it? I venture to say that even the speech of the Minister of Defence to-night is calculated to do that: It was a speech of the kind which we would expect to hear if an honorable senator on the other side were occupying his position. It contained not one sentiment of sympathy, not even a recognition of the fact that he is prepared to use the force he levies for one purpose for another purpose. </para>

                            <para>- Because the man who* could peer into my mind, and say what I believe, and what I doubt, could only be a man with great, intellect like the honorable senator. It is only a man with a great mind who can say what another man is thinking about. I have spoken strongly upon this question, because I feel strongly upon it. I have no doubt that the Minister in his exalted position feels that he has a right to say what he likes in any manner he likes, and that after he has spoken no man shall open his mouth. I can even sympathize with a Minister who takes up that attitude. If I am making a mistake as to my estimate of the Minister, I know that he is strong enough to live the estimate I have made of him down. Anything I have said about him on this occasion has been provoked by the effect his speech had on me. I heard it with, shame and regret. I have heard speeches of a similar kind from the other side of the chamber on similar occasions, and I can assure honorable senators that I could de.tect very little difference between the. Minister&#39;s speech and. the speeches which I have heard from the other side. There was the same false sentiment running through the whole of it - the sentiment that constituted authority should take precedence over human rights. I do not agree with, that, and I will not agree, with, it even when a Minister belonging to my own party- puts it before the Senate. I think that-human rights and human justice come first.. The Minister boasted about constituted, authority, and what it. is going to <inline font-style="italic">do-,,</inline> and that is the whole difference between us. He twisted the meaning of the resolution. It was he who tried to put impossible positions, and to twist the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> into impossible meanings-. I did not try to do so. I am trying to follow the Minister in his twistings and turnings. The question is simple and plain*. Australia, through its Parliament, has- decided to compel the youth and young men. of this country to be trained for military service, in order to repel any foreign invasion, and we simply say now that while we do compel them to be trained to resist a foreign invasion, we are not going to compel them to do anything more than that. The object of training the youth of this country is to defend Australia from invasion, and if we want to train them for any other purpose, let us say so in an open manner.. I hope the motion will be carried, and that the Senate will carry it altogether free from the misrepresentations which have been made, as to its purpose. The object of the motion is to make it clear that the youths, and young men called upon to undergo military training for the purpose of repelling any foreign invasion, shall not he used for the purpose of participating in domestic violence within the States. </para>

                        <para>-  - I regret that any heat has been imported into the consideration of this matter, but I say deliberately that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> whether intentionally or not, has certainly in the heat of his opposition to my proposal flagrantly misrepresented many of the arguments I used. For one thing, he said I was in favour of a paid standing army to suppress domestic violence, but that I objected to the compulsorily trained soldiers doing so. I said, and I think I said it clearly, that I was not attempting to bring about the whole millennium at once, and. that my object was merely to provide that those who are enrolled ostensibly for one purpose shall not be used for any other purpose, I pointed out, incidentally, that there were paid men in our Forces, and I said that they would still be available if required to lead any force that was. necessary to suppress domestic violence. I pointed out that in addition any of the compulsorily trained recruits who chose voluntarily to remain in the service, and to do what was asked of them, would still be at liberty to do so.. I said that if they voluntarily chose to undertake such work they would still be under the control of their officers, and of the authorities generally. I merely wished to protect those who had been avowedly trained for one purpose from being used for another purpose. I venture to say that the Minister of Defence and certain honorable senators, who may be prepared to vote at his bidding, misunderstand the effect of my motion. </para>

                            <para>- I do not understand the honorable senator as a Labour man. Any one who says that I am in* favour of a standing army is making one misrepresentation. Any one who says that I am opposed to the compulsory training system being effective is making another misrepresentation. My words cannot fairly bear such an interpretation. I have all along believed in the possibility of this country being invaded by an outside force, and for that reason I am not only anxious, but willing that my sons shall be trained to do their part in .defending the country to which they belong, and to which they owe their existence. I go further than that. I was absolutely opposed to the provision in the Act which exempts members of Parliament from service. Whether old or young, whether twenty-one or fifty, if we are able to eat and walk about we are able to put up a fight. </para>

                            <para>- I would not care whether they were 170. I think it is a very mean thing to ask others to do what we, as members of Parliament, deliberately exempted ourselves from doing. The argument that Parliament will be necessary to manage affairs in the event of a war is answered by the fact that there would be plenty of people willing to take our places if we were shot down. In my opinion, a man who will not vote for this motion does not understand Democracy, and I believe that the Democrats of this country will not very long tolerate as its representatives those who deliberately vote against it. </para>

                            <para>- I should be dangerous to the honorable senator if I were in his electorate. He certainly has not a glimmer of an idea what the motion means, or he would not make such senseless interjections. The motion is one which will appeal to the Democracy of this country, which, like the Democracy of other countries,&#39; is sometimes a good deal ahead of its &#34; wishy-washy &#34; representatives in Parliament. While I have the utmost  respect  for the Minister of Defence and the utmost confidence in his integrity, I believe, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> indicated, that his mixing up with the military&#39; people has already., to some extent, impaired his outlook. The more he mixes up with them, the more weak he will get in his advocacy of those democratic principles which distinguished him as a member of the rank and file of the workers. That may be an argument as to why there should be pretty rapid changes of Ministers, if not of Ministries. The Minister spoke about the Civil War in America. It is strange that he should have reiterated arguments that I had replied to in advance. He cited the case of the American Civil War to show that, remote as any possibility may seem, it is beyond the power of man to say what may happen. That is true enough, but he went further, and said that we should be prepared to meet remote possibilities. In another place he said that anything  in the nature of armed violence hi the Commonwealth was inconceivable, and then he conceived it. Let me ask. what bearing the American Civil War has on the question, of compulsory &#34;military service? Was there compulsory military service in that country during the war, before the war, or after the war. \ </para>

                            <para>- I use those words because it is impossible to define and limit circumstances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> used the extreme illustration of a couple of drunken men rioting in a street in Sydney. Even that would be domestic violence, but I never did anticipate that any State Government in its wildest moments would ask for assistance under such conditions as those. I say that in the event of a State rebelling against the Commonwealth, without compelling the trained recruits in that State to take up arms against their fellow citizens, in all probability there would be an overwhelming rush to the assistance of the Federal Union as against the revolting Stale of recruits perfectly willing to continue their service. The Civil War in America shows that even were an exemption allowed to persons who did not wish to take up arms against their fellow citizens, there would be sufficient soldiers who would Volunteer to stamp out any rebellion. The fact that no Government with anything like a decent case would be at a loss for volunteers is a reasonable ground for requesting that no man should be compelled to take up arms in such a case if he has conscientious reasons for objecting to do so. Again, the Minister of Defence misrepresented my remarks. He said that either you must, in time of peace, constitute another force to suppress possible internal troubles, apart altogether from the force to repel invasions, or you must wait until a crisis occurs, and then hastily call for volunteers. He knows that is not the position at all . If it was desired to suppress any violence, all that would be necessary would be to get those men who were trained  -  and they all will be trained in a few years - to remain in the service. Those who volunteered to do so would still be at the service of the Government. What I say is that those who do not like to do so, should not be compelled to serve. When the people generally understand the object of this motion, I feel confident that what it embodies will be made the law of the land, and that in the near future. </para>

                        <para>. -  Under cover of the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I desire to make a personal explanation in order that I may remove an impression which, I understand, was made upon the minds of some honorable senators last night when I was criticising the section of the Electoral Act under which postal voting occurs. I made a statement with regard to the wholesale abuse of the postal voting system in Hobart during the elections of  1906.  It appears that some honorable senators were under the impression that I reflected upon the administration of the Minister at the head of the Department, and of the electoral officials in the Denison electorate, whose duty it was to administer the electoral law. I am sorry that any honorable senator should have derived that impression, because nothing was further from my mind than to suggest that either the Minister, or any of the officials, was other than absolutely impartial. What  I  wished to point out was that abuses crept in because, under the law, it was impossible -for the electoral officers in Denison to detect them. Those who laid themselves out to profit by the abuses were, of course, sufficiently clever to carry on their practices without being detected. I make this explanation in order that honorable senators may clearly understand that my statement applied only to the individuals who were in the pay of one of the candidates, and by no stretch of imagination should they have been regarded as applying to the officials charged with the&#39; administration of the law. I should not have felt called upon to make this explanation, except for the remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> this afternoon, from which I gathered that he had inferred that I had reflected seriously upon the Minister, and the officials. I say, again, that I had no such intention. </para>
