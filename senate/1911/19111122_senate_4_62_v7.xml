                <para class="block">It appears to me that whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment would be relevant to the subject-matter of the principal Act, it is not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill before the Committee, because it seeks to introduce an entirely new principle - a principle, I may add. of vital importance. The question has been before the Senate on previous occasions, and cognate questions have also been discussed. The amendment would alter the principle upon which voting is now conducted, because it would give a different value to the votes recorded for a certain candidate. It would almost certainly alter the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Senate. Had such a proposal been submitted in the Bill as read a second time, there is no doubt that it would have taken up a large part of the discussion on the Bill at that stage. The amendment is such as to alter the principles of the Bill as referred to the Committee, and if carried would further require the alteration of section 103 of the principal Act, which deals with the forfeiture of deposits. There would be a considerable difference in the number of votes which it would be necessary for an unsuccessful candidate to obtain before his deposit could be forfeited. I do not think it necessary to say any more. I know that it is a very open question, but in my opinion the proposed amendment is not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, because it would vitally alter the principle of voting provided for in section 150 of the principal Act. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit that according to decisions given more than once, and approved by a vote of the Senate, this amendment is not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, though it is relevant to the subject-matter of the principal Act. It must be patent to every one that if agreed to the amendment would bring about a vital alteration in the principle of the existing Act. The alteration of principle would be so far-reaching that it is absolutely certain that if the amendment were carried the constitution of the Senate would be altered, if anything can be certain in politics. The effect of the alteration on political parties is beside the question, as this matter may be considered without party feeling. It will be remembered that at the last Senate election there were practically only two political parties before the country, and in each State the whole of the three candidates representing the victorious party were returned. </para>

                <para>The  Chairman  of Committees.  -  I say that for all practical purposes the voting strength in the constituencies was possessed by two parties only in each of the States. It must be plain that had this proposal for preferential voting been in force at that election the result would have been in each State the return of two senators representing one party and one representing the other party. That is about the best guide we could have in deciding whether this would not introduce a vital new principle. That being so, we have to decide whether although the amendment may be relevant to the subject-matter of the principal Act it can be introduced, in the way proposed, in this Bill. Some years ago when the Senate was considering an amending Electoral Bill, I submitted an amendment to substitute for the principle of the block vote for the Senate which is contained in the principal Act, and under which an elector must vote for not less than three candidates, the right of each elector to plump for one candidate, or to vote for one, two, or three candidates as he pleased. The then  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate, who, I think, was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> accepted my amendment after discussion, and ruled that it was in order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> objected to that ruling, and the matter was thereupon referred to the <inline font-weight="bold">President, Sir Richard</inline> Baker, who gave his decision against the Chairman&#39;s ruling, and consequently against my amendment. I dissented from the decision of the  President,  and the question was considered at the next sitting of the Senate. After discussion a division was taken upon it, and although the voting was equal, eleven votes being recorded on either side, the fact remains that under the Constitution, the Senate upheld the decision of the  President.  The question then at issue was not nearly so vital as is the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> because it is certain that under it, when there are only two political parties before the country, and three members have to be returned, each of those parties will secure one representative, whilst the third seat will go to the stronger party. I think that statement of the position will be accepted without demur. That being so, surely the principle which is involved in the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> is of such vital importance that it is outside the scope of the amending Bill ! </para>
                <para>Senatorsayers.  -  The principle is a good one. </para>
                <para class="block">The  Chairman of Committees. -  That is quite another question. I have no doubt that many honorable senators who would oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment in Committee would vote for it if it were submitted in a different way. I contend that a standing order has been expressly framed to meet this particular class of cases with a view to insuring that the rights and privileges of honorable senators shall not be unduly restricted, and that the procedure of the Senate shall hot be unduly hampered.. </para>

                <para>The  Chairman  of Committees. - It is standing order  327.  That standing order was framed for the express purpose of meeting the particular class of cases that is now under discussion. It provides that certain new matter which is not relevant to an amending Bill, but which is revelant to the principal Act, may be introduced conditionally upon an instruction to the Committee, moved prior to the second-reading stage of the Bill, being passed. But even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> had obtained such an instruction, I am not sure that his amendment would be in order, that is if we are to follow the precedent which has been laid down. Reference to May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> Vol. X., will show that grave doubt exists as to whether even if the honorable senator had obtained an instruction to the Committee, he would have been in order in submitting his amendment. That question, however, does not arise here, because no such instruction was obtained. The motion which I submitted on the occasion to which I have already referred is set out in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of  1905,  vol.  28,  page  4027.  It reads - </para>

                    <para>Therefore we must consider the subject-matter of the Bill, and whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment is relevant to that subject-matter. The subject-matter of the Act which it is proposed to amend really has nothing to do with the question. It is the subject-matter of the Bill&#39; which our Standing Orders say shall be the test. As has been admitted in the course of the argument, if a Bill were introduced practically to make some trivial amendment in an Act of great length and importance it would not be open, according to standing order 194, to the Committee to deal with all the subjects dealt with in the principal Act, which it was proposed to amend. As to the question of relevancy, what is meant by &#34; relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill?&#34; There is always room for difference of opinion as to what is relevant. It is all a question of degree. What might appear to one man to be relevant to the subject-matter of a Bill might appear to another man not to be so. For instance, on this particular question, it might be argued that the subject-matter of the Bill is the electoral law; that it is an amendment of the law effecting electoral questions. Therefore, it might be argued, the proposed amendment is relevant to the subject-matter. It depends upon the way in which you put it. But it seems to me that there is a great principle involved. That is this : On the second reading of a Bill we enunciate the principles contained in the Bill as drawn. Then the Senate goes into Committee to consider the Bill in detail. I do not agree with the proposition that the Committee could not amend this Bill in any particular except the particulars mentioned in it. I never stated that, and I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not say so. But I do say this - that when this Bill was read a second time, it did not contain the important principle &#39;that is now sought to be enunciated in it. </para>

They would say : &#34; If we bring down a Bill to amend the existing Act, the whole subject-matter of the Act will be open to discussion. It will all be raked in ; and, instead of having a short Bill which can be dealt with in a short time, we shall have a long general discussion, and, possibly, a radical alteration of the principal Act.&#34; I am very anxious that we should adopt a practice which shall be as convenient as possible to honorable senators, and which will restrict them as little as possible in the discussion of Bills. But at the same time, we should adopt a practice which will serve to carry on, the business of the Senate and the business of the country - which is tantamount to the same thing - with as little friction and inconvenience as possible; which will enable honorable senators, when they have passed the second reading, of a Bill, to know practically what that Bill is going to be, and which will prevent honorable senators in Committee from radically altering a Bill by introducing provisions novel to the Bill itself. </para>

                        <para>-  I looked up the cases referred to by the  Chairman  of Committees. I found that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker gave that ruling, he was opposed by some of the ablest members of the Senate ; and that when it came to a vote, the numbers were equal, eleven voting on each side. Ten senators besides the  President  voted in favour of his ruling, while eleven voted against him. It may be, perhaps, a very presumptuous thing for me to say, but I still believe that his ruling was wrong, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0&#39;</inline> Keefe was quite within his rights when he submitted his amendment. The whole crux of this matter is the question of relevancy. Standing order 196 says - </para>

                        <para>Bill. According to the best and most up-to-date dictionary which we have, the definition of relevancy is &#34; Bearing upon, connected with, pertinent to the matter in hand.&#34; I claim that on that definition my amendment must be accepted, because it is certainly bearing upon, connected with, and pertinent to, the matter in hand. I do not think there is any getting away from that. I hold, too, that there is no previous decision on this point. There were two other cases, namely, one in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> moved a proposition, and, later, one in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0&#39;</inline> Keefe submitted a proposal j but neither of them was exactly on all-fours with my proposal. This Bill does propose to amend section 150 of the Act, and its title is &#34;A Bill for an Act to amend the Electoral Act.&#34; That title is wide enough in itself to admit anything. It is proposed to amend section 150 of the Act in regard to the way in which votes axe to be recorded. I want to provide for the recording of the votes in a way different from that which the Government propose. I admit that it does alter the principle, but I fall back upon the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker, that the amendment is relevant, although it may contain a principle different from that which is in the Bill itself. </para>

                        <para>-  I have already admitted that. The fact that the Government propose to alter section 150 does make, I submit, my amendment relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. I do not think there is much in the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> with regard to the matter of the deposit. I do not consider that my amendment, if carried, would affect that matter. Nor do I think that there is anything in the statement that at the last election there were practically two parties. Under this system of voting it would not matter if there were- twenty parties. But granting that there were only two parties, in Victoria there were three parties, including a lady, who polled 60,000, which was more than all the votes in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a Bill to deal with the Constitution in any way but one to deal with the method of election. It is a measure to alter the Electoral Act. I am very glad to have the sympathy of the  Chairman  of Committees. I feel quite sure that he would be very pleased if this scheme were adopted, and so, too, would many other honorable senators. There is a number of honorable senators who have hitherto been pledged to this mode of voting. Another statement made was that there was no discussion on this matter at the second-reading stage. That position can hardly be sustained, because I read the amendment to the Senate, and spoke on it at some considerable length. I had the proposal printed and circulated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell also debated the matter, combating the ideas which I had put forward, so that, it cannot be said that there was no discussion at the second-reading stage. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with a point brought forward by the  Chairman  of Committees himself .as one of the reasons for declining to accept my amendment. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell spoke on the subject during .the second-reading debate. It cannot be said, therefore, that there was no discussion at that stage. With regard to the point as to obtaining from the Senate an instruction to t he Committee, I point out that in the .course of my second-reading speech I distinctly stated that I intended to move an amendment. I received no indication from the  President  or from any one else that that course could1 only be taken on an instruction to the Committee. I do not desire to say a word against the ruling of the former  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker. No doubt he discharged the duties of his office ably and conscientiously. But, after all, he was only human like the rest of us, and may have taken too narrow and restrictive a view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and the present  President  of the Senate were both opposed to his ruling. Apart from that, however, it is surely open to us to form a precedent of our own. and&#39; to reverse the former decision. President&#39;s decisions are not like the laws of the Medes and Persians. They can be altered. Surely an important question such as I desire to raise ought not to be shut out on a technicality. I contend that a system of proportional representation is a better and a sounder system than the prevailing one. The Committee ought to have an opportunity of expressing an opinion on that point. It is scarcely fair to myself, or to the electors of the Commonwealth, that so important a subject should not be debated upon its merits. I therefore trust that the ruling of the  Chairman  will not be upheld. </para>

                        <para>- I consider that the ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees, if upheld, would unduly restrict the rights of senators. I pay no regard at the present stage to the merits of the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment. This is not the proper time for so doing. But I contend that a reasonable reading of the standing order gives scope for a full consideration of the subject in connexion with such a measure as the Electoral Bill. Surely, as the Bill lays down how an elector shall vote, the method of voting is also a relevant matter, and an opening is afforded for Parliament, if it chooses, to alter the existing system. We shall be following precedents too blindly if on account of a decision formerly given, on a matter which may have been somewhat akin to this, but which certainly was not the same, we -were to deprive ourselves of the right of discussing this admittedly important matter. There would scarcely ever be an amendment which could be objected to on the same grounds if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Vardon&#39;s</inline> &#39;amendment were ruled out of order for the reasons given by the  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have brought down a Bill in which they propose to amend section 150 of the principal Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> simply proposes a further amendment of that section. The  Chairman  of Committees has ruled that as <inline font-weight="bold">President Sir Richard</inline> Baker has declined to allow a similar amendment to be discussed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment is out of order. My contention is that it is fully within the power of the Senate, and within the power of the  President,  with the consent of the Senate, to rule that the former decision was wrong, and to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment to be debated. There was a strong difference of opinion as to the former decision, and the President&#39;s ruling was upheld simply by his own vote. Only twenty-two senators out of a House of thirty-six voted. There were eleven on each side.  I  shall read the names from the division list. The ayes were Senators Croft, de Largie, Givens, Guthrie, Henderson, Higgs, Pearce, Stewart,  Story,  Turley, and O&#39;Keefe (teller). The noes were Senators Baker (the  President),  Dobson, Drake, Keating, Macfarlane, Playford, Pulsford, Styles, Trenwith, Walker, and Millen (teller). As the decision was so close, that is an additional reason why we should now review it. </para>

                        <para>-  If the decision had been arrived at in a full Senate, there might be something to be said from that point of view, but inasmuch as  President  Baker himself had to vote to uphold his own ruling, we may well take stock of the result. I think that  President  Baker, with all due respect to him, took rather a high hand in voting against the motion that his ruling be dissented from. The other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> when a motion of dissent was submitted concerning a ruling of yours, you did not vote. Had  President  Baker adopted the same attitude, the decision upon the records would have been entirely different. But is it to be Weld that because something was done in the first or second Parliament of the Commonwealth, it should stand as a precedent for ever?&#34; Is it not in the interests of the people of this country that we should allow free and full discussion on important points, and not rule them out on technicalities? I was very much surprised - indeed, it has been an education to me - to read what various members of the Senate said during the debate on the previous occasion. I see that you yourself, sir, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> said - </para>

If the former were carried, the repeal of half-a-dozen words in section 144 of the Electoral Act would effect no alteration in the machinery for carrying out parliamentary elections. It does not deal with a principle of the Act, but merely enables an elector to exercise his franchise in his own way. The Government think it is necessary to amend sections 143 and 145 of the Act, but, according to this ruling, it is not competent for the Senate to amend section 144. </para>

The Government are proposing to amend section 150 of the principal Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> wants to extend the proposed amendment. Surely when an amendment of an existing Act of Parliament is proposed, the whole principle of the section to be amended is brought under review. If it is thought advisable we can alter any provision proposed to be amended by the Bill under consideration. If that is not in accordance with parliamentary practice, I do not know what is. According , to the ruling of the  Chairman,  we are not entitled to submit an amendment which would alter the original Act, but I direct the honorable senator&#39;s attention to the fact that the Government have themselves proposed in clause 21 of the Bill an alteration of the same provision of the original Act. </para>

                    <para>The whole matter in dispute now is whether the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is relevant to the Bill before us. Without labouring details, an examination of the Bill from the title onwards goes to show thai it is a Bill to amend the existing Electoral Act. It proposes the amendment or that Act in many and various ways. To my mind, the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> the merits nf which I do not propose to discuss at this stage, is merely a minor amendment which does not deal with any important matter of principle as some honorable senators would have us believe. It deals with the question as to how the elector on whom we have conferred the franchise, shall exercise his vote - the limits within which he shall exercise it. </para>

                <para>That is exactly what we say in this case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment deals with the manner in which an elector shall exercise his vote, and the limits within which he shall exercise it. We are now arguing just as honorable senators opposite argued when a similar question was before the Senate on  the 26th October, 1905. If honorable senators are prevented from moving such an amendment they will be unduly restricted. All that we ask is for a free discussion of the proposals submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> and if the majority of honorable senators believe that it is not good in principle, or would not be in the best interests of the electors, it will be defeated. But it ought not to be defeated by being ruled out of order on a technicality. There are many honorable senators present who were not members of the Senate in 1905, and if they had been it is probable that they would have taken the view which you, sir, and honorable senators opposite, took on that occasion, when the ruling against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment was upheld by an equal vote. I hope that your decision will be that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment is relevant to the Bill, and let it be accepted or rejected by the Committee. It is your duty to decide whether the Chairman&#39;s ruling was right or wrong, and  1  submit that it was wrong. </para>

The standing orders from No. 323 to 328 deal with the reception of instructions to Committees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has contended that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> desired to have his amendment discussed, the proper course for him to have followed was to have asked the Senate to give an instruction to the Committee, and that, because he did not do that, he is now prevented from introducing his amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has based his ruling upon the Standing Orders dealing with instructions to Committees.

                <para class="block">That does not deal with the position before us to-day. I submit that these Standing Orders dealing with instructions to Committees are not applicable to the consideration of the question now before us. The only question which has to be decided is whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment is relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill which is under consideration by the Committee. The question of whether or not an instruction was given to the Committee is not under consideration. Standing order 327 does not limit in any way the right of any honorable senator to submit an amendment so long as it is relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> having been &#34; bitten,&#34; so to speak, is quite naturally inclined, out of respect for decisions given from the Chair, to say that what is sauce for one kind of bird must be sauce for another. But J submit that if a distinction can be drawn between the present case and that to which the honorable senator has referred, when a ruling was given by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker - which, with ail respect, I submit, was wrong - it ought to be drawn. If you, sir, as the guardian of our privileges, can see your way to do so, I think you should liberate us from adherence to .the very harsh precedent which was then established. I need scarcely remind honorable senators that on the occasion to which reference has been made, a Bill was submitted to this Chamber, which has since become the principal Act, arid that one great feature of that measure was the block system of voting. It provided that where the electors of a State were called upon to return three candidates to the Senate, they had no option but to vote for three. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, however, sought to allow an elector to abstain from exercising his full franchise, and to permit him, if he so desired, to vote for only one candidate. It will be readily admitted that such a proposal constituted an important and radical departure from the main principle of the Bill. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> proposal merely seeks to make the block vote more effective. Consequently, I hold that there is a very broad distinction between the two cases - a distinction which justifies a fresh ruling on the matter. Now, I come to the question whether or not the amend - ment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> is relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. This measure seeks to amend the principal Act in many important particulars. For instance, it is proposed to abolish postal voting ; but until the second reading of the measure was moved, we did not know what were its provisions. We now know that the Bill proposes to abolish certain privileges which have hitherto been enjoyed by electors., and to extend some of the provisions of the principal Act in another direction. Have the Government a right to say, in connexion with any Bill, that certain principles shall be considered, and no others? If the Government can bring forward a Bill providing for the abolition of postal voting, and for the extension of facilities for absent voting, how comes it that the Committee cannot, by amendment, extend or restrict the franchise, which is clearly the matter under consideration, from top to bottom? </para>

                        <para>-  Is not that the very purpose for which the Bill was brought in? It restricts the franchise in some directions, if not expressly, indirectly, by abolishing machinery which gives facilities for voting, and which the Government think has been abused. Both principle and machinery are involved in that amendment. If the Government can give expression in the Bill to a principle of the franchise or a principle of its administration, how comes it that a private senator has not the power in Committee, even without an instruction, to follow their example? We shall never know where we are if that distinction be maintained, and what is a growing evil will be intensified, the power of Parliament over Bills becoming gradually less and less. For these reasons, sir, I hope that you will see your way to rule that the amendment is in order. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has stated that the Government have introduced a Bill to amend the principal Act, and that, in doing that, they made provision for the abolition of postal voting and certain other essential principles. Because they took that course, he contends that any private senator ought to have the right to move amendments, not only in regard to any provision in the amending Bill, but also in regard to any provision in the principal Act.  1  dc not think that any honorable senator will follow him in that line of reasoning; the  Chairman  has ruled that, unless amendments are pertinent to the subject-matter of, not the Act, but the Bill, they are out of order. </para>

                        <para>-  It all depends. I may be wrong in the view I hold, but to me the matter seems plain and simple. In the principal Act we laid down clearly the manner in which every elector shall record his vote, namely, in a square, and that in that square there shall be placed a cross. This Bill does not in any sense alter that method of voting. No honorable senator can, by any stretch of the imagination, read into any provision of the Bill anything which would even suggest an alteration in regard to the method and manner of voting but by the abolition of postal voting, and by one or two other things which we have done- </para>

                        <para>-  I agree with the Honorary Minister that this is a matter with which we can deal without party feeling. It would be most unfortunate if the rules and methods of conducting business here were to be regulated by such a consideration. I take up the same attitude in this matter as I did in a matter with which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was connected not long ago, when I held that honorable senators are entitled to a reasonable amount of latitude in discussing public questions. I do not hold the view which some honorable senators seem to take, namely, that debate ought to be curtailed whenever it appears that some honorable senators are exercising reasonably the rights which are conferred upon them to discuss a public matter. While I am against a good deal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger&#39;s argument, I am utterly against the argument of the Honorary Minister. The latter argued, for instance, that the question of using a cross was a matter of principle, and, therefore, the Government did not propose to alter it. We consider that it is a matter of machinery, and not a matter of principle. I claim that honorable senators should be allowed a reasonable amount of latitude. We should uphold the rights of senators to discuss matters which are pertinent to the measures before the Senate. We have no better case than the one in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> was bitten, and possibly that has made him twice shy ever since. He went as closely as he possibly could to dealing with the general principles of an amending Bill, and he was ruled out of order. Let us see what the history of the case was. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of 25th October, 1905, he moved the insertion of new clause 42  a  to follow clause 42. I have been fortunate enough to get a copy of the Bill which was introduced here on the 30th September, and read a first time on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> Clause 42 reads - </para>

                        <para>-  This is the first time such a matter has cropped up during my experience as a senator, and it is certainly interesting. Arguments on both sides are strong. What we have to consider is whether we ought to limit the power of the Senate to deal with measures that come before it. I do not think that the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment were carried it would alter the whole party constitution of the Senate, has anything to do with the proposal to change the method of voting. The decision previously given was the result of a very close division, and there is good reason for considering the whole question afresh, with a view of determining whether the same stringency should be maintained on this occasion. The Bill covers the whole of the Electoral Acts passed from 1902 to 1909. If it were merely proposed to amend a section of the Act, one could understand an objection being taken to the amendment. But it is proposed to alter the whole law affecting elections. If the Chairman&#39;s ruling be upheld, it will place too much power in the hands of the Government in reference to amending Bills. It will mean that a private senator who desires to effect an amendment of the law of an important and far-reaching character will have to bring in a </para>

                </interjection>
                <para class="block">Bill of his own. Otherwise, under this decision, the Government will be able to block him. Even if he brings in a Bill of his own the Government can block him by not affording him the necessary time. The Bill is now in the hands of the Senate, which can deal with it as it chooses. It is proposed to strike out entirely section 150 of the existing Act. The provision is put in the melting-pot. It is therefore, I contend, well within the province of the Senate to discuss the whole principle of the section. Of course, it is a question of degree. Does the proposed amendment come within the relevancy line or not? That has to be decided. But we ought to be careful not to limit our power, because by so doing we shall limit the power of those who sent us here. </para>

If honorable senators do not act under the Standing Orders, or do not make themselves acquainted with them, it is their own fault. Any individual senator had two opportunities of proposing anything he liked in connexion with this Electoral Bill. He could either move an instruction to the Committee at the second-reading stage, or he could introduce a fresh Bill. Therefore, in no sense can it be said that by upholding the previous decision we curb or restrain our powers. If the argument that we do so were pressed to its logical extent, we should&#39; deprive ourselves of Standing Orders altogether, because at some point or other all standing orders tend to curb, not the powers of the Senate, but the desires of individual senators.  </para>

                        <para>- THis question seems to me to be one of principle. After considering it from all stand-points, I have come to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> amendment is not relevant to the Bill now before the Senate. It has been argued that a decision should be given from the Chair so as to admit of more latitude being extended to honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> contended that there should be an opportunity for general discussion upon this question, or upon any other question which may be submitted. Much has been said concerning the decision of  1905,  and some honorable senators seem to be under the impression that that decision limited the powers of honorable senators. At that time I was under the same impression, but since then standing orders have been brought into effect, which, if they had been in operation in  1905,  would have given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> an opportunity of moving his amendment. He should have moved an instruction to the Committee to consider the subject-matter of his amendment, and the Senate could have given the instruction had it thought fit. It has been laid down that the second-reading stage of a Bill is for the purpose of giving consideration to the principles it contains. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon, Senator Sayers,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger have contended that there was a fair amount of discussion concerning the principle of the amendment at the second-reading stage. But that has nothing to do with the interpretation of the Standing Orders. Whether several honorable senators discussed the principle, or only one did so, does not matter. The references to the subject were merely incidental. As a matter of fact, I believe that three senators referred to it on the last day of the second-reading debate. I feel sure that if there had been an alteration proposed involving the manner of voting included as one of the principles of the amending Bill, it would have taken precedence of a number of minor matters that were thought worthy of discussion on the second reading. </para>

This is a machinery Bill providing for the methods to be adopted at an election, and it lays down, amongst other things, the manner in which a balolt-paper shall be marked. It provides that it shall be marked, according to scheduleO, with a cross. It would be competent for any honorable senator to move that, instead of with a cross, the paper should be marked with a circle, a square, or any other device, or it might have been proposed to revert to the old method of striking out the names of candidates whom the voter did not wish to vote for.

                    <para>- I should like to direct the attention of the Committee, and particularly of the Government, to the difference between the proposition contained in these proposed new sections and that contained in the section which is to be struck out. It is proposed practically to legalize marks of identification upon a ballot-paper. We have heard a good deal during the consideration of this Bill about the secrecy of the ballot, but, if ever there was a proposition to enable the secrecy of the ballot to be destroyed, it is that embodied in this provision. The existing section 158 provides that a ballot-paper shall be informal if- </para>

                </list>
                <para class="block">Under the existing law, a ballot-paper so marked would be thrown out as informal. But what is proposed to take its place? We have, first of all in proposed new section 158, a proviso -  that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(c)</inline> shall not apply to any mark or writing placed upon the ballot-paper by an officer, notwithstanding that the placing of the mark or writing upon the ballot-paper is a contravention of this Act. </para>
                <para>That is followed by this still more extraordinary proposal - 1 58A.  Except as authorized by this Act or the regulation, an officer shall not place on any ballot-paper any mark or writing which would enable any person to identify the voter by whom it was used. </para>
                <para>The big difference is that previously the marks which were allowed were marks authorized by the Act itself. Now it is proposed to authorize marks by regulation. I do think that it is going a little too far, when, without any reason assigned, it is sought to place in the hands of departmental officials the right to authorize marks of identification upon ballot-papers. I trust that before we proceed any further the Minister will give some reason, other than the fact that the officials want it, for this extraordinary change. </para>

                        <para>-In the past, some officers accustomed to the practice hitherto obtaining in a particular State have inadvertently put numbers on ballot-papers, and the papers so marked have been considered informal, and the voters thus disfranchised. We do not desire that any, voter shall be disfranchised through an error of a departmental officer. We shall take the precaution of rigidly instructing all those intrusted with electoral work not to put any kind of mark on the ballot-papers. If they do, they will be punished for their wrong-doing under the proposed new section  158A,  but the ballot-paper will not be declared informal. I think the Committee should be pleased with such a provision. Surely honorable senators do not desire that a voter should be disfranchised because of a trifling error on the part of an electoral officer? Under the Government proposal, in such a case the officer will be punished, and not the voter. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has quite overlooked the point to which I directed his attention, which is that it is now proposed to permit the officers of the Department to say what marks shall be authorized, instead of providing for that by the Act itself. The Minister has not said a word on that point. I direct the attention of the Committee once again to the extraordinary attempt which is made by the officers of the Department to get everything into their own hands. This has previously been resisted in the Senate, and by no one more strenuously than the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking now of marks which may be put on ballot-papers, and which it is sought to legalize by the action of the Department instead of by the Act. I am not dealing with an officer who has marked a paper wrongfully. Under the law as it stands, the Act itself authorizes the marks which may be placed on ballot-papers. It is now proposed to amend the Act, and provide that marks may be authorized by regulation. Let me ask the Minister in charge of the Bill what marks of identification it is intended to sanction by regulation? </para>

                        <para>- That has absolutely nothing to do with the point I raise, and I cannot believe that the Minister does not know it. Let me suppose that a voter goes to the poll and casts his vote. The Returning Officer places upon the ballot-paper some mark which is not authorized. How can any power to make regulations help that? I am speaking of the regulation issued before a poll saying what marks should be placed on the ballot-paper. Let me ask the Minister whether it is intended under this provision to authorize the numbering of ballot-papers? What marks is it intended to authorize by the proposed regulations? I can understand a ballot-paper being marked with the initials of the Returning Officer. That is quite right. It is provided for in the existing Act, and there is a reason for it. But what other marks -are we going to legalize by regulation ? Let us know what they are, and the purpose of them. I ask the Committee not to be confused by the different matters to which the Minister has referred. The Minister says that if a Returning Officer wrongfully marks a ballot-paper the voter should not be disfranchised. I quite agree with him; but I am not dealing with that at all. The question with which I am dealing is whether Parliament, in the Act, or the Department shall say what marks are legal. </para>

                        <para>- It meets the point raised by the Minister ; that is to say that, if a vote is properly cast, no wrongdoing on the part of a Returning Officer will disfranchise the elector. But under the proposed new section 15 8a, departing from the present law, which leaves it to the Act itself to say what marks shall be legal, it is proposed that the Department shall have power by regulation to say what mark shall be legal. The Minister never discussed that proposition. I ask the Committee before it assents to it to join with me in asking the Minister what marks of identification it is desired to legalize by regulation. That is not an unreasonable request. Is the Minister making this proposal merely because the departmental officials desire it? Is he again going to display, I will not say the obstinacy, but the pertinacity which he admitted he unwarrantedly displayed on a former occasion? </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister&#39;s only reason for this clause is that it has hitherto been the practice in Victoria to put numbers on ballot-papers. I know of no other State in which that practice has been followed. I have had thousands of ballot-papers through my hands, and I have never seen them marked other than by the initials of the Returning Officer. I protest against the administration of Acts of Parliament by means of departmental regulations. We are all familiar with stories of electors who, it has been discovered, have voted in a certain way and have been punished for so doing. Under an entirely new system of voting the electors at the recent Victorian elections displayed a great deal of intelligence. This was clearly evidenced by the fact that the number of informal votes registered on that occasion was relatively small. Under this clause we are asked to vest Returning </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Officers with very great powers. I suppose that the next thing the Department will ask is that it shall be empowered to select the members of this Parliament without the people being consulted at all. I strongly object to giving Returning Officers more power than they at present possess. It cannot be denied that if a Returning Officer be a political partisan he can accomplish a great deal of mischief. Above all things, I wish to maintain the secrecy of the ballot. Under this clause many electors will probably say, &#34; I will not vote at all, because I cannot vote in the way that I desire without the fact becoming known, and without being punished for so doing.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The Returning Officers are officials of the Department. From the honorable Minister&#39;s remarks I gather that in Victoria a certain practice has been adopted under which a Returning Officer could ascertain . how any elector voted. That, I contend, is a bad system. In the other States the practice is to hand to an elector a ballot-paper, in one of the squares of which, opposite the name of the candidate for whom he desires to vote, he has merely to put his cross. Under that system there is no possible- way in which the Returning Officer can ascertain how an elector has voted. But if ballot-papers are to be numbered, the secrecy of the ballot, upon which we have hitherto prided ourselves, will be absolutely violated. I hope that the good sense of the Committee will reject the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- If a Returning Officer can &#34;stuff&#34; a ballot by that means, he can accomplish his purpose equally well by the omission of certain authorized marks. If we are going to make these exceptions, we should also devise some method under which, in cases such as I have indicated, the penalty should fall upon the defaulting official, and not upon the voter. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a Returning Officer who is actuated by corrupt motives from omitting to initial ballot-papers in the way that they should be initialed. </para>

If the result of an election has not been imperilled in any way by the admission of a ballot-paper, in my opinion, such ballot-paper should be admitted. I would go  further, and say that where a person enrolls an elector, but fails to forward his name for registration- </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I do not think, with honorable senators opposite, that all regulations are necessarily wrong because a number of things may be done more conveniently by regulation than by any other method. I cannot see what other possible means of identification or proof of honest possession of a ballot-paper can be demanded than the initialling of that paper by the presiding officer. If anything else is necessary to render the bal-  lot-paper safe&#39; we ought to know what it is. I do not think that the statement has been generally made that a number of persons have been accused of voting in a certain way, and penalized by their employers. </para>

                        <para>- The fear that it may be done is, I think, a reason for making the ballot-paper, and everything in connexion with the Act, as plain and simple as possible. I feel certain that a very large number of persons distrust the secrecy of the ballot. We do not want to feed them with reasons for entertaining that suspicion; but we desire, if possible, to remove in every legitimate way any reason for suspicion which may be aroused in the minds of voters, and which may keep them away from the polling booth. I certainly think that unless the Minister can give us a good reason why something else should be prescribed, he would be wise to consent to the elimination of the words. </para>

                        <para>- Then I ought to have one supporter. If this proviso is only meant to provide for what might be called the accidental inclusion of some mark which the Act says shall not be placed on the ballot-paper, in the same way if the Act says that certain marks or initials should be placed there, but by accident they are omitted, that omission should not rob the elector of his franchise. Let the officer who is guilty of this contravention of the Act, whether or not through neglect, be penalized in such . a way as the regulations may prescribe, but do not let the elector be disfranchised by either corruption or neglect on the part of the official. Where all our Acts fail is in not sheeting home the blame to the official to whom the neglect is due. In this measure we introduce - unwisely, I think - the principle of compulsory enrolment. Surely the object of that provision is to secure that the utmost possible number of votes shall be recorded? </para>

                        <para>- It might lead to that; but the writing of the name of the voter across the ballot-paper would be of no more consequence than a statement by him as to whom he voted for. If an official omitted to place a mark on a ballot-paper that should not render the vote informal, unless it is proved by the surrounding circumstances that it has led to fraud. A presiding officer could no more render a ballot-paper informal according to this Act by writing my name across it than he could by failing to initial it. In most cases these Bills, by reason of the stringency of various provisos and regulations, humbug and trash, introduce a thousand and one methods by which a man may be prevented from recording his vote, though pretending to give him. that opportunity. If we allow, as the proviso to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> does, a presiding officer to contravene the Act by writing anything he likes across a ballot-paper, and then, on the other hand, say that the ballot-paper shall not be informal by reason of that officer having violated the Act, but shall be informal if he violates the Act by omitting to attach his initials, we shall give a thing with one hand and take it away with the other.

                        <para>- Senators Barker and Millen are presupposing that a wholesale issue of unofficial ballot-papers would result in the stuffing of the ballot-box, but my amendment, if carried, will not authorize the handing out of a single ballot-paper without being initialled. It will not do away with the safeguard which the initialling is supposed to provide, nor will it have the effect of freeing any officer who fails to initial ballot-papers from the consequence of his neglect. But where a presiding officer, in turning over a number of ballot-papers, takes out two papers accidentally, and hands one over without initialling it, my amendment will safeguard the voter. The Minister stated that the first part of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> will protect the voter, because the official water-mark will still be on the ballot-paper. If he opens the door by providing that initialling is not absolutely necessary, and that a ballot-paper which is obviously a good one by reason of the water-mark, may be admitted, my amendment will not affect the water-mark. It simply provides that any mark or writing placed upon the ballot-paper or omitted from it by the presiding officer shall not render the ballot-paper informal. The amendment is perfectly safe, because it only provides for what the Minister says is already done. It makes that clear, and puts on the same footing an omission by an officer and the wrongful insertion of a name by an officer. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the Minister is quite clear in this matter. I think that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> points out a&#39; difficulty. It has been stated that a water-mark, or its equivalent, will be sufficient to admit a ballot-paper even though it does not bear the initials of the presiding officer. In the first place, that is rather risky. On one occasion the Returning Officer knew my political opinions as well as I knew his. By the purest accident two ballot-papers stuck together, and these he gave me, which he certainly would not have done intentionally. The first of the two ballot-papers was initialled. </para>

                        <para>- Is the watermark known beforehand only to the officers ? Does &#34; prescribed &#34; cover that? I am not clear as to what the word means. Will the officers be able to prescribe at the last moment what mark a Returning Officer shall put upon ballot-papers? Otherwise difficulty may occur. It may be advisable under certain circumstances to send a telegram to a Returning Officer, even on the morning of an election, instructing him to put a certain mark on ballot-papers for the purpose of making doubly sure that nothing wrong is dona. Circumstances may arise that may induce the office to believe that it is desirable to do so with the object of observing the purity and secrecy of the ballot. I believe our electoral officers to be absolutely free from the taint of corruption, and think that they should have that power of prescribing the marks to be placed upon ballot-papers. Although practically the whole of the Returning Officers in the past have been appointed by Governments which were not Labour Governments, I have sufficient confidence in them to believe that they can be trusted with this power. </para>

There was more in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> stated than some honorable senators realize. May I give an illustration ? An election took place two or three days ago at Port Fairy, the result of which was that a certain candidate was defeated by  54  votes. But there were  179  informal postal votes. They were informal, not owing to the fault of individual voters, but simply because certain duly-authorized witnesses did not comply with the State law. </para>

Let us assume that we do not know how those postal votes would have gone. Nevertheless, here was a candidate who was 54 votes behind, and had reasonable grounds for assuming that a considerable proportion of the disallowed postal votes would have been recorded in his favour. I have no hesitation in saying that the proviso to proposed new section 158 is absolutely necessary. It provides -  that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> shall not apply to any mark or writing placed upon the ballot-paper by an officer, notwithstanding that the placing of the mark or writing upon the ballot-paper is a contravention of this Act. </para>

                    attacked that proviso vigorously. Why? If a Returning Officer were a partisan - and I believe that the majority of Returning Officers are not - he could, except for this proviso, invalidate the vote of any elector whom he knew to be a political opponent, simply by placing a dot upon the ballot-paper. Suppose

                    himself happened to be a candidate, and that at a certain place a Labour partisan was presiding over an election. The person in question might have sufficient discretion to conceal his views, but might, nevertheless, be bitterly opposed to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers.</inline>
                    Except for this proviso he might, by placing a mark, as it were, accidentally, upon the ballot-papers of electors whom he knew to be supporters of

                        <para>- What is to prevent anybody importing paper of the same quality, and having the same water-mark as that used for ballot-papers by the Commonwealth Government? I believe it is an absolute necessity that ballot-papers should be properly initialed, and no ballot-paper should be valid unless it was initialed by a Returning Officer. If what the Minister says is correct the door is open as wide as possible for the committal of fraud. </para>

Russell has told us that he has had handed to him two ballot-papers, one with only a water-mark and the other with initials upon it. To regard a paper as formal that has not upon it the initials of the presiding officer is to open an easy way to fraud.&#39; A presiding officer may initial a paper and hand two papers to the voter. The voter could put the initialed paper into the box and take the other with him to his party booth, and in that way uninitialed papers might be marked in a party Committee room before they were taken into a polling booth to be used in recording votes. </para>

                        <para>- A presiding officer could not initial two ballot-papers for one voter without his action being noticed by the scrutineers. I have known presiding  officers to hand ballot-papers to electors without initialing them, and I have known a case in which an elector pointed out the omission, and asked that his paper should be initialed, as otherwise his vote would be declared invalid. I have been greatly surprised to learn that it is the law that an uninitialed ballot-paper may be declared formal. This only shows the danger of leaving such matters to regulation. I am certain that such a proposal would never have been agreed to in the Senate if honorable senators had been aware of it. This, however, is a case in which the elector has the  remedy  in his own hands, and if a ballot-paper has not been initialed by the presiding officer, he can request that the omission should be remedied. That cannot be said of the proposal now made, which I maintain opens the door to fraud by giving men the opportunity to commit fraud. </para>

                        <para>- I object to this proposal whether it is provided for by the Act or by regulation. Lists of regulations are tabled from time to time, and honorable senators generally do not know what they contain. I hope the Minister will not refuse to give any explanation, as he did when we desired to obtain some information from him, the other night. All we could get from the honorable senator was that a proposal was submitted for the convenience of the Department. I do not know whether the object of this proposal is to put more power into the hands of the Department, but I may say that I regard this as a departmental Bill. I should prefer to retain the old practice of having nothing on the ballot-paper, but the name of the candidates and the initials of the presiding officer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell said that a presiding officer might put a dot on a ballot-paper, but it would have to be a very small dot to escape the notice of the scrutineers. It is usual for a presiding officer to initial the ballot-papers in the presence of the scrutineers, and if he were to make any other marks upon them, it would be known. </para>

                        <para>- No; they are written by the presiding officer before the papers are handed to the electors. I have witnessed a great many elections, and I have never known a ballot-paper to be allowed to pass as formal that was not initialed by the presiding officer. If we  open the door to this kind of thing, the advantage will be to the man with most money. I like to see elections conducted fairly, and let the best man win, but if this kind of thing is to be allowed, we shall find hundreds of papers in the ballot-boxes without any initials upon them at all. </para>

                        <para>- lt was not a man on my side, but on the other side, who benefited by that. This proposal will open the door to a repetition of that kind of thing in Federal elections, and will give rise to a great deal of fraud, especially at small polling places in the different States, where there may be not more than thirty or forty resident electors. Candidates, unless they have money, cannot afford to send scrutineers there. Who will send scrutineers there? Obviously the men who possess plenty of means. </para>

                        <para>- I am not discussing the amendment at all ; I am debating the clause. But, apparently, the honorable senator wishes to &#39;open the door to more fraud. I do not see that his proposal is a workable one. I have seen thousands of ballot-papers counted, and not one of them was unsigned by the Returning Officer. The honorable senator is endeavouring to provide for a case which occurs very rarely. I say that each ballot-paper should bear the initials of the Returning Officer, and nothing more. If the Government intend to push this clause through, I am very sorry for them, because I feel certain that the electors do not desire the proposed alteration in our law. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that when the Government review the position they will recognise that we should, as far as possible, close the door against fraud. To my mind the Bill is repugnant to all principles of fair play. Its provisions may be manipulated so that they may work in two or three different ways. My contention is that where there is a likelihood of abuse we should endeavour to remedy it. Under the Bill a Returning Officer may, by an act which is not illegal, be able to ascertain how an elector voted. </para>

                    <para>. - I. do not intend to follow the bad example of my honorable friends opposite by attempting to retard the passing of this measure. It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> amendment involves the question &#39;of the initialing or non-initialing of ballot-papers by the presiding officers of polling booths. Now, either the initialing of those papers by these officers is or is not necessary. I can conceive of circumstances in which a very narrow margin of votes would result in a certain candidate being elected, and in which a few of the ballot-papers might not bear the initials of the presiding officer. In such circumstances, if the defeated candidate chose to contest the validity of the election, I think that his claim would be upheld. The proviso in its present form seems to me to penalize the voter for an act of commission on the part of the presiding officer. The necessary complement to such a provision is that a ballot-paper should not be rendered .informal merely because that officer has omitted to place upon it certain marks. Consequently, I contend that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is a perfectly logical one: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has said that the scrutineers of the respective candidates should see that no such omission occurred. But I would point out to him that there are hours on polling clay when it is impossible for the scrutineers to watch what the presiding officer is doing. We should leave no loophole of escape whatever. We should not trust to regulations, and if we insist that the placing of certain unauthorized marks upon a ballot-paper by the Returning Officer shall not disfranchise an elector, we should also insist that the omission to place authorized marks upon it should not disfranchise him. </para>

                    <para>A certain class of them is designed to prevent an election being upset on purely technical grounds when there is no doubt as to the expressed will of the electors. As an instance of this class of amendments, I would remind honorable senators of what occurred in connexion with a State election in South Australia. There, amongst other complications, certain postal votes were discarded, because the initials of the returning officer did not appear on the ballot-papers, although they had been placed upon the counterfoils. The Court held that as the counterfoils had been detached from the ballot-papers - although the officer who detached them testified to having done so - it was not competent for it to take such votes into account, although the will of the electors was clearly manifested. Some of the amendments embodied in this Bill seek to avoid a technicality of this kind. Under them it is intended that ballot-papers shall be printed upon a special kind of paper. That paper will bear a secret water mark, will be manufactured under the supervision and control of Government officials, and ballot-papers bearing that secret mark - even though the initials of the returning officer may be absent from them - will still be held to be valid, provided that the desire of the electors has been made sufficiently clear. At the same time it is not intended to dispense with the initialing of ballot-papers by returning officers. But should it be found that inadvertently a properly authenticated ballot-paper, clearly evidencing the wish of the elector, does not bear the initials of the returning officer the election cannot be invalidated on that account. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable senator would be the last person in the Commonwealth to attempt to do a thing of that kind. It would be much easier, much quicker, and much less costly to try to forge the initials of the officer intrusted with the ballot-papers. In addition to the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department, other Departments of the Commonwealth would be interested. The honorable senator might be able to give an order, and get a paper somewhat like the paper which is used, but, as certain paper is dutiable, the shipment would have to pass through the hands of the Customs officials. So that he would have to run great risk and danger if he attempted to do anything of the kind. In these circumstances, I trust that the Committee will not seriously entertain the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The Honorary Minister has stated very correctly what was intended should be the practice of the Department in regard to the paper to be used for voting purposes. Although I cannot now, after the lapse of two years, recall exactly the precautions which were taken, I remember that the very great fear which was in my mind when  1  was introducing the Bill was quite set at rest by the precautions which were disclosed to me by the officials of the Department. And  1  feel confident that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> if he should at any time feel animated by a desire to act in that way, which I do not expect, would find it absolutely impossible to forge the paper. I think that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is not only unnecessary, but would, if carried, be extremely harmful. Under the Acts Interpretation Act the singular includes the plural. If I read his amendment aright, it would have the effect of dispensing, not merely with the initials of the presiding officer, but also with the water-mark. He does not want that, I am sure.  His  amendment would be distinctly harmful, unless, of course, he wants votes to be cast on any ordinary piece of paper. I feel satisfied that he does not seek that. The effect of his amendment, if adopted, would be to validate a ballot-paper which contained neither the initials of the presiding officer nor the prescribed watermark. </para>

                        <para>- I think it leaves it pretty clear that both marks are expected to be on the ballot-paper, should the question ever come before a Court. It would be clearly arguable by lawyers as to&#34; whether a mere water-mark was sufficient. I think it is very doubtful as to which way a Judge would interpret the paragraph. If, however, the clear intention is to admit a ballot-paper which, by inadvertence, has not been initialed by the presiding officer, and not to disfranchise, the elector, there cannot be any possible harm in saying so in words which will be beyond dispute. The fact that various opinions have- been expressed is proof that the paragraph is not clearly worded. My view is that every provision in a measure should be expressed in clear and emphatic language. If the Ministry and the Opposition favour this idea, they ought to have no objection to the use of words which would be unequivocal, and which would be complementary to the proviso in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> that .the use of unauthorized marks shall not invalidate a ballot-paper. If, on the one hand, it does not free the presiding officer from his legal obligation not to use unauthorized marks, and, on the other hand, it makes it obligatory upon him to initial a ballot-paper, my amendment will not in any way free him from his liability, but will tend to make it absolutely clear that an elector shall not be penalized by an offence committed by the officer. I realize that, while I have had the extreme pleasure of supporting a Labour Government, I have also had the experience, which I did not expect to have, that they are so absolutely perfect that no word, let alone a sentence, no crossing of a &#34; t,&#34; or dotting of an &#34; i,&#34; can possibly be wrong in anything which they propose. Therefore I shall not bother my head about attending here or considering any measure in the future, because I know that anything coming from the Opposition is more likely to receive attention than anything coming from this side of the Chamber. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it is a matter of regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> should adopt this attitude to the Minister. I am rather inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> except that I cannot exactly follow the meaning of his amendment. The clause provides that a ballot-paper shall contain certain marks, and he proposes that it shall be equally valid whether it contains those marks or not.&#34; I feel quite certain that is not what he means. </para>

                        <para>-I should imagine that my honorable friend could get in the amendment at the end of the proviso to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> What we want to insure, I think, is that where the presiding, officer makes a mistake, by omission or otherwise, the ballot-paper, shall not be regarded as informal. I remember a case which occurred at a general election held in Queensland in 1896. At Mirani, in North Queensland, something like 300 votes were cast. There was no Labour candidate. The majority of the votes were cast in favour of what we might call the Radical candidate, and the balance - a comparative minority - in favour of what we might call the Conservative candidate. </para>

                        <para>- That is why I am with my honorable friend to a certain extent. The argument used against the validity of the papers was that an elector had to fold his ballot-paper in such a way that when he placed it in the ballot-box the presiding officer could see how he had voted, because at that time voting was effected by scratching out names of candidates for whom electors did not wish to vote. I am not going to say that if a ballot-paper was put in the box without any mark whatever upon it, it ought to be considered formal. </para>

                        <para>- In 1883 there was a general election in Queensland. In a certain township a gentleman was standing for election, who, years afterwards, became a member of this Senate. At the time to which I refer he stood in the Labour interest; he became a reformed character. The method resorted to on that occasion was this : A man entered the polling booth and obtained a ballot-paper. He went into a compartment, where he was supposed to mark the paper ; but, as a matter of fact, he did not do so, but came out with a blank sheet of paper about the same size as the ballot-paper, and put that into the ballot-box. Then he went across the road with the ballot-paper in his pocket, and handed it to the members of the Committee of a certain candidate. It was a very simple matter for them to mark the ballot-paper in accordance with their wishes, and pass it on to another elector, who went into the polling booth, obtained a ballot-paper of his own, put into the ballot-box the paper which the Committee had marked, and brought the unmarked ballot-paper out with him again. That was done over and over again. </para>

                        <para>- And I suppose that &#39;the Labour party have since perfected the method. I quite realize the force of the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has been trying to make. What he means, I suppose, is that if you have ballot-papers properly watermarked, it does not really matter whether a presiding officer omits to put his initials on a certain ballot-paper, and that omission ought not to make a vote informal. I need not remind those who have had much experience of elections that at busy polling places a presiding officer, with a bundle of ballot-papers in front of him, will rapidly initial them and pass them out to his poll clerk, and that it is quite possible for him to hand out two ballot-papers at once, though he has only initialled one. In such a case there is no intention to defraud or do anything wrong. I hold with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that an uninitiated ballot-paper should not for such reason be invalidated. I suggest that he should ask the Government to see whether, when the Bill reaches another place, this clause cannot be amended. He might approach Ministers in his most diplomatic manner. He might suggest that the clause should be recast to provide that a vote shall not be informal through lacking certain initials. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be admitted that this clause is not free from certain confusion. I wish to find out, for my own information, whether or not it is necessary, or allowable, that a Returning Officer shall place a mark upon a ballot-paper independently of his initials and of the private watermark. If the Minister says &#39;that such an additional mark cannot be placed upon the ballot-paper, I am curious to know what is the object of the particular proviso which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> proposes to amend. Personally, I do not think that it matters much whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> amendment is carried or not. The position appears to me to be that a ballot-paper can be invalidated on account of certain things, one of which is the omission of the Returning Officer&#39;s initials or the official water-mark. That position is safeguarded by proposed new section 151, which requires a voter to mark his ballot-paper in the manner prescribed by the regulations. I presume that those words are for the purpose of safeguarding the position of the presiding officer. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; proposed new section 158A penalizes the officer. I quite understand the purpose of that provision. It is intended to prevent the putting of marks upon ballot-papers that are not authorized. </para>

                        <para>- But I cannot understand the proviso at the end of the first part of proposed new section 158. The two provisions appear to me to apply in a positive and a negative direction. It must be remembered that this clause will apply after ballot-papers have been distributed all over the Commonwealth, and have come into the possession of officers in charge of elections in different districts. It is clear that, under the proviso, if it becomes law, marks so placed on ballot-papers by officers would not make votes informal. Why should this superadded power be given to any officer in any district to place marks on ballot-papers in addition to initials? I think that instead of proposing to amend this proviso we should ask why it appears in the Bill at all. I have already said that it can only operate after the ballot-papers are in the hands of the Returning Officers throughout the Commonwealth, and then it is provided that though a presiding officer may mark a ballot-paper in contravention of the Act the paper shall not be regarded as informal. We should guard the secrecy of the ballot by requiring the initials of the presiding officer on a ballot-paper having the secret water-mark. I am not prepared to support a proposal giving officials the power to put any other marks on the ballot-papers. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> argument was that if this proviso were passed an Electoral Officer would be enabled to so mark a ballot-paper as to be able ro identify the voter. I say that what is proposed by this Bill is that an officer guilty of such an offence shall be liable to a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,io.</inline> What object could an Electoral Officer have in putting a private mark on a ballot-paper to enable him to find out how an elector voted? He could, if he were a designing man, do that kind of tiling in any circumstances, and what is here proposed is that he shall be fined for doing anything of the kind. I cannot understand why so much time has been taken up in discussing a provision which is so very plain. </para>

I have heard honorable members on both sides say that electors have many times been disfranchised through some remissness of duty on die part of persons intrusted with responsibility at an election. In order that that may not occur in future, provision is made for the use of a certain kind of paper that cannot be easily forged, and if a presiding officer neglects to do his duty he will be fined, but the voter will not lose his vote. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Minister was speaking I interjected that the delay in the consideration of this clause has been due to his obstinacy. I now repeat the statement in all sincerity. If the provision were as perfectly clear as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would have us believe there would have been no room for discussion upon it. Of what use is it for the honorable senator to say that there will be regulations dealing with this matter, or to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Senator M&#39;illen&#39;s</inline> speech on the introduction of a Bill. The speech quoted was admirable in its way, but it is not a part of the law of this country. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> referred to me as a new chum here, I have been a long time in other places, and I have known Ministers as eminent as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> who, when any doubt was expressed about the terms of a regulation, were prepared to read it. </para>

                        <para>- There is always trouble in dealing with people who are absolutely perfect. My amendment might, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, do more than I desire, but it certainly would put this matter in plain language, and it is better that we should adopt a provision which will not be open to argument in the Law Courts. The suggestion that the draftsmanship of this Bill is absolutely perfect is discounted  by the discussion that has taken place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has just mentioned a point which was not referred to before, and which further emphasizes the looseness with which this clause has been drafted. We have been told by the Minister that there is an alternative. That means certainly a choice of two things, and in this case a choice of the official water-mark or the initials of a presiding officer. </para>

                    <para>. - In my judgment, if ever a provision was clear and capable of bearing only one interpretation, it is that which is now under consideration. There is but one set of circumstances in which a ballot-paper can be printed with a certain watermark upon it, which is known only to the Government until it is issued to a presiding officer. Almost every honorable senator has complained from time to time that ballot-papers have been rendered invalid for reasons which on the face of them were absolutely wrong. Sometimes they have been invalidated by the act of an official. This provision makes it clear that if the officer charged with the duty of initialing a ballot-paper neglects to discharge that duty, the water-mark upon such paper shall be sufficient to prevent the disfranchisement of the elector. I disagree with those honorable senators who urge that this proviso will confer on presiding officers the power to place particular marks upon ballot-papers. It is quite clear that only the presiding officer at a polling booth and his poll clerk can handle a ballot-paper prior to its reaching the elector. Consequently, this provision rightly assumes that there can be no motive for either of the officers mentioned wrongfully marking a ballot-paper, save that of invalidating the vote of the elector. That being so, the clause provides for the imposition of a penalty upon the officer responsible for such marking. </para>

                <para class="block">Section  139,  which deals with absent voting, is in no sense covered by proposed new section  158.  The latter deals with the ordinary voting, while absent voting is dealt with under a fresh set of regulations. Proposed new section  158A  provides that an officer shall not place a mark of identification on a ballot-paper unless he is authorized to do so by the regulations. Reverse that, and it means that the Government ask power by regulation reauthorize an officer to put on a ballot-paper a mark of identification ; not a mark to identify the ballot-paper and prevent  a  fraudulent paper from being used, but  a  mark which will enable the officer to identify the voter. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister knows what I mean. A water-mark, for instance, is a mark of identification for the ballot-paper; that is, to see that  a  fraudulent paper has not been used. Suppose that the regulations decreed that the presiding officer should number the ballot-papers. The numbering is not in any way necessary to prevent a fraudulent ballot-paper from being used; but it will enable the officer and those present in the polling-booth to identify the voter, because when they come to open the ballot-papers they will remember that No.  1  ballot-paper was issued to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-so.</inline> They could, as it were, trace the vote of&#34; every elector who went to the poll. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. What we are asked to do is to give the Department power, by regulation, to authorize these marks of identification. Hitherto the Parliament has kept in its own hands the right to say what marks should go on  a  ballot-paper. In loyalty to the principle of the secret ballot, or in justice to ourselves, we ought, before we grant this power, to have at least some reason put forward for the proposed change. I appeal to the Minister to give us a reason. To my mind, it seems fraught with danger to say that the Department shall, by a mere regulation, authorize an officer to place a mark on a ballot-paper which will enable him later to identify the voter. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not accept the amendment. It is not the intention of the Government, ;nor is it the desire of the Department, :that those intrusted with responsible work in connexion with elections should have the power under regulations to put any mark other than initials on the bulk of the ballot-papers. In this Bill we are doing what has never been done before since the establishment of Federation. Any voter who is absent from the division in Which he resides, and for which he is enrolled, can go into any polling-booth in the Commonwealth and record his vote. Whether he is out of his division and in his State, or out of his State and in another State, he can vote. </para>

                        <para>- Notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stated, the object of this provision is to guard against any fraud or dishonesty on the part of those who record their votes in any part of the Commonwealth, particularly outside the divisions for which they are enrolled. It is necessary that every precaution should be taken to protect all parties and all candidates against imposition and fraud. It must not be imagined for a moment that the placing of a number on an envelope or on a ballot-paper will at once convey to an officer the name of the voter and the way in which he recorded his vote. If. such was the case, it is as certain as night follows day that a provision in the . Electoral Act of two States would have been, repealed long since. In. Victoria, this&#39; principle has been operative* almost since we have&#39; had responsible government. </para>

                        <para>- I feel sure that every honorable senator is anxious to make our elections as pure as possible, and to prevent any possibility of fraud or dishonesty on the part of any electors. If occasion arises, it may be necessary so to frame regulations that probably numbers may be put on ballot-papers, which would, in the event of circumstances arising, be positive proof of dishonesty or fraud on the part of those who might personate electors. By means of these numbers we might not only be enabled to knock out fraudulent votes, but also to punish those guilty of such malpractices. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister has spoken of the practice in. Queensland. I do not think he knows much about it. In fact, I am positive that he does not. I will describe what takes place. When an elector enters a polling booth he gives his name. He is marked off&#34; on the roll, and a ballot-paper is handed to him. That ballot-paper contains his number on the roll, which number, however, is gummed down in a corner of the paper. Nobody can see it, and it is never revealed except by order of the Judge in the event of a case arising for investigation. The n umber is put on the paper for the purpose of detecting personation. If a man personates another at a Queensland election, and the rightful voter afterwards asks for his ballot-paper, he is entitled by law to get it. His number is put on that ballot-paper exactly as it was put on the paper already used. But the vote so recorded is not counted unless there is an appeal. Then the only authority who can order that number to be inspected is the Judge appointed for the purpose. But even then no one actually sees the number but the Judge&#39;s Associate. By this means a personated vote is identified, and the rightful&#39; voter gets his vote. Voting in Queensland is absolutely secret. The Minister, when he spoke of the Queensland system, did not tell the Committee that the numbers are gummed down, and that it is impossible for any one to see them. </para>

                        <para>- But in Queensland everything is provided for in the Act. Take the election for South Brisbane, in  1888,  when the late Henry Jordan was the defeated candidate. It came to his knowledge, and that of his scrutineers, that  a  certain amount of personation had taken place. I. was in Brisbane when the investigation took place, and went into Court to see what happened. The Judge&#39;s Associate opened the gummed-down portions of the ballot-papers until he came to a number corresponding to the number on the roll of a person who had been personated. The Judge then disallowed the personated vote,. and allowed the right elector to get the benefit of his vote. In the result Jordan secured election by about twelve votes, the personated votes being sufficient to affect the result. It is wholly illegitimate to try and draw a comparison between that system and the one which the Government propose. The Minister wants to have the power to number papers as the Government think fit. He and his friends might want to discover how certain people voted. In that case they would order a returning officer to put a mark on the ballot-papers. </para>

                    <para>- It is a matter for regret that the Minister should have dragged Queensland into the arena.  His  only reason for doing so was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> and I have made remarks concerning the practice in that State. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> has explained concerning the numbering of ballot-papers is quite correct. They are numbered under the law. But when a ballot-paper is handed to an elector, the number is securely gummed down, and is never afterwards revealed, unless a case goes before the Elections and Qualifications Committee. In that event, if a charge of personation is made, and the number of an elector who has been personated is 288, the Judge&#39;s Associate opens papers with a knife until he comes to papers numbered 288, whereupon the personated votes are counted and the fraudulent one is rejected. What is the proposal now before us ? It is that under regulations the Government may prescribe what marks shall be placed upon ballot-papers. This is an exceedingly nasty trick that the Government are trying to play upon the electors. Say that an election is to take place in April. Towards the end of the preceding December, after Parliament has risen, the Government can issue regulations authorizing the placing of marks upon ballot-papers. I should not mind if we had the assurance that the marks proposed to be put on are such as are used under the Queensland law. But the Minister actually tells us that numbers may be put on certain ballot-papers, but not upon the bulk of them. What does that mean? Does it mean that a certain chosen number of ballot-papers are to be numbered, whilst the great bulk will be unnumbered? The Minister nods his head when I put the question in that way. We are to understand, then, that under regulations the Government propose to number a certain proportion of votes in different parts of Australia? The secrecy of the ballotlies in all ballot-papers being similarly marked. But here we have a great Democratic Labour Government coming down to Parliament, and saying, &#34; We are going to pick out a certain number of special ballot-papers, and put an identifying mark upon them.&#34; I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was rather stretching a point when he brought up this matter, but the Minister himself has said far worse things about the proposal than the Leader of the Opposition did. The Minister has been driven into a corner, and has been obliged to admit that this has nothing to do with absent voters. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not understand his own Bill. This clause was evidently drafted in a hurry to please some friends of the Government outside, who think that with a new Electoral Bill they may be able to carry an election or a referendum. When a reference is made to the Queensland law, I say that the practice adopted in Queensland is provided for in the Statute. The Minister tells us now that this provision will not apply to the great bulk of the electors, and it would appear that the object is to be able to discover how votes are recorded by certain people in certain places. I gather from the Minister&#39;s interjection that it is intended to apply only to absent voting, but I would ask the honorable senator to tell the Committee how he connects this clause with the absent voting provisions of the Bill. At present, we are lost in a maze of contradictory explanations from the Minister and his supporters. If the Government are clear as to what they want, I would suggest that they should follow the practice of Victoria and Queensland, which have been quoted, and insert these innocent harmless provisions that have been spoken about in the Bill itself. We may not agree to their insertion in the Bill, but if they  are inserted there, at least it will not be possible to alter them by regulation. </para>

                    <para>. - As this proposal is being discussed, some extraordinary and unexpected information is drawn from the Minister. It must now be plain that the proposed new section 158A is capable of at least three interpretations. First of all, if an officer makes a mark of identification upon a ballot-paper which a regulation, about which we know nothing, would authorize him to make, he cannot be punished. Then it is explained by the Minister that the proposed new section does not mean that at all. After about three hours discussion, we are informed that it is intended to apply to the absent voting provisions. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister, to support his position, has referred us to the Victorian and Queensland Acts, in which a method is adopted by which, under certain conditions, it is possible to identify a voter. It may be admitted that, under a system of absent voting, some provision must be made for identification, in order to prevent personation, or to punish it where it takes place. That is the sole reason why, in Queensland, every ballot-paper is numbered. &#39; We are told by the Minister that it is possible that that will be done under this Bill in some cases, but if that be so, why do not the Government follow the Queensland precedent? The Queensland practice has been clearly explained, and honorable senators must recognise how effective it is for the prevention of personation, whether the voting takes place in a division, outside of it, or by post. Under the Queensland law, when an elector applies for a ballot-paper, he has to state his number on the electoral roll. That number is marked upon the ballot-paper, and is then sealed down. If, subsequently, another elector gives the same number, there is at once a presumption of impersonation, and the Act provides the means for detecting it. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate he says so. It is to be presumed that the Queensland and Victorian Governments also desire to preserve the secrecy and purity of the ballot. Accordingly, the Acts passed by the Parliaments of those States clearly define the formalities and the informalities of a ballot-paper. Under the Queensland Act only one little matter is left to regulations. But in this Bill the very opposite policy has been adopted. I ask the Government if the Senate is not as competent to deal with this matter as they are themselves? But over and over again we find that this regulation or that regulation governs certain clauses of the measure. I say that the matter is too important to the electors either to be left in doubt on the one hand or to regulations on the other. Honorable senators are, doubtless, familiar with the opera called <inline font-style="italic">The Grand. Duchess,</inline> and with the scene in it in which the handsome Sergeant Fritz is ogled by the Grand Duchess. The handsome sergeant feels the delicacy of the position, and we all know what he said on that occasion. I am sure that the Minister and very many of his supporters occupy a somewhat similar position to-night in that they are inclined to say &#34; Oh ! damn the regulations.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am not quite certain that the services of a policeman are not required under the circumstances. Instead of reading the provision in a negative form I ask the Committee to read it in an affirmative form.I ask honorable senators to suppose that the regulations may authorize an officer to place on a ballot-paper a mark which will enable the voter to be identified. The Honorary Minister has admitted that this is practically the purpose of the provision. He has acknowledged that it is intended to number certain ballot-papers so as to enable the officials, not merely to identify the voter, but also to know the way in which he voted. If we are going to adopt that system we ought to adopt it in the Act itself, and not leave it to a regulation to be framed by any official. But are the Committee prepared to sanction a system under which we are going to destroy the secrecy of the ballot? </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> may advocate a system under which we can track every voter, but I do not think he will publicly declare that he is in favour of any official being enabled to place such a mark on a ballot-paper as will permit him to ascertain how each elector votes. If we are to have a system of numbered ballot-papers,  we ought to provide for it in the Act itself, and make it apply generally. But to make the iniquity greater, the Minister says, in effect, &#34; You need not be so severe upon us, because we do not propose to number all ballot-papers.&#34; Then what sort of system are we going to adopt? Are we to have numbered ballot-papers at the polling booths in the division of Bourke, in New South Wales, but not in other electoral divisions? The Minister has got himself into all this trouble because he has not obliged the officers advising him to fully disclose to him exactly the system which they contemplate, and because he has not informed the Committee of it. He may feel very confident in his big majority, and may thus be induced to believe that he is under no obligation to tell the Committee the nature of the system which it is intended to introduce. </para>

                        <para>- Sometimes I take to myself one of the attributes of Providence, and vote with the big battalions. But I vote with them only when they are  right. If there be one characteristic of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> which impresses me more than another it is that he seems positively to revel in being in a hopeless minority. I repeat that the Minister is largely to blame for the time which has been occupied in discussing this clause, because he has not taken the Committee into his confidence, and because the Bill itself is absolutely silent as to the system which is to be introduced. I am absolutely staggered that honorable senators should be prepared to swallow a Bill which discloses nothing of the machinery to be adopted, but leaves everything to regulation, both in regard to ordinary voters and absent voters. There is not one member of the Committee who can tell us to what he is assenting in this clause. It is a very serious reflection upon the Committee, collectively and individually, when we find honorable senators supporting a system of which they know absolutely nothing. The Minister has merely said - as if he were weighted down by some great secret of State - &#34; I must have this power to make regulations, in order to carry out the provisions of the Bill relating to absent voting.&#34; It may or may not be necessary for him to have this power. We do not know. Senators de Largie, Needham, Rae, and Henderson do not know. </para>

                        <para>- But what is the Act? Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> explain to the Committee the method under which it is proposed to allow electors who desire to vote out of their electoral divisions to do so? The Minister has not told us. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> can explain that &#39;method, let him confer a favour on the country by informing us as to what is proposed. Let him disclose to us the system which the Minister says can be effectively dealt with only by this extraordinary power of regulation. Although I am by no means a novice in parliamentary life, I do not recollect, during the sixteen or seventeen years of my experience, any occasion upon which a House has been asked to swallow a Bill the purpose of which has not been disclosed. Yet here we have two provisions, one dealing with absent voting&#34;, and the other with voting before the poll is taken. Not a single senator, not even the Minister, can tell the Committee how it is proposed that these votes shall be cast. The proof of that is to be found in this proposal. Why does the Minister want this power to do everything by regulation? He does not know yet what the Government propose to do, and, therefore, he cannot put anything in the Bill. He does not know what is intended, nor does the Department. If, however, they do know, they -are frightened to tell us what they want. Let us examine a little more in detail some o&#163; the Minister&#39;s statements. First, he said that it was necessary to have the right to place marks of identification, on ballot-papers. Let me interpolate here that he was clear and definite at least, on this point that he wants power to authorize the use of marks of identification, because it is necessary in order to check, fraud. This new system of voting is to be launched with the assurance of the Minister that we have to run either the risk of fraud, or, in order to prevent that risk, the risk of the secrecy of the ballot being, destroyed. That is the first conclusion which we can, draw from the Minister&#39;sstatement. He went on to say that it is absolutely necessary that the power of regulation should be given. Is the Committee prepared to pass any provision, simply on the Ministerial assurance that it is necessary ? Ought we not to&#62; be told why it is necessary ? Are we to sit down here and, knowing that after all in this matter the Minister is simply a speaking-tube through which others are addressing the Chamber, take that assurance that it is necessary, without probing; a little further and asking him to say why it is necessary ? He can only say why it is necessary by disclosing the proposed methods in which absent voters will be required to cast their votes - a point or* which the Bill is silent. I ask the Committee to consider the spectacle which it must present to such of the electors as take an interest in its proceedings. Not one senator knows the system which is to be introduced under this proposal, yet he is asked to give a blind assent to it. The Minister said that this power was required more particularly with regard to absent voters. If the provision had been limited to that it would not be so objectionable as it is, but power is sought to put these marks of identification on all ballot-papers. The Minister says he only wants it for the new system of voting. Why was not the provision worded to limit its operation to that? lt deals with all ballot-papers. A more scandalous inroad upon the secrecy of the ballot was never attempted. If, as the Minister said, this power is only necessary in the case of absent voters&#39; papers, why does he take power to mark all ballot-papers? Why should an elector, who votes in the ordinary way, be liable to have his ballot-paper marked? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister uses the word &#34; probably.&#34; Why should the regulations do it? Are we to give up our legislative duly and responsibility altogether and leave this work to the officers of the Department? If so, we might just as well pass one clause providing that the people of Australia shall be entitled to vote under regulations, and leave it all to the mighty -massed intellect of the Home Affairs Department, directed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> to say how they shall be fashioned. The thing has become ridiculous. All the vital principles of the Act are to be eliminated, and, in their place, power to make regulations is to be taken. The Minister knows better than I do that, if this proposal had been made by any other Government, he would have been the very first to denounce it, but because he has allowed himself to become putty in the hands of officials he has not, I feature to say, thought out these matters for himself, but has really taken them as they have come -to him. He is doing not only an injustice to his past career, but an injustice to the Senate, because no one has fought more strenuously than he has done for the right of the Senate to discharge its duty and to exercise that control which it ought to have over electioneering and other matters. Let us assume that this power of numbering the ballot-papers of individual electors, so that an official can keep track of the way in which any elector votes, is necessary, though I deny it altogether. It is a serious reflection, either on the capacity of the officials, or their energy, that they could not have devised some other system. But if it is necessary to have the power of identification, it is for Parliament itself to deal with the matter in the Bill, and to say what the marks of identification shall be. The Minister appealed to the laws of Victoria and Queensland. Why does he not accept their verdict? If they furnish any argument at all it is in support of the contention that it is Parliament, and not a Department, who ought to shape the law. If the Minister wants the power to number the ballot-papers let him say so openly, and deal with the matter in the measure. Otherwise let him tell us that what is intended is something much less serious than that. Any one who has had some experience knows that whatever power is given to a Department will be used to the fullest extent. It is a lamentable commentary, both on our proceedings and on the whole tendency of Departments to gather this power to themselves, that they never once state frankly what they want. Here is a case in point : There was no attempt on the part of the Electoral Office to tell us that it is intended to number ballot-papers until the Minister, as the result of a long discussion, felt compelled to disclose what was in its mind. That ought to act as a warning to honorable senators. The first duty of the Department, and of the Minister, ought to be to state the reason underlying; a proposed amendment of the law. But never, iri the whole course of the proceedings on this Bill, has the Minister anticipated a discussion, or when a proposed&#39; change has been submitted from the Chair, volunteered a reason for it. Invariably we have had to fight, dig, and hammer away until he has been compelled to reluctantly give us some of the information to which we were entitled. There ought not to be any party aspect about this matter. Let every honorable senator quietly commune with himself and. ask this simple question : Am I in favour of a number or mark being placed on a ballot-paper which will enable an official to identify the voter.? If honorable senators are in favour of that, they can lightheartedly vote for the provision. If not, I appeal to them to urge the Government to postpone the consideration of the clause, with a view to asking the Department to see if it cannot devise some other means of preventing&#39; the fraud which it appears to fear. To my mind, this is one of the most serious matters with which we have been confronted. We have been striving for years to uphold before the world the great beauty of the Australian ballot, and its chief feature was its secrecy. This is putting in the thin edge of the wedge, which, if driven home, will ultimately destroy that secrecy, so far as absent voting is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Yet the honorable senator finds fault with this Government for doing what they think necessary in the interests of the Act and its administration. Some time ago I said that we were doing more than any previous Government had done in the way of offering facilities to persons to exercise their vote, no matter where they may be located. When I referred to absent voters, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knew what I was referring to. He need not have referred to proposed new section 139a, which deals with a different matter. I call an absent voter a man who is absent from the division in which he lives, and for which he is enrolled. As we are making provision for any adult to record his or her vote in any part of a State or division, or even outside a State, we want to take precautions against fraud and personation ; and we believe that it will be necessary to pass regulations providing, not for the nullification of the secrecy of the ballot, but for identifying a forger or a personator in case of an election being challenged. No one, for a moment, thinks that we can desire to pass regulations solely for the purpose of fossicking out the way in which any man or woman votes. That is not the intention at all. The bulk of the ballot-papers will have upon them no other mark than the initials of the responsible officer. But regulations will be framed to provide for the numbering of the ballot-papers that will be utilized by those who record their votes in places other than the divisions where they live, or where they are enrolled. I see no danger whatever in that. The practice prevails in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- It prevails also in Victoria. In both States it has a general application. I have never heard any one in the State which I have the honour to represent impute that the Government which introduced the existing Act had an ulterior object in view. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has no desire to leave any opening for personation. But if he wants to take every possible precaution against that kind of fraud, it will be necessary in the interest of the purity of elections, to have some mark of identification upon voting papers that will be recorded in divisions other than where the electors so voting are enrolled. For that reason I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- We have little enough. The better way would have been for the Minister to have a copy of the Bill interleaved and annotated by the officials. Then he could have explained what is intended. Why not put into this provision the safeguards that were contained in the original Act with regard to postal voting? There were four pages of sections safeguarding the use of the postal vote. The matter was not left to regulation. In this instance put the safeguards in the Bill.; then there can be no mistakes about them. As it is now, the regulations may be altered at any time. I do not wish to impute improper motives, but I say that in matters of this kind it is essential that the working provisions should be inserted in the regulations which we pass. I protest against this provision going through unless we strike out the words &#34; or the regulations,&#34; and unless the Minister agrees to follow up this clause with other clauses stating exactly what he wants to do. We ought not to consent to legislate in the dark, leaving it to the Electoral Office to frame a lot of regulations which Parliament may know nothing about. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has referred to the postal vote. Let me show how careful the Electoral Act, as passed when I was in charge, was to leave as little as possible to regulation. Under this Bill, everything is left to regulation from the time the elector approaches the booth until the final disposition of his vote. Not a single limitation is set out in the measure itself. But see what the provisions in the existing Act are with regard to postal voting. First of all, there are sections setting out that electors are entitled to vote by post. Then there are provisions with regard to authorized witnesses and the issue of the certificate which are not left to regulation. The inspection of the application is provided for in section no. Later, provision is made as to what the Returning Officer shall notify when postal votes are issued. The way the elector is to vote is set out in the Act. The duties of magistrates, of witnesses, of the persons voting by post, the provisions as to the preliminary scrutiny, and the counting of the postal ballot-papers are all set out in the Act itself. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; because the necessary provisions were set out in other sections. Compare that with what the Government are proposing with regard to absent voting. There is simply a provision that an elector shall, subject to regulation, be entitled to vote outside his own division. The rest is left absolutely to regulation. If that had been proposed by any other Government, it would never have got through Parliament, and it ought not to go through. The only chance of it going through now is that honorable senators opposite think that whatever may be wrong with it, the administration will, at all events, be under the control of their own political friends. They would never intrust such a power to their political enemies. That being so, the proposal stands self-condemned. When a party is satisfied with a thing only as long as it is controlled by its friends, and dissatisfied when it is. controlled by its enemies, it must stand selfcondemned. </para>

                        <para>- If that be intended, why not provide for it in the Bill ? Why develop this habit of leaving everything to the officials ? Here is a, proposal to introduce a radical change in our electoral system, by which an elector, no matter in what division he may be enrolled, can vote anywhere in Australia. But all that is to be found in the Bill relating to . it consists of three or four lines saying that an elector shall be entitled to vote at any place in Australia. There is not a single line as to the precautions to be taken, and there is not a member of the Senate, not even the Minister himself, who can tell us how it is proposed to safeguard the privilege. If the Minister does not know, is it becoming in a deliberative Chamber to adopt a proposal without an explanation as to what it means? We are voting entirely in the dark, legislating in accordance with departmental directions, and opening the road to the destruction of the secrecy of the ballot. Those who take that view will join with me in the appeal I again make to the Minister that he shall at least safeguard this proposal by modifying, and showing what is intended. If he is not prepared to do that now, let this clause stand over until the Minister can consult the departmental officers and devise some scheme which, whilst securing against fraud, will also protect the individual against inroads on that secrecy which is at once his privilege and his protection. </para>

                    <para>. - The ballot without secrecy is like the play of <inline font-style="italic">Hamlet</inline> with the character of Hamlet left out. It is made clear that in the Queensland Act provisions are set forth for the identification of voters under certain circumstances. Where charges of fraud or personation are alleged, the ballot-papers may be scrutinized by a Judge. But the Queensland Act itself provides for that. While the Queensland Act affords facilities for identification where a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case of fraud is made out, it guards the secrecy of the. ballot, which is interfered with only in the case of a disputed election, in order to decide who is the lawfully-elected candidate. We have the statement from the Minister that he intends to use this provision for the purpose of identification, but we are not told what provision is to be made by the regulation to preserve the secrecy of the ballot. The Queensland practice has been quoted as an example, but the Queensland Act provides for both. As the Minister is, in this provision, seeking, to some extent, the same object, why does he not follow the Queensland precedent, and make it clear that the regulations providing for identification shall not violate the secrecy of the ballot? If this proposed new section be agreed to, this will be the first occasion in the history of Australia on which the secrecy of the ballot will be left to regulation. If there is one thing of which we have been proud, it is that in every Act dealing with the franchise passed in this country the principle of the secrecy of fee ballot has been the main object sought to be obtained. If the Minister will not accept the suggestion to postpone this proposed new section for further consideration, the Committee will be in the position, not of being addressed by a hopeless minority, but of being in the hands of an utterly helpless and hopeless majority. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like, before this clause leaves our hands, to direct attention to another rather extraordinary feature which gives support to my contention that it was drafted by officials of the Department with a sole regard to themselves and their convenience. In this clause there is provided a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> if an officer places upon a ballot-paper an unauthorized mark, but if honorable senators will turn to the proposed new section i8ie, they will find that if any person other than an officer does this he will be liable to a fine of &#163;50. If an ordinary citizen makes - an unauthorized , mark upon a ballot-paper his portion is to be a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> but if one of our officials, who has had instruction and should be qualified for his position, violates the Act in this respect, these lordly officials, the masters of our Acts, and the men who make and interpret them, consider that he should be let off with a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> penalty. I wish only to direct attention to the fact, as, after the last division, it may be assumed that anything that the officials suggest will be accepted without question. </para>

                    <para>. - Need I remind the Honorary Minister that all presiding officers are not permanent employes of the Commonwealth, as has been alleged by him. I do not suppose that one-half of them are members of our Public Service. As a matter of fact, we all know that it is very difficult to induce suitable men outside the Public Service to accept positions as presiding officers. Of course, our own officials cannot refuse to discharge the duties attaching to such positions. But the Minister&#39;s statement that presiding officers are members of the Public Service is so much beating of the air. The pay which they receive is not alluring - indeed, it positively amounts to sweating. Do we expect persons who have to do two days work for a guinea to possess the highest qualifications? Certainly not. But they are the best men whom the Returning Officers can secure for the money. The Honorary Minister has stated that the fine which may be imposed upon a presiding officer for a breach of this part of the Bill may be <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2.</inline> But if the penalty is to have any effect, a minimum and a maximum fine should be prescribed. I should like to see the penalty reduced in the case of an offence by an ordinary elector. It is a farce to think that electors in remote portions of the Commonwealth will ever see any of the regulations which may be framed in this connexion. They may commit an offence inadvertently, and thus disfranchise themselves. But an officer who commits a breach of the law will do so wilfully. I repeat that the remuneration of presiding officers is anything but alluring. In Queensland, they are paid double the amount which the Commonwealth pays them. However, I do not wish to increase the penalty; I prefer to leave that matter to the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Probably I do not. But the statement was made by a member of the Government. In proposed new sub-section  i8ie,  the penalty prescribed in the case of an elector - other than the elector to whom a ballot-paper has been lawfully issued - who makes any mark or writing on such ballot-paper is&#163;50. But in the case of an official who commits a similar offence, the penalty imposed is only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline> As the Minister has practically challenged the Opposition to raise the latter penalty to&#163;50 I wish to ask him whether he is prepared to reduce the penalty prescribed under proposed new section  i8ie  to &#163;10? </para>

                        <para>- I would remind Ministers that we have it on the highest authority that preference is to be given to unionists. Is there any connexion between the fact that where a low penalty is prescribed unionists will be employed, whereas under proposed new section  i8ie,  where the penalty imposed is a high one, Commonwealth officials will be employed? The Minister may think it a trivial matter that a permanent official may be fined <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> whilst a temporary employe, who, under the policy of the Government, will probably be a unionist, may, for a similar offence, be fined only  &#163;10.  If we allow the clause to pass, is the Minister prepared to reduce the maximum penalty to be imposed? </para>

                    <para>. -  This innocent-looking provision absolutely gives to the Department the power to provide, from A to Z, a complete voting system for those who are to vote before nomination day and for those who are to vote away from their polling places. Instead of sketching in skeleton form the provisions to guide the Department in shaping the regulations, it hands over to the Department the absolute right to say how when, and where absent voters are to vote, what is to be done with the ballot-papers, how they are to be scrutinized and counted ; in fact, the whole treatment of the ballot-papers, from beginning to end, is to be left to the Department. I challenge the Minister to cite a country in which the Parliament has left to a departmental regulation the absolute control and direction of the electoral system. Yet that is what is proposed here. I know perfectly well that there is no honorable senator, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, who would assent in cold blood to a proposition to leave to the Electoral Office the right to say how, when, and where a man shall vote. The duty of Parliament is to lay down clearly and definitely the provisions which shall control the voting, but this innocent-looking clause throws the whole onus on the Department. All ballot-papers used in regard to absent voting are to be controlled, from the time they are printed until they are destroyed, according to regulations by the Department. </para>

                        <para>- Therefore, I was literally correct in what I said. In regard to the new system, Parliament is shirking what ought to be its duty. In the case of normal, or postal, or absent, voting, we have always set out the main lines of procedure, leaving the Department to fill in the details and sometimes little matters of machinery which it was not possible or necessary to set out in the measure. In regard to ordinary voting, for instance, we set out most elaborately what the voter is to do from the time he receives his ballot-paper until it is deposited in the ballot-box, in order to secure the secrecy of the ballot. In order to be consistent, we ought to abolish those provisions, and leave to the Department the right to deal by regulations with the ballot-papers of ordinary voters. There can be no justification for this proposal, nor has any Minister attempted to justify it. </para>

                <para>The Government can put in any regulation where the Act is silent. The honorable senator&#39;s interjection confirms my statement that the Act ought to set out the directing principles. In regard to absent voting, no principles are laid down in the Bill. All that it says is that an absent voter may vote at any other polling place within the Commonwealth, under and subject to the regulations relating to absent voting. In the case of postal voting, the principal Act provided  that a man might vote by post, but it went on to provide that his postal voting paper must be obtained and dealt with in a certain way, and that, after he had voted, the scrutiny must be conducted in a certain way, . leaving the gaps to be filled in by regulation. In this case, however, everything relating to absent voting is left to be dealt with by regulation. We are shirking our legislative work. We are throwing on the administrative branch of our Government what ought to be the work of the legislative branch. It is for Parliament itself, and not the officers of the Department, to say how an absent voter shall vote, and what is to be done with his voting paper after it is cast. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that the Bill clearly sets out what is to be done in regard to absent voting papers, but it clearly does not, because sub-section 2 of new section 139A says - </para>

                        <para>- I should think that the Minister would be desirous of getting: away, not merely from this Committee, but also from the peculiar position in which he has placed himself. I challenge him to produce any provision in the Act empowering officials to say how, when, and where voting shall take place. The thing is so monstrous that were I to address any audience other than that whereby the fate of this measure was pre-ordained, it would decline to believe that a Government had fathered such a proposal ; and if convinced by the measure itself, would scout the idea. I do not think that the proposal can have emanated from Ministers themselves. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> Let honorable senators contrast what is now proposed with what is the law regarding normal voting, or voting at a polling-booth. In the latter case, the form of the ballot-paper, and every movement of the elector in the booth, is provided for by law, together with particular directions to the officials, governing their actions, right down to the destruction of the ballot-papers a month after the voting. Why, in regard to this new system, is everything to be done by regulation ? No doubt, the supporters of a Ministry have to swallow a great deal of what they do not approve; but if Labour senators think, as they must, that what is proposed is going too far, there are ways by which they can. make their opinions known without openly rebuking Ministers. As in connexion with normal voting and postal voting, every contingency is provided for in the Act, I am impelled to the belief that, if Ministers are acting consciously, and not merely as the tools of the Department, in the abandonment of all safeguards in connexion with this new system there is some ulterior and sinister purpose. We have already passed a clause in which we have given the Department the right  to put an identification mark upon ballot-papers. Now we are required to go further, and to abandon every privilege that Parliament has hitherto retained to itself in regard to the electoral law - the right to prescribe the method and form of procedure in which votes shall be cast. What would have been said if the Government had brought down similar provisions with regard to normal voting as they have proposed in relation to absent voting? There are elaborate provisions in this very Bill as to normal voting. Would any one consent to leave the whole of those matters to be dealt with by regulation? If not, why should we leave to regulation the whole of the matters relating to the voting of the great body of electors throughout Australia who will make use of these absent voting provisions ? We are doing nothing to guard against fraud, nothing to preserve the secrecy of the ballot, nothing to provide for the counting of the ballot-papers, for the scrutiny of them, or for the preservation of them after an election. Everything in regard to absent voting is to be under the direction of the Electoral Office itself. I decline to believe that any Government would have drafted such provisions of its own volition. There is manifest, throughout the Bill, a clear intention of the Electoral Office to gather all power to itself ; and I say with deliberation that this, of all Government Departments, has been from the beginning striving to make itself, not a mere administrative agency, but a semi-judicial Department, gathering to itself the power to make and interpret our laws. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the officials are laying themselves out to wrest to themselves the power which rightly belongs to Parliament, and to Parliament alone. Let us assume that there were gathered together haphazard, at some public place, a number of electors who were talking over our electoral system. Suppose that some one suggested to them that it would be an excellent idea to enable returning officers to put distinguishing marks upon each voter&#39;s ballot-paper at an election. Would that proposition be favorably received? Yet we have deliberately sanctioned the proposal that such marks shall be placed upon ballot-papers. </para>

                        <para>- My only reason for again referring to the matter is that this is another attempt to get into the hands of Departments power which rightly belongs to Parliament itself. I venture to say that no man can read the Bill through without feeling astonished that the Electoral Office has become so audacious as to ask for these powers, that the Ministry has become so subservient as to concede them, and that there is in existence a Parliament which will tolerate for five minutes such a provision as we are asked to receive andindorse. </para>

                    has said that the Electoral Office is audacious, and that the Government is subservient  to  it. I find it very difficult to understand his position. If the Electoral Office wanted to burden itself with a great amount of additional work and responsibility I could understand an eager anxiety on the part of responsible officers, like Oliver Twist,  to  ask for more and more.

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows that it is not possible for a Government, much less a Government with a narrow majority in both Houses, to repeal every law objected to. It was one thing, in the early days, to give a certain measure of power to a Department, and a different thing to throw away the last shred of parliamentary power. I had nothing to do with what has just been read; but let me read the provision for which I was responsible : - </para>

                <para>The Minister ought to have known that that is the only amendment of the Act with which I have had to deal, and so ought those who gave him the information that he has thrown before the Committee. The Minister seems to think that, because I was at one time favorable to some regulations, I therefore ought to be favorable to all regulations. That is an absurdity. It is the duty of Parliament to lay down the skeleton of the Act, stating specifically what ought to be done in certain circumstances, and leaving to regulations only so much as it is impossible to set out in the Act itself. To an extent unparalleled in any previous parliamentary session, or any Act of Parliament, we are leaving to departmental regulations matters which have previously been set out clearly and distinctly in the Act itself. </para>

                    <para>. - Proposed new section 139 makes provision for voting before polling- day, by electors who will be absent on polling day, and the form of ballot-paper is left to the regulations. There are two forms of ballot-paper, one for the ordinary voter, prescribed by the Act, and another for the absent voter, which is left to the regulations. Why should that be? What has it to do with us if something was left to regulations, as the Minister has pointed out, in section 139 of the Act of 1905? That section, which is now being repealed, dealt practically with Form Q. If anything wrong was done in 1905, the Ministry then in power were responsible. The amending Bill brought in in 1909 simply provided that where the election for the Senate and the House of Representatives was held on the same day, no duplication of Form Q was necessary. It is quite possible that the Government of the day, when introducing that amendment, overlooked the necessity for a special provision in the Act to deal with the ballot-paper in those cases. Possibly, we also overlooked it during the second reading of the Bill, but is the Senate never to learn wisdom, and never to retrace its steps in the light of experience? Because something wrong was done by Noah, and we only find it out in these days of Labour socialistic domination, is it to be allowed to go on for ever? One would think so, to judge from the Minister&#39;s arguments. There is an inconsistency in the Act now, and I do not care two straws whether it existed before or not. The two forms of ballot-papers for what I call present voters and absent voters respectively should be prescribed in the Act, and not by regulation. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that the Minister was exhibiting positive tenacity throughout the Bill. I think it is becoming superlative obstinacy. The Minister is trying to drive the Bill clause by clause through what he knows is going to be a cyclone, when, by submitting to common-sense and observing at the same time the highest political principles, he could get rid in a few minutes of the whole of the difficulties which now occupy hours, and even days. He has not attempted to give a semblance of a reasonable answer to our objections to this provision. The Minister could, in five minutes, have a clause drafted prescribing the form of ballot-paper in the case of absent voters ; but if the Government will not submit to reason, they deserve all they get every time they get it. The ballot-paper is almost the essence of the franchise, and the provisions regarding all forms of it should be made as uniform as possible. We are here till the small hours of the morning because the Government are, so to speak, white-ant eaten with obstinacy in this matter. There is not a man with a pretence to reason and independent judgment, and with the power to exercise both, who would not willingly assent to the Government doing that which we propose. When a point like this has been pressed for  50  many- different reasons, it is difficult to understand the almost superlative stupidity of the Minister and his supporters in resisting it. </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall say that it is difficult to understand their superlative want of reason and intelligence. I shall have no hesitation in availing myself of all the power conferred upon me by the Standing Orders to have this clause thoroughly discussed, to protest against it, and to emphasize the obstinacy of the Government. In every State Act dealing with the franchise, the form of the ballot-paper to be used is given, and the whole framework upon which the electors are to exercise their franchise is invariably included. Why cannot the Minister yield to our proposal? By doing so he will not sacrifice any principle; but, on the contrary, will help to strengthen the hands of the Parliament. Every amendment coming from this side of the chamber is designed to strengthen the hands of Parliament, and to make our legislation clear. The country might reasonably be asked to congratulate itself on the possession of an Opposition in the Senate which, although small in number, is determined to resist this exhibition of useless obstinacy on the part of the Government. By prolonging this sitting the Government are inviting the electors to look more closely into this clause of a Bill which is being bludgeoned through the Chamber by the force of a large and almost silent majority. I believe that if the Minister were to say to his supporters, &#34; You are free to vote as you please upon this matter,&#34; we should find them voting with the Opposition. There are some very important and debatable clauses yet to be dealt with, and I regret that, so far as this provision is concerned, the Government appear to have tightened up their supporters - to have induced them to remain silent - and to treat this as a party measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I must ask the indulgence of the Committee whilst I make something more than an incidental reference to clause 26 in connexion with the clause now tinder consideration. .The two embody a definite proposition, and it is hardly possible to consider the one without making some reference to the other. These clauses deal with the circumstances in which a candidate may claim a recount, and their effect is that the candidate will be absolutely at the mercy of the Chief Electoral Officer. Hitherto we have gone so far as to deprive Parliament of the right to interfere in the matter of a disputed election, and have referred such matters to the High Court. The proposition in this Bill is to take from the High Court some of the power we decided to vest in it, and to vest that power in the administrative officer of the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department. Under the law as it stands at present, a candidate may by lodging the necessary deposit make an application to the High Court for a recount and obtain it. Under this Bill that right is to be denied him, except by the good grace of the Chief Electoral Officer. I am dealing more particularly with a Senate election, although the same principle would apply to an election for another place, because it comes first in the Bill, and next because we are considering this matter in the Senate; and I lay particular stress upon the way in which the clause would operate in connexion with a Senate election.. Clause 25 leaves it in the hands &#39;of the Chief Electoral Officer, who does not occupy a judicial position, and would not necessarily act upon evidence submitted to him, of his own volition, to refuse to grant an application for a recount. There is no opportunity afforded a candidate asking for a recount to submit _ evidence at a public inquiry. The <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the Chief Electoral Officer is to settle the question as to whether a candidate shall have a recount or not. In order that I may prove that statement, and justify my opposition to this clause, it is necessary that I should go a little further and show what would happen if the Chief Electoral Officer chooses to refuse a recount. I have no doubt that I shall be told that a candidate may still secure a recount by appealing to the High Court. If he could 1 should have very little objection to the clause. I wish to show that if the Chief Electoral Officer refuses a recount there is practically no&#62; human possibility of a candidate obtaining it, because in the very next clause it is provided in the proposed new section 161B that- </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. My point, however, is that a candidate shall have a right to a recount, irrespective of whether papers are in dispute or not. Surely the possibility of error in a count has been shown time and again, where there are thousands of votes concerned in an election. Let us&#39; see whether a candidate is to have a right to a recount, irrespective of the sanction of the Chief Electoral Officer. The proposed new section goes on to provide - but shall not order any further recount of the whole or any part of the ballot-papers in connexion with the election unless it is satisfied1 that some mistake or error in connexion with the counting has been made which renders a recount necessary. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister, by his interjection, means that a candidate is to have the right to one recount, and that is made clear in the Bill, I shall be satisfied. I contend, however, that, as the Bill stands, if the Chief Electoral Officer refuses a recount, the only papers which can be counted by the Court of Disputed Returns are the reserved papers to which objection has been taken by the scrutineers. In my own State of New South Wales, at the last Senate election, there were no less than  450,000  votes cast for Senate candidates. I do not know what number of papers were disputed, but, as compared with the whole, they must have been a mere circumstance. Suppose a losing candidate at a Senate election is  1,000  or  2,000  votes below the winning candidate, will any one contend that it would be unreasonable for him to ask for a recount, irrespective of any disputed papers and irrespective of any public official ? Yet, under this Bill, it is left to the Chief Electoral Officer to say whether there shall be a recount or not. The Minister shakes his head, and I am led to hope that it may be the intention of the Government to give a candidate a right to claim one recount. If the Minister is relying upon the use of the words &#34; any further recount &#34; in this connexion, I would point out that, as used in the proposed new section, they cannot mean a second recount. What they mean is a recount further, or beyond, and in addition to the reserved papers. If Ministers are agreed that a candidate should have a claim to one recount, there is no need for me to discuss this matter further, because a very simple alteration of the proposed new section would make that quite clear. If, on the other hand, it is intended, as the clause now provides, that the right of a candidate to a recount is to depend upon the view which the Chief Electoral Officer takes of the matter, I ask every honorable senator present, in the interests of his party and of the electors, to decline to accept such a proposition. We know that, for good reasons Parliament has divested itself of the tight to consider disputed elections, but the Government are now asking that a public officer, under the control, be it remembered, of the Minister of the day, shall determine whether there shall be a recount granted or not. Is it right or feasible that the whole question, it may be, of the representation of a State shall depend upon the view which an individual in a public Department may take of the circumstances of the case? The Chief Electoral Officer for a State may say, &#34; I shall not put my officers to the trouble of recounting a parcel of  450,000  votes, because there is a difference of  5,000  votes between a winning and a losing candidate.&#34; It is true that  5,000  votes may represent only a very small percentage of. the total votes cast ; but I venture to say that there has never been a recount yet which has not resulted in an alteration of the totals of the first count. When we find that mistakes occur from time to time in connexion with an election for the House of Representatives, where, the numbers as compared with a Senate, election are comparatively small, and at a State election where the numbers are still smaller, we are justified in assuming that an equal percentage of errors creeps into the count for a Senate election. Yet the Government propose to deprive a Senate candidate of the right to ask for a recount. I ask the Government to say whether they intend that a candidate shall have the right to one recount, and are prepared to submit an alteration of the proposed new section to make that abundantly clear; or whether they intend&#39; that the right to a recount shall rest with their own officer. I am willing to admit that if the Chief Electoral Officer consents to a recount, there is some justification for refusing to ask the Court to order another. My whole point is that if a candidate complies with the provisions of the Act, and puts up the necessary deposit, he should be entitled to a recount, irrespective of one or all of the Government officials. I am not speaking without having consulted those whose opinions on the interpretation of a legal provision is of some moment when I say that the word &#34; further &#34; to which I have referred, must not be held to mean a. second recount, but must be held to mean a recount further, or in addition to the recount of the reserved papers. If this view of the provision be correct, it is a prohibition, not of a second recount, but of any recount other than that of the reserved papers. I should like before I go any further to get from the Minister a statement as to whether it is intended there shall be a right to one recount. </para>

                        <para>- No. It gives a candidate the power at- any time to go straight to the Court of Disputed Returns, and to ask for a recount. But as the clause stands a candidate must make his application for a recount before the declaration of the poll. What does that mean ? Very frequently a candidate may not be able to make up his mind whether he ought to apply for a recount until after the poll is declared. He may then decide that he requires a recount, but it will be too late, because the application must be made before the declaration of the poll. He cannot go to the Chief Electoral Officer or the Court. If the Government tell me that they will insert in the Bill a provision under which a candidate may obtain a recount of the ballot-papers I shall be satisfied. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. I make that statement after having consulted two lawyers, both members of Parliament, whose reputation in this country is unchallengeable. The Minister of Defence seems to think that a &#34; further &#34; recount means only a prohibition against a recount after one has already been made. But I again stress my point that it means a recount of the ballot-papers in addition to the disputed papers. It rests with the Minister to make that position perfectly clear. In view of the grave doubt that has been raised, it would not be a very difficult matter so to alter the clause as to make it abundantly plain that the right of a candidate to apply to the Court of Disputed Returns for a recount of the votes cast is quite independent of any action which the Chief Electoral Officer may take. </para>

                    <para>. - Much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said in opposition to this clause, and incidentally to clause 26, was said by him during the debate upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill. He appears to take particular exception to the wording of sub-clause 3 of proposed new section 1 6 1B. He says, in effect, that a candidate should have the right to demand a recount of the votes if he is dissatisfied with the way in which they have been. counted. Now clause 25 seeks to confer upon a candidate greater power than he possesses under the principal Act. </para>

An agreement is arrived at between the officers and the scrutineers who represent the different candidates at the election. Then any matters in dispute are referred to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, who, fortified with the decisions of the High Court, is called upon to determine what are formal, and what are informal, votes. </para>

                    <para>.- As I understand the clause, the matter of a recount of the votes is to be left finally in the hands of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer. Whether any candidate shall be granted a recount will depend upon that officer&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit,</inline> because the former may apply to the Returning Officer for the State for a recount, and his application may be refused. He may then appeal to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, who may refuse the application, and that refusal will be absolute. It is said that the candidate may appeal to the Court, and that if he produces evidence the Court may grant him a recount. He may know that he ought to be allowed a recount without being able to produce evidence in support of his application. Unfortunately I have had an experience which cost me, not only a good deal of anxiety, but also a good deal of money. I shall take my own case to illustrate our contention. I stood first for election at the end of 1906, and when the scrutiny was finished I was in a minority of fourteen votes. A friend went to my son and said, &#34; Your father had not a scrutineer at Hindmarsh ? &#34; When my son replied, &#34;No, I think not,&#34; my friend said, &#34;Tell your father, whatever he does, to get a recount of the ballot-papers in the Hindmarsh box.&#34; My son remarked, &#34; Tell us what you know about the matter.&#34; My friend said, &#34; I will not tell you. anything, but I want you to tell your father to be sure to get a recount of the papers in the Hindmarsh box, because it will pay him to have a recount.&#34; My son asked him to speak out, and he said, &#34;I dare not; my life would not be worth living if it were known that I had taken any part in this matter.&#34; I applied to the State Electoral Officer for a recount, which was granted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The voting was very close, there being only fourteen votes between myself and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby,</inline> who was one of the Labour candidates. As the recount proceeded, my minority increased from fourteen to over forty. I had forgotten about the matter which was referred to me ; in fact, I had given up the thing, and arranged to go to Tasmania for a holiday. The last, or very nearly the last, box to be counted was the Hindmarsh box, and then a curious fact was revealed. It turned out that ninety votes which had been recorded in favour of the  Hon.  Thomas Playford had been credited to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosby.</inline> There were no mistakes with regard to any other names. This discovery turned the scale so that, instead of being in a minority of forty-five, I came out with a majority of forty-five. In that case I could not go to the </para>

                <para class="block">Returning Officer and say that 1 had evidence that there ought to be a recount, because the informant had declared that, if his name were mentioned in the matter, his life would not be worth living. I could not use his name; I could not say to the Returning Officer that I could produce evidence which would strongly favour the granting of a recount. If these ninety votes had been credited to the proper persons at the time I should have been in a majority of over eighty votes, instead of in a minority of fourteen votes, and if anybody had wanted a recount it would not have been myself. Even when a recount had been made I should still have come out with a majority of forty-five. Because these mistakes were made I had to fight in the Court of Disputed Returns the illegal action of the State Parliament in appointing a gentleman to the vacant seat in the Senate. I had to fight the thing through the High Court to get, not my rights, but the right of the people to elect a senator. I would not like to say exactly how much money I had to spend before I could do that. In view of these facts, do not honorable senators think it proper that a candidate should have the right to a recount, especially if the voting is at all close? Under this provision a candidate at an election for the Senate may appeal to the State Electoral Officer. If that officer does grant a recount, well and good; but if he sees no reason to do so, the candidate may appeal to the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, who may either direct a recount or refuse the request. Then the candidate is at the end of his tether, unless he chooses to go before the Court of Disputed Returns. If he is in a position such as I was in, he cannot produce the evidence that there ought to be a recount. He may feel quite satisfied in his mind, from the information or the advice he has received, that there ought to be a recount, but he cannot put an. informant in the box and ask him to tender evidence. A candidate ought not to be in that position. Sub-clause 3 of proposed section 161B provides that the Court - shall not order any further recount of the whole or any part of the ballot-papers in connexion with the election unless it is satisfied that some mistake or error in connexion with the counting has been made which renders a recount necessary. </para>

                        <para>- If there had been a number of errors it would not have had a suspicious look, but when it is remembered that ninety votes which had been recorded in favour of one candidate had been credited to another candidate, there, is a somewhat suspicious look about the matter. I think that that will be admitted. I am only calling attention to things which happened to show that there may be a case where a man cannot produce evidence, although he may feel quite sure in his mind that there ought to be a recount. Under this provision, the Court will have to say to the candidate, &#34; We cannot order a recount of the papers unless you can give evidence which will warrant us in doing, so.&#34; I think that the provision ought to be a little more elastic than it is, and that if a candidate can assure an officer, or even the Court, that he has reason to believe that some error has been made, but is not able to produce actual evidence, his application ought not to be refused. Practically the provision leaves the whole thing in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer, and if he says &#34; No,&#34; that will virtually end the matter. I do not think that that state of affairs ought to be allowed. ( I hold that if a candidate can honestly assure the Commonwealth Returning Officer that he has reason to believe that errors have been made, and that a recount will make a difference, or. is necessary, he ought to be allowed to have a recount without producing actual evidence of an error or a mistake.  I have related my own experience, because I think that it is <inline font-style="italic">apropos</inline> of the clause. I hope that the Minister will be willing to agree to a modification of it. </para>

Mo one would wish to prevent a man who had just and reasonable grounds for asking for a recount from getting one. I have had a good deal of experience in this matter, and it was always my practice, between the unofficial and the official declaration of the poll, to have a recount of the papers, at which, the scrutineers and the candidates could be present if they wished. Sometimes a whole bundle of papers is put aside, and, if it were not for the recount, would not be credited to the candidates. Where the difference between the votes cast for two candidates was 4,000 or s, 000, a recount would not be asked for ; but it should be given when a candidate has fair and reasonable grounds for believing that it is justifiable. The experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> shows the need for recounts at times. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland) (2.1 a.m.&#93;. - The Minister has done right in proposing the amendment. The main ground of dispute is nearly always in regard to informal papers, which are put on one side. If the formal voting is very close, the &#39; validity or invalidity of the ballot-papers which have been set aside becomes a matter of much importance. Should a candidate take a case before the Court of Disputed Returns, and succeed in getting papers which have been declared informal pronounced to be formal, the margin is narrowed down, and it becomes essential to see that a mistake has not been made in the counting of the votes whose validity is unquestioned. I have had experience of a case of the kind. Under the amendment candidates will be fairly treated.

                    <para>. - It would be of assistance if it were provided that voting-papers not marked in accordance with section 158 should be regarded as absolutely informal. Neither an officer nor a Court should be asked to say what was intended by the person who marked them. My experience is that informal papers of this kind are cast as much for one candidate as for another. But when a case comes before the Court, we find the Judge picking up one paper, and saying, &#34; There is a smudge here, under which I cannot discern any mark. I accordingly treat the paper as informal.&#34; while, holding another up, he remarks, &#34; I can distinguish a mark under the smudge on this paper, and, therefore, I declare it to be formal.&#34; It is impossible to say what was in an elector&#39;s mind when he marked&#34; a paper improperly, and it would be much better if the task of trying to ascertain the intention of those responsible for these informal papers was not imposed on any one. </para>

                    <para>. - The innocence of the Minister convinces me that he must have been born and bred in Victoria, and must have remained in this State throughout his life. I want to know whether the officer conducting an election may, in accordance with proposed new section 164B, &#34; reserve any ballot-paper for the decision of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer &#34; at the request of an acting scrutineer, as well as of a scrutineer? It appears that there may be as many as four or five scrutineers acting for a candidate during a day. Can any one of them demand a recount? </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is a past-master in dodging the issue. I want to know whether any acting scrutineer, as well as any scrutineer in chief, so to speak, can demand a recount. It is interesting to know that a candidate can change his scrutineers every hour if he pleases, and eventually put each of them up to demand a recount of certain papers. But I doubt whether it will be found that this provision will work very conveniently. </para>

                    <para>. - I also doubt whether the provision to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has called attention will be workable. There are polling places at which there are as many as ten presiding officers. Presiding officers may want to go out just as scrutineers do. But the Bill does not provide for relieving presiding officers, nor does it provide for relieving poll clerks. A candidate may appoint half-a-dozen scrutineers to act for him, and all of them will have access to the booths. I think that is undesirable. If it be desirable in the case of scrutineers, it is equally desirable in the case of presiding officers and poll clerks. We have to repose great trust in presiding officers, but apparently the framers of this Bill do not think that they can act safely out of the sight of the candidates&#39; scrutineers. Surely the duties of presiding officers are just as arduous as are those of scrutineers. But there seems to be something peculiar in the view of the Government about scrutineers, that a candidate can appoint two or three to act for him at each separate polling-place, and that they can relieve each other at intervals during the day. It appears that access to the booth cannot be refused to any scrutineers appointed ; and this, of course, presents opportunities for scrutineers to carry intimations in and out. Have all the scrutineers the right to be present at a recount ? </para>

He has told us that under the Bill a candidate may nominate as many scrutineers as he chooses, and that no provision is made for relieving the presiding officer and other officials during the long days. As a matter of fact, section 126 provides that the presiding officer may appoint substitutes to serve during his temporary absence; and, although a candidate may appoint scrutineers to relieve one another, only one scrutineer for each candidate can be present at the recount. </para>

                    <para>. -We are in danger of getting into a very complicated condition in regard to absent voting. Under these provisions votes can be recorded all over Australia, and how is it possible for the writ to be returned, or any one declared elected, until a complete statement is obtained as to the vote&#39;s recorded? There are no provisions in the Act itself regulating how these votes should be taken. If a man goes to a booth and says, &#34;I am an elector in such-and-such a district,&#34; but does not know his number or his division, is he to be allowed to vote on a Q form on that scanty evidence? Where shall we land ourselves if that loose method of doing business is carried out? No one should be declared elected until the whole of the returns have been sent in from the most distant parts where any one could have been able to vote. This matter should be clarified by a statement from the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - We have had cases since the establishment of the Commonwealth where the return of the writ has been delayed through the breakdown of transport arrangements, although it has been known officially that the votes from outside places could not in any way have affected the result. This provision is intended only to meet exceptional cases. I am informed that something similar occurred in connexion with the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> There is no occasion for the Committee to worry, because every precaution will be taken to safeguard the interest of all candidates. There will be, in future elections, a considerable number of absent votes recorded throughout the Commonwealth, but the number of votes so recorded, and the number that each candidate has secured, will be officially known. Something might happen to delay the sending in of the return, and to prevent unnecessary delay in declaring the poll this provision is inserted. </para>

                    <para>. -  1  do not know that the clause is objectionable in itself, but the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is full of interest, and, in view of the Ministerial attitude, full of mystery. The clause has been introduced with a particular regard to the proposed system of absent voting. It seems to me that unless the Government know a great deal more than they have told us, we shall be landed in a sea of difficulties. Hitherto it has only been necessary to send these votes to one place in each State, but here we have the possibility of votes being cast, say, in Broome, Western Australia, for a Tasmanian electorate. It will not be sufficient for a mere wire to Come from Broome to Hobart stating that a certain number of votes has been cast there in respect of a certain candidate for a Tasmanian electorate. Surely there must be some check on the votes so cast. In the case of normal voting there is some check in the fact that a man votes in his own electorate. But if a Hobart elector votes in Broome, the presiding officer there is not likely to have the rolls for the whole Commonwealth, and he will have to rely on the declaration of the man that he is entitled to vote. Surely we are not going to say that a mere wire from a returning officer there will be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- I admit the desirableness of this clause, which will operate only where the outstanding votes are insufficient to determine an election. But let us assume that the voting for the Hobart electorate, to continue my illustration, is close, and that votes in respect of it are cast in various parts of Australia, so as possibly to affect the election. In that case the clause would be inoperative, but, being inoperative, can the Government guarantee to gather up all these outstanding votes within the time fixed for the return of the writ ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has recognised that we might have to extend the time beyond the period for which the provision  is  made. An election might thus be tied up indefinitely. I am sure that the Minister will find that some modification of this provision is required. Whatever proposal the Government have in mind, they should keep clearly in view the necessity of having an absolute check on all absent votes before they , are taken into account. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a good deal in the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who has discharged a public duty in calling the attention of the Committee to the position. This means a very wide extension of the existing voting facilities, and it is to be regretted that the Committee has to take largely on trust nearly the whole of the principal provisions of this Bill in regard to absent voters. We shall not know what arrangements will be made for transmitting the records to their respective destinations, and what safeguards will be imposed. It is quite right that an election, say, for the Senate, should not be held up because a ballot-box containing only a few votes, which cannot affect the result, has not reached its destination. I believe a ballot-box containing a few votes, which could not affect the result of a Senate election for Queensland, was wandering about that State for .some time, but that the Returning Officer, knowing that the result could not be affected, declared the result of the poll without waiting for its arrival. The Government desire to meet such a contingency, but it is a pity that the Committee has not been furnished with more information. </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst this clause has been under discussion several points have occurred to me in respect of which the proposed system is likely to be ineffective. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to persons voting in Western Australia in connexion with a Hobart election. During the cane-cutting season in Queensland there would be in all probability a large number of Tasmanians up there, and should an election occur whilst those people are in Queensland they would undoubtedly desire to record their votes. There might be 300 voters in respect of that electorate in the remaining five States of the Union, and the result of the election for that particular electorate could not be declared until the ballot-papers had reached Hobart and had been checked. Then, again, it might be found upon examination that two votes - one in Queensland and the other in Hobart - had been cast in respect of the same elector. A dozen cases of impersonation might be discovered, and these would have to be inquired into before the return of the writ. I fail to see any safeguards in connexion with this provision&#39;. At the first blush it might not appear that the votes cast by absent voters were sufficient to upset an election, but so many cases of impersonation might be discovered as to bring about the defeat of a candidate on a re-count. The Honorary Minister is assuming that every vote cast will be correctly recorded. The Returning Officer in Queensland would have to accept the assurance of persons claiming to vote there in respect of a Hobart electorate that they were on the rolls for that division, and by the time that the votes so cast had been examined the absent voters might have left the district in which they had recorded their votes. We are opening the door to a great deal of risk. I do not see how it will be possible to prevent personation under this clause. It appears to me that it is offering a premium for impersonation. I know of a case which occurred at Bundaberg, where about 100 votes were recorded by people who had not been in the State for more than three weeks. </para>

                        <para>- I quite understand that, and if all the votes cast were properly recorded there could be no objection. My point is that, in the case of votes recorded, for instance, in other States for the electorate of Denison, in Tasmania, some of them may have been personated, and I point out that, if a candidate were leading by even 400 votes, 300 of these absent votes might alter the result if it were subsequently shown that there had been personation in connexion with votes recorded in the other States, or even in the Denison electorate itself. However, if the Government are prepared to take all the risks, it is useless to point out these difficulties, since they have the necessary majority to carry their proposal, and as one of their own supporters said to-day they are not prepared to take suggestions from either side. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree that, if possible, the result of an election should be declared before outside votes are received at the central polling place. But we have to remember that the writs of election have to be returned at a certain date, indorsed with the total number of the votes received by each candidate. This proposal is due to an incident which took place in connexion with an election in Victoria, where some outside place was cut off by floods, and it was impossible to get the votes recorded there brought in without considerable delay, and though they would have made no difference in the result the election could not be declared until they had been received. I wish honorable senators to consider that this provision will apply to the whole of Australia, and it may happen that, after a writ has been  returned, indorsed with the election of a certain candidate, outside returns subsequently received may alter the declared result of the election. May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> deals very fully with the issue and return of writs, and the value of writs when they are returned. Supposing that an official says, &#34; I do not think that any further returns which may be received can make any difference to the result of this election.&#34; </para>

                    <para>At the end of the session in 1894 two writs were issued on the same day for the borough of Leicester, a constituency returning two members, as the sitting members had accepted the Chiltern Hundreds and Manor of Northstead. The Returning Officer held a single election to fill the vacancies.  His  action and the validity of the returns made by him were raised as a matter of privilege at the commencement of the next session, and a Select Committee was appointed to inquire into the matter. The Committee reported that the course pursued by the Returning Officer was erroneous in point ot procedure, and that the election was not duly held, but recommended that the House should take no action in the matter as the Returning Officer had acted in the exercise of an honest judgment for the convenience, and with the consent, of all parties directly concerned in the election and without any intention of influencing the result. </para>

                <para>That case is almost exactly upon all-fours with cases which may arise under this clause. We have Returning Officers who are perfectly honest, but who may certify to results which are false.

                <para class="block">In our Australian Parliaments we have no official who is known as the  Clerk  of the Crown. It is true that at one time we had an officer who occupied a corresponding position, namely, the  Clerk  of Parliaments. But owing to certain changes which were made consequent upon the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> that office was abolished. The point which I am endeavouring to make is that when a writ has been returned, which is badly indorsed, there is no parliamentary procedure &#39; under which the fault can be remedied. Upon page 640, of the same edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> I find the following - </para>

                <para>We must deal with this matter of allowing a writ to be returned before an election is completed. In certain circumstances it may be easy enough to forecast the result of an election in closely-settled districts, but I know that, in the Gregory electorate, in Queensland, there is one polling booth which is distant 500 miles from the .nearest telegraph office. How can any one know what the- voting will be at a place like that? A person may guess at it, but that is not good enough where the election of a representative of the people i:&#39; concerned. In the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the Minister of Defence, what power there is to re-open a case after a writ, duly indorsed by our own officials, has been returned, should it subsequently transpire that the ballot-boxes from remote centres have altered the anticipated result? . We know very well that newspapers frequently assert, in connexion with elections, that a count of the votes contained in the remaining ballot-boxes cannot possibly alter the result. We know, too, that it often happens that the expected result is upset by the final returns. Yet it is here proposed to place in the hands of an official the power to indorse a writ, and to return it to the Chief Electoral Officer before the whole of the votes polled at an election have been counted. I have no desire to indulge in captious criticism. I believe that the officials who are advising the Government in this matter know very little about the conditions which obtain throughout Australia. If they did, they would recognise that it is absolutely unfair to the people to say, in effect, &#34; We guess that the result of a particular election will be so-and-so. &#34; In my opinion, we shall be acting unwisely if we embody in the Bill a provision which permits an election to be decided before the votes registered have actually been counted. I invite the Government to say what method they can resort to if for some reason or other the indorsement on a writ&#34; should be found to be wrong. It is easy enough to say that the matter can be referred to the Disputed Returns Committee. Suppose that Jones in the central district does not get a majority against Brown, that the State Returning Officer indorses the writ with the name of Brown, and that a distant place sends in a further return which changes the result of the election. The writ has been returned, and Brown sworn in. Probably Jones will not find out for a considerable time that the position has been altered. When he makes that discovery he will have to put his case before the Disputed Returns Committee, and then go to the High Court. Is that a fair thing? If the official had been compelled to wait until he actually knew the result of the count Jones would have been declared elected, and it would not have cost him a farthing apart from his ordinary election expenses. I think that the Government should put a limit on the provision. I have some sympathy with the idea that we should allow a candidate to know the result of the election as soon as possible, but this clause gives to an official the right to declare the result when probably it may be very much in doubt. If the Government would only tell us that in such a case they would be prepared to ask Parliament to bear the expenses of Jones there would be a certain amount of reasonableness in the provision. </para>

                    <para>.- There is no precedent for suspending a sitting between supper time and breakfast time. Ever since I have been a member of the Senate a sitting which has been suspended at midnight for refreshments has been continued, if need be, till breakfast time at 8 o&#39;clock. I think it will be reasonable to have a break in the sitting at half-past 4 o&#39;clock. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause applies to the House of Representatives the same rule as is applied in the previous clause to the Senate. I believe that the Government will probably find it necessary, after they have had some experience of this measure, to make an alteration which will not allow a writ to be indorsed by a Returning Officer, and returned before the result of the poll is actually ascertained. I ask the Minister to state what steps will be taken in the event of a writ being returned, and it being subsequently found that a count of votes has altered the votes, and a candidate has been put to a large amount of expense in asserting his right to be a member of the other House. </para>

                    <para>. - Such a position cannot arise, because neither the Commonwealth Officer nor the Divisional Returning Officer can act without the concurrence of the Chief Electoral Officer who will be armed with all information. He will know the number of absent votes which have been recorded, where they have been recorded, and for which divisions they are claimed. He will add up the absent votes not yet returned and put them against the candidate who apparently has the right to be returned. If that does not make any difference he will be perfectly safe in declaring that &#39;candidate elected, because, if the votes should happen to go to his opponent, the result could not be altered. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause can hardly be expected to pass without some comment from this side. The proposals now before us serve no public purpose, but have been drafted apparently to gratify party curiosity, and, perhaps, to make political capital. It is provided that every organization, association, league, or body of persons which has spent money on behalf of the candidate or party must make a return of its expenditure. I do not think that any organization of which I have any knowledge would object to doing that, but what public advantage will accrue from it, seeing that there is no limit to the amount which may be spent? Proposed new section  172A  places an obligation on every &#34;organization, association, league, or body of persons.&#34; If any individual were asked to mention an organization connected with politics, his reply would be a trade union, but curiously enough trade unions are not mentioned. Will it be contended later that they are exempt from an obligation which is placed on other bodies of electors ? Preposterous claims have been put forward in the name of unionism. It has been asserted in some public utterances that unionists should be permitted to do what they like, provided that the interests of their union require the action they take, or that they think that those interests require it. </para>

                        <para>- In New South Wales there is a reform association and a liberal league, both of which seem to be specially referred to; but care has been taken to make no reference to unions. The Government can, by reason of its majority, force these provisions through, but the Opposition would be wanting in its duty if it failed to point out the monstrous character of this proceeding, an obligation being inflicted on one section from which another is carefully excluded. The second part of proposed new section 172a presents similar sinister aspects. Whilst it calls on all organizations, with the exception of Labour unions, to make a statement of their expenditure on advertising, it relieves Labour journals of the obligation which it imposes on anti-Labour journals. Every organization, association, league, or body of persons which has in connexion with an election incurred expense in printing, publishing, or issuing electoral advertisement notices, must make a return of the money so expended. That leaves untouched a publication like the <inline font-style="italic">Vanguard,</inline> which was started by the Labour organizations at the commencement of the last elections, and dropped on the day that the poll closed. In it there was nothing in the nature of an electoral advertisement paid for per inch or per column, but the whole venture was supported by the funds of the unions which launched it. While anti-Labour journals publishing advertisements would come under the section to which I refer, Labour publications like the <inline font-style="italic">Vanguard</inline> would not. Generally speaking, the press will laugh at this attempt to injure it. The idea that there is anything to disclose is ridiculous. My protest against such a provision is not so much on account of its main objects as because of its unfairness and one-sidedness. I do not see that any advantage is to be gained from the disclosure which is provided for. I think that to require it is a piece of impertinence, though not much harm will come of it; but it is not fair to require it of one side and not of the other. </para>

                        <para>- I never belonged to it, and an interjection like that makes me thank God that I was never connected with the party. So far as advertisements of meetings and the like are concerned, nothing is gained by the provision. If I see the announcement that a meeting is to be addressed by a certain candidate at a certain place on a certain day, I know at once that it is paid for. The object of the clause is to compel newspapers to disclose the payments made for the publication of matter likely to influence an election which does not appear ostensibly as advertising matter. Let me show where this proposal is so absolutely one-sided&#39;. Take a country newspaper which published a political article for payment received. It would have to make a return under this clause. But the Labour journal would not have to make any return, because it would not have received specific payment for specific articles. Nevertheless, I venture to say that there was not a line published in the <inline font-style="italic">Vanguard</inline> for which specific payment was not received. The books of that publication, if any books were kept, would not show the receipt of payment for the publication of articles, although the whole paper was run in the interests of the Labour movement. Nevertheless, that paper, which was not started without an expenditure of political funds, would not be called upon to make any return. The result would be that we should have our Labour friends running round the country saying, &#34; We spent only a few pounds during this campaign, whilst our. enemies spent so much money!&#34; If we are going to introduce these ludicrous proposals into our electoral system, let us treat all political parties alike. I propose to move an amendment to cover such cases as I have instanced. That object will be accomplished by inserting after the word &#34;expense&#34; in sub-clause 2 the words, &#34; printing or publishing any newspaper, or in.&#34; That amendment, if carried, would cover, not only an expense incurred - as assumed by the authors of this Bill - by the Liberal organizations, but also expense incurred in purchasing space in existing journals, and in papers run particularly at election time. Unless Ministers desire .to stand self-confessed as authors of a one-sided proposition, they ought to accept the amendment. Turning to the latter portion of the clause, dealing with the proprietors of newspapers, I wish to show the amount of venom introduced into this proposition. The spirit in which it is drafted is disclosed by the fact that the penalty to be imposed upon a newspaper which fails to make out a return is ,&#163;500. I ask the Committee to consider whether I am not justified in introducing the word &#34; venom &#34; in this connexion, when the most serious offence under the electoral law - bribery - is punishable by a fine of &#163;200 as a maximum, whilst the penalty to be imposed upon the newspaper proprietor failing to make out a return, or making out an incorrect return for electoral matter, is nothing less than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500.</inline> Is not this an instance of a desire to satisfy the craving for revenge of the party opposite? </para>

I do not know so much about the newspapers of. .South- Australia, and necessarily speak with some diffidence concerning them, but I should be surprised to find that it was the practice in that State to permit a public man to command the right to have his speeches inserted in the leading columns at advertising rates. </para>

                        <para>- Let the Minister for Defence take the trouble to turn up the files of either of those newspapers during the last Federal election and calculate the receipts from election advertisements at per inch. Then let him calculate the expense incurred in sending special correspondents and reporters around the country with Ministers, and with the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think that he will say that those journals received payment for matter published in the news columns. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently this speech was paid for as an advertisement. I have even seen a letter which had been sent to a newspaper, and not inserted as a letter in the correspondence columns, afterwards inserted as an advertisement and paid for at advertising rates. That is a perfectly legitimate thing to do. The same is the case in regard to the speech of a candidate. In the case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> mentions, where publication as an advertisement was acknowledged, what harm was there? I presume that the newspaper managers said to themselves, &#34; Any speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> makes is not of sufficient interest to our readers for it to be published as an item of news ; but, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> likes to utilize our advertising columns, his speech will not be; worse than other matter that goes into them, and as his money will be quite as good as anybody else&#39;s, his speech may as well go in.&#34; But I was dealing with the&#163;500 penalty for failure to make a return under this clause, and contrasting it with the &#163;200 penalty proposed for the most serious offence known in connexion with electoral matters, namely, bribery. The only answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> can make is that the&#163;500 is coming out of the pockets of wealthy corporations. That brings us back to consider the newspapers that are. doing this sort of thing. If there are any newspapers which are subject to financial influences at election time, they are the small struggling country journals. One can easily understand that, with their limited financial resources, their limited space, and their limited circulation, they are not able to publish full reports of speeches or to insert a great many political articles. These newspaper proprietors not unreasonably say that it does not pay to shut out other matter, and that it is quite fair to ask the candidate to reimburse them the expense. These newspapers, however, do not represent the wealthy corporations to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> referred, but . are struggling newspapers which take a few pounds to compensate them for the labour and expense incurred. Yet the proprietors of these small newspapers are to be fined <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500</inline> if they fail to make a. return, or made an inaccurate one. At the same time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> as a metaphorical instance, may go bribing every elector, and yet be fined only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200.</inline> I see no advantage, and a great deal that is pernicious in the proposal, even if it were complete. I wish to make is abundantly clear that my chief objection to the proposal is that it is designed to throw an obligation on newspapers and organizations not friendly to the promoters of this measure, while relieving from that obligation those newspapers and organizations which support them. I have suggested a couple of amendments to this clause, which has been drafted with a reprehensible ingenuity that cannot be accidental. Unless the Minister expresses a willingness to modify the proposal, and accept amendments which will make it quite clear that it is intended to apply all round, and not merely to those newspapers and organizations which are opposed to the Ministerial party- </para>

                        <para>- Even so, a reply ought to be given. As suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> there is a conspicuous absence of the words. &#34;trade unions,&#34; from this clause, although every other imaginable political association is included. Trade unions represent, perhaps, the most powerful, economical, and political organizations  in Australia, or in the world ; and we have not had the slightest explanation of their omission. If there is any attempt to distinguish between political organizations, the reign of political corruption has begun in Australia. We have no precedent in any constitutionally-governed country for such -legislation as  this. In some constitutional countries, more especially in the United States of America, the power of political parties has been used corruptly; and yet there has never been -any attempt, so far as I can gather, to interfere with them in this way. The Bill is a remarkable confirmation of the anticipation of some of the friends and more of the foes of the Socialist Labour party in Australia that, when that party came into power, the first use they would make of their position would be to use the electoral machine and the franchise so as to give their political friends - . </para>

                        <para>- There is not a tittle of evidence that the &#34; machine &#34; referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has ever used its power corruptly. Charge after charge of corruption has been made against the political organization on this side, but in not a single instance is such a charge recorded as proved. Until it can be shown that the political machine on one side or the other is corrupt, and that the ordinary criminal or electoral law is not sufficient to cope with the position, it is an outrage on our liberty to introduce a measure of this kind, which is intended to tyrannize over and so tie up the opposite organization so that it cannot act. In the absence of any explanation we cannot but conclude that the exclusion of trade unions is intended to strike in a party direction. If, as we are told, this Bill will affect trade unions, let that be made perfectly clear; and there would then be at any rate, a semblance of an attempt to be impartial. What is the meaning of the words &#34; any person who has in connexion with any election &#34; ? In the case of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act we had the Judge saying that that measure had been thrown at him, and that, in regard to one important portion of it, not the slightest assistance had been given him in the way of ascertaining the intention of Parliament. The Judge went on to say that he had to take the section in question by and large, and find out as best he could what Parliament meant. It was in the best traditional spirit of the Judicial Bench to make that suggestion, so that Parliament in framing future Acts might not leave Judges in a similar difficulty. I do not think there is any body of verbal experts who could tell us the meaning of those words, or who would not each give a contradictory interpretation. We are asked to deal with political machines in an unprecedented manner, and yet words are used which are evidently incapable of ordinary interpretation. Only the Government, and. possibly, its caucus supporters, know what is the precise meaning intended to be conveyed; and the position is stranger still when we find the enormous penalty of  &#163;500  attached. Then, again, can anybody throw any light on the meaning of the words &#34; on behalf of or in the interests of any political party?&#34; What is the meaning of &#34;any political party?&#34; We have heard over and over again that there are now only two political parties, speaking generally ; but in a drastic measure of this kind we have no right to speak in generalities. There are many political parties apart from the two large parties ; indeed, there are two or three parties amongst honorable senators opposite. There is, for instance, the party of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> may be said to be a conspicuous and worthy member, and we have Free-traders, Revenue Tariffists, and Protectionists, including those who would adopt absolute prohibition, if, at the same time, the wages of all workers were increased to correspond. If an issue were raised on any of these questions, it is quite possible that the party, which is now united, would break up into three or four for the purpose of any election. How are we to define &#34; political party &#34; under such circumstances? Protectionists and free-traders would separately organize, although they are merged together as the Labour party in this chamber. Would these organizations be called political parties ? </para>

                        <para>- If that is to be the test, it is not so expressed in the Bill. People who believe in decimal coinage may form themselves into societies, subscribe funds, and address questions to candidates on the subject. By so doing they may bring themselves within the scope of this provision, and be compelled to furnish returns of their expenditure. I give these instances to show how unjust the intention of the clause is, and how imperfectly that unjust intention is expressed. Not the slightest attempt is made to safeguard the interests of persons acting for legitimate purposes of political reform. The clause is so framed that it may strike at the best political institutions in the community, and leave untouched powerful organizations which by corruption or tyranny may have an undue or unholy influence in politics. Even if the amendment is accepted - and it was suggested as much by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> as by this side - and trade unions are expressly mentioned in the Bill, they will be able so to manage their operations with a little legal assistance as to escape from its operation. </para>

                        <para>- In the whole history of constitutionally-governed countries there has never been perpetrated such an outrage on the community as this. Besides being outrageous, it is also useless. Trade unions were and are still economic bodies, and although they are gradually becoming political bodies, especially in Australia-, their constitutions may be so framed, whether they are registered or unregistered, that they will appear to be economic all the time. They employ, and very properly so, an army of organizers to bring about the improvement of the economic conditions of the workers ; but these men, for every word they address to their fellow workers on the economic and social side of their positions, address- half-a-dozen to them on the political side. The clause is framed with such malicious political ingenuity that even if trade . unions are expressly named in the Bill they can still escape its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that the clause, as framed, would allow them to do so, and they are the only possible bodies that can escape. The organizers of the Australian Workers Union and similar bodies go out. in droves throughout Australia suggesting means by which, through the Legislature and in other ways, the employers can be compelled to raise the wages of the workers. &#34; . </para>

                        <para>- The strongest partisan journals in Australia are the subsidized newspapers of a political party. Their very existence depends upon the financial support they receive from a political party, and yet that is the class of journalism, that,, is not going to be touched by the clause. I believe it was never intended by the other side that it should touch them. On the other hand the moment a, campaign , is started every great journal that may support our side has to account for every expense incurred for an article or advertisement in connexion with it. Again, therefore, unfair discrimination is made. Every Labour journal in Australia to-day is subsidized, and could not exist unless it expressed the political opinions of the Labour party, and backed up Labour candidates. Yet those journals cannot be touched, while the rest of Australian journalism is struck at. A newspaper, like an individual, has the right to express its political opinions, subject to the law of libel, but it has been assumed by the Government that every newspaper in Australia, outside the Labour journals, has turned against the Labour Socialist party, because it is subsidized by anti-Labour candidates or organizations to do so. It has been urged, as an instance, of the unfair play of the ordinary journalism of Australia, that it suppresses the speeches of Labour candidates, but any offence in that direction is, as a mole-hill to a mountain, when compared with the offence committed in the opposite direction by Australian: Labour journalism. Where is there a Labour journal in Australia that will give any space to a speech by a prominent member of this party? They teem with personalities with regard to their opponents, and some of them more or less deliberately manufacture utterances that have never been made by any of us. This clause, and the defence of it, is a most striking instance of Satan reproving sin.

                        <para>- The reporter must have been dreaming to have written such a thing, because I am confident that I did not say anything of the kind. A large amount of space was given in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and an almost equally large amount in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> to prominent Labour candidates, while many of our side who spoke in support of our candidates were not reported at all. It is to the credit of those journals that they did not adopt a partisan attitude in reporting the speeches in that campaign. The charge, therefore, fails against, the two great Melbourne dailies, and the same thing applies in Sydney and Adelaide. I hope I have now silenced for ever the charge that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> at any rate, was partisan, and bought. </para>

                    <para>. - Every one will admit that this is a very one-sided provision, designed to strike at all Liberal organizations, and especially to exempt all organizations which, although carried on as trade unions, are really political in their aims and objects. We maintain that it will not give fair play. The Minister of Defence said it would affect all organizations, but he has not shown that it will. We have heard a great deal as to what the press make out of a general election. My experience is that they make very little. It has been interjected during the course of this debate that articles of the character of &#34; Women to Women&#34; are practically paid for by certain organizations. I do not believe that they are, and we certainly have no proof for such an assertion. Under this clause it will be possible for any political organization to subsidize a newspaper for two years and nine months without fear of punishment, but as soon as a general election is announced the position will be altered. I suppose that the Government will then appoint a censor, who will read the leading articles in the daily newspapers and recommend that proceedings should be instituted where he believes an article has been published in the interests of and paid for by an organization supporting the opponents of the Ministry. At the present time a candidate for the Senate is not permitted to expend more than ,&#163;250 in connexion with his campaign. I do not know whether this provision is intended to affect the law in that regard. An attempt might be made to prove that articles published in a newspaper in favour of the return of a certain candidate were worth a certain amount to him, and that that amount should be included in his return as to election expenses. I have not had much experience in regard to metropolitan newspapers, but my experience of newspapers published- in provincial towns with a population of from 1.0,000 to 20,000 is that they report both sides on an equal footing. I take it that if a candidate for the Senate, or any organization on his behalf, expended more than &#163;250 by way of election expenses, that expenditure would invalidate his election. But if an organization chooses to pay a newspaper or any individual to do certain work in support of the candidature of some person for the Senate without his knowledge or consent, is that to disqualify him? No candidate should be penalized in respect of payments made without his consent. I trust that the Minister will give us the promised explanation, and show that these provisions will apply to all organizations. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has had ample opportunity to reply, but has failed to do so. The only spirit in which these provisions could have been conceived is that of the viper who sought revenge by biting the file. This provision does not touch the right to organize. Parties will still have the right to organize and to spend as much money as they like. Whenever the Labour party meets with a rebuff it immediately raises the cry, &#34;Look at the money that was spent in opposition to us.&#34; It has been said by them that &#163;40,000 was spent in the fight to secure the rejection of the referenda proposals. I do not think, however, that one-eighth of that amount was expended. In order to bolster up that cry, however, and to make people believe that there is something in it, they introduce legislation of this kind. There can be no doubt that this clause is intended to affect Liberal organizations. If that is not the intention of the Government, then let them accept an amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> intends to propose extending its provisions to trade unions and all other organizations. A conspicuous feature of the great newspapers throughout Australia is their fairness to all parties, and especially to those to whom they are opposed. Their opponents are given even better reports than their friends receive. This, after all, is only a puerile attack on the press, and will have no effect. It is but a poor return for the treatment which the press has extended to the Labour party. There is no limitation in this clause in regard either to party or to individual. The large and the infinitely small - the great organizations as well as a single individual - are brought within its scope; but the proposed penalty of .&#163;50 would not act as a deterrent in the case of any organization, or person of means. Temperance Societies, Protection and Free Trade Associations, Single Tax Leagues, and any other body of people supporting a particular cause, will come under this provision ; and I have no doubt that the Government will ultimately find that it will have a boomerang effect and come back upon them. </para>

                    <para>. - I had hoped that there would be no necessity for me to speak further on this clause after the militant and confident statement of the Minister that he was prepared to show that it was not intended to do what it declares shall be done. I have waited patiently for an hour and a half for his promised statement ; but we have been left in that state of delightful ignorance which the Ministry evidently intend to keep us in so far as this provision is concerned. An interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was speaking has led me to the conclusion that these provisions are going to be more far-reaching in their effect than I thought in the first instances they would be. The honorable senator declared that he would describe as &#34; a political party &#34; any party that ran a candidate for Parliament. I would point out that the Temperance party, which spends money - as it is entitled to do - in furtherance of its cause, not infrequently questions candidates on matters affecting the Temperance question, and having ascertained their views, may decide to support any one of them. In such a case, is that body to make a return of the money expended in furtherance of the central idea of its organization ? The liquor trade is also organized, and would, in the same way, come within these provisions. I can enumerate association after association which, ordinarily speaking, is outside the realm of political organization, but which will be brought under the yoke which the Ministry is seeking to place on all those who do not see eye to eye with the Labour party. So far-flung, will be the effect of this clause, that the Ministry will either shrink from enforcing it, or, if they do attempt to enforce it, so many public bodies will be affected, that a great public outcry will be raised, and one of the first duties of their successors will be to repeal these provisions. I wish to place on record the fact that we have not allowed these provisions to pass without a fair and comprehensive view of the iniquity that is sought to be perpetrated by them. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. These provisions will be applicable to all organizations, whether favorable or unfavorable to the Labour party. Under the principal Act the expenses of a candidate for the Senate may not exceed &#163;250, and those of a candidate for the House of Representatives may not exceed <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> contends, however, that there should be no limit to the expenditure which any person or organization may incur in the interests of a candidate, provided that it is incurred without his consent. Such a provision would defeat the very object of the Act in this regard, which is to enable persons of limited means to enter either House of the Parliament. If we were to allow any organization to expend more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;250</inline> on behalf of a candidate, so long as it did not do so with his consent, the position would&#39; be farcical. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator said that the Temperance organization and the Licensed Victuallers&#39; Association might be disposed to spend a large sum of money in the furtherance of their respective objects, and might advocate the return of candidates who, in their opinion, would do most to advance the respective causes they had at heart. But surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would not desire that power should be given them to spend what they liked in support of any candidate&#39;s return? When it was thought right to limit the expenditure of candidates no complaint can be made against this proposal to safeguard the provision we have made. Organizations should not be allowed to do what a candidate is not allowed to do. I do not think that honorable senators opposite are honest in what they have said about the prominence given to Labour candidates in the daily papers of Australia. Mine was not an isolated case, but at the last Senate election I do not think I was given  10  inches of space during my campaign, which lasted twelve weeks, whilst candidates standing in opposition to the Labour party were reported times out of number, and the reports of their utterances filled many columns. These provisions will be applicable to all journals, no matter what political party they support, and it should not be forgotten that there are now many Labour journals in Australia ; that there will shortly be a daily Labour newspaper published in Sydney ; that there is one already at Broken Hill, another at Adelaide, another at Hobart, and in all probability there will be one published very shortly in Melbourne. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment I have only to say that it is already provided for in sub-clause  2  of proposed new section  17 2 a. </para>

We know that big financial institutions and chambers of commerce spend thousands of pounds upon elections, and yet it is not proposed to include them. If we do not specifically name all other organizations we should not specially mention trade unions. I shall not press any amendment now, but I hope the Minister will see that every other organization shall be compelled to furnish a return of money spent upon elections as well as industrial organizations such as trade unions. </para>

                        <para>- I will accept the Minister&#39;s explanation that the amendment does not make any difference, but that may not be generally understood. I have heard honorable senators speaking of the army of organizers sent through the country by the Australian Workers Union. I have no doubt that those who made that reference believed they were telling the truth, but any one who has any connexion with the Australian Workers Union will know that in proportion to  their  business they do not send as many men through the country organizing as an ordinary warehouse in Melbourne or in Sydney will send out to push the sale of its goods. I am afraid that as trade unions are being specifically included in the provision charges of political expenditure will be made against them, and they will be given infinite trouble. </para>

                    <para>. - I think it is a great pity that we should use so many practically synonymous terms in the same clause. I cannot see how there can be any rational objection to the organizations or newspapers referred to in this clause making the proposed returns. The argument that certain organizations will, by the adoption of evasive rules, escape this obligation, is utter nonsense. As the Australian Workers Union, and other similar organizations, have been referred to at such length, it should be in order for me <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> reply to some of the aspersions cast upon those bodies. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that it would not have that effect. I cannot see how any union undertaking political work could escape the obligation to make a return under this clause. The Australian Workers Union has never made any pretence of being non-political. Amongst its published objects is to secure social justice by political means, and by its rules a certain portion of its funds are devoted to political purposes. We are not afraid to publish every penny we have expended, or ever will expend, on political purposes. As a matter of fact, that has always been done. I might mention that when we first attempted to register the organization in the New South Wales Arbitration Court we found that the Pastoralists Union- the employers&#39; organization - desired to register also. But when they discovered that they would have to publish a balance-sheet they withdrew. They absolutely refused to expose their hand, because they would either have to commit perjury or disclose the fact that they had a secret service fund with which they carried on their iniquitous proceedings to down our union. I protest against the frothy humbug of honorable senators opposite in professing that the organizations behind them are not guilty of any corruption and have nothing to be ashamed of. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but it will, at any rate, be a reply to the mean and stupid reflections which have been cast upon the Australian Workers Union, of which I have been a member since it was originated twenty-five years ago. The organizations with which honorable senators opposite are associated have flooded this country with lying and pernicious literature, and have suborned the perjured rats from every political party in the Commonwealth. They go round the country traducing Labour men and every article of our platform, twisting, distorting, lying, and deceiving - words fail me ! - in order to maintain the party opposite in Parliament. By their perjured villiany they assist the party opposite, who , try to hide themselves under the fair-sounding name of Liberals, when we know that every Conservative and reactionary force in the Commonwealth is ranged behind them, as well as every sweating employer and every scoundrelly&#39; manufacturer ; and every one associated with them, no matter to which organization he nominally belongs, appears to be capable of twisting the whole of the Ten Commandments into service on their behalf. I feel that I must express the real indignation which every honest member of this party must have for those who are ranged behind honorable senators opposite, and who, by trading upon the ignorance of some and the prejudice of others, manage to secure the return of those honorable gentlemen. Yet we find honorable senators who are supported by such people, and doing their dirty lying work, traducing the Australian Workers Union, which is not only the largest but one of the fairest and finest organizations which has ever existed in the Commonwealth, and has done more than any other organization to bring to their knees a class of employers who have practised every meanness of which employers are capable. The Australian Workers Union has compelled these employers in recent years to hand over a little of the plunder and spoil they took from the pockets of their poor workmen a generation before. Honorable senators who have traduced this organization should hide their diminished heads in shame. They should go home; and not waste the time of the Senate in an effort to uphold the fort and resist the so-called Labour tyranny on behalf of these miserable, lying, perjured rags which will give prominence to everything they have to say about our side. </para>

They never attempt to disguise or conceal that fact. They would never dream of adopting the subterfuges which have been suggested by honorable senators opposite to escape the provisions of this Bill. The Australian Workers Union has nothing to be ashamed of, except that a number of its members are not sufficiently wise to insist upon more money being expended upon political work. </para>

                    <para>.- In the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> we might have sought your ruling, sir, as to whether a good many of the terms which he employed were quite in accordance with parliamentary practice. But everybody recognised that it was only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> who was speaking, and at this hour of the morning we were glad to have the tedium of what would otherwise have been a tame sitting somewhat relieved. But when the honorable senator, after pouring out some of the sentences which he did, turned round and made the statement that words failed him, he indeed trespassed too much upon our good nature. Although we know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and he knows himself, and is even now smiling at the rhetorical fireworks in which he indulged, I say that if he were to repeat his statements outside this building he would go perilously close to breaking the law of libel. </para>

                        <para>- And my statement may be right or wrong. But it is altogether wrong to say that when we criticise this Bill we criticise the union. Coming more particularly to the clause under consideration, I did urge the Minister, some little time ago, instead of inserting the words which the Committee decided to insert, to strike out all words such as &#34; association,&#34; or &#34; league,&#34; and to make the clause read &#34; Every organization, &#38;c.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who has since declared that that is what he desired, was asleep at the time, and only woke up when it was too late to accomplish his object. We have had the assurance of the Government that there is no desire on their part to differentiate between one party and another in regard to the treatment which&#39; is meted out under this Bill. That being so, I wish to make it perfectly clear that no organizationLabour or otherwise - ought to be permitted to avoid the obligations thrown upon it simply by publishing its own return of expenses incurred during an election campaign. May I point out that the clause does not cover the case of a league which publishes its own newspaper, and we know that newspapers of that kind are published. The <inline font-style="italic">Vanguard</inline> is a case in point. From time to time, too, the Liberal party has published similar journals when a general election was pending. Such organizations ought not to be allowed to escape the provisions of this clause, merely because, instead of subsidizing an existing newspaper, they, foi the time being, run their own journals. </para>

But before doing so I propose to offer a few observations upon the opinion expressed by the honorable senator in regard to the Australian Workers Union, for which he now professes such a high admiration. I have taken the trouble to look up his statements as they are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I find that they do not quite square with his recent professions.

He made that statement after I had distinctly affirmed that I would repudiate any political party and any organization which sought to restrain or coerce any trade unionist from asserting his political or economic position. I said that any combination formed to prevent him from doing that, would be a tyrannical one. I made the same statement long before I entered this chamber. In saying that, I think I voiced the general opinion of the Opposition in regard to unionism, and therefore it was almost infamous for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to assert that we are the tools of a perjured party who seek to persecute, and tyrannize over, trade unionists. </para>

                        <para>- I deny that. There are few men whose tongues or pen has been busier than has my own, either inside or outside this chamber. I defy any-honorable senator opposite to point to a single utterance of mine derogatory to the right of a unionist to associate himself with his fellows for the purpose of improving his economic, his political, or his social position. In employing the venomous terms which he did, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was allowing the latent passion of political prejudice to bubble over. But I do not wish to pursue this matter further. If I may be allowed to reply to his attack with the same vigour that he himself displayed, I say that I cast back the accusation which he hurled at our party, and in which he must necessarily have included me, despite the tone of the speech which I had delivered only a short time previously. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Let the honorable senator consult the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of my utterances. What I said was that when the members of any organization thought that legislation curtailed their rights and liberties it was only human nature for them to endeavour to evade it. I still believe that, notwithstanding this measure which I have stigmatized as an outrage upon any political machine and every political organization. This clause is equally an outrage upon the whole of them. Whatever political or economic principles they may profess, I say that they will seek to evade - lawfully where they can - legislation which they think  unjustly curtails their rights. In saying that I make no reflection upon them. I defy .anybody to point to a single utterance of mine derogatory to the legitimate claims of unionism. What sort of reflection is it to say that persons who will not join trade unions shall have their lives made &#34;a hell on earth &#34; ? Nothing will recoil more heavily or more quickly against the Labour party than unrebuked expressions of that kind. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not care whether the clause i* amended in the direction desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or not. On a previous occasion he pointed out how the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of New South Wales can evade the provisions of this clause. There is what he terms a subsidy to be -paid for the maintenance of that journal. It is not merely a subsidy, but a payment to the newspaper, in another form, out of the annual amount which is deducted from the subscriptions of the members of the Australian Workers Union. In return for that subscription, each member of the union gets a copy of the newspaper sent weekly, post free, to any address in Australia. At the ordinary rate of a penny per copy the newspaper would cost 4s. 4d. per year. The edition which is sent specially to the members of the union apart from that which is offered to the public contains matter of special interest, and is retailed at 2d. per copy. There are more single copies sent out&#34; from the <inline font-style="italic">Worker office</inline> than from any other newspaper office, except possibly from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> office. The members of the Australian Workers </para>

It has, I may add, the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in Australia.

For what reason do honorable senators opposite say that a newspaper will have to send in a return because it advocates a certain line of policy ? </para>

                        <para>-The <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> to which I refer, embraces South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. Recently it devoted a considerable portion of its space to the consideration of the politics of Victoria owing to the imminence of a general election here. Is it intended to charge the cost of the production of the newspaper for the three or six weeks during which it gave special prominence to political matters concerning Victoria, when political matters relating to other States were more or less dealt with in those issues? The return which is required by this clause is intended to apply to the advocacy of the candidature of a particular person, and not to the advocacy of the general principles. If any amendment can be suggested which will more clearly bind every newspaper to furnish a return, no matter by whom it is owned, I have not the slightest objection to offer, but I think that it would only load up the clause to make such an alteration. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Defence has stated that the clause is intended to embrace in its compass all publications, whether initiated .for the purpose of an election or otherwise. If that is the case, can there be any possible objection on his part to make the intention perfectly clear? It only relates to a. return of any money expended, or any expense incurred in printing, publishing, or issuing, electoral advertisements or notices. </para>

Clearly what is contemplated is what takes place ordinarily where an organization or an individual prints or publishes, or causes to be printed or published, an electoral advertisement, or a notice, or  a  handbill, or obtains an advertisement in  a  newspaper which is apart from itself or himself. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister pretends that he wishes the provision to cover all the cases to which I have referred. But it is doubtful whether,, by reason of the language used, some newspaper which is  published for the purpose of an election will not be left outside the compass of the provision. All I ask is the insertion  of  words which will make it quite clear that it applies, not merely to those organizations or parties which put advertisements or electoral matter in journals owned by others, but also to journals which are started for the purpose of an election. I suppose that there is no big city which has not seen  a journal  issued by one party or other for the purpose of an election. Even suppose that there is a possibility that the clause does cover such a journal, the words I proposed to insert will do no more than the Minister says he is willing to do; but they will lift entirely out of the region of doubt the point I have raised. </para>

                        <para>- If we are going to alter sub-clause  1  of proposed new section  172B  we ought also to alter the provision to which the Minister has drawn my attention. Suppose that an organization decides that for the purpose of an election it will run a newspaper. The proprietor or publisher of, say, the <inline font-style="italic">Vanguard</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Federalist,</inline> having to make a return under sub-clause  1  of proposed new section  172B,  will say, &#34; There is no political matter in respect of which I have received or expect to receive payment.&#34; The whole beginning, middle, and end of the newspaper would be the payment which it had received from the association. Yet you could not point to a leading or side article or an item of news, and say that it had been paid for. I ask honorable senators to put it beyond doubt that the provision before the Committee applies to all publications of that sort. My amendment will not be in the interests of one party more than in the interests of another party. At the last election the Labour party published the <inline font-style="italic">Vanguard,</inline> and it is on the cards that at the next election the Liberal party may follow that example. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister refuses my amendment, not because he thinks it is right or wrong, but because he fears that some little political capital will be made out of its acceptance. If I had wished to do that I should have allowed this imperfect clause to go through without alteration. For political purposes it would have suited me for the Bill to pass untouched. But in view of the Minister&#39;s declaration, that he declines to accept my amendment for the reason that the pride of the Ministry might be touched, because he fears that it might be possible for the Opposition to make a little political capital out of his acceptance, I recognise that it is hopeless to further appeal to him. I trust, however, that the Committee will recognise the force of my statement. I have not heard a single statement to suggest that the class of publications to which I have referred ought to be exempt. </para>

                        <para>- In his present spirit of obstinacy, of course, the Minister will not make that admission. A genuine doubt exists as to whether the provision does cover a certain class of publications. The Minister says, &#34; I want to do what the Opposition wished to do,&#34; but for fear that it might be thought outside that some little pressure had been exercised on the Government, he declines to accept my amendment. The Government know perfectly well that nothing which we could do could force them to act against their will. The Government supporters know that quite well, too. All we can do is to appeal to them, and having made an appeal, I ask the Committee to come to a vote. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that I have to differ absolutely from the view which is taken by the Minister. I have had the benefit of a short consultation on the effect of the clause as proposed to be amended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and if there is anything I feel clear and certain about it is that the Minister is missing entirely the purpose at which he says he is aiming. I cannot see how it will be possible to get hold of a special newspaper which will not accept articles from outside persons because of the specialists whom it employs on its staff. Some of these special newspapers last for a few months, while others have a perpetual existence. It is an assumption of gross pragmatism on the part of the Minister to say that he alone is infallible as to the interpretation of this clause. It must be clear from the criticisms which have come from this side that if the amendment were inserted there could be no doubt as to its scope. Otherwise we probably will miss the very purpose which both sides have in view. It is a case of superior pragmatism for the Minister, with a sort of hoity-toity air, to walk out of the chamber under a criticism of this kind. He ought to have the good taste to remain here and listen. I feel myself as capable of judging what is the effect of a clause as the Minister is, and in a case where we have no party interests to serve it is worse than pragmatism for Ministers to treat us in this way, to assert that they are infallible in their interpretation and will not discuss, even with a semblance of patience, an amendment which, if adopted, would insure beyond the shadow of a doubt the accomplishment of the very object which both sides seek to attain. </para>

The demand is to be made upon every individual who incurs expense in connexion with an election - there is no limit - to declare the amount of it, a point to which, I think, I drew attention on the second reading. If a citizen, taking just the degree of interest in politics that a member of the Labour party would approve, entertains a candidate, he will have to make a return showing the cost of the entertainment. </para>

                        <para>- The Government, or the Department, appears not to know what it wants, and not to understand the effect of its proposals. The Warrego Shearing Association, which I visited the other day, did not have a doorkeeper, and none of the other persons coming under the definition could furnish the statement required. While I support the amendment, I nevertheless think that the Government should seriously consider the question of introducing into the definition clause words to explain the meaning of the word &#34; officer.&#34; Otherwise, the word may be taken to mean anything or nothing. </para>

Before we have had time to consider the clause, we are asked to drop it. I complain, first of all, that the Government have brought down a proposal about which they have told us nothing, and. that they now seek to retreat from it like a parcel of whipped boys, without affording any explanation of their retreat. </para>

                        <para>- Then I suspect the Government at once. After the persistent and obstinate attitude of the Government all night, when they profess to meet the wishes of the Opposition, they stand, not only suspected, but absolutely condemned. The Minister in charge of the Bill has not even waited to learn the views of the Opposition on this clause. He gave us no opportunity of expressing them before appealing to the Committee to strikeout this very vital proposal which, with all solemnity, the Government had put into the Bill. We were entitled to rather better treatment, seeing that we had just rescued Ministers from the trying ordeal of a conflict with one of their own loyal supporters, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> Surely we are entitled to be furnished with some reason for this remarkable change of front. The Government carefully inserted in the Bill a proposal to render illegal the hiring and employment of any vehicle for the purpose of conveying electors to the poll. They have suddenly abandoned that position. </para>

                <para class="block">Why? If the Minister is prepared to tell us  1  shall resume my seat at once. Otherwise I am put in the painful position of having to roam over a large area of speculation to find out why a Government that came along with such a valiant front had certainly played the part of political cowards, and run away from their own proposition. It appears fo me, in the first place, that the Government were moved by a large spasm of virtue which caused them to determine that there should be &#34; no more cakes and ale &#34; at election time in this country. Therefore, they proposed to render it impossible for any organization - which, of course, meant the organizations of their political enemies - to hire vehicles&#34; on election day. But, perhaps, it has been conveyed to Ministers that a large number of votes are vested in the cab interest, and that the drivers and proprietors of these vehicles would lose a considerable amount of money if the clause were adopted. Consequently the Government have suddenly retreated from their position. If I am doing them an injustice, Ministers should let us know. But they have not furnished us with a single reason for this change. We are entitled to look for some more or less sinister motive, judging them by their past actions. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. No such view has ever been entertained by the Government. It was intended to tighten up the provisions of the Electoral Act by preventing the wholesale engagement of any kind of vehicle - motor cars, hansom cabs, waggonettes, &#38;c. - by candidates or their friends who might be disposed to spend money in such direction. But, after further consideration, the Government felt that, no matter how closely they might desire to safeguard the provisions with regard to -the employment of vehicles, it would be well-nigh a matter of impossibility to prevent their utilization in connexion with elections. Therefore,&#39; we desire the provisions of the principal Act in this respect to remain in operation. </para>

                    <para>. - If the Government have been judged unfairly in this matter they have only themselves to blame. Why did they not tell the Committee why they proposed this clause in the first instance, and why they now wish to drop it? But no explanation was furnished until now, when the Minister, stung by the fact that I had pretty well discovered the secret of the change, has furnished an excuse which his most whole-hearted admirer must consider p remarkably thin. Nevertheless, the Minister&#39;s explanation is welcome, because we like to know what the Government, have to say for themselves. I venture to express the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> himself will not expect me or any omer honorable senator to accept his statement as entirely reassuring!. He has told us that the Government desired to tighten up the provisions of the principal Act. Do they not desire to tighten up those provisions any longer? Was the clause inserted in a hurry and  with  out thought? The Government have had something like twelve months in which to consider their measure. After this long period of deliberation they came to the conclusion, to use the Minister&#39;s euphemistic term, that it was desirable to &#34; tighten up &#34; the provisions. But no sooner did they bring down their Bill than they abandoned one pf the provisions which they had been twelve months considering. In five minutes they came to the conclusion that it would be impossible to carry out the clause. I suggest that my explanation is, after all, a very much more convincing one - that it has been conveyed to the Government either by their friends in the ranks of the unions or otherwise- </para>

Here is a Govern- , ment which has had the Bill under consideration for a whole year. It did not insert any clause in a hurry. I have no doubt that the Bill was drafted in the Department long ago. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Minister, for his own credit, had better say that it was, and so escape, at any rate, some of the odium which would otherwise attach to him. The whole Bill must have been before the Cabinet for consideration three or four times. It was introduced into the Senate containing this clause. Now we are asked to believe that, as a result of further consideration, and without any pressure or influence from outside, the Government have decided to abandon the provision. Honorable senators can accept that explanation or mine, as they please. </para>

                    <para>. - We have been told that the Government find that it would be practically impossible to apply this clause effectively. In the early hours of the morning, when we were considering clause 32, the application of which involves enormous difficulties, Ministers had no hesitation in forcing it through. But they drop clause 34 without a moment&#39;s consideration, and after a forced explanation, which no one can accept as genuine. What kind of stuff is that to give us ? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand why the Bill prescribes an old and obsolete style of type. The Government must be actuated by Conservative principles. At the present time the Commonwealth is subsidizing a newspaper in Papua that is furnished on the point system. Why do they do that and still ask us to provide in this Bill that advertisements shall be headed in letters not larger than long primer ? I am not a practical printer, and do not profess to know as much about the subject as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> does ; but I do know that the point system is now used all over the world, even in comparatively small printing offices. If the Bill were in charge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I could understand a reluctance to accept the suggestion for amendment. We may accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on guns and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> on chaff or haggis, but we do not expect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who has been closely associated with the printing trade, to resist an amendment of this character. He knows that to lay down that the type used is to be not smaller than long primer is to mention an obsolete term that is not regarded in modern methods of calculating type sizes. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend belongs to the type that is called &#34;French grotesque,&#34; but I will not pursue that point. Let us have up-to-date terms used in this Bill. I am ashamed of the Honorary Minister. I blush for him as a printer. He knows that long primer type cannot be measured except by a sort of rule-of-thumb. There are two different type systems. There is the English system, which measures type according to certain names and sizes - pica, long primer, bourgeois, brevier, nonpariel, pearl, and so forth. The American system, which measures eight, ten, twelve, sixteen, and twenty-four points, is now being adopted all over the world, and it is one that can be easily understood. </para>

                    <para>. - I notice that the clause provides that a person shall not make an untrue statement in any electoral paper or in answer to any question, or in any information supplied to any officer or can-&#39; vasser for the purpose of the preparation of the new rolls under a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> Section 182 of the Act, however, dealing with electoral offences, provides that no person shall &#34; wilfully make a false statement &#34; in any claim, application, return, . or declaration, or in answer to any question under a penalty of imprisonment not. exceeding two years. It appears as though the draftsman has not been sufficiently careful to look at the old provisions; and I should like to, know whether there has been an oversight or whether there is any special reason for this double provision. The word &#34;canvasser&#34; is used, and I ask whether it is intended to superimpose on the compulsory enrolment system the present system of police canvass? If so, I am afraid that no end of difficulty will be created, because the two systems can never work side by side. If we have the police canvassing, even partly, the electors will fall back on the familiar practice of leaving the business to the police. The only way to carry out compulsory enrolment is to make a public announcement that the whole responsibility rests with the individual electors. </para>

                    <para>. - Section 182 of the principal Act, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has called attention, provides for a punishment of imprisonment not exceeding two years for any persons who &#34; wilfully &#34; makes a false statement ; and it will be seen that this very serious offence calls for a heavy penalty. It is not desired, however, to make it an absolutely criminal matter for a person to make an untrue statement; and, therefore, we think that a fine not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> is sufficient. As to the card system, I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is as familiar with what is proposed as is any member of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Under the existing law, there is no right to threaten the elector with punishment in regard to the filling in of a householder&#39;s card, and such a threat is an outrage. Whatever power there may be to compel each individual to fill in a card, there is no power to compel any one to fill in any card except his own, and even that power I doubt. Are these house-to-house visits of the police to be the beginning and end of the card system? There are a dozen ways in which the system can fail. For instance, there are many electors who do not live in houses, but in camps in the bush ; and there ought to be some provision to supply them with cards. </para>

                        <para>- Are the police going round to those people with cards? We are running a danger if we attempt to graft the police canvass on compulsory enrolment, because, so long as the people know that the police are collecting the names, they will refrain from voluntary enrolment. The proper way is to let every elector know that he is personally responsible, and that in future the police will not &#34; wet nurse &#34; him. </para>

We ought to be informed what provision is being made, not merely for fixed residents, but for the travelling population, to easily obtain cards, and to forward them to the Department. We may anticipate that cards will be available at every police station, and other public offices ; but we have not been t old so. Further, we have not been told whether there is any provision for free transmission of the card through the Post Office. </para>

                        <para>- I dispute that altogether. The fact is that the Department has tried on a game of bluff, and it is not surprising, because it has largely lived on bluff during the whole of its existence. When a citizen receives an official-looking card he assumes that there is some legal power behind it; but I venture to say that the first time the Department attempted to launch a prosecution it would find out its mistake. However, the Department is so well aware that the game is one of bluff that it will never launch a prosecution. This discussion has elicited from the Minister a skeleton idea of what is proposed, but we have had to dig pretty hard for that skeleton. The Minister ought to complete the story and tell us exactly what is contemplated under this card system. The Minister smiles ; and I dare say he thinks it preposterous that a weak Opposition should dare to make such a request. </para>

                        <para>- The Honorary Minister ought to let honorable senators know whether the surmises I have made are correct. What steps are to be taken to keep a check in order that there may be no duplication? Electors may vote all over Australia, and this will make the task of supervision constant and heavy. Are checks to be employed in. each division or throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, as they should be? An elector who moves from Victoria to South Australia ought not to be allowed to remain on both rolls. I should like to draw attention to an extraordinary position with regard to the Commonwealth and State rolls. Generally speaking, the percentage of voters who vote in Commonwealth elections is a gradually rising one; but, for some reason or other, the percentage is a gradually falling one in the case of the States. I am speaking generally, because I believe there is one State in which this tendency is not operating. We cannot believe that the electors are keener to vote in Federal elections than they are in State elections ; and I think the difference arises from the fact that one set of rolls is more perfect than the other. The card system ought to be so complete that duplication is impossible or will be reduced to a minimum; and I appeal to the Minister to make a full statement as to what is contemplated. By such a step he cannot jeopardize the Bill, because he has the majority behind him, and the information is due to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Government decide to accept advice from the Opposition they should accept it in its entirety or leave it alone. By accepting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon&#39;s</inline> advice partially they will make the Bill as ridiculous as it deserves to be. Either one term or the other would have been right, but to put the two in together is absurd. If the two denominations agreed in size there would be no objection to putting them <inline font-style="italic">both</inline> in as alternative terms, but what the Minister intends to do is just the same thing as telling some one to purchase a certain thing which was &#34;not to be smaller than  9  inches or  10  inches.&#34; It is obvious that the smaller dimension would suit all purposes. The  10  point is a shade smaller than long primer, and, if it is intended to put that in, it should stand alone as marking the minimum to which the Government agree. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator spoke about Victoria. Apparently he cannot get away from that State. Cannot he give a plain &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No&#34; to my question? He will not get his Bill through any the quicker by attempting to browbeat me. New section  j8.ib  is one of the most ridiculous things which could be put into an Act. An elector, after receiving his&#39; voting paper, goes into a polling booth, which is strictly private. No one can overlook what he is doing. He may leave in the booth a card or dodger, for which the next man entering the booth may be blamed. This is a provision which cannot be enforced unless the secrecy of the ballot is violated. New section  181c  provides -  &#34; (1.) A candidate, or a person acting on behalf of, or in the interests of a candidate, shall not employ, for reward, any person as canvasser or committeeman or in any capacity in connexion with an election, unless the expense incurred could be lawfully incurred by the candidate under Part XIV. of this Act......    &#34;(2.)Reward&#39; in this section includes any payment or promise of payment direct or indirect to the person employed or to the wife or husband or any relative of that person.&#34; </para>

A person shall not make any untrue statement in any electoral paper, or in answer to any question under this Act, or in any information supplied to any officer or canvasser for the purposes of the preparation of new rolls......... </para>

                    (New South Wales) holds that new section  i8id,  with regard to untrue statements, deals only with minor inaccuracies which are not wilfully false. If so, a penalty of&#163;100 is unduly severe. The untrue statement may be made inadvertently; and, although the penalty provided is a maximum, a bench is apt to be led to think that Parliament takes a much more serious view of the offence than is actually the case. A much more serious offence later on is punishable with a maximum penalty of only&#163;5.

                        <para>- Yes, and it is because we consider the offence a very serious one that we make it punishable by imprisonment. We desire now to make provision to deal with persons who make untrue statements under the Act. It is difficult to prove in all cases that there has been wilful intent, although very often there can be no reasonable doubt that the untrue statement was wilfully made, and persons who make untrue statements in connexion with the electoral law ought to be punished. We are extending the provisions of the law as to absent voters, and wish to take every possible precaution against impersonation or fraud. This proposed new section provides for a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100,</inline> but I shall endeavour to meet the wishes of the Opposition by proposing that it be reduced to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20.</inline> It does not follow that any one convicted of an offence under this provision will be fined the maximum penalty. In only a very serious case would that penalty be imposed. </para>

                    <para>. - In reducing the maximum penalty fixed under this proposed new section, the Minister will give away nothing, because whatever the maximum penalty -might be, a small fine would only be imposed for a trivial offence.  We have to remember that, under this measure, electors are required to supply a number of trivial details, and that if by accident an untrue statement in regard to any of those details were made, there would be no escape under the proposed new section for the person making it. This is not a party matter, so far as I am concerned. It is because I recognise that persons might innocently make an untrue statement, and under the provision as it stands would have to be punished, that I propose the insertion of the word. &#34; wilfully.&#34; I am surprised that the Minister will not accept what is, after all, a very reasonable proposition. </para>

                    <para>. - --The Government in connexion with this Bill, and a good deal of legislation introduced by them during the present as well as last session, are bringing Australia under a sort of <inline font-style="italic">Code Napoleon.</inline> They are taking up the French idea that a man is .to be assumed guilty until he has proved his innocence. The amendment, however, is in accordance with the British idea of justice, and ought to be accepted. The Government are building up a reign of terror. New crimes are being invented by them from time to time, and here we have another. Unless the word &#34; wilfully &#34; be inserted as proposed, a man may be punished for an untrue statement innocently made. During the last few days my wife and I have received cards from Queensland requesting us to place our names on the Federal roll for that State. My wife&#39;s name is on the Victorian roll when she is living here, but I will not go on the Victorian roll. I keep my name on the Queensland roll. An eminent member of the Senate told me recently that his name is on two State rolls and one Federal roll, and he argued that I should be justified in allowing my name to appear on more than one roll. I could honestly answer questions, and cause my name to appear on three or four rolls, but I have not done so. However, I do not wish to waste time. </para>

We have been told that these rolls are to be prepared for the mysterious card system which has not been explained, and since a penalty of&#163;100 is provided for the offence of giving false information under the clause, we have a perfect right to know what the proposed card system really is. </para>

                    <para>. - It is easy to imagine that in large centres of population the card system can be worked with the aid of police and post-office officials, but we should be informed as to how the Government propose to work the system in connexion with the enrolment of the nomadic population of the west and north-west of Queensland, of western New South Wales, and, possibly, also of Western Australia. There must be an essential difference between the method adopted for carrying out the system in towns, and the practice to be followed in its application to a remote and sparsely-settled district. I have made a courteous request for specific information on the subject, and yet the Minister remains silent, and has not the courtesy to give me a reply. </para>

I say now that every possible precaution will be taken to see that every adult citizen entitled to be enrolled shall be supplied with the necessary card to fill in, and send to the proper authority in order to secure enrolment. This will be done by means of the police and post-office officials, and if the facilities afforded in this way are not sufficient, other provision will be made to give effect to the system. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;12.10 p.m.&#93;. - I think it is a great&#34; mistake to attempt to introduce this provision in this form. We can all imagine cases in which it would be very desirable that the Judge should be given the power to call the Chief Electoral Officer or a representative of the Department before the Court as a witness, or to defend the administration of the Department. The proper officer would be the Chief Electoral Officer. But when an unsuccessful candidate and the successful candidate at an election are parties to a petition presented to the Court of Disputed Returns it will be a very serious thing if we bring in a third party and multiply the costs in respect of an issue in which primarily he is not concerned. But the reason my honorable friend gives for the introduction of this clause is that in the past charges have been made against Presiding Officers in polling booths - charges which directly affect the Department. What I wish to point out is that the proceedings which are instituted in connexion with an electoral petition are not instituted for the purpose of inquiry into any such charges. They are brought for the purpose of settling a dispute between two persons, and if incidentally reflections are passed upon the administration of the Electoral Department, the  President  of the Court should have the power to call the Chief Electoral Officer as a witness. But to convert a petition to determine whether or not a candidate has been properly elected into a double-barrelled procedure is a very different matter. No respondent to a petition ought to be obliged to fight a claim of that sort. Although the Government would be very careful in such circumstances not to unduly assert their own power, still the risk ought not to be incurred. My honorable friend must see that his proposal would add a new penalty in the case of a sitting member whose seat had been challenged.  His  object is no doubt a good one, and there are circumstances in which it is de- sizable that the Chief Electoral Officer should be afforded an opportunity .of defending his administration. But that should not be done by changing the character of the proceedings. I would suggest to the honorable senator that he might consider the clause with a view to effecting his purpose by making at least two changes in it.

                        <para>- That position would be met by empowering the  President  of the Court to call the Chief Electoral Officer as a witness in his own defence. My serious objection to the proposal is that it is undesirable to duplicate the investigation by adding to it an inquiry into charges affecting the Department. If such charges are preferred they ought to be made the subject of departmental examination and acquittal. An inquiry as to whether a candidate has been properly elected does not affect the Department at all, except so far as matters which have been omitted to be done, may touch its status,. No officer of the Department would be dismissed merely because the  President  of the Court stated that there had been certain irregularities, and that, as a result of those irregularities the elected candidate could not hold his seat. If charges are made against the Department, the Chief Electoral Officer ought to be afforded an opportunity of being heard in his own defence. It would be a poorly constituted Court if its  President  could not say to the parties, &#34; If you do not call so-and-so as witness I will do so.&#34; From that point of view the purpose of my honorable friend could be achieved by merely giving the Court of Disputed Returns power in any case in which irregularities are imputed to the Department, to summon and examine such persons as it may think necessary. </para>

Now, we believe that a provision of this kind would enable the Department to enter an appearance, and if it were proved to the satisfaction of the Court that its officers were responsible for such informalities, the Court would have power to award costs against the Department. But, as the law stands at present, the Department has not an opportunity of appearing in Court, no matter what the successful or unsuccessful candidate may say in regard to it. Although the Department may have been remiss in its duties, the costs are heaped upon the shoulders of the successful or unsuccessful candidate, with the result that on three or four occasions appeals Have been made to Parliament to grant monetary aid to those who have been unnecessarily burdened by the principal Act. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very pleased that the Minister has seen fit to accept the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> which will remove one of the objections urged against the clause by members of the Opposition. There is one reason why it is desirable that the change should be made. The Chief Electoral Officer is an administrative officer, who should not be in any sense of the word a partisan, and who should be careful at all times to avoid siding with one of the contesting parties. If he were marked out as an individual who had a right to enter an appearance in every petition relating to a disputed election, he would always be in opposition to the defeated candidate, and there is a possibility that he would come to be regarded as a partisan rather than as an administrative officer - a position that would be absolutely intolerable. I feel sure that before many years have passed he will have cause to be thankful that he has been prevented from being placed in a position of that kind. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the amendment will probably affect the question of costs. It may be that the costs of an appeal to the Court may be distributed between the respondent and the Chief Electoral Officer, and, in such circumstances, the petitioner may be exposed to the liability to pay a double set of costs. Is that altogether wise? </para>

But if the Department be made a respondent in the case, it will have to bear its share of the expense, just as will any other party who appears before the Court. </para>

Then, by virtue of a provision in the principal Act, all discretion as to the awarding of costs is vested in the Court. The amendment is necessary if effect is to be given to the first portion of the clause.

                    <para>. - This clause enables a person to hang up for three years a prosecution which he may desire to launch. It is too long a period, I think, to allow a person to nurse a grievance or to hold a sword over the head of another man. Not only that, but as time went on it would probably become exceedingly difficult for the defendant in a case to find evidence to rebut the charge when made. I do not know what the procedure under the ordinary law is, but this clause seems to specifically authorize a person to rest on his alleged grievance for three years and then to launch a prosecution. That is absolutely unfair to the other person. There is a possibility of the provision being used most unfairly. Three years is the term of a Parliament. Suppose that one of two candidates wins a seat by a narrow majority, and he thinks that he has evidence to lay a charge against his unsuccessful opponent. He does not present the charge until the lapse of nearly three years. </para>

                        <para>- I can imagine a successful candidate entertaining a fear as to what may happen on the occasion of the next contest. Suppose that at the last election which was held eighteen months ago, a successful candidate felt that he had found evidence of some wrong-doing on the part of an unsuccessful candidate. And he decided to hang up the case until the eve of the next general, election, when his old opponent would be representing himself to the electors. That is one of the occasions when this provision might be used most unfairly. If a man has a case of wrongdoing under the Act, he should not be allowed to rest for three years and then bring it forward when the possibility of obtaining rebutting evidence may have disappeared. </para>

                        <para>- No; but this provision applies to minor cases as well as major cases. Take section 180, for instance, which requires any hand-bill or pamphlet, or advertisement to carry on it an imprint, or the name of the person authorizing publication. Surely it is monstrous to allow a charge of. that description against a man to be hung up for three years. Section 159, too, has a bearing on this matter. It says - </para>

                <para class="block">Let us suppose that the time within which an election can be questioned - a matter of some three months - has passed away, that at the expiry of that period the ballot-papers are destroyed, and that six months or twelve months, or three years later, a person comes along and launches against a man a charge of having tampered with the ballot-papers. That is a monstrously unfair thing to allow. If the Committee decides to allow a charge to be launched within a period of three years after the , alleged offence has been committed, it ought to modify section 159 by providing that the ballot-papers, which may be the proof of either the wrong doing or the innocence of a man, shall be preserved for a similar period. </para>

The honorable senator must not suppose that the Government are keeping alive for three years the right to challenge a seat, but &#34;they are keeping alive for three years the right to charge any person with tampering with ballot-papers. </para>

                        <para>-Ii  is easy for the honorable senator to speak in that way, but I submit that, where there is no evidence to justify the proposed change in the law, it ought not to be put in the power of a person, either innocently or maliciously, to hang up a charge over another person. Under this provision a malicious person could do no end of injury to an innocent person if he were so disposed. It does not affect the interest of a man whose seat has been allowed to go without challenge. Once that time has expired he is no longer concerned in charges. Fifty charges may be launched, and it may be proved that every ballot-paper which was cast in his favour was forged, but that will not unseat him. It is monstrous to allow a charge against a wrongdoer to be tied up for three years. I hope that the Minister will see the wisdom pf allowing the clause to drop, or, at any rate, of modifying the period. I again call his attention to the flat contradiction between proposed new section  209A  and section  159. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion a period of three years is quite short enough. Suppose that a person commits a most serious offence against the Act. Two years may pass before anything transpires. If the period were shortened, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has suggested, a wrongdoer, whom no one here wishes to defend, might be allowed to go scot-free, because the law provided that after the expiry of a very brief period a wrong-doer cannot be brought to justice even though his wrongdoing has come to light. </para>
