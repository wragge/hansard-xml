                        -S3]- - I beg to second the motion which has just been submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. In so doing, I may direct attention to two points which occur to me in reference to the important occasion of which we are now proposing to take official notice by a resolution of the Senate. The first point is this. This motion appeals, I am sure, to the members of the Senate - as I believe it would appeal to the citizens of this country outside if submitted to them - not merely as sounding a note of congratulation to the distinguished personage who has been called to the throne the Empire, but as a notification to the world at large that Australia recognises that she is not only an integral portion of the Empire, but intends so to remain. Further, I desire to observe that we may pass this motion - as I am sure we shall do - with additional pleasure from the reason that, for the first time of our history, we have now called to the throne a Sovereign who is personally known to many of us, and who has personally made himself acquainted with Australia. I am sure that I shall have honorable senators with me when I venture to express the hope that circumstances will be so fortunate to us - and I may add so favorable to  His  Majesty - that he may again be -afforded an opportunity to visit this country. If he should see an opportunity of so doing, I venture to say that there is no portion of the Empire in which he will be more cordially welcomed than in this Commonwealth of ours.

                <para class="block">Before I begin my speech, I wish to express my regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> one of the delegates to the Coronation, is suffering from bronchitis or congestion of the. lungs. I sincerely hope, and I am sure that it is the wish of the Senate, to see the honorable senator in his place within a short time, and able to perform his duties, which he took so much interest in. I am very pleased to notice that the <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr. Boydell,</inline> is again able to take his seat at the Clerk's table, seemingly in good health. I hope that he may continue to do so, and that his health may improve. I am not going to be ungrateful. I recognise that the Fisher Government have conferred an honour upon me, and upon the State I represent, by asking me to move the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> asked me to take the matter in hand, he said that I was from South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> from Western Australia, and that in the other House the honours were also being conferred on representatives of the different States. I am very pleased indeed to be the first  speaker  on this occasion, because I recognise that in our Government we have men of action, men who in any circumstances can hold their own. We have in. them men who, visiting England, mixed with royalty, sat at the same table with King and Queen, and mingled with lords and dukes, and whose heads were not affected in the least. I am pleased to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and his colleagues - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the Minister of External Affairs - acquitted themselves well. They gave a good account of themselves in England. In fact, I do not wonder that the people in the Old Country, especially the working classes, were astonished to find at the coronation of  His  Majesty the King a Prime Minister of Australia who was working in a coal mine a few years ago. As regards the. Minister of Defence, we never had a better one in the Commonwealth. </para>

I am glad to say that these Ministers acquitted themselves in such a way that even in the most complicated questions they were able to take a stand and maintain their ground. I am going to sympathize, if I can, with the Opposition. It must have been very trying indeed for the opportunity to slip from them. What a grand opportunity it would have been for distinctions, honours, titles, and all those things had they only been there. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mind that. I do not wonder at it, because it is human nature. For men of conservative ideals for one moment to contemplate the spectacle of a man who worked in a coal mine as I have related, -and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who is the son of a blacksmith, and who a few years ago was a carpenter working for his living, dining with the King and the Queen of England - oh, was it not too much? What a time they had, and what a time the other side lost! I do not at alt wonder that the Opposition are a bit annoyed. I am sorry to say that South' Australia was involved. The Mayor of Adelaide - I have nothing to say against him - wanted the title of Lord Mayor, and I am told that several members of this Parliament and others who went to England were also disappointed that they did not get titles. </para>

                        <para>- Let me go a little further. When a certain vessel arrived at Fremantle what happened? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> was on board, and amongst the statements he made were the statements that the Honorable Andrew Fisher was scarcely loyal, that he was selfish, that he obtained the highest honour he could get for himself and that " poor me " was right out of it. Then when he came to South Australia he went and told Old Granny - the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> - and it had an article on " Opportunities Lost." When we think of that the matter becomes serious. Of course I have no sympathy with that sort of conduct. I know that my remarks must hurt the feelings of those who have been disappointed. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may have been disappointed, too ! I do not know. I have brought with me a poem of Robert Burns, dealing with this very subject, " For a' that and a' that." I thought that it would apply remarkably well to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> It may give the honorable senator a little comfort, and bring a bit of consolation even to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lewis</inline> Cohen, a man who as Mayor is held in very high esteem. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator said that his speeches were "turned down" by the press; that they were ignored; and that the Prime Minister's two colleagues overshadowed him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> colleagues were good men, but they were nothing like so brilliant in comparison with the Prime Minister as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> said they were. That criticism was very ungenerous and, to some extent, perhaps, it caused a little friction amongst the members of the Ministry and of the party; or, rather, it might have done so, if Andrew Fisher were not fit to hold his own. </para>

The organizers and lecturers of the party - Miss Grace Watson included - will have taken <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon's</inline> speech as a text, as though it were something out of the sacred Bible; they will go up and down amongst the people telling them what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> said about the Leader of the Labour party, and what an awful party it must be to have such a weak leader as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> I do* not intend to pursue this matter any further, but wish to allude to other subjects. When we consider the fight that we had over the financial issue ; when we remember the struggle with the Opposition, who wished to retain the obnoxious Loan Act upon the statute-book for the purpose of enabling the Government to borrow ^3,500,000 for naval defence; when we remember how bitterly the Government were denounced when they introduced a Bill to repeal the Act, we must smile at the success' of the Labour party's policy. We were told that the Government would not be able to carry on without a loan. But what has the result been? Look at the overflowing Treasury at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- That brings me to the question of the effect of the land tax. The members of the party to which I belong stated that it would be the means of bringing into the Treasury money that the Commonwealth needed, and' would, at the same time, have the effect of breaking up large estates. The results have been exactly as we predicted. So- <inline font-style="italic">"fas</inline> as money is concerned, the revenue received has approximated to ,Â£1,400,000. Some said that the measure would not have the effect of bursting up large estates. In answer to that I am now in a position to quote from a petition presented to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in Adelaide &amp; month or two ago. I will read an extract from the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser -</inline></para>

                    <para>A deputation, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Miller, M.P., waited on the Commissioner of Crown Lands  (Hon. C. Vaughan)  on Wednesday morning with a view of inducing the Government to purchase the North Bundaleer Estate for closer settlement purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Boucaut presented a largely-signed petition from the residents of Jamestown requesting the Government to purchase the estate from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Edward Maslin with the object of settling the property more closely. It contained about 23,000 acres, situated between Jamestown and Spalding. If it -were acquired at least 100 families could make a living out of it. </para>
                    <para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boucaut</inline> said that as a result of the coming into operation of the Federal land tax <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin</inline> would have to part with about  Â£4,000  per annum, and he had practically made up his mind to sell the property. A petition had been got up in the district, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin</inline> had given him permission on the previous day to offer the land to the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin</inline> had stated that he could not keep the estate any longer, as owing to the Federal land tax about two-fifths of his income had to go to the Commonwealth. No price had been fixed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin,</inline> but if the Government were willing to come to terms a sum satisfactory to both parties would no doubt be decided upon. When the Canowie estate was placed in the market nearly  -the same quantity of land had been bought by private individuals, and although there had been but seventeen families resident thereon formerly, &gt;there were now only about seven new settlers. This was on account of the fact that it had been sold by auction, and because men with plenty of money in the neighbourhood bought the lane), end were at the present time keeping a few sheep on it. It seemed a pity that so many thousand acres should go out of culture. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin's</inline> property was sold in the same way perhaps a dozen instead of 100 additional people would gain the benefit. There was a large homestead on the estate, which had cost  ^4,000  -to erect, and this could also be utilized in some useful way. It had been suggested some time back that the homestead could be turned into a sanatorium, but a later and more practicable suggestion was that it could be made a branch of the Agricultural College. There was splendid land in the vicinity. It was in a good position, and the rainfall was about two inches. In conclusion, he thought the petitioners had very strong grounds for recommending the Government to seriously consider the matter. </para>

                    <para>The Commissioner in reply remarked that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boucaut</inline> appeared to have a strong case, lt was desired that the Government should purchase the estate on the same lines as they did the Yongala property, but it should be remembered that the price of land had gone up a great deal of late, and it had to be taken into consideration that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin's</inline> property covered a very, large area. At the same time, if the land could be obtained at a price which would justify the Government in purchasing it they would be prepared to do something in the matter. The Government were very careful as regarded the repurchasing of land owing to the big capital involved. However, the whole question would be taken into consideration, and they would see what could be done to meet the request of the petitioners. </para>

The Canowie estate, I admit, has not greatly benefited the people, because it has gone into the hands of some wealthy individuals, but the North  Boobarowrie  es'tate, which was repurchased by the Government for  Â£6  2s. 6d. per acre, was dealt with under the Closer Settlement Act. Every acre of it was applied for, and hundreds of disappointed applicants could not get any of it. </para>

These estates are adjoining, and comprise splendid land. If my memory serves me aright, the North  Boobarowrie  estate was purchased by* <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Melrose</inline> and his partner, some years ago, for about Â£4 an acre, and recently it was sold to the Government for <inline font-style="italic">Â£6</inline> 2.s. 6d. an acre. </para>

                        <para>- Should not the interests of the people be considered? Why should a hundred people be compelled to remain landless while one man is making thousands a year running sheep and growing wool on an estate, and excluding men, women, and children from the land? My reason for referring to the matter is to show how useful the Federal land tax has been. We required it also from a financial point of view. We need money for de fence, and the Government are going in for defence with a vengeance. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is at the helm I do not think the Conservatives will be able to complain of the expenditure on defence. </para>

                        <para>- We have money for defence. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that we now have money to buy bullets, and also to pay for old-age pensions. I have no intention to be personal, but it does not hurt men who have an income of many thousands a year if they have to pay ,Â£3,000 or Â£4,000 a year, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin</inline> said he would have to do. That statement may have been a little overdrawn ; but even if it were not, he would still have many thousands of pounds to fall back upon, and as he will probably receive Â£6  per acre for 23,000 acres, which he received as a present from his father, he will be able to retire and live long and happily on the money he will have acquired; whilst the authorities at Jamestown, as stated in the petition to which I have referred, may anticipate that a much, larger population will be settled in their district. What. I have said with reference to South Australia applies with equal force to other States. Some are in a worse position in this respect than South Australia. The Labour party had a policy, and they have put their shoulders to the wheel. They promised the electors that they would do a certain thing, and as soon as they had the numbers they did it. I am proud of it, and it has been, and will be, a cause of great prosperity to the Commonwealth. Let me for a moment deal with the impression and effect our delegation must have had upon the British people, and the working classes of Great Britain in particular. As a party we have been blamed, in some quarters, for being opposed to immigration, but what has happened in connexion with New South Wales ? According to press reports, arrangements have been made for three or four vessels to leave England for New South Wales with 2,400 immigrants. </para>

                        <para>- I know that as a farm labourer following the plough in the Old Country I desired to obtain information about Australia, and I think the Federal Government can take credit for the fact that so many now are prepared to leave the Old Country for New South Wales and South Australia. The fact that men holding the positions which the members of the present Government held a few years ago should, with the confidence and trust of the people, occupy their present high positions must make a big impression on the minds of people in the Old Country, and satisfy them as to the country to which they should emigrate. I intend to say a little about the bank note issue. I am proud of the present financial position. I am glad to find that the Government are going in for a Federal banking system. I think it is quite time that was done. If the Conservatives had remained in power they would never have proposed anything of the kind. I wish to read to the Senate the information which is contained in the following statement - </para>

But, seeing that it has been drawn from him, he is evidently in good health. Conservatism is to -the front, and I am upon right lines. Before concluding, I wish briefly to refer to the Bill which it is proposed to introduce to authorize the construction of a line of railway to Western Australia. I am strongly in favour of that undertaking. </para>

During the first session I had the honour of being a member of this Parliament I supported the Bill authorizing a survey of the line to Western Australia, and, on that occasion, I stated that if the surveyor's report were a favorable one I would be prepared to advocate the construction of that line. The report is a favorable one, and I say that in the absence of such a railway we cannot have a proper Federation. </para>

                        <para>- It will be by-and-by. At any rate, it is required for defence purposes alone. So far as South Australia is concerned, I have nothing of which to complain in regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a railway through the Northern Territory. That Territory has been taken over by the Commonwealth, and will be developed by it. </para>

                <para>I am not one of those who blame the Government for not developing it forthwith, and for not having a policy to which they are prepared to give effect immediately. I recognise that it is a big question. Of course. 1 have heard some persons say that they know all about the Northern Territory and could settle this vexed problem straight away. But my own opinion is that those who profess to know all about it really know least. I commend the cautious attitude which has been adopted by the Government, and I am confident .that the work of developing the Territory will be well done. I presume, too, that it is intended to push on with the erection of the Federal Capital. On this question I have always fought in the sauie ranks as the Leader of the Opposition. I have never vacillated. When the Labour party in the Senate with one exception voted against Yass-Canberra. I stood to my colours. </para>

                        <para>- Because it was such a remarkable exhibition. I have neither the time nor the inclination to deal with the Government policy, as a whole. We have before us the policy of the Labour party, as it was presented last session, with some steps in advance. I have every confidence in the Ministry. They have had a year's experience of office, and that year's work has been a credit to them. While the Prime Minister, and some of his colleagues, were in the Old Country, those who were left behind in the. Commonwealth - I refer to the Acting-Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer,</inline> and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> - acquitted themselves like men. They rose to the occasion, and manfully did their duty. I am, however, not quite satisfied with the treatment which the present Government, and past Governments, have meted out to the Post and Telegraph employes, particularly in South Australia. That treatment has been cruel. It has been tantamount to robbery. </para>

                        <para>- The framers of the Constitution specifically stated that the civil servants of South Australia who would be transferred to the Commonwealth were entitled to certain consideration. I can show the Leader of the Opposition that statement in print. Yet 1 may tell him that a few months ago the grievances of these men nearly resulted in a strike. The Postal Commission took evidence in regard to those grievances, and arrived at a certain decision which, however, the Government have chosen to ignore. I am sorry that Ministers have adopted that attitude. I hope that justice will be done to these civil servants. The Public Service Commissioner, who, I suppose, is a Scotchman, has acted harshly and despotically towards them. He has treated them in a manner worthy of the Czar of Russia by trampling their privileges underfoot. It was natural that, under such circumstances, the men should look to this Parliament, and to the present Government for redress of their grievances. </para>

                        <para>- Lately, when there was a great debate in South Australia over the referenda proposals, we heard of the evils in connexion with the Post Office and its bad management. I do not think that it would be of any use for me to occupy the floor any longer. I have expressed myself fairly and freely, and I shall be very sorry. indeed, as far as our people are concerned, if there is not a change made in reference to the Post and Telegraph administration. It has been pointed out from the Opposition side that the troubles in connexion with this Department are due to the present Administration, but we know that they date years back, simply because the Federal Parliament, instead of spending money and doing justice to the Civil Service, as it ought to have done, starved the Civil Service and handed the money back to the States. . </para>

                        <para>- I also regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is unable to be here to-day through illness, but" I hope that it will not be long before he will be with ' us, and share in our deliberations. I join with my honorable friend, too, in congratulating the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, and the Minister of External Affairs, on the able and excellent manner in which they acquitted themselves at the Coronation, and also at the Imperial Conference. I wish to recognise the excellent manner in which different Ministers have administered the affairs of the Departments during the recess. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who so firmly and ably administered the External Affairs Department while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> was absent in the Old Land ; to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who acted as Minister of Defence; and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer,</inline> who was the Acting Treasurer. This clearly shows that in our party we have any amount of administrative ability, and that we shall never be pushed far want of a Minister. I desire <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make a few remarks in connexion with the trip to Papua. I was very desirous of undertaking the trip, to see what use was being made of the money voted by this Parliament for that Territory, but, unfortunately, through illness and other private reasons, I was unable to go. I am very pleased, however, to know that a large number of the members of this Parliament availed themselves ot the opportunity to go. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the members of the Opposition, who withdrew in a body, will explain their reasons by-and-by. I, for one, shall be guided to a great extent by the opinions expressed by those who visited Papua, and who can tell us how the money is expended, what amount is required, and for what purposes it is required. I also regret the defeat of the referenda proposals. I am proud of the fact' that the State I represent gave a handsome majority in favour of them. For many years its people have suffered from rings, trusts, and combines, and when they had an opportunity to make known their opinion, they expressed themselves with no uncertain voice in favour of giving this Parliament full power to deal with trusts and monopolies. </para>

                        <para>- I really believe that the honorable senator does not know the meaning of the proposals which were submitted by referendum on the 26th April last, and that if he were to devote more time to considering these matters, and less time to addressing meetings of the Women's, so-called, National League, he would not interrupt me with such an asinine interjection as he has just made. What has resulted from the defeat of the proposals? We have had a disastrous sugar strike, which undoubtedly was precipitated by the Sugar Combine. Why did they desire trouble? They had on hand over 70,000 tons of sugar, and a strike meant money to them. . It did not trouble them how the men, women, and children might suffer, so long as they could make money. They refused to meet the men in conference; they refused to discuss the matters which were in dispute; and, naturally, the men, being human, went out on strike. That was the only remedy which they had to hand. Now we find that the people have to pay the piper. We hear of sugar going up day by day to an enormous price. </para>

                        <para>- That is, I think, a very pertinent interjection. I regret that the people of Western Australia, who voted so strongly in favour of the referenda proposals, have to suffer on account of the lack of interest taken in them by the people of Victoria and other States. I feel sure that, had the people given the proposals the careful and earnest consideration which they required, in every State there would have been a majority recorded in favour of them. How were they defeated? </para>

During the" last few weeks in Melbourne I have come across thousands of persons who have told me that they voted against the proposals, but that they did not understand them on account of the misrepresentations of the press. Not only had we misrepresentation by newspapers, but we also had misrepresentation by politicians - men who were receiving the pay of the nation, but who were serving the interests of monopolies, and monopolies alone. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable senator for the interjection. We have been afforded an example of the cowardice of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper. It is, not prepared to admit that it made a mistake in advising the people as it did during the recent campaign, but it is prepared to throw the blame on the present Government and Parliament. Let us consider for a moment the absurdity of establishing sugar mills and refineries at Yass-Canberra and dragging all the sugar cane there from North Queensland, or sending the cane across to Papua or to the Northern Territory for treatment there. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> considers that it is only right and proper for the Federal Government to have their own refineries at the Federal Capital, or in Papua, or in the Northern Territory. Its idea is so absurd as hardly to be worth referring to. It clearly proves, however, to the people of Victoria that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is not sincere in its attempt to educate them as to what is best in the interests of the nation. Why did we submit the referenda proposals to the people? It was to bring into operation Acts which had been passed at the instance of the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was a member. During the late campaign we found <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and other members of the Government which got Parliament to pass the Seamen's Compensation Act, the New Protection Act, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and the Australian Industries Preservation Act, telling the people not to give Parliament the power to bring those measures into operation. </para>

                        <para>- The additional powers sought for were required to enable effect to be given to those measures. I pass on to some of the important proposals contained in the Governor- General's Speech. I find nothing there that is revolutionary. I find nothing there to frighten any of the people of this country. The proposals foreshadowed in the Governor-General's Speech simply &lt;&gt; carry into effect the programme which the majority of us submitted to the people when we asked for their votes and their support. Each and every one of those proposals will, I trust, be passed into law before the present session closes. Reference has been made to the Commonwealth note issue. The policy of the Government in reference to that subject met with strenuous opposition during the last session of Parliament. Indeed, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell was speaking to-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> interjected that the Government had "commandeered the profits " made out of the note issue. I should like to ask from whom the Government commandeered those profits? Before the passing of the Australian Notes Act the profits from the issue of bank notes did not go into the pockets of the people of this country. But by the passage of that Act, even in the first year of its operation, we have derived a profit of Â£334,690. This revenue has been derived without placing any burden on any section of the people of Australia. Much of it is money which otherwise would have gone out of this country altogether. Again, before their issue by the Commonwealth, bank notes were not used to a very great extent. But we find that the issue is greater now than it ever was. </para>

I am very pleased indeed to see that the Australian note issue has turned out so successfully.

Since the year 1893 the people of this country have not  had  much confidence in the banking institutions. </para>

                        <para>- They are very large, but still the people have not had the same confidence in the banks as they  had  previously, on account of the way they had to suffer during that disastrous time occasioned by the closing of the banks. I for one had to suffer severely. We must all admit, however, that the foundation of banking is confidence. In a Commonwealth bank the people will have unbounded confidence, because behind that bank will be the Federal Treasury, whilst behind the Federal Treasury will be the whole of the resources of this Commonwealth. There is no doubt about the future of a Commonwealth bank ; none whatever. Then we come to the question of pensions. The bringing into operation by proclamation of the invalid sections of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has, I am pleased to know, brought happiness and brightness into many homes throughout this country, but I am strongly in favour of the Government taking into consideration the absolute necessity of making some extra payments to those persons who are living in the remote parts of the different States. An honorable member near me interjects that we cannot constitutionally do so, but I fail to find any section in the Constitution which prevents us. For instance, in Western Australia we have many old-age pensioners who are doing a little bit of prospecting on the gold-fields. It is better, having regard to the interests of this country, that those old men should be encouraged to remain on the gold-fields doing  a  little prospecting, whilst at the same time receiving their pensions. The majority of them are earning nothing like sufficient to keep them, and the 10s. per week which they receive from the Government is certainly not enough to maintain them on the gold-fields. I consider that a little extra money ought to be allowed to those old men who are living in the far interior of the different States, and who are endeavouring, in their way, as they have been endeavouring all their lives, to develop the mineral resources of this country. I hope the Government will give this subject their earliest and their serious consideration. I do not think that the Constitution forbids us from moving in the direction I have suggested. Now I come to the most important part of the speech delivered by  His Excellency  the Governor-General. I refer to the passages referring to that great national work, the building of the trans- Australian railway. The matter has been referred to bv various Governments for many years. In fact, the people of Western Australia were promised, when they entered Federation, that they would get the railway which they desired. But that promise, so far, has not been carried out. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to know that we have at last in office a Government which has the courage of its convictions, and which is prepared to carry out, not only its own promises, but the promises made by persons in authority to the people of Western Australia ten years ago, and upon which they relied when they joined the Federal Union. This work, I admit, is going to be an expensive one, and I wish to let the Senate understand clearly what my position is in connexion with it, and also in connexion with the development of the Northern Territory. I do not for a moment believe that it will be possible to build the transcontinental railway and to open up and develop the Northern Territory out of revenue ; and I for one am in favour of the Government using loan money for these purposes. We cannot fail to recognise that in all the large centres in Australia at the present time there is a demand for extended postal facilities and for increased, telephonic communication. These are services that must be rendered, because, after all, the man who is prepared to go out back and to open up and develop either the mineral or the agricultural, resources of this country is doing more, and conferring a greater benefit on Australia,  than are those who are working and dwelling in the cities, and deriving all the advantages of civilization. We must give these people postal facilities, and we must improve their telephonic communication. We must perform these works out of revenue. We must also pay for the defence of Australia out of revenue. But I claim that it would be a matter of impossibility for the Government to finance such large works as building railways, developing the Northern Territory, and constructing the Federal Capital, out of revenue. Of course, I am now expressing my personal opinion. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but you  can easily exhaust the possibilities in that direction. Indeed, I will go so far as to say that if we were to exhaust the possibilities of taxation we should even then be unable to finance all the contemplated Commonwealth works out of revenue if, during the next twenty years, we are to accomplish all that we have set our hands to. If we are going in for the progressive policy that this Government should undertake, it is, in my opinion, a matter of impossibility to finance the undertakings without raising some loans for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- Coming to the question of Tariff anomalies, I wish to state that I was returned to this Parliament as a New Protectionist. I believe in building up the industries of this country. But, seeing that the people have declined to indorse the policy which was submitted to them last year, and that we have not power to impose our New Protective policy, I am not for one moment in favour of increasing protective duties on those articles that are produced by monopolies at the present time. For instance, take agricultural machinery. The consumers are deriving no benefit from the protective duties imposed upon those goods. Neither are the wage-earners deriving any benefit. Therefore, I consider that it is our duty, if we are to retain the protective Tariff, not to increase the burdens on the people, and not to increase the cost of living; but rather to take off all those duties which are purely revenue producing. Where there are protective duties from which people derive any benefit, I will support them, but I will not be one to help to build up in this country such big trusts, rings, and monopolies as exist in the United States. </para>

                        <para>- They have received more from them than from any  previous Government. The public servants in my own State have every confidence in the present Ministry, and are well satisfied with what has been done for them. I have before me a return showing the amount of the increases of salaries paid to the public servants during last year. I find that the increases to clerical assistants amounted to  Â£10,000;  to postmasters,  Â£2^00;  to telegraphists,  Â£13,000;  total to the clerical division,  Â£25,500. . </para>

                        <para>---They were all underpaid until these increases were given. The cost of living has increased, and it was only just that increases of salary should be made to men in the service to enable them to be in receipt of a living wage. Some are not at present receiving a living wage, if we take into consideration the increased cost of living in different parts of the States. We have undoubtedly the best paid Civil Service in the world, and while I hope it will continue to remain so, I trust also that we shall get from the civil servants of Australia better service than is being rendered to other peoples. I am prepared to admit that at present in different places we are not getting as good a post and telegraph service as we should get. We hear a great many complaints of letters and telegrams being undelivered. I am satisfied that there !s ground for the complaints. Letters do go astray, and telegrams remain undelivered. </para>

                        <para>- I do not dispute that for a moment, but I say that we must, as far as possible, have a perfect service. It may mean a very great deal to a person to have a letter addressed to him go astray, and even more that a telegram should be undelivered. Three weeks ago I had occasion to go to Adelaide on private business. At mid-day on Saturday I sent a telegram to say that I intended to leave the same night by the express, and I was greatly surprised on arriving at Adelaide to find that my telegram had not been delivered. I left Adelaide again on Monday afternoon at  4  o'clock, but the telegram had not been delivered up to that time. Yesterday I received a letter to say that my wire had not yet been received. How this has happened I do not know, but such things should not occur. If our civil servants are well paid we have the right to demand the best service from them, and those from whom we do not get it should be removed and others put in their places. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but we might have fewer mistakes in our service than we have at the present time. I do not complain of the administration, but there is often in connexion with different post-offices evidence of undue carelessness in the non-delivery of letters and telegrams. I have received a great many complaints on the subject, and I feel that it is due to those who have lodged them with me that I should bring the matter under the notice of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and it is rather a peculiar case. I am very pleased to know that the Government intend to amend the Electoral Act this session. I hope they will entirely dispense with postal voting. I hope that they will at the same time see that absentee voters are provided with better facilities for recording their votes. I think that, no matter for what district a man or woman is enrolled, he or she should be at liberty to record a vote at any polling booth throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Not more so than the system of postal voting in existence at the present time. We should have more polling booths established. I claim that wherever there are twelve or fifteen electors there should be a polling booth established in order that they may have an opportunity to record their votes, whether for a member of this Parliament or upon proposals submitted at referenda. I admit that increased expenditure would be involved, but we claim to believe in government of the people by the people, and we must give the people an opportunity to express their opinions through the ballot-box, no matter what the cost may be. I do not propose to discuss any further the matters mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech. There is important business to be transacted this afternoon, and personally I do not consider that very much is gained by the discussion of the Address-in-Reply. It very often gives rise to ill-feeling, and instead of doing good in furthering the legislation of the country it may do harm. I hope that the session- entered upon now will be a successful one, and that no matter from what part of the Chamber a useful suggestion is made it will receive exactly the same consideration. If we approach the work of the session in this spirit I am satisfied that at its close the people will be prepared to admit that their representatives in this Parliament are doing their best to further the interests of the majority, and will be satisfied that they have men here anxious to make Australia the great nation we all desire it to become. </para>

If the Senate is to take its proper part in the legislation of the country, we should keep a close watch over these money Bills. I ask for an assurance from the Minister in charge of the Bill, which I believe he is in a position to give, that the money asked for in the Bill is merely to meet the ordinary services of the country. If the honorable senator tells me, as I understand he has done by interjection, that that is all that is contained in the Bill, I have no further objection to offer to the motion. </para>

                <para class="block">It is generally known that on the first reading of a Bill of this description honorable senators have an opportunity to make any remarks or criticisms they please, but I should like to point out that, whilst the Address-in-Reply is still before the Senate, it would be much more convenient for honorable senators, as well as more acceptable to the Government, if they reserved such criticisms for that debate, rather than indulge in them in dealing with the Supply Bill. As I have already intimated to the Leader of the Opposition, the only extraordinary item contained in this Bill is the vote of ,Â£200,000 for the Treasurer's Advance. In view of the experience of the last two months, I am sure we are not asking for an advance in excess of what we really require. A great many contracts have been let in connexion with our new military services. They are nearing completion, and every day brings in fresh accounts. From the first of the month to the thirtieth contractors will be asking for payment for completed services. There are other works approved by Parliament which must be paid for out of the Treasurer's Advance until complete estimates for them are passed. The amount that is being asked for on this occasion is Â£1,038,016. That may seem large for one month's supply. The amount voted bv Parliament for the services of the past two months was very considerable, and yet it! did not contain some of the items which are really part of the new services of this year. I would like to give honorable senators a few illustrations. Everybody must recognise that, as time goes on, the Commonwealth services must increase as a result of the legislation which we enact. I want to point out some of the items which have necessarily swelled the amount of Supply for the current month. We all know that last year the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth, and in that connexion we require Â£58,000. Similarly the Commonwealth has assumed control of the Port Augusta railway, and for that service we need Â£46,000. For ammunition we require Â£23,000 above the proportion in the previous Supply Bill, whilst, in connexion with our compulsory military training, which has just become operative, we need Â£81,900. A sum of Â£22,000 has had to be cabled Home to meet the deficiency upon the Pacific Cable. These and other sums aggregate ,Â£241,000, and, with the Treasurer's Advance and Â£20,000 from refunds, which is the usual thing, would reduce the Supply for which we are now asking to between Â£500,000 and Â£600,000, wh'ich would be about half the amount of the Supply granted for two months during a previous session. All these items have been approved. The Supply for which we now ask is necessary to place the Government in a position to meet its liabilities until the Budget has been submitted to Parliament and the Estimates have been approved. To enable us to tide over the current month we are asking for the sum which is set down in this Bill, and I am sure that when honorable senators understand the position they will be only too willing to grant our request. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to adopt the very excellent suggestion thrown out by the Vice-President of the Executive Council by refusing on this occasion to avail myself of the opportunity which is provided by the Bill of indulging in any general remarks. But I wish to direct attention to one or two points connected with this and similar measures. I do so at the early part of the session for this reason : that at this stage honorable senators will at least credit me with having no desire to harass the Government. I know that when suggestions are made by members of the Opposition there is always a suspicion that they may be like gifts coming from the Greeks. But at this stage no such suspicion can be entertained by my honorable friends. I trust, therefore, that they will listen to the suggestion which I am about to make, not for the first time. In dealing with the financial proposals of the Government, it has hitherto been the fate of the Senate to be told, in effect, "There they are; the money has been spent, and you must accept the Bill." In such circumstances, there is no other course open to us. But that is not the position which was contemplated by the Constitution. I am aware that the remedy for this state of things lies in the hands of honorable senators themselves. But the necessities of party are upon us all, with the result that, whenever a Government is remiss in bringing forward its proposals at a sufficiently early date to enable us to discuss them, its supporters, while willing to admit the offence privately, are prepared to condone it publicly. I wish the Senate to express its opinion on this question in such a way as will insure that the Government will bring forward its financial statement at a sufficiently early period in the session to give the Senate a fair opportunity of discussing it. </para>

                        <para>- We did not get an opportunity of discussing it in the way that we desired. Turning to the Bill, the Vice-President of the Executive Council has drawn attention to the fact that the Treasurer's Advance Vote is an abnormally large one. It is not only large on this occasion, but it is steadily growing. I do not know whether honorable senators pause to consider what this Advance Vote really means. It means the signing of a blank cheque - it means that the Government are able to spend that cheque just as they think fit, &gt; provided that they afterwards tell us how they spent it. Such a system does not give Parliament full control of the public purse. I admit that a necessity exists for providing some till-money - that there should be some advance to the Treasurer - but I do not think that the necessities of the case are such as to render necessary a vote of Â£200,000. The necessity for such a vote arises largely from the system "Which we have adopted, known as the cash system, under which all moneys not expended during the financial year lapse at the end of June. As the result, claims are doubtless pouring in on the Government in connexion with works which were authorized during the past year. Ought that cash system to be maintained in regard to specific appropriations such as works or the purchase of materials? It is one thing to apply it to the ordinary services of the year, but surely there is a great distinction between those services and the construction, say, of a railway? Parliament may approve, for example, of the expenditure of Â£100,000 in connexion with the Federal Capital, or the construction of a railway to Western Australia. The mere fact that that amount has not been entirely spent by the 30th June ought not, in my opinion, to disturb the destiny of that money. If we were to alter our Audit Act and to limit the operation of the cash system to the ordinary services of the year, and if we were to determine that when once a sum of money has been specifically ap:propriated, it shall be devoted to that specific purpose only, it would not be necessary to bring forward these inflated Treasurer's Advance Votes. Judging from the private conversation which I have had with honorable senators, I believe that they are largely in agreement with me as to the desirableness of modifying this cash system.. Consequently, the reform ought not to be difficult to bring about. Turning to the Bill itself, I have no wish to be captious; in regard to the assurance given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council.. But there are a few items which can scarcely be called the ordinary services of the year. For instance, there is one which reads, " The storage and seasoning of timber." So far as I know that is; an entirely new item. The honorable senator may say it is only a little one, but it is there, nevertheless. With regard to the much larger item of the Northern Territory, it is impossible for the Government to give us all the information that we would like. But I desire to know if the item Â£46,000, which appears on page 6 of the Bill, under the heading of the Port Augusta Railway, represents only a deficiency? </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to draw the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to the item ofÂ£4,963for the mail service to the Pacific Islands, which appears under the head of the Department of External Affairs. I received, some time ago, and I dare say that my co-representatives from Queensland also received, a suggestion from the Cooktown Chamber of Commerce, which seemed to me a remarkably reasonable one. The Minister knows that Cooktown is almost an isolated community, even with regard to Queensland. It has to depend very largely for some of its mail communication upon the facilities which are extended by reason of the postal service between Papua and Sydney and Melbourne. There is a good deal of communication with Papua. Cooktown is one of the nearest ports, and I believe does a fairly extensive trade with Papua. At present, the mails from Papua pass by Cooktown, and are opened at Cairns, and then despatched to Cooktown. It has been suggested by the Chamber of Commerce at Cooktown that the delay of an hour or so outside the Endeavour River would enable them to get their mails quickly and to answer their correspondence. It is about two months since I drew the attention of the Department to this matter, and I dare say that my fellow representatives of Queensland have done something in that direction, but I have not yet received a reply. It may be that the Chamber of Commerce has received a communication ; it may be that the representative of some electorate in Queensland, or some other senator for that State has received word about the matter, but, although a very reasonable suggestion was brought under the notice of the Department over two months ago, I have not yet received any official intimation of what has been done. It seems a simple matter which was submitted. All that had to be done by the Department was to inquire whether a stoppage of an hour or so outside the entrance to Cooktown would seriously interfere with the transmission of mail matter to Cairns, the southern ports of Queensland, and the rest of Australia. Yet it has not been attended to, or, if it has been attended to, I have not received the courtesy of an answer telling me what has been done. But I received, and received pretty promptly, word that the matter was under consideration. How extraordinary is this conflict of departmental administration. One naturally takes a matter of this kind to the Department of the Postmaster-General, because it concerns the delivery of mails, but one finds out afterwards that it is connected with the External Affairs Department, and it is handed from one Department to the other. It takes some time for one to understand the processes of circumlocution which are observed by the two Eepartments. The Government may have a sufficient explanation to offer, but I ask, in the name of the isolated community of Cooktown, that, at any rate, its request should be attended to a little more promptly. </para>

                        <para>- That is the very reason why the promptest attention should be given to any representations made to the Department. Can the Minister give us any promise that the request respectfully submitted and reasonably urged by the Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the people of Cooktown can be attended to? As he must know well, if it could be attended to, it would be a great boon to them. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no recollection of having received, or seen at the External Affairs Department, any communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger in respect to this matter, but it was brought under my notice by more than one member of the Senate, and the requests which they made were similar to those which he has made to-day, and which he said he made in an official manner some months ago. When a contract was let a considerable time ago Cooktown was not included. It was included in the previous contract. The Department has no power to make any alterations in regard to the existing contract. Therefore, Cooktown cannot be included, unless Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. are prepared to make it a port of call. When the Chamber of Commerce felt that, perhaps, it would be next to impossible to have Cooktown included, they were extremely desirous of . having their mails forwarded as speedily as possible. They stated, probably correctly, that if, on its return from Papua, the mail boat would drop anchor off Cooktown their mails would ' be delivered many hours earlier than is the case to-day, when they have to be landed at Cairns. I feel sure that both the External Affairs Department and the Postal Department are extremely anxious to facilitate, as much as possible, the convenience of the residents of Cooktown and the Chamber of Commerce. </para>

To my knowledge, the External Affairs Department got into touch with Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. in regard to the desire of the Chamber of Commerce to have the boats stopped for an hour or so, and anything which it can do - and I feel sure that anything which the Postal Department can do - to get them to acquiesce in that request will be only too gladly done. </para>

                        <para>- Then I trust that a larger sum will be placed on the Estimates, in order to provide a very much better service, not only to Cooktown, but also to ports in northern Queensland. I am quite in sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's request. I can recollect receiving a copy of the resolution which was passed by the Chamber of Commerce. We should do what we can to help the little places, because the big ones can always look after themselves. Having lived in the backblocks, I know that Cooktown is the kind of place which attaches special significance to the mail arrangements. I have recently been at Cooktown, and it appears to me that we are deliberately leaving it out in the cold. It is not quite so small as an interjection would make out. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly; and in the surrounding country there are possibilities which may make Cooktown a place of some importance again; but even if that were not the case, I shall always speak up .for the little back places, so that their people may live on equal terms with those in other civilized communities. I trust that there will be a larger sum voted to provide speedier mail communication with Papua.: It appears to me that that Possession, which has great possibilities ahead of it, can never be properly treated or developed until its people are brought into touch with those on the mainland. It is a matter of extreme regret to me that nothing has yet been done in the way of wireless telegraphy to link Papua up with the mainland, and give its people - nearly all of whom have relatives living at Cooktown or other parts of north Queensland - an opportunity to communicate with them, especially in cases of sickness. I trust that the matter will not be overlooked. </para>

                    <para>. - What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said makes me believe that I received from the Department a letter in reply to one I sent, which practically conveyed the information which he has conveyed to us to-day - that is, that there is a contract let, and that it cannot very well be varied. That, of course, is a departmental matter. But I take this objection - that if the Department wanted to vary the contract, and recognised the injustice done to Cooktown by the mail to that port being carried to a southern port, and then sent back again, I feel sure that the contractor could be approached, and that some variation could be made in the contract which would meet the wishes of the Cooktown people. I am prepared to say at once that the explanation offered by the Minister tallies with that which was made to me when I wrote to the Department on the subject. But I reply that if the Department would look into the matter it would probably be possible to make an arrangement with the contractors so as to alter the present method of running the steamer. I also wish to refer to item 14, under the heading " Miscellaneous " - Press Cable Service Subsidy Â£730. That subsidy, if I remember rightly, was granted on the condition that the persons receiving cable messages from abroad should receive a certain number of words per week. I should like to know whether a check is being kept on the number of words that come over the cable, or whether the subsidy is being paid without any such check? When information is furnished to me on that point I may give notice of a question to ascertain what number of words come through and a few other details. </para>

                    have to thank the Minister for his prompt and clear explanation regarding the question that I raised. But I wish to ask why the reply so made was not sent to me in the form of a letter ? Without undue egotism, I may claim that if there is one thing more than another, in connexion with my parliamentary duties, about which I am careful, it is not to go unnecessarily to the Commonwealth Departments, either to see Ministers or their responsible officers. Whenever I have to go on public business I do so with a certain amount of reluctance. But I think that honorable senators will agree with me that when I do have a communication to make to a Commonwealth Department a reply ought to be sent to me.

                        <para>- I hope that there has been no intentional discourtesy, but the Minister representing the Post? master-General stated that a communication containing the explanation of the Government had been sent to other honorable senators. If that be so, apparently an invidious distinction has been made. Why should that be so? In fairness to the Minister and his officers, however, I should say that it is just possible that a letter may have gone astray, because I have been recently away from Melbourne. If that be the explanation, of course neither the Minister nor his officials are to blame. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> have indicated the weak spot in the matter of the contract with Burns, Philp and Company. I dare say the company is conducting its business under the contract with the object of making as much money as possible. We are all, in reference to business matters, anxious to make what we can. The question is whether the contract price has not been cut down so much that Burns, Philp and Company cannot afford to concede even the few hours' delay that the call at Cooktown would involve. Still, in view of the flourishing state of the finances of the Commonwealth, I consider that some concession might be made in the interests of the little port of Cooktown. The payment of an extra Â£20 or so ought not to prevent the wishes of the Chamber of Commerce being attended to. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has repeated that he forwarded a communication to the Department of External Affairs affecting Cooktown, two months ago, and has not received a reply. But before he sat down the honorable senator admitted that he had been absent from Melbourne for a considerable time, and that there was a possibility that a letter had gone astray. I have already assured him that the fullest inquiry will be made. Personally, I have no knowledge of having seen or received a communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, but, of course, every honorable senator is treated on the same basis in regard to departmental matters. It would indeed be a curious state of affairs if invidious distinctions were made in regard to departmental communications, and this Government would certainly be the last to do such a thing. As to the subject mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> I have to say that the press cable service subsidy was granted on certain conditions, which, I believe, provide that at least 6,000 words per week shall be transmitted. I have every reason to believe that the conditions governing the subsidy are being complied with, and that the Department does keep a check upon the number of words received. All the information available can be perused by any honorable senator who is interested. </para>

If they are, I desire to inquire whether the Department has power to suspend the payment of the bounty for the production of iron and steel until the Lithgow labour trouble is settled ? This is a form of pressure which I think a Labour Government should bring to bear if it can, having in view the iniquitous way in which the men who are receiving this huge subsidy from the Commonwealth are treating their employe's. I should like to know what the position is, because it seems to me that the way in which iron and steel production is being fostered is not likely to be of any permanent advantage to the Commonwealth, considering the manner in which the manufacturers, who are supposed to be pushing the industry, are conducting it, and the iniquitous manner in which they are treating their workmen. If we continue to pay these bounties to men who treat their employe's in such a way any longer than we can possibly avoid doing so it will be a disgrace to a Labour Government. </para>
