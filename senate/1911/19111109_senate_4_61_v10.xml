                        <para>On the 16th September, the Area Officer, Albury, Lieut. Fitz-Gerald applied for permission to prosecute Cadet Clark. No approval was given, and it was pointed out to the area officer that the offence appeared to be a breach of the Police Offences Act, as the offence alleged was not committed on parade. The area officer apparently took this as an authority to take action under the Police Offences Act, and prosecuted accordingly. </para>
                        <para>Instructions were issued on the 17th August that no action was to be taken against Cadets in Civil Courts by their commanding officers or adjutants as provided by the Defence Act no without the authority of the District Commandant, which in this case was not given. </para>

But, supplementing that, I propose at a later stage to give the amount of the re-votes and the total. If honorable senators want the particulars, they will find the re-votes stated in connexion with each' particular item. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the contingent notice of motion to suspend the Standing Orders does not cover this measure. I ask the Senate to suspend them in order to enable it to be dealt with. I do not wish to curtail discussion in any way. No action in that direction will be taken if the debate is confined within reasonable limits; but honorable senators will, I am sure, recognise that the year is slipping by, that a large amount of public money is held up, and that the carrying out of public works is delayed pending the authority of Parliament to proceed. As all the items which are covered by the measure have been, under the notice of honorable senators for a considerable time in connexion with the Estimates, I suggest that they will only be doing their duty to the country in proceeding at once with its consideration. That will not deprive any honorable senator of his right to freely criticise various items. I appeal to the Senate to accede to my request.. I move - </para>

                    <para>. -  I would remind the Minister that it is not the fault of the Senate that the measure is brought forward at this late period of the year. Parliament was in recess for ten months, and should have been called together months ago, so that the Estimates could have been brought forward. It is straining our patience a little too much to bring in this 'Bill without previous notice, and ask us to appropriate nearly  £3,000,000  without having a moment to examine the various items. At the same time, I think it would be ungracious to refuse our assent to the motion, and so I do not propose to object. </para>

                <para class="block">In reply to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition, I promised to supply the Senate with the total amount of the re- votes proposed in this Bill. I find that I am unable to do So at present. I have asked the Treasury officials to let me have the figures the moment they arrive, and if 1 cannot give the desired information before I conclude my remarks, I shall do so at a later stage of the discussion. The total vote represented by this Bill is  ,£2,791,365.  Under the authority of the Act which was passed last year an amount of  ,£1,318,099  was expended, so that the expenditure contemplated under this measure represents an increase of  ,£1,473,266.  Taking the Departments in their order, the expenditure which we are asking Parliament to authorize is . as follows : - Department of Home Affairs,  .£824,915;  Postmaster-General,  £1,300,000;  Treasury,  .£5,150;  Defence.  ^£63 1,900;  and Department of External Affairs,  .£29,400.  I am now informed that the total amount represented by re-votes in the sums which I have mentioned is  ,£281,160.  There is one item in this Bill to which I desire to direct special attention. It reads, " Division No.  6a,  Special Works; No.  1.  To pay into Trust Fund, Telegraphs and Telephones Special Works Account,  £600,000."  That amount is in addition to a vote on account of works for the Post and Telegraph Department of  £700,000.  Honorable senators are well aware that during the early years of Federation, the Postal Department was undoubtedly starved in its works vote. While the Commonwealth was returning to the States large sums of money in the form of the Federal surpluses, the Post Office, during those years, was not receiving the amount of money which it needed to enable it to keep its works up to date, and to meet public requirements. This vote of  £600,000  represents an endeavour on the part of the Government to meet the difficulty that has been created by the failure of this Parliament in past years to provide money for necessary works.. Honorable senators know perfectly Well that in ordinary circumstances, at the end of June, which marks the close of the financial year; all votes lapse except those which are paid, into Trust accounts. The awkwardness of that procedure comes home to those who are in charge of Departments, because after the  30th  June of each year, the only works which can be proceeded with are those which can be carried on out of the. Treasurer's Advance, and for that expenditure parliamentary sanction has subse-0 quently to be obtained. Naturally, no Government cares to incur extraordinary expenditure out of that fund. As a rule, it is used only to carry out such works as are of an urgent character. Then when the Estimates are passed late in the financial year, an attempt has to be made to rush other works through. The Government propose that this £600.000 shall be paid into a Trust  Fund,  and that, subsequent to the passing of this measure, a Bill shall be introduced to authorize the establishment of such a fund. The Treasurer has informed the members of another place that when that Bill is submitted it will contain a schedule setting forth the items upon which this money is to be expended. la other words, the measure will resemble an ordinary Works Bill, inasmuch as it will contain" a schedule of works, but with this difference, that any money which may be unexpended at the end of the financial year will then be utilized by the Department to continue such works. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that that is the proper way to put the position, because the requirements of the Audit Act can be met in another way, as the Leader of the Opposition knows. I ara sure that those honorable senators who have had much departmental business to transact must have long ago concluded that the time is rotten-ripe when we should attempt to put the Post Office in an efficient condition, and that can be accomplished only by a large expenditure upon works. The ,£700,000 represented in the ordinary Estimates of the Postal Department is supplemental to that, and it is proposed to follow that expenditure by another vote of £700,000 next year, as the officials estimate that, to put the Department upon <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> proper footing, an expenditure of £2,000,000 is necessary. It may be asked, " Why not embody the whole expenditure of £2,000,000 in these Estimates ? ' ' The answer is that it would not be possible during the current year to carry out the whole of the works which are necessary. Consequently, I ask honorable senators, in their criticism, to remember that, under the proposal of the Treasurer, the control of Parliament will be amply safeguarded. They will have an opportunity of discussing the items, which will be set out in the schedule of the Trust Bill. If any of those items are eliminated, this money will remain in the Trust Fund ; and if, when the works authorized are completed, a balance is available, that balance will be paid into the Consolidated Revenue in the ordinary way. Amongst the main items in this Bill are the following : - - Store at Darling Island, Sydney, £35,053 ; towards ,the completion of the Military College, £40,000; cost of the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra, £100,000 j Transcontinental Railway, Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, ,£22,500 ; Naval Barracks, Submarine Depot, £53,000 ; New Quarantine Buildings, £32,800 ; Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, £19,000; Cordite Factory, Maribyrnong, site and works, £16,615; Beerburrum manoeuvre area, £13,608; Sydney Parcels Post Office. ,£25,000 ; Wireless Telegraph Station, Fremantle, £11,000; Purchase of sites - Post and Telegraph Offices, £50,000 ; Telegraph and Telephones - ordinary vote for construction, £700,000; Telegraphs and Telephones - special vote for construction, £600,000; Defence - warlike stores, £300,000 ; cost of providing four batteries Field Artillery, £45,000 ; rifles for Senior Cadets, £65,000 ; reserve of gun ammunition, £31,700; armament and stores for fixed defences, <inline font-style="italic">£55,650 &gt;</inline> to replace condemned ammunition, ,£12,000 ; raw material for Cordite Factory, £10,000; naval works, dockyards, &amp;c, £20,000; re-armament of the vessels <inline font-style="italic">Protector, Gayundah,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Paluma,</inline> £20,000; buildings for the Northern Territory, £26,900. The votes for the Home Affairs Department, of course, contain expenditure, not for that Department purely, but for all other Departments. I do not propose in my remarks at the present stage to enter into details concerning those votes, because a more convenient opportunity will arise for making explanation* concerning them in Committee. But I think it advisable, as some of these departmental votes are in the nature of policy, that  1  should make a few remarks now. It will be noticed that there is a vote for new quarantine buildings of £33,280. That has been rendered necessary by the fact that, when the Commonwealth Government took over quarantine from the States, in many cases the buildings that had been used for quarantine purposes were not transferred. This was not a transferred Department in the ordinary sense. Some of the buildings were retained by the States. It has been found necessary, therefore, to provide buildings in a number of the States for quarantine as conducted under the Commonwealth; whilst in other States in which  buildings were taken over it has been found necessary to renovate and extend. Consequently, we have on these Estimates a pretty substantial vote for that purpose. I think that practically all the items for works under the control of the Postmaster-General's Department are of a detailed character, which can be best dealt with in Committee. The only items which, perhaps, call for comment are those relating to wireless telegraphy stations. Of two wireless stations at present in course of completion, the one at Pennant Hills, Sydney, is in the more forward condition, and only  ,£5,000  is asked for the purpose. But for the purpose of the Fremantle station  ,£"11,000  is required. </para>

                        <para>- Not under this Bill. There is, of course, provision for wireless telegraphy generally, but not for any specific establishments. That <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> to say, the Post and Telegraph Department has obtained the services of an expert in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie,</inline> who will recommend where wireless telegraphy should be established. If in Committee honorable senators choose to ask for information on that point, I shall endeavour to find out what stage the expert's reports have reached, and what particular points in the various States have been selected for the establishment of stations. I may mention generally, however, that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the establishment of wireless telegraphy stations around Australia, apart from the two which I have mentioned, though it is not proposed that they shall be of the same expensive character as the stations at Pennant Hills and Fremantle. In connexion with the Department of External Affairs, a commencement has been made - perhaps on a small scale, but still a commencement - with the problem of the development of the Northern Territory. These Estimates contain votes for various works that will be necessary to commence that development. Obviously, there cannot be a large amount for the purpose at present, because the work that is being done is largely of the nature of inquiry. Scientific and survey expeditions are being sent out to various parts of the Territory, in order that the Government may be able to formulate a developmental policy. Most of the expenditure represented in this Bill is caused by the necessity for inquiry, analyses of soils, establishment of experimental stations, and so forth, in order that the Government may be able to decide on scientific lines what the nature of the development shall be, and how it shall be carried out. Coming to the Department over which I have the honour to preside, honorable senators will recognise that a very substantial vote is included in this Works and Buildings Bill. A considerable portion of the money asked for, however, is for the purpose of works that have already been authorized by Parliament. In that connexion I may mention the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, the Cordite Factory, the Military College, construction of rifle ranges, and the armament of our forts with modern guns, together with the extension of fortified places in the Commonwealth. A new policy in connexion with defence is the commencement, for the first time, of a Works Department under the control of the Naval Branch. The Government have determined to make a new departure in this respect : - That naval works, so far as they partake of a marine character - that is to say, such works as constructing dock-yards, shipbuilding, and depots  - will be carried out by the Naval Branch of the Defence Department directly, and not through the Home Affairs Department. The construction of buildings ashore, however, and the acquisition of land, will still pertain to the Home Affairs Department, even when the work is done for the Defence Department. The Naval Branch has had placed upon its shoulders also the responsibility for the construction of vessels for the Commonwealth. I do not refer simply to vessels built for the Defence Department, but also for the Department of Trade and Customs. There are votes in the present Estimates for the construction of certain Customs vessels by the Naval Branch of the Defence Department. Although it must be admitted that the Defence votes are large, and in some senses new, the policy which they are intended to promote is not new. That is to say, these votes are for the purposes of the policy which Parliament has decided upon. Honorable senators will observe, in looking through the Works Estimates, and general Estimates, that the vote for rifle ranges has mounted up from  ^17,000,  the actual expenditure last year, to-  £"70.000  in the present year. The Defence Department has been subjected to criticism from time to time with regard to the provision of facilities for rifle clubs and rifle shooting. But I venture to say  that when honorable senators consider that the expenditure has risen to .£70,000 they will admit that the Government are making an honest effort to meet the requirements of the riflemen and of rifle shooting throughout the Commonwealth. In regard to special defence material, honorable senators will know that some four years ago it was decided, on the advice of the Colonial Defence Committee, that the fortifications around Australia, which were then deemed to be of an old type, armed with ancient guns, should be re-armed with the most modern weapons of the same calibre. There were, therefore, votes for the displacement of the old guns by new ones. The policy is being continued this year, and provision is made on the Estimates for placing new guns at the fortifications at Melbourne, Sydney, and Newcastle, and for new additional guns at Thursday Island. One very large vote is represented by the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. There has been considerable delay in the establishment of that factory, and I should like to give a short history of what has occurred. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing was Minister of Defence, he invited offers from firms throughout the world for the erection of a rifle factory capable of turning out fifty service rifles per day of eight hours. He did not provide plans and specifications, which contractors themselves had to supply with their tenders. When the first Fisher Government came into office they found that tenders had been called for on that basis, and that there were various types of machinery in use in such factories. One practice in the manufacture of rifles was adopted in America, and another in England. The English firms tendered according to the English system, under which, roughly speaking, a separate machine is used for the manufacture of each part of a rifle, and is not adjustable for the manufacture of any other part. Under the American system a lesser number of machines are used, and the cutters and gauges are so adjustable that one machine may be used for the manufacture of several parts of a rifle. Of the two tenders which, in the opinion of the Department, were the cheapest and the best, one was an American tender on the American system, and the other an English tender on the English system. The latter tender represented a very much larger sum of money than the former, but it was argued that the method of construction gave cheaper results. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; speaking from memory, I think the tender of the American firm was for £60,000, and that of the English firm for about .£120,000. Prior to the receipt of the tenders, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing had sent to England Engineer-Lieutenant Clarkson, an officer of repute in the Commonwealth service, to look into and study the business of rifle manufacture. The various, tenders were by correspondence referred to Engineer-Lieutenant Clarkson for his report. It became a question of correspondence between the Commonwealth Government, represented first of all by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, later by myself, and later again by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> and the tendering firms, to find out exactly what they were prepared to supply for the amounts of their tenders. As I have said, no specifications were laid down by the Commonwealth, and I remember that it was an extremely difficult matter to judge as between the two principal tenders which would be most advantageous to the Commonwealth. Eventually the American tender was so supplemented by guarantees, and in other ways, and its advantages were so clearly pointed out, that Commander Clarkson, who had been promoted in the meantime, was satisfied that the American tender would give the best return to the Commonwealth, and lie finally recommended1 that it should be accepted. That recommendation was received, I think, just before the first Fisher Government went out of office; and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook assumed control of the Defence Department one of the earliest acts of his administration was to accept the tender of the American firm. There are some terms connected with the contract which I cannot at present make public. The tenderers are considerably over the contract time in the supply of the machinery. They asked me, when I became Minister of Defence for the second time, to give them an extension of time for three months. I gave them an extension for one month. They also put forward a claim for compensation, on the ground that specifications supplied by the Royal Enfield Rifle Works of England, the manufacturers for the British Army, were not correct. We, of course, repudiated any idea of compensation. They asked also that the penalty for delay in the completion of the contract should be waived on account of laxity in regard to the specifications. I said that I would consider the question of waiving the penalty when the contract was completed. We have consulted the Crown Law authorities, and believe we have done the best thing possible throughout in the interests of the Common wealth, but it would 0Dviously not be in the public interest that I should make public the exact position, nor the exact nature of the claims made by the company. I am giving the Senate this information because I think it will tend to clear up a doubt which seems to exist in some quarters, that since we have not yet exacted the penalty for' delay in the completion of the contract we have in some way waived the rights of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- There is no threat or imminence of legal proceedings so far from either side. I do not think the position of the Commonwealth in the matter has been jeopardized in any way. I consider -that it is a business attitude to take up to insist that the contract must first of all be completed before we decide what we shall do with regard to the infliction of a penalty, or with regard to any claim which the company may press for compensation. The fact is that from whatever cause, the completion of the contract is long overdue. </para>

                        <para>- I do not; but the paper to which I have referred will give that information. There was a time limit in each case, and the English tender I know stipulated for a much longer time than did the American tender. I believe that the difference in time was one of the factors which induced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, as Minister of Defence, to make up his mind to accept the American tender. ' Just before I left office, with the first Fisher Ministry, the departmental officers had pointed out in connexion with the question of time that under one tender we might be manufacturing rifles during the time when the other tenderers were manufacturing the machines. The position now is that practically all the machinery has been delivered and is being installed. The buildings are about completed. The power plant, which was made in Australia, at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, has also been delivered, although it has not yet been officially taken over. It is being put through a series of tests to satisfy the departmental officers that the specifications have been complied' with. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it was found that it did not come up to the required test, and that is now being adjusted. The whole of the factory is approaching completion, and the acting manager informs me that he believes that before the end of the year it will be in full working order. In regard to the Cordite Factory, work has been proceeding steadily, and a stage has been reached when they are making the constituent parts for the manufacture of cordite. A large quantity nf nitric acid has been manufactured, and the manager tells me that towards the end of the present month he expects to be turning out cordite from the constituent parts, which have been already manufactured. I wish to refer briefly to what is proposed in connexion with the Naval Department. If honorable senators will turn to the Estimates they will see a vote of  £20,000,  put down for dockyards,. dredges, piers, wharfs, surveys, and other naval works. We had a report from Admiral Henderson as to what, in his opinion, were the best lines on which to base the Commonwealth naval policy. In their naval policy the Government are endeavouring to follow these lines, as far as the recommendations made cover the immediate future. In his report, Admiral Henderson saw fit to refer to a period of time covering twenty-one years, which he divided into three periods of seven years each. So far the Government are directing their attention to the first period of seven years; although, ns Admiral Henderson points out, what is done to-day ought to be done with a view to the period ahead, and the development which will follow from the taking of the proposed steps. As regards naval development and naval works, his main recommendation was that there should be a chief eastern naval base and a chief western naval base. At the outset he recommended that Sydney should be the eastern base, and that Fremantle, or a place in its vicinity - Cockburn Sound - should be the western base. He also recommended that round Australia, there should be subsidiary bases for various purposes, and he instanced Westernport, in the vicinity of Hobson's Bay, Port Stephens in New South Wales, Port Lincoln in South Australia, Thursday Island, and Port Darwin. The amount which is asked in these Estimates largely represents surveys of the various places which he indicated, with a view to ascertaining whether they comply with the requirements which he laid down. In making his recommendations, he had at his service all the data which had been collected by the State Departments, the various surveys which had been made, and all the knowledge in the possession of the Navigation or Marine Boards. But it was obvious that the data as to some of the sites could not be definite. Take, for instance, Cockburn Sound, in Western Australia. That is not at present what we would call a harbor. The mouths of what is deemed to be the harbor are closed by shoals in one place and by rocks in another. We are asking the State Government to have borings made to see whether it is practicable to blast a passage through the rocks, or cut a passage through the shoals of sand. We are also taking steps ourselves to have surveys made of the land in the vicinity, to plan what should be done there to create a naval base, so that later we shall be armed with all information as to actual cost, and able to tell Parliament exactly what we propose to do, and where we intend to place the work. That we are not able to do to-day, because we have not the data. This vote, although it looks formidable in its wording, is largely required for works pf an exploratory character, because what I have said about Port Cockburn also applies to Westernport and Port Stephens.- In each of the last two mentioned places we desire to have surveys and trial borings made, in order that we may be able to decide where to place dock yards and naval works of various kinds. Admiral Henderson took it for granted that the Commonwealth was prepared to adopt the recommendation of the Imperial Conference of 1909, that we should establish a fleet unit, providing as it did for three submarine boats. He took into consideration the question as to where the boats should be located, and he recommended that one should be located at Westernport and one at Port Stephens ; the former base to be used as the headquarters for the southern coast, and the latter base as the head-quarters for the north-eastern coast. He also recommended that we should take steps to provide for the training of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> who would be raised in Australia for the manning of the Fleet Unit. In the Commonwealth service we have a number of old gun-boats which, according to our naval advisers, are perfectly fit for training purposes. I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Protector,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Paluma,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Gayundah,</inline> and a couple of torpedo boats. The recommendation of our naval advisers is that, if these boats were each armed with an up-to-date gun, so that gunnery instruction could be given, they would be useful for two purposes. First, for training the Naval Reserve, which will be raised under the Defence Act - that is, youths who are over eighteen and under twenty-five years of age - and have to go to sea for twenty-five days in each year. Not only would the boats be useful for training these lads, and making them a valuable reserve for the Fleet Unit, but they would also be useful as recruiting boats for the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Fleet Unit. At present recruiting is carried on by the Australian Squadron, which is, of course, under the control of the Admiral. Some 400 Australians are being trained there, besides 200 or 300 who were enrolled for the Royal Naval Reserve. Those who joined the Naval Squadron during the last year or eighteen months were told that, in joining, they were practically undertaking to serve in the Australian Fleet Unit, and they signed on with that understanding ; so that when the Fleet Unit takes the place of the Australian Squadron, the Australians who were enrolled during that period will pass over to the Australian Government, and will be used to man the Fleet Unit. It is necessary to supplement that number, because we shall require about 800 of the lower ratings for the Fleet Unit. Following Admiral Henderson's recommendation again, it has been decided to establish a Naval </para>

There is also a proposition to do the same thing at Garden Island, in Port Jackson, with the consent of the Imperial authorities. </para>

                        <para>- It is very generous indeed. We are asking the Imperial authorities to allow our recruits in the interim to go into the Garden Island establishment, and from there to be drafted on to the drill-ships - the <inline font-style="italic">Pyramid</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Psyche</inline> - which are set aside for that purpose. This vote on the Works Estimates is intended for the establishment of Naval Barracks, and a Gunnery and Torpedo School at Westernport, the idea being to get as many Australians as possible, so as to insure that in the Fleet Unit all the lower ratings shall be Australians. The expenditure of another, large sum in connexion with the Defence Department is rendered necessary by the universal obligation to train which has been laid upon the youths of Australia. A sum of £65,000 is required for procuring rifles for the Senior Cadets. Orders have already been placed, and the object of this vote is to supplement them, so as to secure the necessary number of rifles. On the military side we have the advice of Lord Kitchener, which was tendered to a previous Government, and which was largely accepted and followed by the present Government. On that advice we are adding to the field batteries of Australia four batteries per 3'ear, and the Works Estimates contain an item of .£45,000 towards that object. A new item, which also marks a departure and a new policy in defence, is an item of £31,700 to establish a reserve of gun ammunition. When we came to consider the position of our field artillery we found that the reserves of artillery ammunition were dangerously small. When we recall the quantity of ammunition which was expended in a gun during the Japanese- Russian war we can realize how dangerously low our reserves of field gun ammunition have been in the past. Unless we take the proposed step we may find ourselves at some time in an awkward position. Suppose that we were cut off from Europe by sea for a few weeks, we would have very great difficulty in providing ammunition for field artillery. There are no manufacturers of the ammunition in Australia, and, therefore, it became imperative that some steps should be taken. Two courses were open to us : either to establish a factory for the manufacture of shells for field guns, or to establish a reserve of this class of ammunition. In time of peace our consumption of field gun ammunition and ammunition for the fixed defences is too small to employ a factory during the whole year. A huge sum would have been required to establish a factory, and when it was established our requirements would have been too small to keep it economically at work. Therefore, the Government decided that, until our consumption of ammunition is on a larger scale, it was imperative to establish a reserve of this ammunition on which we could fall back in time of war, if supplies from the Mother Country were cut off. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it does. In the case of all these high explosives deterioration means danger, and once a certain point is reached the article has to be destroyed. Our inspectors are continually going round and testing the cordite, and since I have been at the head of the Department we have had to destroy over £10,000 worth of this explosive. ' What we propose to do, therefore, is not to store the  cordite, but to store the metal parts of the cartridges - the shells. Then, having the cordite works, we shall always be in a position to charge the shells in time of war. This reserve, I need scarcely point out, will not deteriorate. The shells will be as good in ten years' time as they are to-day. This is a new departure; but I think honorable senators will agree with me that it is a very necessary one. Then there is an item of£12,000 for replacing condemned ammunition. This does not refer exclusively to cordite which has deteriorated, but to ammunition in store for the old type of  6-in.  guns. This ammunition has now become useless, owing to our having mounted more modern guns. Wherever it was possible to do so, we have used this ammunition; but, of course, we have not been able to use the whole of it. There are one or two places, too, where, according to experts, additional steps will need to be taken to make the proposed naval bases which we are establishing safe. That is to say, we shall require to mount guns of a heavier type, and we shall also need to extend the fortifications in those places. It is obvious that, if we have a formidable Fleet - and our Fleet, though small, will be a formidable one - no fleet will attack us unless it is equally formidable, both from the stand-point of the range of its guns, and of their penetration. Therefore, any ships sent down to attack our bases will be vessels carrying guns of a certain calibre. That consideration has caused us to extend our policy by arming our fixed defences. The amount which is set out on these Estimates represents the preliminary expenditure towards that end. I wish now to say a word or two regarding the Government policy in connexion with the factories which have already been established. In those factories, a system of accounts has been instituted by means of which we hope to be able to check the cost of production. We hope that these factories will be able to turn out the goods they are supplying as economically, if not more so, as we have hitherto been purchasing them from the contractors. </para>

                        <para>- We ought to be able to profit by the mistakes of other Departments. I repeat that a system of bookkeeping has been instituted in these factories, so that we shall be able to check, the exact cost of materials, of labour, and of production. I do not know that there are any other items in the Bill to which I can direct attention at this moment. Most of them are of an ordinary character, and simply give effect to the policy which has hitherto been adopted. Certainly, we are asking for larger amounts than have previously been voted; but these larger votes do not relate to new items. During the past twelve months we have placed very huge contracts for clothing materials, and these contracts are provided for upon the Estimates now under consideration. Both the production of the cloth and its manufacture into uniforms are being carried out in the Commonwealth. Although there have been some complaints about the non-supply of uniforms to Cadets, honorable senators must recollect that it was only in 1910 that the Bill was passed which authorized the increase of our Defence organization ; so that only a little more than twelve months have since elapsed. During that period, we have passed through one of the busiest years Australia has known, our factories have been working up to their full capacity, and we have had to go round and, as the Americans say, "hustle," in order to get our contracts placed, both for the supply of cloth and of uniforms. Though here and there we are slightly behind in the supply of uniforms, in most cases, they have been sent out as soon as the lads have been ready to receive them. In conclusion, I merely wish to say that any information which I can give to honorable senators, either in replying upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, or in Committee, I shall be only too pleased to supply, because I recognise that Parliament has an undoubted right to the fullest information in respect of any subject which is dealt with in these Estimates. All I ask is that honorable senators will, as expeditiously as possible, pass the Bill, so that the many useful works for which it provides may be commenced, and that the Government may get going with many undertakings for which both Parliament and the people have been clamouring for a long time. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Defence has stated the position, from his point of view, very fairly by asking the Senate to make such progress with this measure as it can. In dealing with that aspect of the case, may I point out that he has frequently expressed the view which is entertained by the Senate that a fairly reasonable opportunity should be given us of considering the finances of the Commonwealth. Seeing that this Chamber is disposed to extend to the Government a great deal of consideration in regard to this Bill, I think it is not unreasonable to ask them to afford us an early opportunity of considering the whole financial position, upon a motion which already appears upon the business-paper. It is only right that the Government should give that debate a little more prominent place upon the business-paper than it occupies at present. To postpone the question until we are on the eve of the prorogation, will be merely to keep the word of promise to the ear and break it to the hope. I quite agree with- the Minister that there are matters which he mentioned which can be more advantageously dealt with in Committee, and I propose to follow his suggestion in that connexion. But I would direct attention to the serious practice which is growing up of endeavouring to circumvent the Audit Act. Under that Act, on the 30th June in each year, every sum which is unexpended falls back into the Consolidated Revenue, and has to be le-voted. However desirable a practice that may be in regard to votes for the ordinary annual services, its absurdity is becoming more and more manifest with each Bill that is presented to this Chamber. Nothing could have emphasized its absurdity more eloquently than did the remarks of the Minister of Defence in his attempt to defend it. He pointed out that because it is not possible to expend £600,000 upon telegraphic and telephonic works before the 30th June next, it is intended to establish a Trust Fund; and thus to evade the obligations of the Audit Act. This is not a solitary instance of the kind. I do not know whether the Minister can tell us how many Trust Funds are already in existence. I believe that the amount at present in them represents something like £11,000,000. I cannot better illustrate the position than by saying that on the Senate table there is a bottle of water, and several tumblers. The bottle we will suppose represents the Consolidated Revenue, and just so long as the water remains in it, the Senate exercises control over it. But if the Ministry pour a portion of that water into a tumbler, which I may liken to a Trust Fund, from that moment it passes out of our control. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">That is the one object underlying the establishment of Trust Funds, and it doubtless explains the strong affection which the Treasury officials have for this mode of procedure. I have no objection to the cash system being adopted in regard., to the ordinary annual services, but when we are asked to hypothecate a certain sum of money for the purchase of a specific quantity of material, I say that Parliament, having approved of it, the amount ought to be expended, irrespective of whether or not it can be expended by a certain date. It is the acme of absurdity to say that, if Parliament, in its wisdom, votes £2,000 for the purchase of ammunition, because the money cannot be expended by the 30th June, it must lapse, and the Legislature must be asked to reapprove it. The extent to which this practice is growing is shown in the figures which are before us. Last year, we voted £523,616 in connexion with the Department of Home Affairs, of which only £330,468 was expended. Where is the justification for loading up the Estimates by this procedure, and of asking Parliament to reconsider its decision? This matter becomes more serious when we observe the growth of Trust Funds. Every session we create a fresh Trust Fund ? Why ? Merely to get away from the disabilities which are imposed by the Audit Act. Would it not be a more businesslike procedure to amend that Act, and to say that when we have made an appropriation for the purchase of material, or anything else, it should stand good ? When the general Estimates are under consideration, I propose to ask the Senate to consider the sums of money which are being dealt with under cover of these Trust Funds, and which thus pass beyond parliamentary control, notwithstanding that we may have had no information whatever as to the specific purposes to which they are to be applied. The Minister of Defence has assured us that though this £600,000 will be paid into a Trust Fund, not a penny of it will be spent until a Bill has been submitted containing a schedule which will disclose the details of the proposed expenditure. But  1  would remind him that a similar promise was made to the Senate on a previous occasion, and was not redeemed. I refer to the promise made in respect of the Naval Trust Fund. We were invited to' appropriate a certain sum which was to be paid into the Naval Trust Fund, and we were given the solemn assurance by the Government of the day that not a single penny of that money would be touched until Parliament had been afforded an opportunity of approving or disapproving of the proposed method of expending it. We know that that promise was not redeemed. The fund was rifled, and appropriated without any further reference to Parliament at all. The justification urged was that there had been a change of Government, and that the Ministry of the day were under no obligation to redeem the promise of their predecessors. I refer to this as showing that the Ministerial promises, although under existing circumstances they may be of value, do not in any sense protect the rights of Parliament. If we place this £600,000 in a Trust Fund, there will be nothing to prevent the Government from spending the money as they like, barring their own word ; and while I do not doubt that their promise will, in this instance, be rigidly observed, there is no guarantee to Parliament as to how the money will be spent. Parliament practically gives up its right even to inquire, or, at any rate, to control the expenditure, once it gives permission for the money to be passed into the Trust Fund. With regard to wireless telegraphy, I should like to have an assurance from the Government that they are not committing themselves more and more deeply to the Telefunken system, until at least they have had some assurance as to the result of the legal action recently instituted in Great Britain by the Marconi Company. The Telefunken system was very severely criticised elsewhere, and in the Senate, some time ago. Although the departmental view was not disturbed by parliamentary criticism, I think I am correct in saying that grave doubts existed in the minds of some honorable senators as to whether the correct course was being taken. Since then those doubts have been considerably strengthened. If any one wants proof of the assertion that the cheapest tender is not always the best, we have it in the disclosure made to-day by the Minister with reference to the Small Arms Factory. The Government of the day, with regard to both the Small Arms Factory and the wireless installation, felt itself almost compelled to accept the lowest tenders that were offered because of the low figure quoted for each. In both of these cases, an American firm in the one instance, and the local representatives of a German firm in the other, put in tenders very much below the rates quoted by their competitors. In regard to the Small Arms Factory, the Minister has to-day .furnished us with particulars as to what has occurred. The successful tenderer had hardly got to work when a claim was put in for compensation, because it was professed to have been discovered that there had been some variation from the original conditions. The same thing occurred with reference to the construction of wireless installation, where the Government paid 50 per cent, increase over the tender price because of some alteration in the conditions, which, I venture to say, was not worth anything like the amount of compensation claimed. We know the subsequent history of this wireless company. It is a marvellous thing to me that, while we insist upon a Commonwealth monopoly with reference to wireless telegraphy, the Government should have consented to pay 50 per cent, in excess of the tender price almost as soon as the tender was accepted. I can only hope that the Government are not going to allow themselves to get further and further involved, so that they will be compelled to go on extending the Telefunken system as new wireless installations are required. I do not say at the present time that the Telefunken system is either the best or the worst system that we could adopt. I do not raise that point at all, nor is it necessary to do so. What I am anxious for is that the Government shall not be compelled, in regard to fresh installations, to deprive itself of the opportunity of adopting any other system which may be considered to be better ; and, above all, I am anxious that the Government shall make itself abundantly safe by seeing that all legal difficulties are satisfactorily disposed of before we permit the Telefunken system to be finally installed in Australia. I have one remark to make concerning the Northern Territory. The observations of the Minister concerning the policy of the Government did not seem to promise a very hopeful future for that portion of our responsibilities. The Minister spoke of the amount set down on the Estimates for experimental farms, and said that it was intended to experiment in order to acquire that knowledge which would enable the Government to determine on lines of development. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that we are not to wait for the result of the experiments before we attempt to develop, but that developmental works will go on side by side with the experiments which will enable us, from time to time, to readjust our developmental policy. If that be the meaning, I quite approve of what is being done. The policy pursued is satisfactory, so far as it goes ; but I should have liked to have had a more definite statement as to what is intended with regard to the Northern Territory. For myself, I am not free from apprehensions concerning it. First of all, I recognise that this is perhaps the biggest responsibility that we have yet shouldered. </para>

                        <para>- It is; and I will add - and I say this with a full sense of responsibility, and with seriousness - that  I  regret the Government have not obtained the services of a better adviser with regard to agricultural development. I urge the Government not to tie themselves absolutely to the advice which they will receive from those to whom apparently they are looking for guidance at the present time. There are persons in Australia whose capacity is beyond question, and who have had' some practical experience - and  I  lay  a  great deal of stress upon practical experience - of tropical agriculture. The advice of these people is available to the Government if they seek it. They will do well to avail themselves of such advice before they proceed further. At any rate,  I  trust that they will not lay too much stress upon the reports which have been presented to them by their own officers. Before I sit down, I may draw attention to one little matter regarding the form of the Bill. We might as well be correct. The Bill professes to vote money for the purpose of " Additions, New Works, and Buildings, &amp;c." That title finds its way on to the face of the Bill because it was the title of the first Works Bill introduced into this Parliament; but the Minister will see that this measure is quite dissimilar from that. It contains large votes for defence purposes, for the purchase of material for military stores, for armaments, ammunition, the establishment of an aviation corps, the re-armament of vessels, and so forth. These items of expenditure can hardly come under the denomination of" Additions, New Works, and Buildings." I admit that the point is not important, but I suggest that it is about time for the Government to alter this stereotyped heading in order to make the title conform to the purposes of the measure itself. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Defence has made an appeal to the Senate to pass this Bill without delay. He does not, of course, expect that there will be no criticism, but he has requested that there will be nothing in the nature of obstruction. The explanation given, however, touches upon matters of policy to such an extent that some amount of criticism must be expected at this stage. I take the opportunity of saying a few words with regard to one or two of the more important subjects dealt with in the measure which are not capable of being so well dealt with in Committee.  I  will first refer to a point to which I have alluded on several other occasions. We are taking an enormous sum of money out of revenue in order to provide for permanent works. Take one item alone - the establishment of a Trust Fund for the purposes of a Post and Telegraph Department. An amount of over£600,000 is being taken out of the current year's revenue for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- It ought to be. As the Commonwealth develops, the Department should become entirely reproductive, and should be able to sustain its own expenditure. But at present the Department absorbs a very large amount of revenue. Notwithstanding the fact that these permanent works which will be built out of this Trust Fund money will be permanent assets of the Commonwealth, it is proposed to charge the whole cost upon current revenue. Why so? </para>

There is not a member of the Senate who is not aware that twice or three times £600,000 will be required to place the Post and Telegraph Department on a sound footing in the matter of permanent works. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie must have forgotten what the Minister of Defence said in introducing this Bill.

                            Largie, with his knowledge of the requirements of the Post and Telegraph Department, should be acquainted with the conditions of the Postal Department of the United Kingdom. If he is he will know that no less than eighteen months ago, when by an Act of the Imperial Parliament it was provided that when the rights of the -different telephone companies expired they should be taken over by the Imperial Government, a minute was sent down from the Postmaster-General's Department to the Treasury in anticipation of the requirement of £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 for the purpose, and it was accompanied by a statement that the cost of the transaction would be met by the Post and Telegraph Department by a system of terminable annuities. When the Postmaster-General of England warned the Imperial Parliament that it would be necessary to find £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 for the purpose mentioned, it never occurred to him to suggest that it should be taken out of revenue.

                        <para>- Ever since I have been a member of the Senate, I have been complaining that that has not been done. When we find that the Postmaster-General's Department of the United Kingdom, with its 40,000,000 of probably the wealthiest people on earth, never thinks of charging to current revenue the whole cost of developmental and reproductive works, it should be patent to every one that a somewhat similar system should be applied to the construction of such works in Australia. What is the reason for the adoption of the Government policy in this matter? It is due to a financial shibboleth on the other side - " Don't borrow." </para>

                        <para>- The Minister would do well to bear in mind that very often our visitors successfully practice the art of " leg-pulling." The fact remains that private telephone companies, in extending the area of their operations, do not take the cost of permanent reproductive works out of capital. They spread it over a number of years, and from each year's revenue set aside a certain amount to cover the cost. It is so with every private enterprise. If a company is formed to carry on reproductive operations, it does not charge the whole cost of permanent works to the capital raised straight away, but to meet it depend to a very large extent upon the profits derived. I mention this matter, because any one who travels through the sparsely-populated districts of Australia must know that settlement is retarded because the Government, time and again, in answer to demands for extensions, say, "There is no money." They might easily get the money required, especially for the Post and Telegraph Department, but I regret to say that in this Bill, proposing such immense expenditure on new works and buildings, there is not the slightest indication that the Government intend to adopt the financial policy followed everywhere else. In this connexion, I may refer to a matter which probably Ministers will regard as proving that their policy is a sound one. The previous Government, after careful deliberation, intended to establish in connexion with the construction of reproductive works for the Post and Telegraph Department, something like the principle upon which the Post Office of the United Kingdom is carried on, by proposing to pay for those works by a system of terminable annuities. I think that was a sound proposition. I have risen only to refer to this matter of financial policy, and so long as I remain a member of the Senate I shall protest against the Government system of charging the whole cost of reproductive works to current revenue. </para>

                        <para>- Until a proper system of finance is adopted, especially in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department, the reasonable requirements of the people for telephonic and telegraphic facilities will not be met. I do not wish to blame the present Government solely in this matter, because preceding Administrations followed much the same line. There is this difference, however, to be considered : That the last Government intended to abandon the policy of looking to each year's revenue to meet the whole cost of new reproductive works. Such a system must in the end break down. This Bill proposes the expenditure of over £2,000,000 upon new works and buildings. From the somewhat sketchy, but very informative, remarks of the Minister of Defence in introducing the Bill, it is clear that we are committed to millions of expenditure on works which will be permanent and reproductive. How are the Government, as our population increases, to meet out of revenue the expenditure which will be necessary upon the public works to which we are already committed? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie suggested, by interjection, that I am the apostle for the loan business. But in a certain sense honorable senators opposite are the apostles for a loan policy. There are items in this Bill associated with the development of the Northern Territory, and with possible schemes of development in Western Australia, and the shibboleth of the Government party - no borrowing - is utterly impossible of application to these schemes of development. The Government cannot face the problem of connecting Port Darwin with Adelaide, and Port Augusta with Kalgoorlie, out of current revenue. </para>

                        <para>- If I were to pursue this matter, I should be led into the discussion of matters of policy, and I think we might defer to the Minister's request not to trench too largely on matters of that kind in dealing with this Bill. Still, I say that if we are going to build the railways to which I have referred, we must borrow somewhere. If we are going to conduct the Post and Telegraph Department as it should be conducted, in order to give reasonable facilities to the people of Australia, we must borrow. When we get some idea of the financial policy of the Government, we shall find either that the development of the country by railways north and south is mere pretence and humbug of the electors, or, if there is sincerity behind it, that these reproductive works can only be carried out by the Commonwealth going to the loan market somewhere. </para>

                        <para>- That question will be dealt with by the Government by-and-by. I cannot forget that, during last session, we repealed the Naval Loan Act which had been passed at the instance of the previous Government to sanction a loan of£3,500,000 for establishing a navy. But the greater portion of the money required for that purpose has been found out of revenue. For the Defence Department, as well as the Postmaster-General's Department, money is required, and the Government's policy of last session is still in force, although it was denounced by the last speaker, and his colleagues, as one of the worst things which possibly could happen. It was described then as unjust, unfair robbery, scandalous robbery, and in other ways, but we do not hear much about the policy now. The result of its adoption has been that, instead of borrowing, we have found £3,500,000, practically out of revenue, and the much denounced tax of last session has produced for the Commonwealth about £1,400,000. Those who hold large valuable properties are now called upon to pay their just and fair quota of the taxation. Surely they ought to find the means for protecting their estates. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to have from the Government a promise that if this measure is passed with ordinary expedition, but, of course, after some discussion we shall have an opportunity to debate at length their financial policy. In fact, that opportunity should have been provided before this Bill was introduced. We are practically ' working in the dark, but if the Minister can give the assurance I desire, it will facilitate the passage of the Bill. We are asked to vote a large sum to carry out the works policy of the Government for the current year. A considerable portion of the amount represents votes which have lapsed, and have to be re-voted. I dare say that a large part of the sum which we are now asked to vote will also lapse, because I do not think that the Government will have the time, even if they had the will, to spend all this money on useful works during the next six or seven months. It is over twelve months since they promised that wireless telegraphy would be installed with expedition in Australia, but there has been only delay in this matter. A station was to be established at Thursday Island or Cooktown. According to the Minister of the day it did not need to be equipped in anything like the same way as the station at Fremantle or Sydney. When a ship goes Home it is installed with wireless telegraphy in about three weeks. I think that four or five months was ample time for the Government to fulfil their promise We hear nothing from them now on this subject, except that the erection of a station is being proceeded with at Pennant Hills and at Fremantle. What action is being taken with regard to other stations which were to be established in different parts of the Commonwealth - for instance, one in Tasmania, and one in North Queensland? No money is asked on these Estimates to carry out this necessary work. I think that at the least the Government ought to proceed with the works which they promised to undertake. Although nothing has been done during the last twelve months, yet the Government come down now and tell us that for another year nothing is to be done. That is not fair to the Parliament or to the country. Apparently sums of money can be found for constructing railways and establishing the Federal Capital. The laying out of the Capital is not so urgent as the installation of wireless telegraphy. It is established all over the world, but Australia lags behind, and only for private enterprise we would not have such a convenience here. In my opinion, the Government are to be condemned for their inaction. We have heard a lot about the Government carrying out works with revenue, and revenue only. How are they going to pay for the railways out of revenue unless they impose additional taxation? At present we do not know what is their policy in that regard. We are practically asked to vote a lot of money "on the blind." Are we not entitled to know when the Government are likely to proceed with the development of the Northern Territory? I have not heard a word from the Minister to-day about the development of the Territory of Papua. Surely it is intended to do something there. </para>

                        <para>- Since it was taken over the Northern Territory has involved a loss at the rate of £316,000 annually, which, of course, the taxpayers have to make good. We are told that the Government are making experiments there. They had the advantage of the various experiments which had been made by South Australia; and surely before they decided to take over the Territory they should have had an idea of how they intended to develop its resources, ind not ask the taxpayers to cover a deficiency of over £300,000 a year, merely telling us that something will be done there by-and-by. That is not a good business proposition. I do not think that any one else would take over a Territory without being prepared to develop it. Nor have we heard how the Government intend to populate the Northern Territory, or, indeed, what course they propose to take. Everything is to be left in abeyance. There is no prospect of this Parliament having an opportunity to efficiently deal with the Territory, and when we appeal to the electors we shall be told that the Government intend to take some action in the future. In the meantime, the Territory is to be a millstone round the necks of the taxpayers. It was the duty of the Government to outline what they intend to do as regards its development. There is also a large loss every week on the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, but we have not heard a word from the Government as to how they propose to reduce the loss. Apparently it is to be allowed to continue, and we shall have to vote money to make good the deficiency. The Senate was entitled to an explanation from the Government, but we are left completely in the dark. I do not cavil at the proposed votes for defence, because I think it is necessary, but some of the items appear to me to be very large. Upon these Estimates an amount of £4,000 is provided for the purpose of making a road in the Maribyrnong district. I desire to know whether or not that road is within Commonwealth Territory. If it be within Commonwealth Territory, I have no objection to the expenditure; but otherwise I entertain the very strongest objection to it. I observe, too, that in the Bill large amounts are set apart for the establishment of rifle ranges. Strange to say, no sum has been provided for any rifle range north of Mackay, in Queensland, notwithstanding that some of the largest rifle meetings in Australia have been held in that locality. From my own experience, expenditure in that direction is very necessary. We have been assured by Ministerial supporters that the Commonwealth is not going to embark upon a borrowing policy. I. may, perhaps, be permitted to tell honorable senators that I know a very wealthy man who refuses to own a single house, on the ground that he can rent one cheaper, and thus make better use of his capital. If we can borrow money and expend it to advantage in the Northern Territory, why should we not do so? Why should we be compelled to do everything out of revenue for the benefit of future generations? Let us shoulder our share of the burden and let posterity shoulder its share. </para>

                        <para>- What is wrong in a man borrowing money, so long as he can make good use of it and pay interest upon it? Is it wrong for the Commonwealth to borrow money for reproductive public works which will belong to future generations? All authorities lay it down that to borrow for reproductive public works is good financing. If I owned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell's farm, and I saw that, by mortgaging it for £2,000 or £3,000, I could make a profit of 2 or 3 per cent., I would adopt that course without hesitation. It would be good business to do so. But the honorable senator is so conservative that he cannot see beyond the nose on his face. To borrow money for the purpose of developing our resources is good business, so long as the Government have faith in those resources. In the absence of further taxation, I would like to know where the money is to come from which we shall be asked to vote upon the Estimates-in-Chief . We have embarked upon a defence scheme which is based upon the reports of Admiral Henderson and Lord Kitchener. Admiral Henderson's scheme alone represents an outlay of .£80,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- They have to maintain a Navy which is far more powerful than any other Navy in the world. I do not suggest that the people of Australia will complain of fair taxation ; but it is impossible to construct, out of revenue, all the works by which future generations will profit. Let us borrow judiciously. If the Northern Territory is the great country which it has been pictured to be, why not borrow money for its development? Let us ease the taxpayer in that way, and then more revenue will be available for the purposes of defence. I admit that a Defence policy should be paid for out of revenue. But, upon these Estimates, I see dozens of works which are to be paid for out of revenue, and which will principally benefit future generations. I wish now to refer to the establishment of the Cordite Factory. I hold in my hand a copy of the correspondence which took place in reference to that factory, and I confess it is a little puzzling to me. I have been told that only two tenders were received for its erection, whereas the correspondence discloses that four tenders were forthcoming. These were : - The Birmingham Small Arms Company, £150,231, time, two and a half years ; Archdale and Company, Birmingham, £100,438, time, three years ; Greenwood and Batley, Leeds, £69,141, time, two years, less five weeks; Pratt and Whitney, United States of America, £68,144, time, one year, sixteen weeks, which was subsequently reduced to one year. Commander Clarkson, Captain Collins, and various other gentlemen all pointed out that there was not much difference between the tenders of two firms - that the difference was principally in respect of the time which would be occupied in establishing the factory. I will not weary the Senate by quoting the whole of the letters relating to this matter. I shall confine myself to one. On page 2 appears the following passage : - </para>

                        <para>- What was the use of sending the official to America if this state of things was to result? What good came of the inquiries ? Commander Clarkson considered that there was little to choose between the two manufacturers " except time of delivery." Have we secured any advantage in respect of time of delivery? The Government knew that they were letting the contract to people at a distance, and that they might never carry it out. The Minister has acknowledged today that he does not know exactly when the business will be settled. He added that there were certain matters that it would not be advisable to state to the Senate. I quite agree with him, and shall not attempt to press him to say more than he thinks judicious. But I hope that the honorable senator will see that contractors who put in a tender which is accepted carry out their job, and are not allowed to play ducks and drakes with the Commonwealth. I have always found in private business that if one had a contract to let the best course to pursue was to let it to a reliable man who would carry it through according to the conditions as to time and quality laid down in the specifications. An unreliable contractor will generally take longer over the job, and put in bad work unless he is watched very carefully - and watching costs a good deal of money. </para>

                    <para>.- Many important points have been raised in the course of the debate, which, no doubt, will be more fully discussed when the Bill gets into Committee. I should like to ask the Minister to arrange to have the general debate on the Budget-papers as early as possible. Very large and important questions have to be discussed, and it is not fair thai they should be thrown back until we approach the end of the session. A good deal has been said with regard to the policy of. borrowing or not borrowing. In my opinion, we should not make a fetish of either policy. It is purely a question of what pays best - whether it pays the country better to take out of the pockets of the taxpayers money for reproductive works, or to borrow at  3½  per cent., and allow the taxpayers to invest their money at perhaps  5  or  6  per cent. It is purely a matter of business. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger intended to argue that borrowing should be adopted as a policy in all cases. </para>

                <para class="block">Quick with some default in connexion with the Small Arms Factory. That was most unfair. Surely the present Government is responsible for carrying out the contract. They cannot shake off their responsibility by making charges against an absent man who cannot stand up for himself in the Senate, and who certainly is not responsible for the failure to complete the contract. It seems to me that it is a question of whether the specifications were faulty or not. From the little we have heard this afternoon, I am disposed to think that it may be a difficult matter for the Government to recover penalties, if, as has been hinted, there has been some change made in the specifications. </para>

                            Quick; but it fell to the present Government to see it carried out. There are many matters which it will be necessary to discuss when the Budget debate is resumed, but there is one rather delicate matter of importance to which I think I should refer now. We are asked by this Bill to approve of an expenditure of  £2,791,365,  and I think we should know whether the Government intend to apply the principle of preference to unionists, and to institute a discrimination as to the men and women to be employed in connexion with the expenditure of this money. If it is the intention of the Government in the construction of these new works and buildings to give effect to the principle of preference to unionists, we should have a straightforward statement on the subject. If such a statement is not made we may assume that there will be no discrimination in the selection of men and women to be employed in connexion with this expenditure, and that they will be selected because of their capacity, and not because they belong or do not belong to a particular body.

The money to pay for these works will come out of the pockets of the whole of the people. Every man, woman, and child in Australia, through the Tariff, or in some other way, will contribute to this expenditure. If it is intended that the work for which this Bill will provide is to be set apart for a mere moiety of the people, we shall know where we stand. I trust that the Minister of Defence will make some reference to this important matter in his reply to the debate. </para>

                    <para>. - Most of the criticisms we have heard from honorable senators opposite this afternoon have been directed at their colleagues in another place. The contracts in connexion with the Defence and the Postal Departments to which they have referred were entered into by their colleagues in another place when they were in office, but one would imagine from their criticism that the present Government were responsible for the delays which have taken place. The delay in the completion of the contracts referred to has been due to the fact that those who entered into them lacked sufficient business capacity to see that proper contracts were made, and with reputable firms. Therefore, my references by interjection to the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Defence of the previous Administration were deserved. It is rather amusing to hear honorable senators opposite criticising the financial policy of the present Government. They must either have forgotten already the result of the last general elections, or they are unable to learn anything from it. They appear to have forgotten that the country kicked their party out of office because of the scandalous financial policy they were pursuing. If there was anything in connexion with the opposite party which the electors resented more than another it was the notorious Naval Loan Act passed by the late Government. The policy of the present Government is plain to every one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has referred to it as "schoolboy finance." Apparently, the only kind of finance known to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's type of politician is one of " borrow and burst." Their policy is to borrow, whether they require the money or not. We never had in Australia as much money, collectively or individually, as we have to-day. The Government are collecting more money now than has ever before been collected in Australia, and because in a commonsense fashion we are proposing to pay our way and provide from revenue for new works, we are told by honorable senators opposite that we should borrow. </para>

Does he think that they ought not to provide money in any shape or form for new works, but should pay away all surplus revenue to the States, and starve the public works of the Commonwealth. </para>

After all is said and done, what is a miserable£1,250,000 from a land tax? It is only a first instalment. The present Government will not be satisfied until a great deal more of our revenue is derived from direct, and a great deal less from indirect, taxation. No matter how the revenue is derived, we, on this side, are determined that we. shall pay our way while we can do so, instead of borrowing money when it is not required. Why should we borrow money when Australia is more prosperous than she has ever before been in her history? Still, we have the stupid Tory party on the other side- </para>

                        <para>- I pointed out that if the term was meant to be applied to the party as a whole, or the policy of the party represented by honorable senators on the Opposition side, it would not be out of order; but, as it appeared to me that the honorable senator said of honorable senators that they were the " stupid Tory party," I asked the honorable senator to withdraw the word " stupid " as applied to them. The honorable senator's notice of dissent does not properly apply to my ruling, which was that the term he used, as applied to honorable senators on the Opposition side of the Chamber was out of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie should alter this motion, because it is not in accordance with the reason why I asked him to withdraw the words. </para>

                        <para>-  It is quite evident to me, sir, that you misunderstood the remark I made, otherwise you would not have ruled as you did. The remark was applied to honorable senators on the other side as a combined party. I was referring to what was the policy of the party which is now the Opposition, when it was in office. You will see, sir, that my remark could only apply to them as a party, and not as individuals. My intention was quite plain to any one. </para>

                        <para>-  I listened attentively to the utterance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and I can say that he did not direct his remark at all to any honorable senator opposite. It should be remembered that when an honorable senator is addressing the Chair, and discussing a question of policy, he has in his mind the policy pursued by the party opposite. If we are to be tied down in these matters, it will rather narrow the margin. If the word " stupid " is applied to any honorable member of the Senate, certainly it may be considered offensive; but if it is applied to the policy pursued by the party which honorable senators opposite represent, I do not think it can be considered offensive. </para>

                        <para>-  It is a question of the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. It was the policy which he was discussing, and not a member of a party, or even the party. In my opinion, his application of the remark was quite correct, and, therefore, I support his motion of dissent from the ruling. </para>

                        <para>-  I regret that this motion has been moved, because I do not think it was worth while to object to the ruling. What we are called upon to deal with is the ruling itself, and we must assume that the  President  has correctly stated what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie did say. The  President  distinctly asked the honorable senator whether he applied the term personally to honorable senators on the other side. It the honorable senator had risen then and assured the  President  that he had not, that would have cleared up the whole matter. </para>

                        <para>-  If the honorable senator will excuse me for saying so, I think that what he said on the second occasion was not what he said on the first occasion. In the first instance, I took the same view as the  President,  namely, that the remark was open to the construction that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie was alluding to honorable senators opposite as being a " stupid Tory party." I think it was perfectly reasonable for the  President  to regard the remark in that light. He took that view, and asked for a withdrawal of the words. I think that the honorable senator will be well-advised if he withdraws the motion and states that, if his words were understood in that sense, he is prepared to withdraw them, or assure honorable senators opposite and the  President  that he did not intend them to be so understood. </para>

The  President  has stated that he gave the ruling believing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie had used the words in the sense I have suggested. If a vote is taken, I must support the ruling, because it seems to me that it is a correct one. The question now is, not whether the honorable senator did or did not use the words. The  President  has said that he did use the words, that he asked him if he used the words in that sense, but did ' not get the assurance which he desired. </para>

If such an assurance is given, the  President  will probably tell the Senate that he does not regard the remark as being out of order. Otherwise I shall have to vote against the motion. </para>

                        <para>-  I am really supporting my honorable friend. I understand that he denies that he considers us "stupid Tory members." I certainly thought he said that members of the Opposition were a " stupid Tory party." But to me it does not matter what he said, so long as he was not personally offensive. I have a perfect right to call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie a stupid Labour man, and he is equally at liberty to designate me a stupid Tory, or a stupid Liberal, or anything else, so long as his remarks are confined to a political sense. It might be a good thing if we were permitted a little more latitude in our choice of language than we have hitherto been allowed. It now appears  that we must not describe the appointment of certain members to a Royal Commission as a scandal, neither must we call an honorable senator "stupid," or a "Tory." Upon the whole, I drink we are getting too much into a Sunday-school atmosphere. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, and if he chooses to use strong language m reference to myself, he is perfectly at liberty to do so. </para>

                        <para>-  I was absent from the chamber when certain words were used, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. It seems to me immaterial what they were. The  President  has entered judgment upon them, and we are now asked to say whether his ruling is right or wrong. It appears to me that what may be held to be right or wrong is very much a matter of opinion, and will vary with different Presidents, just as much as it will with honorable senators. But the point is that we have a  President,  and, unless his decision is hopelessly wrong, we are under an obligation to support it. Having said so much, I join with the Minister of Defence in asking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, not only for his own credit, but for that of the Senate, to terminate this incident, especially as, according to his interjection, he evidently meant one thing, whereas the  President  thought that he meant another. </para>

                        <para>-  Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I did not hear the remark to which exception has been taken ; but the position seems to be that you, sir, have ruled that certain words, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie denies having used, should be withdrawn. In these circumstances, I am bound to support your ruling. I am sorry that an honorable senator upon the Ministerial side of the chamber, has taken up a similar attitude to that adopted by an honorable senator upon the other side of the chamber only last week. So long as I have been a member of this branch of the Legislature, it has been customary for any remark made by any honorable senator, which was regarded as offensive by another, to be immediately withdrawn. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who is Whip of the Government party, and who ought to save the valuable time of the Senate instead of wasting it, should have taken up this obstinate attitude, and should have refused to adopt the gentlemanly course which has hitherto obtained, of withdrawing what is regarded as an offensive expression. </para>

How often are we called Socialists, and something even worse - a term which some of us may not care to have applied to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has expressed himself in the way that I would have expressed myself. Speaking in all soberness, I say that the Opposition are an extremely Tory party. With very great reluctance, I shall vote against the President's ruling, and in opposition to the Government. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, because I think he is in the right. </para>

If it be wrong for me to condemn them because of the stupidity of their policy, it is equally wrong for them to claim that that policy is an intelligent one. </para>

Had I been doing so, I would at once have recognised the propriety of withdrawing the words to which exception was taken. But 1 was dealing with the Opposition in a party sense, and I cannot for the life of me see how there could, be any misunderstanding of my meaning. I was dealing with the policy of the late Government, and there are members of that Government who are politically dead. They are not here. There are many men outside of this Parliament who were members of the Fusion party. I was speaking only in a party sense, and I fail to understand how there could be any misconception as to my meaning. </para>

                        <para>-  I did. I repeated the words which I actually used, namely, "stupid Tory party." I was referring at the time to the result of the last election, when the Fusion party was nearly wiped out of existence. The Minister of Defence is entirely wrong, and I hold that the  President  did not hear my remarks, otherwise he would not have ruled as he did. </para>

                        <para>- In putting this question, I wish to state that the motion does not contain the words which I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to use, and to which I took exception. Pointing to honorable senators on the other side, he said,. " Members of the stupid Tory party opposite." I immediately rose, and asked the honorable senator to withdraw that expression, because I considered it to be disorderly. He admitted that he had used' the words which I had understood him to use. I pointed out to him that if he applied the term " stupid " to the policy of a party it would be quite in order, but as I understood the words to have been used concerning honorable senators opposite to him they were out of order. I may add that a ruling of a former  President  lays it down that "it is not proper to impute to a senator stupidity." </para>

                    <para>- If any words of mine can remove any feeling of soreness on the part of honorable senators opposite, I wish to state at once that the term to which exception was taken by the  President  was not intended by me to be applied to them personally. I can now, I trust, resume the discussion of the financial question. Comparisons have been made between the telephone service in Australia and in other parts of the world. I have inquired into this matter, taking special note of the rates charged and the wages paid in similar services elsewhere. If we take the telephone rates of the United States, Canada, and South Africa, we shall find that in some instances they are 200 and 300 per cent. higher than they are in Australia. If we compare telephone charges in the United Kingdom with those in Australia, we shall find that our own people have very little to complain about. When people in a large and sparsely-settled country like Australia obtain their telephone services actually for less than do people in a densely-settled country like the United Kingdom, it will be seen at a glance that we have a condition of things upon which we may reasonably congratulate ourselves. In Australia, a person can obtain a telephone for  £4  per annum, paying an additional halfpenny per call. In the United Kingdom the charge is  £5  per annum, with an additional charge of one penny per call. It is therefore evident that our business men are obtaining an exceedingly satisfactory service at a very low rate. The comparison in respect of wages is also in favour of the Commonwealth. Our wages are nearly 100 per cent. higher than are those in the United Kingdom. According to published statements collected by the Postal Commission, of which I was a member, wages in the telephone service in the United Kingdom are something like £67 per annum as compared with £110 per annum in the Commonwealth. Moreover, the telephone attendants in the United Kingdom work over fifty hours per week, whilst our attendants work only thirty-six hours. Linesmen in the United Kingdom receive a minimum salary of£65 per annum, with a maximum of £122. In the Commonwealth the minimum salary is £126 and the maximum£180. These comparisons are sufficient to show that our telephone system is in a very satisfactory position indeed. As to new works, the Postal Commission recommended that, a considerable amount of capital being required, the expenditure might very well be spread over a number of years. The Commission did not recommend that the Commonwealth should borrow. That is a matter of policy for the Government of the day to determine. But we did point out the amount of money that was required to make the service efficient. The present Government, finding itself possessed of an overflowing revenue, determined to provide for the works without borrowing. Surely that was a wise determination. If the Government had resolved to borrow under such circumstances, they would have laid themselves open to serious charges. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has referred to what he calls " schoolboy finance." I wonder what kind of finance he was advocating. I am precluded from applying the term " stupid " to his policy, but I could not, on any account, call it intelligent finance. The policy adopted by the Government is the only one that would have been justifiable under present circumstances. If ever the day should come when the Commonwealth will find it imperative to borrow, I shall regret that step, and shall never agree to it smilingly. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger's " schoolboy finance," we should borrow whether we require the money or not. In my opinion, it will be time enough for us to borrow money when we cannot meet our liabilities with the money we have. </para>

                <para class="block">There were one or two criticisms to which I wish to reply. First of all, with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> criticism of Trust Funds, it seems to me very peculiar that, while the honorable senator condemned the Trust Fund for the Post and Telegraph Department, as such, he actually proposed that the whole of the Consolidated Revenue should be treated as one gigantic Trust Fund. He asked, for instance, why, after Parliament has voted a sum of money for a particular purpose, we should, at the end of each financial year, allow the vote to lapse, and have the money re-voted in the next year. That is exactly what a Trust Fund is intended to avoid. The Audit Act makes the lapsing and re-voting of appropriations necessary, and in the circumstances, the only way in which its provisions can be complied with, is to establish a Trust Fund and pay money into it until the purpose for which it was established is accomplished. </para>

                        <para>- There must be an annual balancing on the 30th of June in each year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger objects to large amounts of revenue being expended on these works, and prefers that they should be provided for under a system of debentures or a loan. I repeat, what I said before, that if in the earlier years of the Federation, when we had money to spare, a fair amount had each year been spent on the Post and Telegraph Department, we should not now need to ask for such huge sums. At present, I know of no reason why the Post and Telegraph Department should not continue to provide for capital expenditure out of revenue. Of course, there will arise works which we will not be able to finance out of revenue. When the time arrives for those works to be dealt with, the Government will not hesitate to adopt a loan policy, if the circumstances warrant it. I say that, for the works provided for in this Bill, a loan policy is not warranted. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asked that a reasonable time should be given honorable senators to discuss the Budget. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in laying the Budget-papers on the table of the Senate, undertook that a. reasonable time would be given for the discussion of the Budget; and I have no reason to doubt that he will keep that promise. I might say that, in this matter, honorable senators are in the same position as are honorable members in another place, where, because of the pressure of other business, it has been impossible to resume the discussion of the Budget. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> endeavoured to make a little capital out of a slight misunderstanding that arose in another place regarding a certain road at Maribyrnong, because one Minister was under the impression that it was a shire road, and the Government were proposing to make a grant in aid of its maintenance. That was a proposition put forward, but not finally adopted in the Estimates. The road for which money is provided in the Bill is entirely within Commonwealth property. It is not a road in the ordinary sense of the term. We are simply making a road from a landing we have on the Saltwater river to one portion of the Cordite Factory. It will not be open, or accessible to, the public ; and it is intended to make it possible to land material from the river, and take it up through the Cordite Factory on our own land. Referring to the Small Arms Factory, I wish to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers'</inline> criticism was not entirely fair. If he had read the parliamentary-paper to which I referred him, he would have seen that, during the time I was Minister of Defence in the first Fisher Government, I went into the matter exhaustively. It was a very difficult matter with which to deal at this end of the world, especially in view of the fact that we had no officers who had had any experience of small arms factories. But at the time we left office, it was open to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, if he thought PrattWhitney's tender was not a good one, or as good as the other, to accept the other tender. No tender had been finally accepted when we left office. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> will refer to page 4 of the parliamentary paper mentioned, he will find a foot-note to the following effect - </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to call attention to the item of £146 for a timber storage shed in New South Wales, and the item of£700 for a similar shed in Victoria. The former item includes  £46  for a re-vote, and  £100  for new service, while the latter item includes  £156  for a re- vote, and  £544  for new service. I desire to ascertain the present position regarding the storage and seasoning of timber. A few years ago it was decided to initiate a system of storing timbers for use in Commonwealth works, and a substantial sum was voted on the Estimates for acquiring, during the financial year, a quantity of timber representative of the descriptions available in the forests of the different States. It was proposed to store the timber and season it in a way which private firms could not be expected to do, so that its capabilities would be demonstrated to the utmost. It was anticipated that, by pursuing this policy, we would have in our public works evidence of the suitability of our timber for different purposes in the future. The vote to which I refer does not seem to have been availed of by the Government to the full extent, or, indeed, to any large extent. I should like the Minister to state the purpose for which the items on these Estimates are required, to what extent the policy laid down in a previous session has been followed, and with what measure of success so far. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to know whether any attention has yet been directed to the State which supplies, I suppose, the best class of hard-wood to be found in the Commonwealth. 1 do not know whether a fair quantity of the jarrah of Western Australia has been stored for the purpose of being used in connexion with the public works ot the Commonwealth. It is about time, I think, that the Commonwealth obtained from Queensland or Western Australia, or perhaps from New South Wales, a piece of timber country, from which it could draw whatever supplies of timber it needed for public purposes. Owing to the increased cost of the timber required by the Government of Western Australia, they have had to take up a piece of country, and set up machinery, in order to obtain cheaper timber than they could get through the employment of private contractors. The time has arrived, I think, when the Commonwealth might well follow that example. Both in Queensland and in Western Australia there are areas of timber country where timber could be obtained at first cost, and so avoid the payment of the high prices which are at present charged. We have a number of commitments, and, consequently, the prospect of a very large quantity of timber being required in the near future. In my opinion, it is foolish to depend upon contractors to supply this article. I suggest to the Government the necessity of not only collecting every timber which is of proved quality, but also obtaining from some of the States large timber areas, in order to supply the needs of the Commonwealth in hard woods or soft woods, or even in both. That necessity has been forced upon at least one State Government, and there is no reason why the Commonwealth should depend any longer upon private contractors for its supply of timbers, when it could effect a great saving by acquiring a sufficient area of timbered country. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was Minister of Home Affairs he found some difficulty in getting supplies of seasoned timber for his Department, and initiated the policy of storing timber to be seasoned. Pursuant to that policy, last year two sums of  £700  each were voted for New South Wales and Victoria, for the purpose of erecting sheds in which timber could be stored. In this Bill we are asked to vote  £146  and  £700  respectively to complete the sheds. In the case of Victoria, an extension of the original plan was found necessary; and that accounts for the Committee being asked to vote, for new service in Victoria,  £544,  as against  £100  under the heading of New South Wales. The Departments are thoroughly satisfied with the results which have been gained by the adoption of this policy; so much so, that there is stored on the Federal Capital site£5,000 worth of timber, which has been purchased, and which is to be added to from time to time. I hardly think, however, that the time has arrived for the Commonwealth to adopt the ambitious proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> Certainly in the Federal Capital Territory, or in the Northern Territory, we may do something in that direction. I agree with my honorable friend as to the necessity for obtaining cheaper timber for public purposes ; but I think that it is a matter which comes within the activities of the State Parliaments rather than of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - Referring to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> that the Government should secure timber reserves in Australia, I would like to say that, in Papua the Commonwealth has any quantity of first class timbers of every description. During our recent visit we saw hard woods and soft woods ready to be taken away. We were told that the ring of timber merchants in Sydney and Melbourne made it impossible for any person to cut the timber and send it down to Sydney. One resident offered Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company a full cargo for Sydney; but the firm would not accept the offer because of the difficulty of placing the timber on the market in Australia. Difficulty was placed in the way of storing timber in Sydney and selling it. If the Commonwealth Government were to get their supplies of timber from Papua, they would not only supply their own wants, but also open up splendid country. If the time for adopting this policy is not ripe, as the Minister says, I do not think it is very far from that stage. I hope that the matter will be taken in hand On my return from. Papua I suggested to the Minister of External Affairs that the Government should experiment with its woods in the manufacture of gun stocks in the factory at Lithgow. I do not know whether they intend to carry out my suggestion, but I honestly believe that Papua can provide timbers which are fit for that purpose; in fact, for almost anything. </para>

This vote is required to pay the cost of preparing plans and deeds, should those negotiations be successful. In another place, the Prime Minister gave an undertaking, which I now repeat, that before the Commonwealth is committed to any definite sum Parliament will be taken into the confidence of the Government and asked to approve of the site selected. </para>

It is some time ago - I do not like to think how long - since we determined the site of the permanent Seat of Government, and if my memory serves me accurately, we have on more than one occasion voted money for works in connexion with that site. I wish to ask the Government when they anticipate we shall get to the Federal Capital? To vote money in this fashion year after year is either a political intrigue or more or less of a political farce. </para>

                        <para>- I am not accusing any honorable senator of being a political intriguer. But the whole thing seems to be a sort of political farce. This Parliament is committed to the Federal Capital site at Canberra. It has entered into a compact with the New South Wales Government, and the money which has already been expended upon that site would not have been voted but for the idea that we were to establish ourselves there as soon as possible. Honorable senators who hail from Queensland, which is the most distant State, are the most disinterested in this matter. Seeing that the buildings at the Federal Capital site are under the control of the most brilliant genius on earth, he ought surely to be able to inform his colleagues of the approximate date when we may expect to get to the future Seat of Government. </para>

The vote is mounting up year by year, but it does not appear to me that the Government axe determined that the Seat of Government shall be removed within a measurable distance of time. When Parliament selected Yass-Canberra, that choice was made with the idea that we should soon be able to sit in the Capital city. But we know what has been going on in the meantime. Neither Sydney nor Melbourne has yet abandoned the hope that the' Federal Capital may be permanently located in one or other of those cities. Pressure is being brought to bear through the newspapers and other public channels with a view of securing a reconsideration of the question. Owing to political wire-pulling, the whole matter may be reopened. If that is to he done, let us know at once. I do not know that there is a subject more likely to give rise to political intrigue - for which the Government are largely responsible - than this. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope to be able to satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, who seems to be thirsting for information concerning  the Federal Capital. I do not think the honorable senator can fairly say, however many sins he may lay to the charge of the present Government, that we have adopted other than a straightforward course in connexion with this question. Any one who looks back over the history of the Federal Capital contest must, if he does us justice, admit that we have gone straight concerning it. As to when the Federal Parliament will be able to sit at Yass-Canberra, that event must, of course, be a few years ahead. There  13  a method by which we could sit there within twelve months - namely, by erecting temporary buildings and offices. But that would be a costly and unsatisfactory method of procedure. It would be costly in the sense that these temporary buildings would only be used while permanent buildings were in course of construction, and consequently the money spent upon them would be thrown away. It would be costly in another sense, because wherever the temporary buildings were put they would in all probability interfere with the carrying out of the plans for the erection of the permanent Capital. The Department of Home Affairs has proceeded about this business in an orderly fashion. During the past year the Department has been engaged in the preparation of projects, and in the execution of many necessary works. If we are to have a city worthy of the name, we must necessarily lay our plans carefully. Accordingly, competition has been invited, as a result of which we hope to get the aid of some of the best minds in the world to assist us in laying out the city. In the meantime, a considerable proportion of the present vote is to enable preparations to be made for the erection of the necessary public buildings whenever the laid out city is completed. The money is also for the purpose of making tunnels for a proper sewerage system, because it is the intention of the Government, acting upon expert advice,_ to lay down a sewerage system forthwith, so that we may not be compelled to rip up the streets after the city has been built. I have before me a list of the works in contemplation, showing what is proposed to be spent. </para>

                <para>The foregoing is for works only; it does not include lands, surveys, or other administrative expenditure. </para>
                <para class="block">The works that will be gone on with include roads, timber storage, power plant, water supply, gauging of the Cotter, Molonglo, and Queanbeyan Rivers, brickworks, Observatory, Administration offices, and a bridge over the Molonglo River. I have a statement here setting out in detail all that is to be done in connexion with these various items, but it is unnecessary that I should read it to honorable senators. From what I have said it will be seen that the Government are in earnest in their desire to press on with the building of the Federal Capital. To spend money on actual buildings, until we have the plans of the city before us, would be to put the cart before the horse. We are doing, and propose to continue to do, all essential preparatory work in order that necessary materials may be available when we are ready to begin the actual building of the city. </para>

                    <para>. - There is one aspect of this question to which I again desire to direct attention. I personally accepted the Minister'sstatement with a good deal of pleasure, but I point out that we are making appropriations for the building of a city upon land which, at present, we do not own. I previously, directed attention to this very anomalous position. Surely, the first thing we ought to do is to devise a scheme for the resumption of such land as we intend to acquire ? It was always understood in the early days of the discussion of this matter that in the Federal Territory there was to be but one landlord - the Commonwealth. Have we all abandoned that idea? </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> speaking evidently with authority, says that that idea has not been abandoned, and, if so, is it not time an attempt was made to realize it? Are we to wait, perhaps, for two or three years more before we resume the land we require, and, in the meantime, construct sewerage works, and spend the considerable sums to which the Minister of Defence referred, on other people's property? I suggest that the Government should immediately attempt to grapple with this problem. They should adopt what might be regarded as a bold policy of land resumption, unless it is intended that we should drift into the position we see around us in all the capital cities of the States. The Government should determine the area to be acquired for the city, and as much more as they think the Commonwealth should have ownership rights over. That will probably involve a very considerable financial undertaking. The land is there, and is going to be given an added value-. I have no hesitation in saying that if the matter is properly handled we can, from the incremental value which will be given to the land, obtain a sum which will go a long way towards the building of the city itself. </para>

                        <para>- I think I speak with moderation when I say that in any big city in the world, it would be possible to form a syndicate that would be only too glad to take this job off the hands of the Commonwealth Government, if it were given the same opportunities of profiting from the increment of value which will be added to the land on which the Federal Capital is to be built. The question arises, how are the resumptions to be carried out? At present, the innocent and modest resumptions which are being effected are carried out by officials of the Home Affairs Department, acting under Ministerial authority, but no one will contend that the best way in which to carry out the resumption of big areas of land involving an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds is by private bargaining in anybody's office. The undertaking is too big for anything of that kind, and I suggest for the consideration of the Government the creation of some tribunal to which, in the light of day, the owners of land which we shall require to resume will be able to present their claims, as is done in the case of Land Boards in at least two of the States. Before such a tribunal every matter could be inquired into, and evidence given by the owners of the land and experts of the Commonwealth Department. </para>

                        <para>- I am looking for a much more simple procedure. The best illustration I can give the Minister of what I desire is the appointment of such a Board as is now in operation in New South Wales, where estates are resumed for closer settlement. These matters are referred to an open tribunal specially constituted to determine the value of the estates in question. In the Federal Territory we shall be dealing with a much larger area, embracing the estates of several individuals, and we should afford every opportunity to the owners to make good their claims, and the departmental officials to present their views as to the fair value of the land to be resumed. If these resumptions on an enormous scale were carried out in the way I suggest, they would be entirely free from any possibility of suspicion, and it would be in the interest of the Government, and of the' owners of the land, to deal with them in that way. Another matter in connexion with this seems to me to call very loudly for prompt action. In the Act we passed dealing with the Federal Capital a provision was inserted that land resumed should be acquired on a basis of its value in 1908. When are these resumptions to take place? Every year they are delayed will make it only more and more difficult to demonstrate the value of the land in 1908. I have no doubt that since the passing of the Act to which I refer in the Federal Territory and outside of it, there has been a considerable advance in land values. The owners of land will probably not be very particular about the date at which the increment of value accrues. How will the Commonwealth Department prove the value in 1908, especially if the resumptions are to be delayed for another four or five years? I am advancing this as a business reason why we should carry out the resumptions as early as possible. Another argument might fairly be advanced in this connexion. Is it quite fair to the owners of these lands to place them in such a position? They will be told the Government intend to take their lands. They will not be told when, but that when they are taken it will be at their value a long period since. These people should be told that their land is to be resumed or that it is not. It is unfair to them that they should be left between Heaven and earth, unable to sell or do anything with their land, doubtful if they will improve them, and in considerable doubt as to what they will receive for them if they are resumed. I am sure the Minister of Defence will admit that it is a business proposition that the Government "should, at an early date, determine the area to be resumed and the policy of resumption. In fairness to the land-owners concerned, the intention of the Act to which I have referred should be given effect, or it should be amended. </para>

                        <para>- I heard the honorable senator's explanation, but it seems strange to me that timber is to be stored only in New South Wales and Victoria. The Government will require a lot of timber in the other States. I believe that Queensland possesses the best supply of pine and other timbers, and supplies a great deal of timber to Victoria and New South Wales. We might, in the circumstances, reasonably expect that some provision will be made for the storage of timber in that State. There is a lapsed vote for Victoria of£156, and a new vote of £554, making a total of  £700.  For New South Wales there is a lapsed vote of £46, and a new vote of£100. That will not put up much of a shed for the storage of timber. </para>

                        <para>- When the Minister is asked for information he can refer to the departmental officers behind him, but we are not all in that happy position. We have to hunt up the information for ourselves. In view of the fact that Queensland supplies New South Wales and Victoria with a very large quantity of pine, cedar, and other timbers, I would like to know why the Government propose to make no provision for storage sheds for the seasoning of timbers in that State. With regard to the vote for the Federal Capital, I was one of those who voted for the selection of Yass-Canberra as a site, but I never imagined for a moment that the scheme would be allowed to hang so long in the stays before anything was done. We are told that money is wanted. Of the sum which was voted for this purpose last year£33,957 was not spent, and has to be re-voted, and, in addition, we are asked to vote  £66,043.  I want to know why the. Government ask us to vote large sums which the Department knows it cannot spend within the financial year. We have heard that these Estimates have to be passed in order to allow the works to be proceeded with; but in this schedule, we are asked to re-vote about  £250,000,  which was voted on the last Estimates for various purposes. That is not a businesslike method of procedure. </para>

                        <para>- No. What I mean is that the Department ought to know whether it will need  £60,000  or  £100,000  for the year. The plans in connexion with the Federal Capital are not returnable until next January. The Minister of Home Affairs has stated that the Department is going to get the benefit of the best talent in the world. I do not know whether it is true or not, but I have read in the press that eminent architects in America, Great Britain, and Australia have refused to submit plans to persons whom they believe to be incompetent to express an opinion on them. </para>

                        <para>- Because it will be necessary to call for fresh tenders. In other words, we shall be in exactly the same position then as we were in twelve months before. I feel satisfied that, by the end of next year, no plans will bie adopted. The business will be strung out as long as possible. Whatever influence is at work I do not know, but my impression is that there is no real intention to proceed. Otherwise the Government would have appointed well-known architects to select the best plan. In nearly every instance where plans are invited the Minister does not select the best plan, but calls in experts, who decide upon the person who should receive the prize offered. In this instance, however, the Minister is to decide. Suppose that plans are returned by next January. In what position shall we be? The Commonwealth will not have acquired the land for laying out a city. Surely we cannot enter upon private land before it is purchased and lay out a city. </para>

It is not intended to deal with the plans, or to spend the money which we are asked to vote, and next year another re- vote will be proposed, or, perhaps, the Government may decide to pass money into a trust fund until they have accumulated a sufficient amount to spend. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see why we should be asked to vote sums which it is not intended to spend. Of the amount which was voted last year, how much did the Government spend? As nearly as I can make out, they spent between  £60,000  and  £80,000.  We are also asked to vote  £22,500  towards the cost of constructing a transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. Is it usual for the Government to ask Parliament to vote money for the construction of a railway before plans and specifications have been prepared and submitted? I have seen a good many railway proposals submitted, but the plans and specifications were always laid upon the table by the Government before a vote for construction was asked. This vote of  £22,500  is required, not for the preparation of plans and specifications for the proposed railway, but towards its construction. Is the Senate prepared to vote the money without caring whether plans and specifications, or estimates of cost, are submitted? Apparently it is prepared to vote the money " on the blind." </para>

                        <para>- We have passed a Bill to survey the route of a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie; but I have not seen any estimate of the cost of construction. I have heard various sums mentioned as likely to be required, but I have not seen any plans and specifications, or any estimate of the cost. It is not disclosed in these Estimates whether the rail way is to be built on any plan, or what is the gauge on which it is to be constructed. Why should we be asked to vote  £22,500  unless the Government are prepared to submit plans and specifications and an estimate of the cost, and seek parliamentary authority to construct the line? I have never known the construction of a railway to be initiated in this manner, although I have seen twenty or thirty railway proposals put through Parliament. No other Parliament would agree to vote  a  sum towards the construction of a railway, no matter what the amount was, in the circumstances which I have pointed out. Here we are asked to re-vote £3,526 and to vote  £18,974,  making a total of  £22,500,  without one tittle of a plan or any estimate of cost being submitted We have had brought before our notice various imaginary estimates; but these have been reduced or increased. One engineer has said that the line will cost  £4,000,000;  another engineer has estimated the cost at £3,700,000; in fact, various sums have been mentioned in this way. Surely before the Government ask the representatives of the people to vote this money they should submit for our approval plans and specifications of the proposed railway. They have adopted a most extraordinary method of procedure. The Senate seems to me to be satisfied to pass the item without any information as regards total cost, or without any reference to plans and specifications. The line may involve an expenditure of  £4,000,000,  or  £5,000,000,  or  £6,000,000.  At the present moment the Minister cannot give us any idea, either as to the plans and specifications, or as to the total cost of the work. All that he has in his possession are the estimates of some engineers which vary. There are no plans to show how much the railway will cost per mile, or how much each section will cost. In short, we are asked to tax the people to build a line without a tittle of proper information. I do not suppose that anything I could say would affect the decision of the Committee. It seems that any proposal which the Government may submit, whether wise or foolish, is sure to pass. I, for one, enter a protest against this money being voted in the absence of plans and specifications of the proposed railway. </para>

                    <para>. - The item in question covers buildings and machinery supplied by the Department of Home Affairs, but not the machinery supplied by Pratt and Whitney. The machinery for the making of rifles is the subject of a contract entered into by the Defence Department. I presume that the amount to which the honorable senator has directed attention will represent the final payment on account of the machinery supplied by the Department of Home Affairs. </para>

                        <para>- There is an item under the heading of "New Special Defence Provision," which reads "Small Arms Factory, £6,000." There was also an appropriation last year of £11,800 in this connexion, and an expenditure of £11,933. That amount was expended by the Defence Department. It is separate from the expenditure upon machinery to be supplied by Pratt and Whitney, although it is contingent on that supply. This amount must, therefore, be added to the sum to which I previously referred. </para>

I understand that, outside the post-office at Croydon, a suburb of Sydney, the Department is erecting an iron letter receiving-box. Surely that is a waste of money. But I believe that this is not an isolated instance. It seems extravagant expenditure, because receiving-boxes are not necessary in such situations. </para>

                    <para>. - I observe that in various parts of the Commonwealth there are post-offices bearing the same name. For instance, there is more than one Woodstock Post-office. There is also a Croydon in New South Wales, in Queensland, and in Victoria. This duplication of names frequently leads to difficulty. Some time ago, I sent a telegram to Bowen. For the last forty years, there has been a large and important post-office at Bowen, Queensland, which is the receiving station for the New Caledonia Cable. I did not know, however, that there was another Bowen in Victoria, and my telegram was sent to the wrong place. I afterwards found that I ought to have put the word " Queensland " upon the address. I am afraid that letters and telegrams often go astray through such a duplication; and I think the Government should, as far as possible, put an end to it. I am not blaming the Department for the error that occurred in 'connexion with my own telegram ; but I hope that the Minister will bring the confusion under the notice of the Postmaster-General, and see whether means cannot be devised for avoiding it. </para>

But, of course, the Commonwealth Government cannot change the names of places at its own sweet will. We have power to alter the names of post-offices ; but it would never do to alter the name of a Post-office without altering the name of the place where the office was situated. Whenever the Department can induce local people to change a name in order to avoid duplication, that is done. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to South Australia. I see references here to Balaclava, Bordertown, Caltowie and Crystal Brook. I was delighted when I saw these votes. We have heard of people stating that the farmers' interests are being entirely ignored by this Socialistic Government, and when I saw this list my heart leapt with joy. Honorable members opposite seize, with pleasure, every opportunity to denounce the Government, and I think it is right, when the opportunity offers, to do the opposite thing, and give the Government credit when credit is due to them. As a farmers' representative, although belonging to the Labour party, I am delighted to find that the Government have done this. I am sure that the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was a member, never did anything of the sort. </para>

                    <para>. - On the second reading of the Bill I drew attention to the fact that there is no vote proposed for the establishment of wireless communication between either Cooktown or Thursday Island and Papua. It is more than a year since I had to interview the Department about the matter, and I was then assured that the work would be proceeded with at once. I am unable to congratulate the Government in this matter. During the last eighteen months there has been urgent need for wireless communication between North Queensland and Papua. Not long ago the Administrator of the Territory was lost, and we were all very anxious to know what had become of him.We could get news from Papua only by steamer, or steam launch. We know that wrecks sometimes take place on the Barrier Reef, and, as many vessels are now fitted with wireless telegraphy, it might be possible to save many lives in case of a marine disaster if there were some place on the coast of North Queensland with which vessels could communicate. Though a promise was made to me last year that the work to which I refer would be proceeded with, nothing has yet been done. I hope it will not be hung up as the establishment of the Federal Capital has been. I have constant inquiries from people in the north as to when the Government intends to proceed with the work, and I hope the Minister will be able to inform the Committee that it is the intention of the Government to do so very shortly. </para>

                    <para>- - Last year it was understood that a wireless station was to be erected at Thursday Island or Cooktown, to provide communication with a station to be erected in Papua. For military reasons it was subsequently decided that the Queensland station should be established at Thursday Island. Surely it should not take twelve months to put up a wireless station at Thursday Island when vessels can leave Australia for the Old Country and in three weeks be fitted with wireless telegraphic apparatus. We are now told that an expert has been procured to select sites. </para>

A separate vote is provided for the stations at Pennant Hills and Fremantle, but there is no separate vote for a station at Thursday Island or Papua.

                        <para>. - We have heard from time to time a great deal of what a Government can do as compared with private enterprise, but private enterprise has established several wireless stations in Australia since the Government promised the establishment of a station at Thursday Island. The stations established by private enterprise may not be as well equipped as those at Pennant Hills and Fremantle, but they are powerful enough to do the work we require to have done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> now informs us that the wireless telegraphy expert has been engaged in a controversy with the Marconi company, and, reading between the lines, it may be suggested that he would favour the adoption of a particular system. We shall not prejudge him, however, and will assume that he has an open mind on the subject. But I would impress upon the Government that they have the money, and should not allow private persons to act in advance of themselves, and put up wireless stations. The people on Thursday Island look to the Government to undertake this work. A promise was made that it would be proceeded with, but it has not been kept. I believe that the Government could have done the work if they had so wished. What has been the cause of the delay I do not know, but to-morrow I shall have to tell the people of Thursday Island that, although private persons have been able to erect wireless stations within the year, the Government have, for some reason or other, been unable to do so. </para>

He has asked whether the Government would be guided by that gentleman in respect to methods. Undoubtedly the Government will be very largely guided by his recommendations. That is the reason -why he was appointed. With regard to any law points which may arise, the Government have their own officers. </para>

                        <para>- Questions of law have arisen in regard to wireless telegraphy and the systems in operation in different parts of the world. In reference to methods, location, and power of the stations, the Government will be guided largely and mainly by their expert; but as to any matters of law which may arise from time to time, the Government will consult their own officers. </para>

                    <para>. - It was not a question of law which was raised, but a question of whether, when the Government seek expert advice, they will obtain that advice from one who is quite free from prejudice. I ask the Committee whether a gentleman who has been engaged in a lawsuit with the Marconi Company is quite the disinterested person whose advice the Government should seek when the claims of that company are being weighed in the balance against those of a rival company? That is putting the position I hope with sufficient definiteness. To bring in the question of law points is likely to obscure the issue. It is quite evident that this gentleman is not an expert lawyer in the matter, or he would not have been defeated in the case in which he was interested. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with the question of patent rights, but with the question of calling in an expert to show which system is the better one. The position is that the Government are calling in to advise them as to which of two systems is the better a man to judge against his successful competitor. I shall be quite willing to retract any statement I have made if I find that I have acted upon wrong or insufficient information, but 1 understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balsillie</inline> was interested in a company, and I think that he also claimed some patentee's rights. At any rate, he was involved in a lawsuit with the Marconi Company, and the latter triumphed ; and now he is called in by the Government of the Commonwealth to sit in judgment on his successful rival - not in a lawsuit, but in the world of invention - and to say whether he regards his rival's system, or some other system, as the superior one. There is only one man in a thousand who can quite shake off the prejudices which such an experience is likely to create. We are all human; even wireless experts are human. I feel that I have not exceeded my duty in directing attention to what, to my mind, is unquestionably  a weakness in the officer who has been chosen for this particular work. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to ask the Minister a question, and I do not want any one to think that I am moved by a feeling of jealousy. I am merely seeking information. I direct attention to the very great discrepancy in the votes asked under the heads of New South Wales and Victoria for " metallic circuits in existing single wire networks," namely, £16,900 and £126,500. I take it that it is intended to adopt the metallic circuit pretty generally. I take no exception to the amount required for the improvement of the Victorian system', but it would seem to me to suggest either that they are very much behindhand in New South Wales, or that for some reason it is not intended to carry out the work there as expeditiously as in Victoria. There is such a marked discrepancy between the two votes that it arrested my attention at once, and I would like the Minister to explain the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - Much of the tunnelling work which is being done in Melbourne, and which has been done during the last few months, was done in Sydney years ago - I believe before Federation - at a cost of many thousands of pounds. The amount which is asked for the work in Melbourne is much larger than the amount required for the work which is being carried on in Sydney. The tunnelling work which was done in the latter city anterior to Federation saved such a considerable sum to the Department that it explains the disparity between the two votes on these Estimates. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to ask for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, of South Australia, whether the items under the head of that State, on page 29, are proposed in connexion with farming districts, or where it is proposed to spend the total vote of £[53,400 for telegraphs and telephones? I do so because, in all friendliness to the Government, I warn them that if it is expected that the various sums are to be spent outside some hay-sheds, they are likely to have serious trouble. </para>

                    <para>. - Although Brisbane is a fairly large city, only £2,000 is proposed for metallic circuits in existing single wire networks. It seems wonderful that while £2,000 will meet the requirements there, £126,500 is required for Melbourne, and £16,900 for Sydney. I think that Brisbane is pretty well on the same footing as Sydney, but only £2,000 is to be voted. </para>

                        <para>- That is hardly fair. I know that in Adelaide the wires are all overhead, and that much tunnelling has not been done, as in Sydney. Adelaide is pretty much in the same state as is Melbourne. Yet, for the latter city, £126,500 has been voted, and only a vote of £2,000 is proposed for Brisbane. There must be some explanation for this marked disparity between the amounts, and I hope that the Minister can give me some information. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that there is some arrangement for the mutual use of the machines. At the same time, it almost seems to me that we are reaching a period when some other arrangement will have to be made. I cannot conceive that the present arrangement can continue to be satisfactory. The mere installation of plant costs money. If we decide to erect a printing office, the plant will have to be dismantled, and transferred to another place. If we are going to have our printing work done by another office, let us take it to an office which has a plant capable of doing it. It seems to me that we may well consider whether we should be better served if we equipped an office of our own. </para>

They are quite good enough for use for the training of the Naval Reserve. Of course, we recognise that their guns are obsolete. They are not fighting ships of a modern type. But we are putting an up-to-date gun on each of them, so that they will be quite good enough for training the Naval Reserve. The amount which we propose to spend for that purpose does not represent one-tenth of the cost of a second class protected cruiser if we had to buy one for training purposes. As these vessels can enter all our coastal ports, pick up youths there, and give them their training, they will perform a useful work. </para>

                    (New South Wales) £10.4]. - I notice here a proposal in regard to the Northern Territory. Some accusations of extravagance in finance have been made against the Government; but when I look at the items which are grouped under the heading of " Northern Territory," I fail to see how any such charge can be justified. For instance, for " artesian water bores, also wells and dams on overland route on Macdonnell Ranges and Tanamai gold-fields, and opening up stock routes," the Government have screwed up their courage to ask for a vote of £2,000. This, it must be remembered, is in a country where labour is dear. I do not know what will be the cost of an artesian well in the Northern Territory; but I do know that when these wells were first put down in New South Wales and water was obtainable within a reasonable distance of the surface, £2,000 used to be regarded as a fair amount. Of course, I am aware that since then the operation of boring has been very much cheapened, but I venture to say that the average cost of an artesian well is £1,000. I do urge upon the Government that they should be a little more lavish in their efforts to open up the Northern Territory. Certainly, if they intend to develop that territory, they will have to proceed much more boldly than they propose to proceed in the light of these figures.

                        <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition has been somewhat facetious at the expense of the Government. But I do not think there is room for him to be facetious if he will look at the facts of the case. Up to the present the Government have not been authorized to spend a single penny in the Northern Territory. This vote, when it is agreed to, will empower us to incur expenditure there. But anybody who looks at the facts will recognise that very little money can be spent there before the close of the present financial year. However, when once the authority has been given to commence work there, it will probably be found that the vote upon next year's Estimates will be tenor twelve times the amount which appears upon these Estimates. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very glad to hear the explanation of the Minister, and I am also pleased to see that it is intended to spend money upon experimental farms. Seeing that we have a railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and also from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, I should think that the time has arrived for the establishment of a railway department, and the appointment of a railway commissioner. What are the intentions of the Government in this respect ? </para>

                    <para>. - I take it that the Minister considers that the Commonwealth is already losing enough upon the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, and that he does not desire to increase that loss. Turning again to the Northern Territory Estimates I think that, in regard to the item of  £8,000  for experimental farms, he should take steps to inform us of what the Government propose. I do not think that the Committee will grudge the expenditure of  £8,000  in this connexion, provided that the money be judiciously expended. I think that we ought to have some information as to what is to be done with this amount. I scarcely expect the Minister to give us a detailed statement to-night, but I do invite him to circulate, by memorandum, or otherwise, the information which is desired. I also observe that there is a vote of£2,000 for a horse-breeding establishment in the Northern Territory. Is that also an experimental farm, or is it an off-shoot of the horse-breeding scheme of the Defence Department ? If it be an experimental farm, it is not needed, because we had the assurance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> when the Northern Territory transfer was being dealt with - given with that solemnity which characterizes the honorable senator - that the country was especially well suited for horse breeding. If that be the case, we do not need to experiment to demonstrate an established fact. </para>

As to the  £2,000  for horse breeding, I have to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it has no reference to the scheme for breeding horses for military purposes. Neither is this an experimental horse-breeding farm. It is simply proposed to carry- on a horse-breeding establishment that already exists in connexion with the overland telegraph line. The station has been in existence for some years. It has been carried on by the South Australian Government; and we took it over in connexion with the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of simplifying accounts, expenditure which does not concern the Department incurring it, ought not to be charged against that Department. The Northern Territory is going to require, on its own account, every pound we can spare for it. I do not wish to see its accounts loaded up with services which are primarily for the benefit of other Departments. Let the Post and Telegraph Department carry its own sins and provide for its own expenditure. Here we have a vote charged against the Northern Territory for a service which is not for the benefit of the whole of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - The announcement of the Minister takes me by surprise. I understood that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was in the charge of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and that it would not be dealt with until he returned to Melbourne. Of course, the Government has a right to take business as it likes; but I submit that, unless there is a strong reason for the change, it is advisable to adhere to the understanding arrived at. The announcement was that the Electoral Bill would be proceeded with, in order that the other House might obtain possession of it, and an assurance was given to me that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would not be taken until the Vice-President of the Executive Council returned. I admit at once that the Bill has been upon the paper for some time; but all that I can find time to do is to keep myself posted in regard to business that I think is immediately ahead of me. I can only envy those who, more fortunate than I am, are able to master business that does not seem likely to be brought under consideration for some time. Quite a number of honorable senators, who are not here now, are under the impression that a certain order of business was to be pursued. Unless there is strong reason to the contrary, I ask the Minister to adhere to the arrangement originally made. </para>

                        <para>. - The Government have become impressed with, the necessity of proceeding with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as rapidly as possible. We do not wish to inconvenience anybody. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be in a position to proceed with the Bill to-morrow. The Vice President of the Executive Council will not be present ; but, before we get into Committee, he will probably be able to reply to any criticisms which may require an answer. I can assure the Senate that certain facts have come under our notice which have made it necessary that this Bill should be pressed forward. </para>
