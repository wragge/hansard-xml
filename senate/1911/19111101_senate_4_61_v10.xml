                        <para>The result of one election for Melbourne was in favour of a certain gentleman who died some time ago in the Old Country, but when the seat was again contested it was won by the previously unsuccessful candidate, mainly because of the undue influence exercised under the postal voting system at the first election. </para>
                        <para>At the first election a considerable number of votes were recorded by post, and at the second -election there was a very considerable diminution in the number of votes so recorded. </para>

                    <para>We have here speaking the responsible Minister in charge of this Bill, the object of which is to make a substantial alteration in our electoral system. We have a right to expect that when a Minister makes a statement of fact in a matter so easy of verification it shall be at least reasonably accurate. It is an obligation on every senator to make himself acquainted with the facts which he presents to the Senate, but that obligation is doubled when a Minister is speaking. I direct attention to the figures for the election, and I do not propose to do more than to quote from the official report presented by the Divisional Returning Officer for the electorate. On the first page of the report the following statement appears - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The postal votes also exceed those recorded on the last occasion by 168. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Here is a flat contradiction of the statement of the Minister, that the result of the election had been .turned from the success of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir M.</inline> McEacharn at the first election to the success of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> at the second by reason of the diminution in the number of postal votes recorded. The official figures show that there was an increase of 168 in the number. Let us go a little further into the figures, and also the report on the election, and we shall have no difficulty in seeing what was one material contributing factor to the totals shown in the two contests. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> scored 3,667 votes against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir M.</inline> McEacharn's 7,808 votes. Of the postal votes at this contest the latter received 603, and the former 197. I do not want any reference to the figures to confuse, or, at any rate, to cause the Senate or the Minister, or, I hope, persons outside these walls, to forget that on a simple matter, capable of being verified by reference to the records, the facts contradict what the Minister, in all solemnity, asked us to accept. </para>

The point I am pressing is that there is an obligation on every senator, and doubly so on a Minister, to verify a fact before he offers it for acceptance here. If the Minister wants to know what was the big determining factor at the election in question, and he will look further down the report, he will find, under the head of " Form Q, section 139," the following statement : - </para>

                        <para>This system of voting  appeared  to be abused, as the polling places were all in close proximity to each other, and it seems to me that the privilege -was never intended to apply to those electors living within easy access by tram or other means of rapid conveyance to the polling places for which they are enrolled.  I  do not think this privilege should be allowed to be used unless the elector is at least 3 miles distant from the booth for which he is enrolled. </para>

                    <para>Let me remind honorable senators that the very basis of our present system, when it was proposed here, was, that as we were to an extent making the method of voting lax, it was necessary to localize electors to the polling booth in the neighbourhood of which they lived. It was the only check which was offered, and it was stated that as a man would have to vote in his own locality, being known he would not be likely to attempt to impersonate. But here is a case where official attention was drawn to the fact that the facilities provided for another set of circumstances were being abused. Why? The Minister is looking for the reason why the decision of one month was altered in the next. Let him look into the number of. those who voted on " Q " forms at polling places other than their own, and he will get a key to an impression which at any rate determined the flow- of votes on that occasion. </para>
                    <para class="block">It does seem strange that the Minister, desiring only to insure the purity of our electoral methods, seeks to destroy the facilities accorded by postal voting, and at the same time is blind, deaf, and dumb regarding an abuse to which an official has drawn attention. </para>

                            <para>- It is curious that this officer did not draw attention to it, but did draw attention to the abnormal number of persons who voted at polling booths other than their own. Any one who is experienced in electoral matters must know that the great door through which fraud can enter is the absent voting provision. Yet, whilst attention' was directed here to the .great danger of allowing persons to vote outside their immediate neighbourhood, or allowing other persons to vote for them, Ministers are in no sense concerned about restricting, that facility; but they concentrate their attention upon postal voting, against which, hitherto, no official has reported. </para>

I should now like to deal with another argument on this point, brought forward bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> He seemed to regard it as an argument against postal voting that that system had been more largely used in Victoria, which is a thickly-settled State, than in States where settlement is more widely dispersed. That was one of the most extraordinary arguments I have ever listened to. </para>

                            <para>- So it is. The hardship is great in such cases. Honorable senators opposite seem to think that, in regard to postal voting, there is nothing else to do than simply drop a piece of. paper into the post. As a matter of fact, there is a great 'deal to do before that takes place. There were thousands of electors in the sparsely-settled portions of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, who could not get witnesses to sign their applications for postal votes. In Victoria, however,  it  was different. The very fact that this is a closely-settled State means that witnesses are more easily obtained than in the wide areas to which I have referred. </para>

                            <para>- Then it was no proof. Dealing with these figures as to Victoria again, I point out. that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline> argument was that, because postal voting was more largely used in Victoria than elsewhere, therefore the system was abused. But the voting by the ordinary method in Victoria was, in proportion to population, in excess of the voting in other States. Is that also a proof of abuse? Again, I point out that the reason for the heavier vote in Victoria is that facilities are greater in this State than elsewhere. Moreover, facilities for travelling in this State enable people to be better organized. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister of Defence may regard party organization with disfavour, if he chooses to do so; but we know perfectly well that the time has passed altogether when there can be an unorganized, and, at the same time, successful election. It is idle to attempt to deceive the people outside by pretending that superiority of organization is an argument against this system. The fact that there was a larger vote in Victoria was simply another proof that there was better organization, keener interest in the election, and greater facilities for recording votes. Turning again to the Melbourne election, to which reference has been made, I should like to make another comment upon the actual figures. Here, I venture to say, we. shall find the reason why this Bill has been introduced. On the occasion in question, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> polled  197  postal votes, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEachern polled  603.  There is the one simple reason which I can discover why the Government are seeking to abolish postal voting. </para>

                            <para>- That is the logic of the honorable senator's interjection - that we should abolish postal voting because a postal official acted corruptly. The honorable senator should also propose, then, the abolition of the ordinary method of voting, because occasionally corruption occurs in connexion with it. He should propose to abolish everything in connexion with which corruption may creep in. The answer to that is that, because some people act corruptly, either in connexion with postal voting, or anything else, that is no reason why we should abolish a useful system. Instead of abolishing postal voting, we should endeavour to stop up every loophole by which corruption can creep in. </para>

                            <para>- I do call it  a  slight error, because, after all, what is a disparity in regard to figures? At the first election to which reference has been made, the postal votes were  647.  At the second election they numbered  815.  The Leader of the Opposition evidently laid himself out for a vigorous attack upon me because of the statement I made. I made it in reply to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger. It was made on the spur of the moment. I was under the. impression at the time that a larger number of postal votes was recorded in the city of Melbourne  in  the first election than in the second election. But it is common knowledge that, in connexion with both of those elections, numbers of votes were recorded by post that ought to have been recorded in the usual way, because there was every facility for voting at the ballot-box in the electorate in question. But that is not the only reason, let me repeat, that moved the Government to propose the abolition of postal voting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> admits that it is true that there was a very much larger percentage of postal votes recorded in Victoria  than  in any other State. He gave as a reason for that the fact that Victoria is a smaller State. </para>

                            <para>- It is remarkable how honorable senators opposite jump about from one point to another. The main reason for the abolition of postal voting is not, as alleged, that it is harmful to members of the Labour party, and helpful to members of the Opposition party, but because the Government have set up a principle. Experience has- shown that for years the Labour party has advocated principles that have been unpopular; that for years they have been in a hopeless minority in regard to their advocacy, but that they have seen the minority turned into a majority in the course of time. It is because the Government believe, as a matter of principle, that no matter how many safeguards are placed around this system of postal voting, it can never give satisfaction to the Labour party or any other party, that they propose to abolish it. The main reason given by honorable senators opposite for the retention of the system is that it is a convenience to female electors at certain periods. </para>

                            <para>- Commercial travellers can vote under this Bill. A commercial traveller can record his vote at any polling-booth. A seaman can record an absent vote. Let us look at the argument with regard to depriving the female section of the community of voting facilities. This eleventh hour sympathy for suffering sisterhood on the part of honorable senators opposite can hardly be taken seriously. In my previous speech on this subject I quoted the number of votes recorded by post at the last election. The total was  29,249,  of which13,490 were the votes of males, and  15,759  of females. </para>

                            <para>- At that election excitement ran high. There was very much at stake. A great deal of expense was incurred to get people to vote. People voted by post who would not have voted at all at the ballot-box, and some who voted by post in a certain way would probably have voted another way had they gone to the poll. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> sought to show how seriously the abolition of postal voting would inconvenience womenfolk throughout Australia at certain periods. To obtain some idea of the number who would be affected, I have obtained some figures from which an inference can be drawn. In New South Wales in  1909  the number of births was  43,782.  On an average we may suppose that each woman was indisposed for four weeks during the year. </para>

                            <para>- Let us divide the total number by twelve. That gives  3,649  in any one month. That is the number of women who, if the estimate be reliable, would in a month be inconvenienced by the abolition of postal voting. But there are, as we know, many women who are able to move about a fortnight after maternity. On that basis of calculation the number who would be inconvenienced would be  1,684.  The number of postal votes cast by women in New South Wales at the last election was  3,325,  or less than the number who, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> would be physically incapacitated from recording a vote at all. </para>

Dividing that by twelve, assuming a woman in .a maternity case to be indisposed for a month, we should have a total of  2,628  who would be unable to vote. If we reckoned the time at a fortnight, the number would be  1,213,  yet at the last elections in Victoria  7,708  recorded their votes by post. The number of births was considerably less in Victoria- than in New South Wales ; the number of women who voted by post in the former State was considerably higher than the number who voted that way in the latter State. In Queensland, the number of births was  15,552,  allowing for a period of four weeks the number of women who would have been unable to vote in the ordinary way would have been  1,296;  allowing for a fortnight the number would have been  598. </para>

                            <para>- We shall not rob any one of the- vote. The number of postal votes recorded by women in Queensland at the last elections was  2,382.  In South Australia the number of births in  1909  was  10,091.  If women were indisposed for four weeks  841,  and if they were indisposed for a fortnight only  388  would have been unable to record their votes in the ordinary way, and yet  791  women voted by past. In Western Australia the number of births was  7,602.  If women were indisposed for a month  633,  and if for two weeks  292  would have been unable to vote in the ordinary way, and yet the number of postal votes cast by women was  850.  In Tasmania the number of births was  5,500;  assuming women to be indisposed for a month, there would have been  458,  and if for a fortnight  211  unable to vote, yet the number of postal votes recorded by women in Tasmania was  703.  Repeating again that the main argument against the proposed abolition of postal voting is that it will seriously inconvenience and, as a matter of fact, wholly disfranchise the women folk who may be in a certain condition, we find that the total number of postal votes recorded by women at the last elections was  15,759,  and the total number recorded by males  13,490.  Now, what was the matter with the males? </para>

                            <para>- I wish to know what is the point. I have been trying to ascertain the point which the Opposition have been endeavouring to make in their objection to the abolition of postal voting. One objection urged against it is that women in a certain condition of health will be disfranchised. Another is that aged and infirm men will be disfranchised. But it does not matter what figures are quoted in order to show that the number who will be disfranchised by the abolition of postal voting will be comparatively very small, nothing, apparently, will alter the view expressed by certain honorable senators of the Opposition that the Labour party desired the abolition of postal voting mainly or wholly because they believed that more postal votes would be recorded by post against members standing in their interests than would be recorded against those standing in the interests of the so-called Liberal party. Let me repeat again that no such motive moves the Government in their desire to bring about the abolition of the postal voting system. We believe it to be a bad system. </para>

                        <para>. - I have already received letters in connexion with this Bill from people residing  50  miles from any polling place so far established in Queensland. You, sir, must be quite aware that there are people on stations and in the bush, at places where there is no polling place within a reasonable distance, who should be considered. During the referenda campaign, in common with many others, I found it impossible to secure a ballot-paper. The supply of papers for the referenda, and even for the census, was so limited that thousands of people in North Queensland, in the hinterland of Cairns, were unable to return themselves, as resident in that State at all. I refer to this incidentally to show the difficulties which people in remote districts have in securing papers, even for such a purpose. How are these people to record their votes if the postal voting provisions are abolished ? </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that later on. I pledge my word for the truth of what I said. I could give the names of people who could not get census-papers to fill in, and I am certain that the difficulties at election time will be ten times greater. Census-papers were supposed to be delivered at every domicile, and all that people had to do was to fill them in. In many cases it was found impossible for people to obtain those papers, and I want to know how those people will be able to record their votes under this Bill. It will prevent them from voting at all. I suppose that no honorable senator would expect a woman to travel 40 or 50 miles to record a vote. The postal vote was introduced to enable people at a considerable distance from a polling place, or otherwise unable to vote in the ordinary way, to record their votes. Honorable senators opposite claim that, they are progressive, but I say that this is a retrograde movement. We have been told that the postal voting system has been abused, but we have been given no proof of the statement. I say that if there are abuses under the system we should try to do away with them, but we ought not to disfranchise people. If the Government intend to establish polling booths everywhere, so that no one will be likely to be disfranchised, I can find some excuse for the proposal. We have had merely statements as to any abuse of the postal voting provisions of the existing Act. . * . </para>

                            <para>- We could very easily safeguard the postal voting system. Before submitting a proposal _ to entirely abolish the system the Government should have proposed means to safeguard it from abuse, if abuse exists in connexion with it. Honorable senators have complained that men and women have been induced to vote by post so that it might be known how they voted. I have witnessed a few postal votes, but I never knew how the people voted. </para>

                            <para>- If abuse has crept in under the "system we might provide that the postal vote should not be used unless the voter is at a certain distance from a polling booth. We might require the elector to sign a declaration to prove his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> and impose as severe a penalty as honorable, senators please upon the signing of a false declaration. I cannot for the life of me understand why this proposal is made. It is common rumour that it is because . it does not suit honorable senators on the other side. That is public talk even amongst Labour sympathizers. It is claimed that they have lost a certain number of votes, but that the other side will lose more if the system is abolished. I do not say that that statement is true. We hear of many strange things done at elections. We are told that men and women have been induced to vote by post in order that interested individuals might know how they voted. I have been mixed up in politics for a good many years, and have never known that to be done. </para>

                            <para>- I think that a man would require even greater hardihood than the honorable senator who has interjected to ask an elector to vote by post, so that he might know how he voted. I have too high an opinion of the men and women of Australia to believe that they could be cowed into voting in order to suit any one. When I hear such things said from the other side I feel that those who make use of such statements belittle the manhood and womanhood of Australia. We are told that after elections people are punished in all sorts of ways because of the votes they gave. I have said to those who have made such complaints to me that unless they spread the truth about themselves no one could know how they voted. I do not believe that anyone would ask the electors of Australia to vote by post in order to find out how they voted. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say it is impossible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> might have more hardihood than I have; but if I asked a person to vote by post in order that I might learn how he voted I would probably receive an answer that would make me look very small. If the honorable gentleman came to me and asked me how I was going to vote, or to vote by ballot in such a way that he would know for whom I had voted, I know the answer he would get; and I believe honestly that both the men and women of Australia are as independent as I am. </para>

                            <para>- That is another old gag. No man's living depends upon his answer. I ask the honorable senator, supposing a man on the West Coast of Tasmania voted for the Labour party, would he be dismissed ? If he were there would be a strike immediately. The same thing applies to Sydney, Newcastle, Charters Towers, or any other part of Australia. I know that men are not hounded down because they vote for the Labour party, the Liberal party, or any other party. It is about time that gag was dropped. I know the people of Australia are independent enough. I have heard the same old story after every election for the last twenty-five years. At one time, if any person had known of such a thing in my own district it would have been myself. </para>

                            <para>- I am not talking about Glassey's committee. Before the Bill is read a second time, I want to know from the Government whether they are going to take any steps to provide facilities for people at a distance from polling places to vote. Will they give the Senate and the country any assurance that people who reside 20, 30, 40, or 50 miles distant from polling-booths will have some means of getting their votes recorded, without having to travel such a distance? I am certain that no honorable member on the Ministerial side of the Chamber would expect a woman, or a man who was not in good health, or who was crippled, to travel such a distance to vote. If the Bill passes without amendment, such people must be disfranchised ; and I want the Government to tell me what they are going to do to enable those people to vote. I will be satisfied if they tell me that, and if they will agree to accept an amendment -let it be guarded by all the machinery that they can bring in - which will give that class of people an opportunity of voting. I do not think the Ministry would like it to go forth to the country that, because people happen to live a long distance from a polling booth, they are not to be allowed to vote. The people I am referring to are practically our pioneers away in the bush. Honorable senators must remember that Queensland is not a small State like Victoria. Queensland is as large as New South Wales, Victoria and ten Tasmanias combined, There are thousands of people in Queensland who are not within reach of a polling booth, and it does not meet the case for the Government to say, " We will give people facilities to vote where there is a polling booth." The same thing applies to New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia as applies to Queensland, though it may be to a lesser extent. I am speaking of the State I know, and I say that, unless the Government bring in some provision which will give settlers who are far removed from any polling booth facilities to record their votes, they will inflict a great hardship on the very class of people we want. We are always crying out about putting people on the land. We put them oil farms, sheep stations, or small selections, and yet we are going to disfranchise them. </para>

I would make it easier to get a postal vote, under strict regulations; but the honorable senator is going to do away even with the facilities which people have at present to vote by post. If there is a justice of the peace or a schoolmaster in a district, he can witness the papers, and the residents can vote by post. Under the proposal in the Bill, no matter whether there is a schoolmaster or a justice of the peace in a district, the people will not be able to get postal votes </para>

                        <para>- I did not intend to speak on this Bill ; but, as a matter has been mentioned in the debate with which I am perfectly well acquainted, and in connexion with which I took a very active part, I cannot allow the occasion to pass without giving my reasons for objecting to postal voting. I have been a magistrate for some nineteen years, and during that period I have been called upon, in the exercise of my duty, to witness a very large number of postal ballot-papers. The Leader of the Opposition quoted the case of the McEacharn election petition. That was the election in the Melbourne electorate. I had nothing to do with the first election for that seat, but in connexion with the second election, I was the honorary secretary of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney's</inline> committee. All the matters connected with that election therefore came under my purview. There was great activity displayed on both sides in the desire to secure the seat, but the activity on one side was counterbalanced by the activity on the other. There were certain honorary magistrates who went round to the various houses in Lonsdale-street, and Little Lonsdale-street, and the lanes in the vicinity to induce the women of easy virtue to apply for postal votes. These were not women for whom the postal voting provisions were intended. They were not about to be confined, nor were they sick and incapable of attending the poll on the day of the election. They were persons who were healthy and quite capable of going to the polling booths. I myself attended on one occasion and witnessed a signature, for which I was afterwards brought up, and fined <inline font-style="italic">Â£10.</inline> In that case a woman desired a postal vote. She was an invalid, and when I attended at her house, I was assured by her daughter that the woman wanted some assistance. I said, "What is the assistance required?" and I was told that it was to steady the woman's hand. I said to the daughter, "Very well; hold your mother's hand if you desire to do so, and help her to make her signature." The daughter did so. It was afterwards found that the mother could neither read nor write. The magistrates who had issued the applications for the postal votes had signed blanks, and they were taken out, and' distributed. The name of that woman was forged. When the two applications for postal votes came before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> the electoral officer dealing with the matter, he found variations in the signatures, and he took the necessary steps to bring me, and the other man, before the magistrates. We have an honorable senator asking where corruption takes place, and saying that to ask a person for whom he is going to vote would merit condign punishment- </para>

                            <para>- I am only mentioning those cases I know of. Honorable senators opposite are very virtuous. They say that nothing of this kind is possible. They are perfectly oblivious of anything of the kind of which I have spoken. The Arcadian simplicity of it strikes me as evidence that they must know that it takes place. In one case I know of, a woman was induced to apply for a postal vote. She did so, and got it. A magistrate went to her house, and said to her, " Have you got your postal ballot-paper ?" She replied that she had. He said, " Show it to me. I will fix it up for you." She brought it out, and he said, " Of course, you are going to vote for McEacharn?" She said, "No; I am going to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney."</inline> The magistrate replied, "I will see you damned first," and took the paper, and tore it across. I am not going to mention the name of that magistrate, but that actually occurred. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows as well as I do the difficulty of getting proof. If a person gets possession of a postal ballot-paper, and that paper is signed in the ordinary way, how are you going to prove that the person making use of it does not come under the provisions entitling him or her to a postal vote? When I was cited before the City Court, and fined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Panton</inline> for having witnessed a postal vote in an improper way, some thirteen other cases were brought forward, and it was proved that in fourteen instances, magistrates had signed blank forms, allowed them to be taken out, and names of electors had been forged on them. In my case, there was an appeal, and the higher Court immediately quashed the conviction because there was no evidence to show that I had done anything derogatory to my position as a magistrate. At the time I made the declaration I did not know that the woman was an illiterate woman. I was not told about that. So far as the Labour party are concerned, I have never known them, no matter how high excitement may be at election time, to get a vote by corrupt means. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. I am telling honorable senators what I know of the possibilities of corrupt voting under the postal voting system. I desire that every one should have the opportunity of voting, hut of the two evils which exist, we must choose the lesser, and I say it would be wise to abolish a system which has been used so corruptly, and which has wrought so much harm as has the system of voting by post. I was a scrutineer for the postal votes recorded at the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir M.</inline> McEacharn. The result could not turn on the number of these votes, because of the large number of the other votes recorded. We went through the 600 postal votes, and I am certain that 50 per cent, of the persons who availed themselves of this system were not entitled to do so. I was aware that persons had been going up and down the streets urging electors to secure postal ballot-papers, because if they did they would not have to go to the polling booth. This statement was commonly made, " You do not need to go to the polling booth; all you have to do is to apply for a postal ballot-paper." </para>

                            <para>- The harm which will be done to a small number of persons will be more than compensated for by the benefit which will be secured to the country. There is a number of persons who, under every law, must be placed at a disadvantage. In this case I hold that lesser evil will be done by abolishing a greater evil. During the course of the election to which I referred, and in which I took an active part, as I desired to see <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> returned, I witnessed much abuse of the postal voting system by reason of the fact that any amount of money was available, and the persons who were engaged for the other side were not particular as to what they did, as their only desire was to secure votes. From the facts which came under my notice at the time, I was quite convinced that postal voting was used corruptly with the intent to defeat the opposing candidate by means other than fair and clean. To my knowledge the Labour party have always desired to have elections conducted, as far as practicable, in a clean, fair, and open way. In view of the fact that we cannot possibly get all people to record their votes,  we are justified in abolishing postal voting, and I trust that the Bill will be carried almost unanimously. </para>

                        <para>. - So much has been said on the question of abolishing postal voting that there is no need, I think, for me to reiterate the argu-ments which have been used in that respect. The continual cry of members of the Opposition for safeguards against the corrupt practices alleged to occur under the system is an empty one, for the simple reason that, as they know very well, there are many things against which it is impossible to guard, and very much can be done under certain conditions which it is impossible to prove. </para>

                            <para>- There are so many things which can be done, so many ways iu which postal voting can be abused - ways against which it is impossible to guard ah far as I know - that it is the duty of those who object to the abolition of the system to show where or how a safer method can  be devised, and how it can be so safeguarded as to prevent corruption being commonly exercised. I know that the other provisions of the secret ballot system may in certain directions be abused, but that is no argument why we should increase the opportunities for abuses to arise. </para>

                            <para>- While we cannot abolish everything, yet, where one section of the law has been found to be practically unworkable on account of the abuses which have arisen thereunder, there is no course open to us, so far as I can see, but to abolish it. The system of postal voting has, of course, its genuine uses. We all know that there are instances where <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> electors have voted under the system who otherwise would not have been able to vote. Therefore, we admit that by abolishing the system a certain number of the electors will inevitably be deprived of the opportunity to record their votes. But it is notorious, and it is idle for honorable senators on the other side to pretend that they "do not know anything about the matter, that the use of postal voting has led, not merely to one or two cases, but to a tremendous amount of abuse, and the parrot cry of " Prove it!" " Prove it !" is an idle one, because a system of that kind lends itself to abuses which, in the very nature of things, are beyond proof in the majority of instances. The abuses which arose under this system when it was a part of the Queensland law were so numerous and so flagrant that, by the common consent of all parties, it was abolished after a short trial. I defy any senator from Queensland to deny the statement that, by practically common consent, postal voting in that State was abolished because all sides had to admit that the abuses which were rampant under its operation were intolerable, and must not be repeated at a subsequent election. There is no difference between State and Commonwealth in the carrying out of an electoral law. Consequently a system which was found unworkable in Queensland, under a State law, must be equally unworkable under the Federal law. The cases which were proved only the other day in New South Wales do not show that the law can be maintained in its purity, but they show clearly enough that for one case which is susceptible of proof there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of cases in which proof would be impossible. I am aware that similar evils arise under the secret ballot system, but none so widespread as those which exist under postal voting. I freely confess that if there was any way in which postal voting could be "amply safeguarded, or as completely safeguarded as other provisions of the electoral law, I would be only too glad to see it operative. I can well believe that, in certain circumstances, postal voting might be established. I hope that if we adopt a system of elective members in the Territory of Papua we shall adopt the system of postal voting. No principle is involved. It is simply an expedient. In fact, the whole of the electoral machinery is simply a series of expedients for carrying the popular will into effect in the best way. And if any better method can be found for one country than would suit another, there is no inconsistency in adopting in one place that which would be wholly inapplicable iri another. Therefore, I do not go on any question of principle in regard to the matter, but postal voting has been found to be inexpedient, because of the way in which it lends itself to corruption to a greater extent than do any of the other provisions of the secret ballot system. While I intend, most reluctantly I confess, to vote for the abolition of postal voting, because I believe that whatever evil may be inflicted by the disfranchisement in this way of a few, will be more than compensated for by the greater purity of the elections generally ; if it could be shown that there was some certain and safe way of guarding the system against abuse, then neither I nor any one else would, for a moment, I think, ask for its abolition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> - Is it not possible? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator RAE.</inline> - I have not heard or found any method by which postal voting could be better safeguarded on paper than it is now. At present, on paper, there are ample safeguards, but the trouble is to render them effective. </para>

Nothing which the Opposition have advanced so far has caused me to in any way alter my opinion. I desire to say a few words regarding one  or two of the other leading principles of the Bill. I admit that the provision for compulsory enrolment is purely experimental. I do not know that any great good is going to be effected. </para>

                            <para>- While I hold that compulsory enrolment is on a very different footing from compulsory voting, yet I, for one, am not enamoured of it I frankly admit. It seems to me that if eighty persons out of every 100 take sufficient interest in the politics of the day to go and record their votes they are the proper persons to govern the country, so far as votes can do, and that if there are 20 per cent, of the voting population who do not take that interest in public affairs that is their funeral. Proportionately it gives greater power to those who are more competent to use power. I take it that, broadly speaking, the electors who take a sufficient interest in politics to vote are those who have the most intelligent understanding of the questions at issue, and if we are to dragoon the remaining 20 per cent, into enrolling, and follow them round the country to see that their names are always on the roll, well, there is too much spoon-feeding about the system to me to recommend it altogether. I think that if they will not take the trouble to enrol no party is any the worse off from the fact that they do not take the trouble to vote or cannot vote when they desire to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Give them the chance to do so. There are few persons who cannot either go to a post-office or write to find out whether they are on the roll. If they take a, keen interest in elections, they will certainly do one or the other. I know people who have been resident in one constituency for thirty or forty years, who have voted at every election, and who, nevertheless, have found that, for some unexplained reason, their names have been omitted from the roll. These accidents do not occur only in connexion with supporters of the Labour party. I have known people in the highest circles of society to get their names left off the roll through the bungling of those who were responsible for its compilation. But if people took reasonable precautions, such mistakes would seldom happen. Certainly, they would rarely be disfranchised from that cause. I generally look at the roll myself, or, if I am unable to do so, write home to my people, and ask them to see to it that our names are all there. If we were to follow up the cases of those who, through indifference or carelessness, had their names left off a roll, or failed to transfer, we should give rise to an endless amount of trouble to attain no great amount of good. </para>

                            <para>- But it would make bungling much rarer' in future than it has been in the past. 'My opinion is that when names have been left off the roll, it has been impossible to sheet the bungling home to any particular person. That is the reason mistakes occur year after year. If the man who committed the error was sacked or punished by having his own name left off the roll for a given period, such mistakes would not occur so often. </para>

                            <para>- I would give him seven weeks. If the name of a voter which should be on the roll is left off, it is a disgrace to the compilers. I am personally aware that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> MacDonell, Chief Secretary of New South Wales; handed in his name at the proper time. It was left off the original roll, and also off the supplementary roll. Similar instances have occurred time after time where the elector has taken every precaution, and yet has found his name omitted. Mistakes of that kind would, in my opinion, be remedied by a system of receipts, by which the official who received the name of a voter, and failed to see that it was put on the roll, was punished for his neglect. Furthermore, I would enable a person having a receipt to vote with it just as if his name were on the roll. But while I would take these precautions to enable people to be enrolled and vote, I do not see why we should compel persons to be enrolled or to vote against their will. We are told that it is the duty of every citizen to vote. But does he injure his fellow-citizens by failing to carry out that duty? I do not think so. I say that every man who is opposed to my opinions, and who fails to vote, makes my vote of greater value. Therefore, I rejoice - I certainly do not resent it - when my opponents fail to vote. Other proposals in the Bill which have met with a great deal of adverse criticism, are calculated to do valuable work. I refer particularly to the proposal to limit the influence of money power when it is used unscrupulously, as we know it has been in the past. So far as penalties are attached to unfair actions on the part of an inspired press, or of those employed as paid canvassers, the provisions of the Bill meet with my hearty approval. The Leader of the Opposition dwelt at great length on the Labour press as compared with the daily press of Sydney, Melbourne, and other large centres. He devoted particular attention to that excellent little weekly paper, <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> - or, rather, to the two <inline font-style="italic">Workers</inline> published in. Sydney and Brisbane. The honorable senator sought to show that the Labour press is subsidized. I know that my honorable friend is an adept at mental gymnastics, and can make a thing appear very different from what it really is. </para>

                    <para>Therefore, I was not surprised at the warmth that he threw into this portion of his speech. But, as a matter of fact, <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> does not receive any subsidy in the true sense of the term. It is quite correct that - as shown by the rule quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> - a certain amount is deducted from each annual subscription of a member of the Australian Workers Union and devoted to the purpose of running these newspapers. The honorable senator was wrong in the case of Queensland, where the subscription is very much less than is the case in New South Wales. The principle is, however, the same. But it is not a subsidy in the ordinary acceptation of the term. It is not a bounty given to encourage the production of the newspapers. These journals are the property of the unions which devote a portion of their funds to running them. In addition, every member of the union is entitled to have a free copy of <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> sent post free to any address in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Not the individuals, but the actions of the individuals - whatever they did. I say, however, that, time after time, both the Queensland and the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> - and I nave read both of them for twenty years - have been the severest critics of members of their own party when it was considered that they were not carrying out their duties properly. Members of the Labour party have been criticised for their sins of omission and of commission. These newspapers have even advocated the expulsion of certain members of the party on occasion. They have, in every way, given a kind of criticism which the daily press never gives. The daily press booms up a Labour man whenever it is suspected that he is weakening on his principles. If he does anything in the nature of what we call " ratting," they praise him as a man of moderate views and clear intellect - as a man marked out to lead - as a man who is clear-sighted, honest, and able above his fellows. </para>

                            <para>- I know no more about that than the man in the street does. But while, this Labour press is frankly owned and conducted in the interests of the Labour party, I say that it is a pure misuse of terms to compare it with a newspaper press which, in response to, or in return for, big advertisements, colours its news or its comments. To what extent the big dailies of this country are open to purchase in respect of their opinions I do not know. I have never had either the means or the inclination to test the point. But I do say that we find a curious case to awaken suspicion in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> That news paper last year continuously advocated those proposals which the Labour party submitted to the electors at the referenda. For weeks and weeks we read in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> leading articles in which every argument brought forward in the other Chamber by the Leaders of the Opposition - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook - were trenchantly, exposed, and all their fallacies blown to the winds. Everything that could be said was said to knock those arguments to pieces, and that policy was maintained until the close of the session. </para>

                            <para>- Every honorable senator knows very well that there must have been' a cause for this change. The men who conduct the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> are not inexperienced, callow youths. They did not, for the first time after the Close of the session, consider the arguments in favour of our proposals. We know very well that there must have been big and powerful reasons behind to cause the change; and it is fair to assume that those reasons were mostly financial. Unless we are furnished with a full and comprehensive explanation, it is not unfair to assume that financial considerations were at the back of such a sudden change of front. But that is not the only case. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> has occasionally published articles, day after day, and week after week, advocating principles with a distinctly democratic tinge. But this line of advocacy suddenly stopped when we came within reach of a decision upon a given question, and, in spite of all previous professions, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> turned round and advocated the opposite course. That kind of thing goes on to such an extent that it is time, as far as the law can enable us/ to know what forces there are behind these articles and alleged letters that appear in the daily newspapers at election times. If the provisions of this Bill will do anything to blow out the false prestige which surrounds the great editorial " We," and inform people that it is only some fallible mortal, whose word is worth no more than that of the next man they ' may' meet, it will clear the political atmosphere, and enable the electors to estimate at their true value letters from correspondents which probably have been written in the office of the newspaper in which they appear. There is a kind of superstitious reverence paid by many persons to views expressed by the newspaper press. </para>

                            <para>- It is passing away, to some extent, no doubt; but there are still tens of thousands of people who believe a thing if they see it stated in a newspaper, or, at any rate, believe that there is a foundation of fact for it. If by compelling articles on election matters to be written in the first person, and signed by the author, we can assist to do away with the false prestige attaching to newspaper articles, we shall have done some good, since people will be then in a position to estimate them at their true value. For these and other reasons I welcome this measure, but I trust that, in Committee, the Minister in charge of it will permit amendments calculated to strengthen the efforts made in that direction. I trust there will be no insistence on every word and clause of the Bill, because, in some respects, we might make it stronger and we might eliminate some of the provisions. There is certainly ample reason for imposing penalties upon the misrepresentation which now so frequently appears in the daily press, for enforcing the signing of articles appearing during an election campaign, and for penalizing the efforts made by means of money to unfairly obtain votes. In connexion with the matter of canvassing, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> made a great point of the ability of trade unions to employ men as organizers for industrial purposes, and at the same time use them for political work. There is no objection on my part, and I think I can speak for others on this side also, to making the clauses dealing with that matter apply as fully to one organization as to another. I take, for instance, the case of the Australian Workers Union, a body that employs a number of organizers in each of the States. What does it amount to after all? There may be twenty men employed in this way for three or four months during the shearing season in a State like New South Wales. These men are for fully nine evenings out of every ten engaged in visiting sheds where the vast majority of the men they meet are Labourites, and need no canvassing whatever. The holding of meetings in towns at which to act the part of political organizers is beyond, not their ability, but their powers, because they have too much other work to do. </para>

                            <para>- During every shearing season an organizer may be going for weeks without ever entering a town. If he does enter one it may be only for a few hours, when he is off again to the next station. There is a great deal of difference between canvassing and general organizing work. I take it that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> took the platform on behalf of a political party, though he might not be engaged in organizing work, he would not be canvassing in the ordinary sense in which the word is used. He would put the principles he believes in before his audience, and ask them, if they agreed with them, to vote for the candidates who would represent those principles. That is not what is generally understood by canvassing, which I take to mean the visiting of individual electors and asking them to pledge their votes for particular candidates. </para>

                            <para>- No; God forbid! I contend that general organizing work will not be interfered with in any way by this Bill, nor will one side be penalized as compared with another. If I, as an organizer for the Australian Workers Union, visited a town and held a meeting, I should be doing nothing which could be prohibited under this Bill.I could do no more in that respect than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> or those associated with him might do in similar circumstances. No one would ever dream of asking individual shearers which way they were going to vote. He would take it for granted that the majority were on his side. Those who were not would not be worth questioning, because they would probably lie, anyhow, over the matter. </para>

                            <para>-  I certainly think that  the  principles we advocate are very much better than those advocated by honorable senators opposite. I have never contended that human nature differs very much in individuals, no matter on which side they may be. But principles do differ very widely ; and I should not be on this side if I did not believe that ours are immeasurably superior to those mythical affairs which are called principles on the other side. The fact remains that so far as canvassing is concerned, this Bill will not penalize one side more than another. If in Committee it can be shown that anything can be done to make that more clear than it is as expressed in the Bill at the present time, I shall be only too pleased to vote for any amendment which will put the matter beyond doubt. We have not been very much in the habit of canvassing for money, and I trust we shall not do very much in that way, because I do not think the results are satisfactory. The temptation to either side in such a case is undoubted. We should have no more compulsory legislation than can be avoided ; but we should make it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong ; and that is why I think it is absolutely necessary to abolish postal voting. I shall defer any further remarks I have to make upon the Bill until we get into Committee. </para>

I  have no desire to add anything further to the discussion. All I wish to say is that I shall invite the Committee to divide on one of the clauses dealing with the abolition of voting by post. I think it would be better if we were to have the debate on any subsequent clause which specifically strikes out the voting by post provisions. </para>

                        <para>. - After the vote taken this afternoon, of course any attempt to test the question of the abolition of voting by post again would be futile. At the same time, I would like to call attention to the speech of the Minister in charge of the Bill this afternoon, which to my mind was somewhat extraordinary. It was not a political speech. It was an obstetric speech. He dealt with a phase of this question which grated on my ears in the way it was elaborated. According to the Minister's own showing, reducing it to its narrowest limits, he is disfranchising from 8,000 to 10,000 electors by eliminating voting by post. </para>

                            <para>- It was narrowed down in that way by the Minister. There is a certain time in a woman's life, and if there is any time that ought to appeal to whatever is chivalrous or manly in man it is that time. To assume for a moment that a woman could go to the polling booth: during those three or four weeks, or, it might be, three or four months, is assuming something which is extremely unfair, and is not to be expected. I was shocked at the Minister's speech. Nothing we can say will change the minds of the Ministry ; but even looking at the effect of the abolition of voting by post from the narrowest stand-point - narrowing it down to the women in the condition referred to, without considering people living at a distance from a polling booth, and people who are infirm, or who are unable to get to a polling booth owing to many other reasons - on the Minister's own figures he is disfranchising from 8,000 to 10,000 people in the Commonwealth. I think this provision striking out voting by post is unjust. </para>

                        LEDGER (Queensland) {5.7]. - One would have thought that the Minister straight away, after the expressions of some of his own supporters, would have been convinced that this clause should be postponed. One of his own supporters has pointed out the fact - and not a single member on the Minister's own side, or the Minister himself, has disputed it, because it could not be disputed - that, in a particular case - a case which is sufficiently familiar to us - a large number of women are going to be disfranchised. The Minister takes up the position now of saying, " Let them be disfranchised." That is the position which is being taken up by a Government which pretends to be democratic, and which pretends that Parliament should be elected by adult suffrage.

                        <para>- One of the Minister's own supporters gave a strong reason why, in particular cases, the postal vote should be retained; but the Minister has not even had the courtesy to say to the Committee whether or not he will consider such a provision as will enable the people concerned - in this case women - to vote by post. Notwithstanding the fact, which he cannot repudiate or minimize, that a certain class of adults in the community will be disfranchised, he says that voting by post must be abolished. Have we had from the Minister, or from a single Ministerial supporter, a complete explanation as to why it is impossible to provide for those cases? We might provide that every woman in that position should be entitled to go before an officer, make a declaration as to her condition about which there could be no dispute whatever, and become entitled to a postal vote. Such a woman, of all the people in the community, is entitled to have that facility extended to her. Does the Minister mean to say that he cannot frame conditions to provide for that? Does he say that a woman in the condition which has been mentioned should not, if she goes before a medical officer in conjunction with a justice of the peace, and complies with such strict conditions as I have indicated, be allowed to vote by post? There is silence on the other side. The thing is so unblushingly unjust that, from the Minister down, there is no one who is capable of defending that position. </para>

I am not going to apologize for the noise which I am making, if the honorable senator likes to call it noise, nor do I apologize for the length of time I am taking, because the statement of the Minister this afternoon proved that this proposal, root and branch, is unfair and indefensible, and is striking a blow at adult suffrage. </para>

                            <para>- That has got nothing to do with the position in front of us. The position is that an injustice is being done, by depriving of their franchise certain women, who are honorably entitled to vote. That is proved by the Minister's own statement. Let me point out that not a single word has been said on the other side as to the steps that might be taken, to enable these women to exercise the franchise by means of postal voting. It is the greatest humbug to say that the Minister or the officers of the </para>

                    <para class="block">Electoral Branch cannot provide a form to meet cases of this kind. In every town throughout the Commonwealth medical officers could be appointed to deal with the matter. The medical officer, as a State or a Federal official, would take the responsibility of the statement which he would make in each case. We can easily make provision for the class of women in question to vote by post. It is simply an insult  to our intelligence to say that the privilege of voting by post cannot be retained for these women. There are other considerations which arise in connexion with the clause. After a division has been taken in which the overwhelming strength of the Government has been shown, of course, the Minister and his supporters may say, " We will vote down the Opposition." Is that worthy of a democratic Government? Is it worthy of a Government which professes to exercise and to base their parliamentary rights and privileges upon adult suffrage. Is that a decent attitude to take? Will a single senator, on the other side, say that if he were allowed a quarter of an hour for the purpose he could not frame a schedule by which the persons to whom reference has been made so often would be protected? Not one of them. There is not a senator opposite who would insult his intelligence or the Government by saying that it could not be done within the time. Without allowing the Opposition, or even his own supporters, an opportunity to frame a provision, however strict or stringent it might be does not matter, the Minister wants to rush the Bill through Committee, although many senators on his side have expressed sympathy with our desire to retain postal voting for a certain class. He declines to afford to any honorable senator an opportunity to frame an amendment which would meet that particular case. </para>

If honorable senators on the other side had any real sympathy with that which they have expressed here, they would join with us in asking for time to see that those persons shall not be disfranchised ; in other <inline font-style="italic">words, to</inline> see that effect, is given to the speech of the Minister in charge of the measure. In a deliberative assembly proper reasons should be given for a proposal of this kind. There is no reason why  a  single senator on this side should not continue the battle on behalf of a class of women, and, indeed, of others, who live in the country. Ours is a reasonable request, but I hope that we shall not be thrown back on a parliamentary practice by which, sometimes, if we cannot get effect given to a reasonable request, we can show the Government the consequences of resisting our appeal. </para>

                            <para>- I would not insult the honorable senator's intelligence, however little or great it may be, by saying that he does not know that an injustice to a particular class is going to be perpetrated by the Government. " O, franchise how many crimes are committed in thy name." Honorable senators opposite will not even tell us that, after consultation with the officials, they have found out that they cannot draw up forms to prevent this, injustice to a class of women. They know that if the Minister, or an official, said they could not draft a schedule to meet this class of cases, they would say a thing which was not correct. No official dare to make such a statement. </para>

                            <para>- What was the object of my amendment to the motion for the second reading but to secure to the House a further opportunity of considering the matter? The supporters of the measure on the other side admitted the injustice of disfranchising this class of citizens, and the Minister accentuated it. Naturally, one would have thought that a Minister or a supporter would have had an amendment prepared. If an amendment is in the mind of the Minister, or a supporter, what harm will be done by postponing the clause? I would remind honorable senators that men in outlying districts will be struck at by this clause just as severely as women will be. The very argument which is being used on behalf of women applies with added force to adults who are aged and infirm. It is absolutely unnecessary to say' that there are men and women who are not so aged and infirm that, on polling day, if they are more than 5 miles away, they cannot exercise their votes. This clause is, so to speak, the political death-warrant, so far as voting is concerned, to a considerable portion of the community. Apart from women, and a particular condition relating to them, every honorable senator opposite knows that there are other men and women to whom it is a. physical impossibility to vote except by post. </para>

                            <para>- Every time the honorable senator goes on the hustings he has the poor man, and the poor widow, too, on his lips; but when an argument is turned against him, he holds the poor or infirm man, or somebody else, up to derision. Never have I based an argument on class distinction, rich or poor, married or single. I have always tried to discuss a measure on bed-rock principles. There are many persons, women as well as men, who, by reason of distance, and age, and infirmity, cannot go to the polling booth, and these are the very persons who have not abused postal voting, if it has been abused at all. There are in the Commonwealth thousands of women who cannot get to the polling booth, and who can only exercise the suffrage by means of the post. It is not contended that settlers in the back- blocks have abused the privilege. If there is anything in the criticism from the other side, it is that citizens, male and female, in the towns have abused postal voting. When I asked for proof of their statement there was no sufficient proof forthcoming. How can we ask a woman or a man, old and possibly suffering from infirmity, which would not be technically designated as illness, to go 40 or 50 miles to a polling booth? In Queensland, I have known persons who were never able to exercise their right to vote, even for their particular district, by reason of distance, although, for the purpose of State elections, polling booths were amply provided. It was not until the Federal Parliament adopted the postal voting system that they were able to exercise their privileges at all. Have the Government any realization of the difficulties which confront settlers in the back-blocks? I have known a- man who, not having facilities for postal voting, travelled with his wife and daughters a distance of 80 or 100 miles in order to exercise the franchise. As postal facilities are extended - and we are spending thousands of pounds to extend them - the benefits which can be conferred upon the people by their means should be extended also. What benefit to the people is more substantial than a means of exercising a voice in the government of the country? Not a single atom of proof has been cited in justification of the abolition of postal voting as exercised in the back-blocks districts. No abuse or corruption has been hinted at. I hope that the Minister will give us some information as to whether hie is going to drive this proposal right through, or whether he will afford facilities for preparing a modification in accordance with which the aged, the infirm, and women may be enabled to vote by post. </para>

                            <para>- I quoted the report of a Police Court case in which a man was fined for a breach of the law in connexion with postal voting. But that does not satisfy honorable senators opposite. They say they want evidence from the backblocks. I will quote a case in point. If this does not satisfy them, I shall have to be content with applying the old proverb, " There are none so blind as those who will not see." This case is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">North-western Advocate and Emu Bay Times</inline> - the leading Liberal newspaper of the north-west coast of Tasmania. It was published on 24th April, 1910, and is headed " Referendum Notes." </para>

                    <para>If Liberalism does not gain success on Wednesday it will earn it. Everywhere throughout Tasmania Liberals are organizing to secure the defeat of the referenda as never was the case before. Not only will thousands of vehicles be employed in the Liberal interests on Wednesday, but Liberal workers have been for days past devoting their attention to securing postal votes. </para>
                    <para>Not the least energetic of workers in the Emu Bay district is Cr. J. Bramich. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bramich</inline> has undertaken to organize the postal votes in Oonah and Hampshire, and probably some thirty votes against the referenda will be in this way recorded that would not have been cast at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bramich,</inline> as a justice of the peace, is an authorized witness, and therefore his undertaking the work of canvassing and collecting ballot-papers is peculiarly effective. Four hard days' work are being put in by this enthusiastic Liberal, two days in securing applications for the postal votes and two more days in getting the papers marked and collecting them. Oonah and Hampshire districts are more than five miles from a polling place, therefore residents are entitled to vole by post. It is found that the average settler is in strong opposition to the Labour party and their pet referenda schemes. So are many farm labourers and those who are not so easily converted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bramich</inline> has made a number of such converts. The 8s. per day arguments is the most effective for the settler and farmer. "Did you want to pay 8s. per day, wet and dry"? is the query. The answer of the settler and the farmer is not hard to guess. Of course, they cannot afford it. </para>
                    <para>But how does the argument affect the farm labourer? It is explained in his case that what affects his employer affects him. That the payment of a higher wage will mean a higher price- for necessaries, with a lessened chance of employment. If farmers cannot afford to employ men to-day, what will happen when the wage is 8s. per day, " wet or fine," for any and every sort of farm labour - and without any variation? That is 8s. for the best man 8s. for the worst. The argument tells. Throughout the district named there will be practically a unanimous no to the referenda proposals. </para>

                            <para>- The Government in Tasmania took precious good care that members of my party were not made justices of the peace. Any unbiased person will admit that this instance shows that there was gross misapplication of the privilege of postal voting. If there were no other instance than this, I should feel justified in voting for the abolition of the system. I wish to inform the Senate that if postal voting is done away with the result will be to disfranchise one of my own parents, who will be unable to go to the poll.. I quite admit that many persons will be unable to vote. But in view of the abuses that have occurred, I can see nothing for it but to abolish the system, believing that this policy will be to the advantage of Australia generally. </para>

                            <para>- I never listened to a more cold-blooded statement than that made by the Minister with regard to the voting of women in maternity cases. I suppose he was speaking from a statement which had been prepared for him. The figures were worked down to the lowest possible minimum. But even so they showed that a great number of women will be unable to vote if postal voting be discontinued. I have no objection to polling places being established at destitute asylums and homes for incurables ; but while honorable members opposite are prepared to take the ballot-box to the bedside of a person whose usefulness as a member of the community is ended, they are prepared to say that the delicate woman who is about to become, or has become, a mother, shall not vote. That is a plain statement of what is intended. </para>

How can any man with any sense of justice say to these women, " Because you are not in a fit state to go to the poll, you shall not have a vote at all." What about those who are prevented by any form of serious illness from voting in the ordinary way? Why should they be robbed of their votes? Why should the infirm, who are unable to go to the poll, be robbed of their votes ? </para>

I now ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> to withdraw the statement, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell has stated that it is objectionable to him1. </para>

So certain am 1 that it does make all the difference that I am prepared to suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> now that, if he has the slightest recollection of having used the word " No," his words were offensive, and they ought to be withdrawn. I did not hear the word "No" used by the honorable senator, though I was sitting just in front of him. I say that the words that were actually used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> could not be taken in the objectionable way in which, in the heat of the moment, they were taken by honorable senators opposite. </para>

                            <para>-  I was sirring here all the time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> was speaking. The Vice-President of the Executive Council referred to something which he said <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> did not do when he was in the Legislative Council of South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> replied that if he entered into a discussion of that question then he would be out of order, and that the  Chairman  would pull him up. Then he said he was prepared to discuss the matter- with " the honorable gentleman," meaning the Vice-President of the Executive Council, at any time. Senator Russell said, "I will take that up." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon-</inline> answered, " I am prepared to discuss it with any intelligent or respectable person." Although the word "No" was interjected both by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and the Honorary Minister, I think the  Chairman  will bear me out in saying that when he put the question from the Chair, he did not mention the word " No " at all. The word "No" came from an interjection on the other side of the chamber. The  Chairman  put the phrase before the Committee without the word "No." Now, sir, on that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> said he had not said anything that he thought was objectionable to any person. It is now put before you by the  Chairman  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> used the word "No." I think the  Chairman  will bear me out in saying that when he put the phrase from the Chair, he did not use the word "No." When he put the phrase to you, sir, he used the word " No, ' ' and that word makes a great difference. I do not like to hear any strong personalities. I did not take it from Senator Vardon's manner that he meant anything offensive to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. He was slightly irritated, perhaps, at the interjection of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but I do not think he meant any. offence to any person. If the word "No" was not prefixed to the phrase used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> I do not think any member of the Senate could take any exception to his remark. </para>

                            <para>- Then that settles it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> is prepared to say now that he will discuss the question referred to with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell, Senator Russell</inline> can appoint a time and a place. Let us see if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> will do it. That is exactly the position. I distinctly understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> to say " No," and to point out why he would not do it. No honorable senator who paid particular attention to the matter when it arose could understand anything from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon's</inline> remarks, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was not intelligent and respectable enough to discuss the question with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I know as much as the honorable senator about what occurred. It is charged that insulting and offensive words were used to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, and the customary course, when a remark is taken exception to, is for the senator who has made it, to withdraw. If the senator who has used words tq which exception is taken says that he did not mean them in an offensive sense his statement is accepted, but the words are always withdrawn, whether they were meant to be offensive or not. It does not matter whether the word " No" preceded the phrase used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> or not. The implication was as plain as the nose on one's face. We all know full well the feeling that exists between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell.Senator Vardon would have acted much more fairly if he had withdrawn the statement when the  Chairman  called on him to do so, than by having a wrangle when every one in the chamber knows what is at the bottom of the whole affair. </para>

                            <para>- If I were as often on my feet lecturing the Senate as is the honorable senator, I might pose as lecturer-in-chief of the Senate. The honorable senator arrived in the train to-day in a very bad mood, and has not got out of it yet. The words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> having been taken exception to, the  Chairman  was perfectly right in asking that they be withdrawn. </para>

I asked him, I suppose half-a-dozen times, in the ordinary courteous way in which any  Chairman  of Committees speaks to a senator, to withdraw the words, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> after apparently hesitating for some time, stated definitely, " No, I will not withdraw." According to my reading of the Standing Orders, if any senator disputes a ruling of the  Chairman  of Committees he has only one course to pursue, and that is immediately to put in writing his reason for disputing the ruling. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> did not propose to take that course at all. He definitely refused to obey the ruling, arid therefore I thought that, in the interests of the proper conduct of business, I should bring the matter before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I submit that if the Chairman's ruling is neither to be obeyed nor the proper course to be taken, of putting in writing the reasons for disputing the ruling, the conduct of business will be considerably hampered. Every honorable senator knows - as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> - that there is only one course for an honorable senator to take who disputes the Chairman's ruling. I know of no feeling between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, or between honorable senators and myself ; but, in my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> having disputed my ruling, should have taken the proper course of putting in writing the reasons for disputing it. </para><interjection>

Quite a number of honorable senators have asserted that the word " No " was used, and so far as my hearing served me the word " No," or a word very much like it, was used. After all, is there anything in the point as to whether that word was used or not ? What we have to decide is not any dispute between myself and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> or any other honorable senator, but a question affecting the conduct of the business of the Senate. The point is whether the Chairman's ruling should be obeyed, or if there is a reason for not obeying it, whether the proper course should not be taken by the honorable senator disputing the ruling, of putting in writing his reasons for objecting to it. </para><interjection>

                            <para>-  No. There is the honorable senator again saying "mercy." I challenge any one to bring anything against my moral character. I am not going to bet, but I will give to a hospital which is in need of funds <inline font-style="italic">Â£20</inline> if any member of the Senate can prove to me that I have in any instance branded myself as an immoral man or a fool, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> would like to paint me. I do object to such remarks coming from any man in the circumstances. I know, if I dare go back into history, what is at the bottom of this -business ! At the Coronation in England, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon's</inline> claim was overlooked. He expected probably to be <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> to-day. </para>

                            <para>- The  Chairman  of Committees has reported to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> made a statement which he regarded as being out of order. Under the Standing Orders the  Chairman  of Committees has the same power as the  President  to take exception to a statement, and to demand the withdrawal of any words if considered to be out of order. There is another aspect of this matter, and that is that when a member of the Senate makes a statement which is considered by another senator to be applicable to himself personally, and to be offensive, it has. been the custom in the Senate for the former to withdraw the statement. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> should withdraw the statement which he made. There is evidently an impression amongst a large number of honorable senators that the words which he uttered did apply specifically to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, and I think that the only action which can be taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> to maintain the dignity of the Senate is to withdraw the remarks which have been objected to, and which are considered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell to be personally applicable to himself. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Government to consider whether it would not be well to adopt the electors' right system, which I believe would provide a way out of this difficulty. In New South Wales, electors' rights were only issued to men. The signature of an elector was obtained on the butt of an elector's right before the right was issued. Suppose that we adopted the system, but with the elector's signature on the right, it is quite evident that wherever a man might go he would have to produce an elector's right. The officer could ask the man to sign his name, and if the signature did not agree with that on the elector's right, the elector could not vote. With such a system in use, we should be able to retain the postal voting system, and so get over the difficulty with which we are faced. As regards the case of persons who are ill and cannot attend personally, surely an arrangement could be made by which  a  person could send his electoral right to the returning officer and get from him a postal ballot-paper. We must all admit, I think, that it is very undesirable that innocent persons should be punished because others have been guilty of wrong-doing. There is no doubt that this clause, if passed, will deprive thousands of innocent persons of a right, because certain other persons have behaved dishonorably. I do not think that  that is in accord with British ideas of justice. We should see that we do no harm to well-behaved, honorable people because others act dishonorably. I am surprised that this point has apparently not been considered by the Government. Even if only 100 innocent persons were concerned, they should not be punished because others have done wrong. I beg the Government to reconsider the matter, and to postpone the clause. </para>

                            <para>- These, the honorable senator says, are the only people who have never voted. I think, sir, that when I am making a speech no honorable senator has a right to tell me that I am wrong. If he is man enough, let him get up afterwards and tell me where I am wrong, and not sit there yapping like a dog which has lost a bone. With all due deference to the honorable senator, I assert that the people mentioned in section 109 of the Act have voted. I have known them to vote. I have witnessed postal ballot-papers for them to vote, and I think that my statement will be taken as true. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has never met with any of these people, but I have. I am quite prepared to call in any witnesses whom he thinks necessary to prove my statement. Why should these persons be disfranchised? Certainly, if they have not voted, it has been through their own fault ; but this clause will deprive them of a facility to vote. </para>

                            <para>- During the second-reading debate a great many excuses were made for the abolition of postal voting. I think I shall be able to show that there was no foundation for many of them. The existing law prescribes that a form shall be signed by a person who desires to vote by post, and his signature has to be witnessed by an authorized person. Before the referenda in April last, I applied for a postal ballot-paper, as I was leaving Australia, for England and found that my ship would reach Fremantle on the 25th April and sail on the same day. Had I not been able to vote by post, I could not have taken part in the referenda. I should not be entitled to do so in similar circumstances under this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- A similar privilege should be accorded to every person who is unable to go to a polling booth. Allegations have been made as to the improper use of postal voting ; but no evidence has been adduced. If improper practices occurred, why was not the penalty of <inline font-style="italic">Â£50</inline> enforced? Surely we should not abolish a great convenience simply because it is alleged that it has been misused on some occasions. We do not abolish a law simply because some persons break it. There is a law against thieving and murder. Nevertheless, those crimes are committed, and nobody proposes to abolish the law which is intended to restrain them. Because certain individuals have done wrong under the postal voting provisions of the Electoral Act. that is no reason for depriving of this privilege persons who may be sick, or too distant from a polling place to vote by ballot. I recently received a letter from a lady who has accepted an engagement to teach in a private family in a distant part of the country. She pointed out that, under the Bill now before the Senate, she would be deprived of her vote on election day because her home is 50 miles from the nearest polling place. She said, " 1 have always taken a great interest in elections, and I feel sure that there is no man in the Federal Parliament who would take the vote away from a woman who is trying to earn her livelihood." </para>

                            <para>- She will find out later. It must be remembered that only certain persons are authorized to witness signatures to applications for postal ballot-papers. The authorized witnesses are - All Commonwealth electoral officers, returning officers and registrars ; all postmasters, postmistresses or persons in charge of post-offices; all police, stipendiary or special magistrates; all justices of the peace ; all head teachers in the employment of a State Education Department ; all officers of Trade and Customs ; all members of a police force; all mining wardens and mining wardens' clerks in the Public Service of a State; all legally qualified medical practitioners ; all officers in charge of quarantine stations and lighthouses ; all pilots, telegraph line repairers, railway station-masters and night officers in charge, who are permanently employed in the Railway Department of any State; all superintendents of mercantile marine and their deputies ; and all persons employed in the Public Service of the Commonwealth or of a State who are authorized by proclamation. I point out that the authorization to police officers and line repairers is particularly useful to persons living in far distant parts of the country. There may be police patrols going from station to station, and line repairers in isolated districts often visit stations for supplies. It is a great convenience for such persons to witness an application. There are large numbers of persons employed in the mercantile marine trading around our coasts, and provision should be made for them. </para>

                            <para>- I know that there is a clause in the Bill entitling a person to vote at any polling place in the Commonwealth, no matter whether it be in his own electorate or not. That is to say, a person temporarily in Melbourne can vote as if he were in an electorate in Tasmania or Western Australia. But that does not touch the point with which I am dealing. There is no clause in the B'.Il  entitling  a  person  to vote unless he can reach a polling place. It is useless' to say to a man who lives 50 miles from a polling place that, if he were, in Melbourne, he could vote as if he were in the Kennedy electorate in Queensland. I wish <inline font-style="italic">ti</inline> extend facilities for voting, not to restrict them. At Dunwich, in Queensland, there are from 1,200 to 1,500 people, many of whom are very old and infirm. I suppose that some of them can  hardly  discriminate between one party and another. Dunwich is made a polling place, and the whole of those people can vote. Yet other people who are  young  and take a keen interest in political affairs will be debarred from voting under this Bill. Some honorable senators opposite have urged that the Opposition should draft a clause to meet such  cases  as I have instanced. What are the Crown Law Officers for if they cannot draft a clause for the purpose? I do not think that the officials are such dunderheads as to be unable to draw up a simple provision like that. </para>

                            <para>- This Bill has been drafted, not to give facilities to people to vote, but to prevent them from voting. If ir were entitled " A Bill to prevent certain people from voting," I could understand it. The various persons who, under the existing law, are authorized to witness applications for postal ballot-papers and postal votes, are liable to a penalty if any abuse of the system has been due to their action. We have heard that the system has been  abused, and I ask why no penalty has been enforced. One swallow does not make a summer ; but with all the outcry about the abuse of the system, honorable senators opposite should have been able to produce two or three cases of the kind. If the postal voting system is to be abolished on the ground that it has been abused, the ballot system should be done away with for the same reason. I have known a case in which a man, on being given a ballot-paper, retired into the box to vote, came out, put a dummy paper into the ballot-box, which I afterwards found there when counting the votes, and took the clean ballot-paper out of the polling booth to. the committee conducting the election for a particular party. That clean ballot-paper was then marked by the secretary of the committee looking after a particular candidate's interests, and the next voter took it into the booth, received another paper, went into the box, came back again, put the marked paper into the ballot-box, and brought out the new ballot-paper given to him, in order that it might be marked in the same way. </para>

A case referred to in connexion with the postal voting system was that of a postal ballot-paper being signed by a voter while another held his hand. In such a case, the voter should have been questioned and asked to make a declaration. The signature of a person upon an application for a postal ballot-paper could be compared with the signature on the ballot-paper itself, and it would be easy to detect whether they were the same. If a man misuses a postal ballot : paper which he has witnessed, it should be very easy to find it out. </para>

                            <para>- Decidedly it is. It is his business to compare the signature on the ballot-paper with the signature on the application form. If the existing Act were properly administered, no very great abuse of the postal voting system could occur. I have counted postal ballot-papers in the presence of the honorable member for Kennedy, and I know that no great amount of abuse could arise in connexion with the system. The best man might pass one or two irregular votes, but if there is any out-cry about an abuse of the system the officials will be careful to see that the signatures on the postal ballot-papers and on the application forms are alike. However, if honorable senators opposite have made up there minds to disfranchise people, no matter what is said on this side, we cannot help it. They are strong enough to </para>

                    <para>Larry  any proposal in spite of us, but it is our duty to. make the best fight we can in the interests of the people who will be disfranchised if the postal voting provisions cf the existing Act are repealed. The Minister has only to turn his head around to the electoral official behind him to discover that there are many other ways in which the abuse of the system, if any, might be dealt with. If the Returning Officers and Divisional Returning Officers did their duty under the existing system there could be no great cause for complaint. A case was alluded to which arose in connexion with an election in South Australia four and a half years ago, in which an electoral official said that certain ballot-papers had been burnt, or otherwise destroyed, though many months afterwards they were found. No law that we could pass would entirely prevent that kind of thing. Though there have been abuses of the ballot system, involving thousands of votes, we hear nothing about them, but in connexion with_ alleged abuses of the postal voting provisions we have hearsay evidence that some one told some one else that there had been something wrong with the operation of the system. I ask the Government to retain the system, and see that the Act is enforced, and if any fraud is perpetrated let them double the existing penalties and make the term of imprisonment three months instead of one. The people who will have to suffer under the Government proposal are the last people on God's earth who should be deprived of the privilege they have under the existing law, and, in the circumstances, I ask the Government to hesitate before they decide to abolish the postal voting system. </para>

                        <para>.- We can understand the virtuous indignation of our friends opposite, because we know that they realize that a system is about to be repealed from which they have derived great political benefit in the past. I wish to say that the only political party responsible for the introduction of this measure is the party represented by our honorable friends opposite. If the supporters of that party had not abused the postal voting provisions to the extent to which every one knows they have been abused, there would have been no call for this amending Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I make an assertion which can be backed up by reference to official documents. During the election of 1906, for the division of Denison, this system of postal voting was abused to an extent unequalled in any other part of the Commonwealth. It is no exaggeration to say that several hundred postal ballot-papers were sent under cover to one address, and people were induced to make application for these postal ballot-papers through a certain individual. The people who applied for them never saw them. They were used by the individual in question, and sent oh to the Divisional Returning Officer. A senator on the other side of the chamber said that the Returning Officer's duty is to compare the signatures on the counterfoils with the applications. Now, although that is part of the Returning Officer's duty, none of the officers is an expert in handwriting, and it is not a very difficult matter to closely imitate the signature of an 'applicant. </para>

                            <para>- I say that several hundreds were imitated. In the Denison election in 1906, out of a total of 10,700 votes recorded, there were, roughly, 650 postal votes,. I will not offer the figures, because I am not quite sure of their accuracy, but the margin between the male vote and the female vote was very small. There was a small army of paid individuals touring the town with the object of inducing people to make application through them for postal ballot-papers. When an application was signed, the Divisional Returning Officer was requested to send the ballot-paper to care of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> and it is a well known fact that at least 300 of these ballot-papers reached that individual. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In all conscience, one-half is bad enough. It came under, our notice, in a number of instances, that people who in good faith sent in applications for ballot-papers did not receive ballot-papers. Consequently, they attended the polling booth with the object of casting their votes. Their names were checked, and they were told that, having voted previously by postal ballot-papers, they could not vote again. Of course, those people were very indignant, and a number of them complained to me. Several of them were men, and at least a dozen were ladies.  Of  course, their postal ballot-papers had been used. Honorable- senators opposite have time and again asked, " Why was not action taken against the people offending?" Let nae tell them that the best advice that could be obtained in Hobart was obtained in connexion with these matters, and we were advised that no case would stand, because there was no absolute proof of intention to commit a fraud. </para>

My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> this afternoon gave a striking instance of the manner in .which ' postal voting is abused in one part of Tasmania. It is quite a common occurrence to have complaints from different parts of the island, north, south, east, and west - particularly south - where certain people travel about weeks and weeks before an election, and not only get hold of postal ballot-papers, but absolutely intimidate people into making application for postal ballot-papers. </para>

                            <para>- I may tell the honorable senator that there has been so much discussion, assertion, and denial during the last few days about these cases, that to-morrow I intend to move that all papers be laid on the table of the Senate which have any bearing upon these matters, or upon questions of this character, which have been brought under the notice of the Government. I am confident that those papers will make very interesting reading. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> appealed to the Government a few minutes ago to delay dealing with this electoral reform. I appeal to the Government not to delay it for one minute more than is necessary, because, if there is one electoral reform that is more sought after, more desired, and which will be more commendable to the people of Australia than any other, it is the reform indicated in this proposed amendment of the electoral law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> a few moments ago, stated that some people at sea would be prevented from exercising the franchise. I interjected that he ought te* read the Bill before he criticised it, and if he had looked at proposed new section  139,.  which is to take the place of old section.  I39&gt;  he would have seen that provision is made there for people to record their votes immediately after the writs for elections have been issued. </para>

If those honorable senators who wish the passage of the Bill postponed are alive to their responsibilities as representatives of the people, and are satisfied that the Bill calls for radical amendment, then it is their duty to present an amendment to take the place of the section which it is proposed to amend. I sincerely hope the Government will not listen to the pleading of honorable senators opposite to delay the passage of the Bill, and that it will not be delayed one moment more than is necessary. </para>

The honorable senator said tha* some hundreds of postal ballot-papers were signed, and were sent to the Divisional Returning Officer, but that they had not been signed by the persons by whom they purported to have been signed. He said that those people went to the poll, not having received their postal ballot-papers, and found that their postal ballot-papers had been voted on, and that, their names having been struck off, they were unable to record their votes. Is not that the statement of the honorable senator ? </para>

We have in the Act the most stringent regulations for the conduct of elections in regard to voting by post, and very severe penalties can be imposed. The honorable senator says that legal advice was taken, and the opinion was given that no case would stand. Is not that a proof that there was no case, and that what he has been telling us tonight is really not correct? We find that there is a proper mode of procedure by which the postal votes can be checked. It is provided in the Act that an authorized witness shall not witness the signature of any applicant for a postal voting ballot-paper unless, first of all, he has satisfied himself as to the identity of the applicant, has seen the applicant sign the application in his own handwriting, and is personally acquainted with the facts, or has satisfied himself by inquiry from the applicant that the statements contained in the application are true. Under that provision, there is a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">Â£50,</inline> or one month's imprisonment. Does the honorable senator mean to say that no effort was made to sheet the charges home and to endeavour to trace who had signed these papers and witnessed the signatures? It is also provided that - </para>

                    <para class="block">I am quite aware that in days gone by in New South Wales many persons mislaid or lost their electoral rights. That, I understand, was one of the commonest objections to the system. When a person got an electoral right he had to sign his signature on the butt retained in the office, but not on the right itself. The consequence was that manipulations of electoral rights took place. If a man's autograph were on the butt of the electoral right he could vote, but, if asked, he would have to write his signature to show that he was the person entitled to vote, and it could be compared there and then with the signature on the right. The electoral right, if the signature were, evidently, a forgery, could be retained and the man's name taken down, and no doubt he would be prosecuted. With regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> persons who were situated at a great distance, or who were ill, we could surely regulate the voting by post so that they could send in' their electoral rights some days before polling day, the returning officer could keep the documents in his possession, and send them voting papers in such a manner that no one but the persons entitled to them would be able to use them. How that could be done I shall explain. In the election of the directors of an institution I belong to the voting paper is sent out in an envelope, and attached to that is the person's signature, which can be detached. If my proposal were adopted for electoral purposes the signature of an elector could, if necessary, be compared, and persons who could not attend, through sickness or by reason of distance, would be able to vote by post. I know that there is a great prejudice against the use of electoral rights, because, in days gone by, in New South Wales, persons often made a wrong use of them. Under my suggestion we would have a great check on the misuse of the documents. I have no wish to press the matter, if the Government say that they are willing to postpone the clause and to consider my suggestion. I feel quite sure that public feeling will grow very greatly against a Government which brings in a Bill to make the innocent suffer "for the guilty, and certainly that is what will take place under this measure, if it is not amended in some such manner as I suggest. Thousands of persons, both men and women, will be unable, through illness, to vote. Why? Because other persons have misused their opportunities, and the witnesses, whoever they were, presumably lent themselves to what was very much like roguery. I do not think that in any circumstances we ought to punish the innocent for the faults of the guilty. After what we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> and others, it is quite evident to me that there has been a great lapse or ignorance on the part of persons witnessing postal ballot-papers. I have no wish to inconvenience the Committee, but I feel very strongly on this subject. I feel persuaded that public feeling will rise in indignation, and very rightly so, against the innocent being made to suffer for the guilty. </para>

I am satisfied that he is perfectly honest, and would never traffic with electors' rights as persons in New South Wales have been guilty of doing. The elector's right bore on its face all kinds of things. It was tried in all shapes and forms, and it was usually bought on polling day at any price from is. to <inline font-style="italic">Â£x,</inline> and used to advance party interests. I sincerely hope that the system will not be introduced into this Bill. I quite understand the position taken up by the Opposition, and sympathize with them. I recognise that, from the commencement of Australian history, politicians of a like creed have had the framing of the electoral laws, and consequently this is the first time when they find themselves unable to put one impress on the electoral law of the Commonwealth. In these circumstances I can sympathize with honorable senators on the other side, inasmuch as previously they always took good care so to frame the law that it would serve their purposes. </para>

                            <para>- That is what the Opposition tried to do before, and that is what they did. Whether they are satisfied with the evidence that has been produced is a matter of no consideration, because if we were to bring forward evidence which was so clear that at the judgment seat every man who had assisted in building it up would . be condemned, still they would not be satisfied. They are satisfied that so long as the provisions for postal voting remain as they are in the Act, so long will they be utilized by their side in politics, and so long will that side be in a position to utilize them very effectively. Consequently they are not likely to give very much support to the clause, but rather to do as they are doing, that is, fight as long as ever fight is left in them, to cling to a weapon which they know has served them very effectively. In his usual bluff manner, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> lamented over the men who are 50 or 60 miles away from a polling place. That is a thing over which we have no right to lament. Every member of the Opposition ought to endeavour with me to see that no person shall be 50 or 60 miles away from a polling booth where there are voters in any number. </para>

                            <para>- It was not the persons I am speaking of who used the postal voting system, but the people in the main streets in the big cities, residing close to a polling booth, and many of them having three or four polling booths within a quarter of an hour's walk. It was these persons who utilized the system, while sixty or seventy persons who were at a place 50 or 60 miles away from a polling booth had no facilities given to them to vote. I hope that we shall take care to provide such facilities as will enable persons in outlying places to cast their votes in a polling booth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> made a most pitiful appeal concerning the number of persons who were likely to be disfranchised by this Bill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is making an effort to save them. I want to charge the Opposition with exactly the position with which they have charged us. They have not shown one vestige of evidence that we shall disfranchise any one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> tried to show that 29,000 persons would be disfranchised by this alteration of the law, half of whom reside in Victoria. But he did not observe that the probabilities are that a large percentage of those who voted by post at the last election were servant girls in Toorak, whose employers induced them to vote by post in the interests of the honorable senator and his party. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to direct attention to certain statements made by the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat - statements which, disguise them as you may, amounted to a charge of absolute corruption against the late Administration. That charge was to the effect that the previous Government had, for purely party purposes, created certain polling places where it suited them, and had withheld polling facilities where they ought to have been granted. I invite the Government either to prove or to disprove that charge. In fairness to those whose honour has been reflected upon, they ought to do the one thing or the other. If the charge be true, every man in the late Administration ought to be branded throughout Australia as absolutely unfitted to occupy any place in the public life of the country ; but if the charge be not true - if there be no justification for it - I have no hesitation in saying that the man who made it ought to be drummed out of public life. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that, finding that there is no evidence whatever to justify such a charge, the honorable senator would like to make it appear to be a subject for jocularity. But I challenge honorable senators opposite, here and now, to make good their allegation. The Minister who was responsible for this particular work, in the late Government did exactly what was done by all previous Administrations, and followed the only course that was open to an honest administrator. That was to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the responsible officers. No Minister in the last Administration, nor,. I believe, in any previous. Administration, who had charge of this Department, attempted to dictate to the officers as ,to where polling places should be established. There is a member of this Senate, who was the Minister who initiated the policy which has been followed by all of his successors. He will be able to say whether what I am stating is not the truth. Let me point out, further, that if the charge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> were, true, and polling places were arranged in the manner he has described, it was his duty to make a statement to that effect at  the time: But there is not the slightest evidence in support of what he has said. He has been entirely actuated by a desire to vilify his political opponents. I invite Ministers to search the records of the Electoral Office, and to see if there is anything whatever to justify what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has said I think I am warranted in saying that no action whatever was taken by the official head of the Department with reference to the country officials under his control, except in so far as he was acting upon the advice of his responsible officers. I say, moreover - repeating my invitation to the Government - that they ought to search the records of the Department, and bring forward proof, if they can find any, in support of the charges to which we have listened. </para>

                        I have to say that, however strong his desire may be to revive a system, which I personally hope has disappeared for ever from Australia - namely, the electoral rights system - I cannot give him any support. I saw too many bundles of these documents in the hands of my political opponents to make me feel comfortable about the system. More than that, I suggest that the clause under consideration is hardly the proper place for the discussion of the subject. This is merely an index clause; it is not even an interpretation clause. Whether the words proposed are added or not, the term "Voting by Post " should be complete as a reference in itself.

                        <para>. - One would really think, judging by the amount of heat evoked during the discussion, in respect to the provision for the abolition of postal voting, that thousands of men and women will be disfranchised if the Bill becomes law. But everybody who has read the measure knows that little, if any, inconvenience will be caused. Rightly or wrongly, the Government believe that there will be considerable additions to the electoral rolls under this Bill. We believe that a larger percentage of votes will be recorded, and that there will be more facilities for recording votes under this Bill than exist under the present law. It is true that voting by post will not be permissible. Reasons have already been given why the Government are anxious to abolish that system. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is actuated by a desire to do his best for the electors, but nobody who has had any experience of electoral rights can be anxious to have that system restored. Undoubtedly, they were used as they were never intended to be used. </para>

But the Minister has not answered the statement that under the system proposed numbers of electors will be excluded from the exercise of the franchise. I do not think that at any time in the history of the development of the franchise, until now, in the Commonwealth, where we have absolute adult suffrage, any community has gone back on the progress made. The present Government are the first to ask Parliament to go back. These points were raised on the second reading, and have been emphasized in Committee; and, although the supporters of the Government are aware that it is intended by this Bill to deprive people of votes, by reason of their age and infirmity, they still persist with the proposal. The Minister in charge of the Bill has heard the reply of the Leader of the Opposition to a charge of corruption on the part of a previous Administration, and he has not a word to say. </para>

                            <para>- Entrenched behind the numbers opposite, the Minister of Defence can continue to smile all the time. But to-day is for honorable senators opposite, and to-morrow, possibly, for honorable senators on this side. . I have not had much parliamentary experience, but within my reading and experience of parliamentary usage and practice I never heard of a charge of corruption against a previous Administration, refuted by a Leader of the Opposition with a challenge to the Government to say how true it was, being left unanswered by Ministers. The Minister in charge of this Bill has resumed his seat without a single word in reply to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ; and his colleague, the Minister of Defence, smiles at the position. </para>

One of his supporters made a charge against a past Government of administering the Act corruptly. The Leader of the Opposition, who was a member of that Government, asks that that charge shall be substantiated. </para>

                            <para>- May I remind the Minister of the old proverb, " Silence gives consent' ' ? He has consented by his silence to the charge. He will not, or cannot, refute it, and he will not even go so far in connexion with a matter affecting parliamentary honour, as well as the honour of the Government, as to say that he will look into it. If this is the way in which the franchise is to be handled, and criticism from this side is to be met, deliberation in Parliament becomes a farce. </para>

This matter, which should be conducted entirely free from party considerations, is being made the strongest  of party issues. During the debate, the grossest charges of personal, as well as Ministerial corruption, are made, abuse of the postal voting system is alleged, and when no notice is taken of criticism, we have a right to ask whether Parliament is to be a deliberative assembly or a place in which, when the word goes forth from those who have the numbers behind them, a measure is to go through whether it is right or wrong, just or unjust. This is putting the franchise as it used to be put before - practically at the point of the bayonet. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that no one is trying to make a fool of himself. There is one thing which stands out very prominently in the discussion on this Bill. In Queensland, and probably also in the other States, it is the practice to proclaim polling booths in certain State institutions in which the aged and infirm are gathered together, so that by walking only a few yards, they may be able to record their votes. That practice is adopted at Dunwich, in Queensland, where there are, perhaps, over 1,000 aged and infirm people. Similar facilities should continue to be given to such people. It ought not to be a crime in the eyes of the State to be poor, and it ought not to be a cause of punishment that one is infirm. If we give 1,000 or 10,000 aged and infirm persons gathered together in public institutions facilities for recording their votes by providing polling booths at their very doors, surely we should extend a similar privilege to the aged and infirm who are not gathered in such institutions. The Minister will not take the trouble himself, nor will he give us the necessary time', to consider some amendment which, in the face of the alleged abuses of the postal voting system, would provide necessary facilities for such persons to record their votes. </para>

                            <para>- Then in a deliberative assembly, those in power should speak, and those whose duty it is to criticise should not talk at all. The fiat has gone forth in this matter of postal voting, and the Minister refuses by one word to- meet the challenge thrown out by the Opposition. In this particular case where a charge has been made he will not say he thinks that it is unfounded, or that he will inquire into it. It is characteristic of the method in which this thing is being bludgeoned through. It may be said that it is futile to speak, as it is impossible to get the Ministry to alter their decision, but still one must persist, because some of what is said will leak out, and some of it will be considered by the people outside. Apart from the injustice that the Government are doing knowingly, and without a shadow of defence for their shameful act, not one scintilla of evidence has come from the Ministerial side to support the charges that have been made. </para>

                            <para>- I will now proceed with another point. I have sometimes complained to the Department officially with regard to its administration of some portions of the Electoral Acts. I think the centralized administration which has prevailed for such a number of years has made the officials, and sometimes the Ministers, unable to appreciate the vast difficulties people in the back-blocks have to overcome in order to exercise the franchise. We have in our country as large a territory as Great Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, with some other place thrown in, and only one small portion is settled. Settlement is going slowly but surely into the back-blocks, and it is an absolute impossibility, without spending hundreds of thousands of pounds, to provide polling places in those parts into which settlement is gradually going. Under the present Act a person residing over 5 miles from a polling booth is able to vote by post. Is there any one in his senses who is prepared to say that that is not exactly what ought to be done? Here is a rather extraordinary position. The Ministry have provided that every adult person in Australia who is away from his or her division on polling day, if strong enough to get to any polling booth anywhere in the Commonwealth, shall be allowed to vote. At first sight that is a generous application of further voting facilities. I have no objection to that under proper safeguards. The Ministry give to persons who are strong and healthy, who may be thousands of miles away from the division in which they are enrolled, the opportunity to vote; whereas persons who are in their division, but who are 30 or 40 miles away from a polling booth, are being deprived of' an opportunity of voting. It frequently happens that a man and his wife have a farm 5 or 6 miles away from a polling booth. It is absolutely impossible for the woman to. leave her children and go with her husband to vote. Either the man or his wife must stay at home for the purpose of looking after the household, and because of that, one of them is deprived of the opportunity of voting. On the other hand, able-bodied men and women who are travelling are to be allowed to vote at any polling booth. These people may be about to shake the dust of Australia off their feet, and they may be able to vote just before departing, whereas thousands of people in Australia who are bound to their little farms or holdings, will not be able to vote. In those cases either the wife or the husband must stay away from the polling booth to look after the household. If we disfranchise only a dozen people we do an injustice to that dozen people. We know that it is a physical impossibility for hundreds of men and women to get to the polling booths. The Ministry practically say to those people, "' If we concede to you the privilege of using a postal vote properly, and of using it without the slightest undue influence, other persons will abuse it or use it corruptly." To take away the right of a man or a woman to vote is to inflict the greatest political or social injustice that can be inflicted on that man or woman. It is "utterly ridiculous for the Ministry to pretend that in this Bill they are acting in consonance with the spirit of Democracy or the spirit of the Constitution. Time after time we have asked, " Give us specific instances of abuses under the postal voting system." If the Ministry were to give those specific instances of abuse, the Committee might be able to devise some conditions by which those abuses would be guarded against. We have asked for specific instances, and we have had charge after charge made, and those charges have broken down. Then the last refuge is the suggestion of personal corruption - first, through one's self; second, through one's party ; and finally and most dastardly, through the Government which we supported. Surely the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Minister has some reason for his action in introducing this proposal. Apparently he is going to bludgeon it through in the face of this criticism. Let us take it that there are 30,000 postal votes exercised at an election. By passing this clause we will actually disfranchise a number of electors equal to a large constituency. The average constituency has under 30,000 electors. In connexion with the representation of the back-blocks electorates, which is most important to us, not a shadow of proof of any charge of abuse has been put forward. It is at the people in those electorates that this clause strikes. By this clause settlers in the back-blocks, and especially the small ones, with 300 or 400 acres, who are some distance away from a polling booth, will be deprived of the opportunity of voting. </para><interjection>

It does not matter whether or not the people in centres of population have abused the postal voting provisions, we ought to give every facility to the people in the back-blocks to record their votes. Abuses of the postal voting provisions may have been perpetrated in Melbourne or other places, but is that any reason why we should flog the backs, politically speaking, of the sellers in the backblocks ? That is the statement of the Minister of Defence now. Say there had been three or four, or a dozen, elections upset in large centres of population owing to corrupt practices in connexion with the postal voting system, does the honorable senator say that that is a reason why people elsewhere should be punished ? Is not that a Chinese method of dealing out punishment? In China, if something goes wrong in the Customs at Hankow, they cut off the head of a man at Canton. What is the burden of the song of the Minister in charge of the Bill ? He said that something went wrong in Melbourne, and because of that he is going to punish the people in the country districts. Even at this late hour I ask the Government to withdraw the clause, and give us time to consider the matter, if the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is not acceptable to them. Their attitude towards the Opposition shows a spirit of almost Caesarism. I feel sure that the public will recognise that we on this side are standing by the franchise as it was laid down in the Constitution. I have not imported any political or party issues into the debate, I have charged no Government with corruption or failure to administer the Act, but I have pointed out that this measure will do a gross injustice to many persons. What have we got from the other side? Only smiles. There was a time when people had to' fight for the franchise, and when it was obtained it was so used as to make our Empire what it is. But this is the first time in the history of a constitutionally-governed country, either within or without the Empire, where the Government have sought to curtail a franchise based on adult suffrage, and to curtail it on such grounds as would be scorned and laughed out anywhere outside, say, of China, which has its own method of doing justice. </para>

                        <para>. - I confess that a serious pass has been reached when I have to recognise that after a trial of nearly nine years this method of enabling absent voters to record their votes on polling day has broken down. I can well remember, and it is "not many years ago, when it was the dream of very many progressive spirits in this country that a time would come when a method for enabling those who could not attend on polling day to vote would be devised by the Legislature. I can well remember that the Labour party in those days looked forward to a time when shearers and seamen would be accommodated with a means te vote, and that the privilege would be extended to those who, by reason of sickness or other disability, could not attend on polling day to record their votes. I think I can fairly claim that the Electoral Act of 1902 was passed largely, if not exclusively, by the assistance of the Labour party, and that a prominent object of that measure was to give an opportunity to vote to those who could not conveniently attend on polling day. I am sure that the most violent partisan, either here or outside, will not say that the great party which has possession of the Treasury bench to-day would have suddenly turned their backs on a policy which they had advocated for a long time, and hoped would work a lot of benefit, without having some very good ground for their decision. Not only did this proposal to give a fuller and freer franchise to the people originate with the Labour party, but it was advocated by them in season and out of season. </para>

It was not possible in that State in those days, and as a member of the Labour party I looked forward with ardent hope to the time when it would be possible. As the idea grew in popularity the Labour party continued to give an unfailing support to its enactment. Is it not strange, dien, that we should suddenly have turned our backs on a proposal with which we were so long associated, and from which we expected so much public benefit to flow ? </para>

                            <para>- It answers the point, I think, fairly well. If it has been possible in the past to enable ten persons to cast their votes by reason of a legitimate disability, and at the same time ten votes have been recorded which should not have been recorded, the ten voters whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> wants to safeguard have been disfranchised. The Opposition have been asking all along the line for proofs of abuse of postal voting. When the system was in full blast in Western Australia one vote was recorded in the name of a person who was an inmate of a gaol. At the same election votes were recorded for persons who had not been heard of for years, and persons who it was known were residing in South Africa. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> can coil' firm my statement that the scrutineers burst into a fit of laughter at the votes coming forward with the alleged signatures of these persons. </para>

On that occasion he receiver! about three postal votes to every two received by the Labour nominee. In fact, a person in .the western State has only "to recall the practice of postal voting in any division to be quite satisfied that an overwhelming majority of postal votes have been obtained by opponents of the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- I do not object to that. What I complain of is that postal voting has been associated with gross injustice for which- there was no warrant. Persons have, been employed to go round as postal vote officers, and as justices of the peace, to collect the votes of those who were not entitled to vote, and at the same time have used every possible means to win votes to their side. We know that undue influence has been exercised over and over again by those who were sent out to collect votes. It was because of this practice that the Labour party came to the conclusion that, in the interests of a pure and clean system of politics, postal voting should be wiped out once and for all. I want to draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> to the fact that so long as he helps to maintain a system under which votes can be cast in a direction which the owner does not intend, so long will he be a party to a system which will to some extent disfranchise those who would have their votes cast in a legitimate way. Hitherto the Labour party have been very staunch supporters of this system, from which they expected great benefits to flow. It has had a trial for nine years, and one unfailing result has been that it has been associated with practices of a most questionable kind. While I recognise that there will be hardships inflicted under this clause, still we shall secure that greater benefit of a purer, a cleaner, and a more systematic recording of votes in the future than has been our experience in the past. I was once a believer in postal voting ; but as one who has watched its Operation and noted its results, although we could not get positive evidence of abuse and misuse, I feel perfectly satisfied in my mind that it is a system which ought to be abolished, and which must go. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to submit a matter for the consideration of the "Vice-President of the Executive Council. During his absence, when the Senate was in Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> made a statement, which was an accusation against the past Administration, of having appointed polling places, or withheld the appointment of such places, merely to suit its own party purposes. I then stigmatized that as a charge of corruption against the late Administration, and invited Ministers to take the necessary steps to put them into a position either to affirm the statement officially or to deny it. Neither of the Ministers then present responded to that invitation. I now invite the Vice-President of the Executive Council, as the merest piece of fairness which the Government can extend to their political opponents, to make inquiries in the Department, to search its records, and to take whatever steps they like to probe the matter to its depths, and say whether there is the slightest justification for this gross imputation upon the honour of their predecessors? </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seems to be so agitated that one would almost be compelled to think that there was something new in the statement that I made in Committee in regard to the polling facilities offered to the electors. What I said then I still maintain. I say that the electoral laws have up to the present time been absolutely ineffective in regard to the provision of facilities to vote for electors residing in many parts of Australia. I speak particularly in regard to my own State, where I know that polling facilities have not been granted in anything like the proportion that they ought to have been, if people were to have such opportunities of voting as were enjoyed by those who reside in the large centres. I know of large numbers of men, living in the bush, timber-hewing and following the usual avocations of bushmen, who have been denied those facilities for voting simply because their numbers, in the eyes of the administrators of the electoral law, were not sufficient to justify the establishment of polling booths at which they could exercise the franchise. </para>

                            has now tried to wriggle out of the charge which he made some time ago. He certainly spoke about the electoral laws, and complained that they had been administered to the advantage of parties opposed to his own. But he also said that polling places had been established, or had not been established, for the special purpose of obtaining votes for the party to which he is opposed, and of depriving the opposite party of voting facilities. It is a personal charge made against a previous Administration. That was taken up by the Leader of the Opposition. I hope that the matter will be cleared up, and that the Government will extend this measure of fair play to their political opponents.

I trust that the Governmentwill investigate this matter, because it is not only the honour of a previous Administration that is at stake, but the honour of the officers of the Commonwealth Electoral Department. Honorable senators know that polling places are fixed on the recommendation of the returning officers, after being submitted to the Chief Electoral Officer, and that these officers, and not the political head, are responsible. The political head of the Department really knows nothing whatever about it. </para>
