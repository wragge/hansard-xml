                    <para>.- I desire to draw the attention of the Committee, and particularly of the Minister of Defence, to two facts. We understand from a communication made to the Chamber that the Western Australian Government have intimated their willingness to revive in its entirety the Act of  1903,  which sanctioned the construction of this railway. That will not meet our requirements, because this is a Bill authorizing the construction of one railway, whereas the Act of  1903  was drafted and passed on the assumption that the Commonwealth was going to construct two railways, namely, the one under review, and one from Port Eucla to intercept the main line. I do not remember the exact verbiage of the State Act, but it affirmed that upon the Commonwealth commencing to construct the said railways, Western Australia would do so-and-so. It is a technical point which I have no doubt the Western Australian Government will put right. What we want in their authorizing Bill is the substitution of " this railway" for "railways." Otherwise it will leave a technical loophole which would render nugatory the whole effect of the Act. I hope that the Minister has grasped my point. This clause provides that the construction of the railway shall not be commenced until the two States have agreed " to grant such portions of the Crown lands of the State as are in the opinion of the Minister necessary for the purposes of the railway." The engineer on whose advice in engineering matters the Government are content to rely has recommended that there should be along each side of the route a reserve half-a-mile wide with special reserves for platforms, yards, and station buildings, and in the sandhill country a reserve 10 miles wide. He affirms that a larger area is necessary owing to the character of the country. He points out that it is fairly settled and firm in its natural condition, but once it is subject to the action of stock it will become broken up and will be subject to every passing wind with the result that it will cause a great deal of trouble which will mean expense in the maintenance of the railway. We have an idea as to what the most favorable State Government regard as a sufficient area to concede to the Commonwealth for these purposes. The Act passed provided for the cession of an area only 3 chains wide along the line of route. I should like to know whether the Government regard as sufficient the area offered so far by the Western Australian Government, or whether they are prepared to strive for an area more nearly approximating to that recommended by their consulting engineer. It is, I think, of very considerable importance that the Committee should have some knowledge as to what is in the Ministerial mind. We have the report of the engineer recommending much more than the State has granted. Under the Bill the whole matter is left to the Minister, but I feel sure that it would be a satisfaction to the Committee, irrespective of the views which honorable senators take as to the main proposal, to know that the permanent interest of the line - and by that I mean the permanent interest of the country - will not be sacrificed to an undue desire to rush the line through, and that some effort will be made to obtain such area of land as in the opinion of the Government expert adviser is absolutely necessary. </para>

                <para class="block">Act of 1903 was only received on Wednesday last, and immediately I drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that that Act only provided for the cession of 3 chains of land along the route. The Commonwealth Government had decided to ask for what the consulting engineer recommended, namely, an area half-a-mile wide on either side of the line, and so much additional land as may be required for legitimate railway purposes or water supply. As regards the sandhill country, we propose to adopt the suggestion of the consulting engineer, and to ask for the area of land referred to by the honorable senator. Undoubtedly the Government will make representations to the Government of Western Australia, and as regards the sandhill country to the Government of South Australia. I have not the slightest doubt that both Governments will be quite willing to meet us in that regard. I think that the provision for the cession of 3 chains to the Commonwealth was put in the measure simply because it was thought that that would be sufficient for the line, and not because the State would stand in the way of granting additional land. </para>

It has been a cardinal part of the policy of the Labour party that in connexion with railway construction a certain area of land on either side of the line should be reserved for railway purposes. This is a policy which the Federal Parliament, having now a Labour majority in both Houses, may put into practice. But what do the Government propose to do? The Western Australian Government propose to give .the Commonwealth 3 chains on either side of this line. I never heard of a more ridiculous proposition in my life. At most, the Government propose to insist upon an area of half-a-mile wide on each side of the line, as suggested by the engineers. I have often said that I do not think that this country is worth much. But I remind honorable senators that my opinion has been overruled by an overwhelming majority. Other honorable senators appear to believe that the country is valuable, and, if it is, I put the position before them. The people of Australia are going to build this railway, and if the country through which it will pass is any good, it will be largely enhanced in value by the building of the railway. Who would be entitled to that increase of value? The Labour party have always contended that any increase of value brought about in that way belongs to the people who build the railway. If the land along the line is increased in value by its construction, that increase of value will not belong of right either to the people of Western Australia or of South Australia, but to the people of the Commonwealth. No man can gainsay that. The Government, however, propose to hand over the community-created value in this case, should it ever arise, to the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia. A weaker abandonment of Labour policy I never heard of in my life. I hope I shall never hear the like of it again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie may sneer, and laugh, and scoff , but that will not alter the fact one iota. Every Labour man who knows his business has been contending for the last twenty years for this principle, and now when a Labour Government have an opportunity to put it into practice, they shamefully abandon it. I am raising my protest. My hands are clean so far as this matter is concerned. I shall not be satisfied if anything less than 25 miles on each side of this railway is granted. I consider that a fair proposition. </para>

                        <para>- My Scotch friend says " We will not get it . " Perhaps he will say what we are going to get, and what he thinks we are entitled to. Here is an honorable senator who was returned to this Parliament on Labour principles. He signed the Labour platform, and, I believe, that when he did so it was something more to him than the taking of his pen in hand and the writing of his signature. I believe that the Labour platform is engraven on the heart of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell. But it may be in his heart, and yet not in his head., I am afraid the honorable senator's head is, in this matter, rather at fault. All that the Western Australian Government proposes to give us is 3 chains of land on either side of the line. What remarkable liberality. We have a Labour Government in power in Western Australia also. They are bound by the same principles as we are, and have been advocating the same policy. But apparently they are very careful not to put that policy into practice. They consider that it would be altogether too fine a thing to hand over this community-created value, which, if some honorable senators are to be believed, will be very large, to the people of Australia. The Government of Western Australia say, in effect, "We will allow the people of Australia to spend ^5,000,000 in building a railway through our territory, but we will not allow them to receive the increased value which will be added to the land along the line by the construction of that railway." The South Australian Government, which is also a Labour Government, say the same thing. Presumably they are both in agreement with the Labour axiom that whatever value is created by the expenditure of public money belongs to the people who find! the money, and not the people of the particular locality in which it is spent. The people of Western Australia and South Australia are, in this case, as much the people of a locality as if they were under a divisional board, a shire council, or a municipality.  I do not suppose that anything I can say will stem this current. </para>

With regard to the first, the Minister has since had an opportunity of referring to the Western Australian Act, and we have his assurance that the attention of the Government will be directed to the necessity of preventing any difficulty arising later on.

                        <para>- For the purposes of the railway, yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must recognise the difference between what he is striving for and what I sought to attain by my amendment, and the reservation of a sufficient area of land for railway purposes only. The two things are quite distinct. It is very gratifying to know that the Government will ask for an area for railway purposes approximating that recommended by the engineers. </para>

                        <para>- I invited the Senate yesterday to delay matters until these negotiations were completed, but honorable senators would decline to accept that suggestion, and we are now necessarily compelled to leave matters to the Government. In the circumstances, it is a great relief to me to know that the Government will in no case accept the original offer of the Western Australian Government, but will make an effort to obtain a reservation approximating the recommendation of the engineers. I assume that that means that they will ask for the area recommended, but will not refuse an offer approximating it, whilst, on the other hand, they will not accept the very meagre proposal contained in the original Western Australian Act. Three chains in that country is absolutely insufficient for ordinary railway purposes, and especially in the sandhills country. I have had opportunities of observing the effect of stocking on this class of country in the north-west corner of New South Wales. Undoubtedly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dean's</inline> surmises, without any stock, and that means without even rabbits, such country retains some appearance of soundness. </para>

If any objection is raised to the proposal to secure a sufficient area along the route of this line for railway purposes, and to reduce the cost of maintenance, it can only be with the express purpose of defeating the proposal now before us. I take it, from the statement we have heard, that we can rely upon it that the Government will not be content with an area so insufficient as that provided for in the Western Australian Act, and will insist upon our being treated in a more generous spirit than is disclosed in that Act. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that, but we cannot get all that we want, and I am more moderate than the honorable senator, with whose remarks I quite agree. The unearned increment attached to land in consequence of public works should go to the Government which pays for those works. Some people do not understand the .difference between 10 square miles and 10 miles square. Allow me to mention that 10 miles square means 100 square miles. Therefore if my suggestion is adopted, it will mean that the Commonwealth will acquire 103,300 square miles, or 66,112,000 acres. My impression is that in course of time the land as a whole will be honestly worth at least is. 3d. an acre. </para>

                        <para>- Many people think that the land is valueless. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker held that opinion. I have a more hopeful belief in the future of Australia. If the land which I propose to acquire be worth is. 3d. per acre, we shall obtain over  £4,000,000  towards the cost of the railway. I understand that some pressure has been brought to bear upon certain honorable senators to induce them to refrain from supporting this proposal, for fear that the two States which will be principally benefited will not give us any land beyond that which is provided for in other portions of the Bill. But I shall certainly divide the Committee on the proposal. The total length of the line is 1,063 miles. Subtracting 15 miles from each end - 30 miles altogether - and we are left with 1,033 miles. Converting that area into acreage, it amounts to 103,000 square miles. I am not sure whether it would not be larger than the whole State of Victoria: </para>

If that be the proposal, why take up the time of Parliament with such a Bill as this? Why not say to the States, "We will lend you  ,£4,000,000,  and take that land as security." That may be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> idea of how the Commonwealth should build a line, but it is a peculiar one.

                        <para>- I cannot accept such an amendment. It is altogether opposed to the idea of the Commonwealth constructing the line. Either the Commonwealth is prepared to build this railway or it is not. If it is prepared to do so, it should pay for the work. If it is not prepared to pay for the railway it ought not to construct it. If the principle which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> enunciated ought to be followed in this instance, it ought also to be followed in connexion with every Commonwealth work. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> want the railway from the Federal Capital to the port at Jervis Bay to be constructed on tie same principle? </para>

                        <para>- This is a Bill for building a Commonwealth railway over State areas. It is not a proposal for acquiring State lands. I think that when honorable senators consider these facts, they will see that what we are doing is different from the action of a Government which constructs a railway which adds value to private land. The Commonwealth is in a different position towards the States from that of States towards private individuals. The Committee would be very ill-advised if it acted towards any State as a State may be justified in acting towards private persons. </para>

                    <para>. -  I shall not enter minutely into the merits of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment, which asserts the principle that the Commonwealth should acquire any value that may be created by the construction of this railway with Commonwealth money. I entirely agree with him. As this railway must benefit two States, and as the people of Australia are going to advance the money to build the line, those two States should give some security or guarantee for the repayment of some portion of the money.. Surely that principle is sound. I agree with much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said. My opposition to this line was not so much directed against the project itself, as against the unsatisfactory condition under which the railway is proposed to be built. There is not sufficient genuineness in the demands of South Australia and Western Australia unless those two States readily concede something of the principle that when we advance them between ,£4,000,000 and £6,000,000 to build a railway, the people of Australia who find the money shall have some sort of guarantee that in future years the Commonwealth will be recouped a portion of the expenditure incurred. I am not going to say that there are not some difficulties in the way of applying the principle of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment in connexion with future legislation, but at present I am inclined to support it. </para>

                        <para>- At present I do not believe that it would bring in much, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> estimates that at some future time it will be worth is. 3d. per acre. I have always understood that the Labour platform contained the principle that the community should reap the benefit of community-created interest. I have advocated that State Governments should construct railways ahead of population into unsettled lands suitable for settlement, whereby additional value would be given to unalienated lands, which would in the end mean that the lines would be built practically for nothing. In maintaining that principle, I have been a little in advance of the Labour platform. Something of the same kind is advocated now. There is no settlement in the country to be traversed by the line. No doubt some of the land will have a value in the future. By building this railway we shall create land values. If the land will only carry one sheep to  20  acres, the value will be considerable in time. It may be fifty years before the people of the Commonwealth get back the money they spend, and in the meantime they will have to bear a loss of  ,£70,000  or  ,£80,000  a year. We merely ask for fair dealing between the Commonwealth and the States. Surely it is fair that the Commonwealth should receive some portion of the value that it will create to recoup it for the money to be spent. If that had been provided for in the Bill I should have been far more satisfied than I am now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that that would not be a fair thing. But is it a fair tiling that the Commonwealth should provide the money with which to construct this railway, and that the States of South Australia and Western Australia should reap, not only the benefit accruing from that expenditure, but also the benefit of the enhanced values given to the land along the route of the line? If the States themselves were constructing the railway, they would, of course, be entitled to pocket the unearned increment. But they are not building the line. If the Minister urges that the area for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment stipulates would be more than sufficient to recoup the Commonwealth for its capital outlay, I am prepared to support a smaller area. But I desire to see the principle affirmed that the Commonwealth shall reap the benefit of the unearned increment. I do not think that the Minister of Defence should hurriedly turn down this proposal. I know that there are a great many honorable senators who share my views, notwithstanding the way in which they may vote upon this amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Whether the Commonwealth or the State gathers in this unearned increment does not affect the principle. The Commonwealth, the States, and the municipalities are merely different forms of government in this country. If we are to affirm the absurd idea put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> in regard to alternate blocks along the route of the proposed railway, when the Commonwealth constructs a wharf or a jetty, in the future, we shall be told that it must secure to itself the unearned increment. To carry the honorable senator's argument further, why should not the Commonwealth ascertain the exact amount of benefit which is being conferred upon Melbourne by reason of the Parliament meeting in this city? I repeat that we already have the power to secure for the Commonwealth the land values which it creates by the expenditure of its own money, if we choose to exercise it. We do not exercise it because there is no occasion for us to do so. The Government are embarrassed with riches. </para>

He said, in effect, "I am an unflinching advocate of the principle that the community-created values of land should belong to the community. Upon that rock I take my stand." But,, having taken is stand upon that rock, he immediately exclaimed, " But for Heaven's sake do not support the principle."

                        <para>- A great many hot advocates of principle are prone to regard as ridiculous any attempt to enforce principle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> went on to say that if we adopt this principle in respect of the proposed transcontinental railway we shall have to adopt if in respect to every minor public work. Simply because it is impossible for the Commonwealth to collect the trivial amounts of added value which may be given by Commonwealth expenditure to small works costing, perhaps, £100, he argued that we should refuse to collect that added value when we have a clean sheet upon which to start and everything in our favour. Nobody can dispute the proposition that the community which creates added values in land is entitled to those added values. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has affirmed that even if the Commonwealth does not collect this increment, the States or the municipalities will do so. Surely he must recognise that "the whole is not the same thing as a part, and that a part is not the same thing as the whole. It is the whole community and not" a portion of it which is entitled to these community-created values. I regret that I am not able to support the amendment. I regard it as an extremely objectionable and absolutely impracticable proposition. In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is confusing land with land values. I object altogether to the Commonwealth loading itself up with peacocked areas all over Australia. </para>

                        <para>- There, again, we have small areas which do not count. If the system advocated by the honorable senator be adopted in regard to this railway, I presume that it will be adopted in regard to other railways which will be built. Let my honorable friend consider the difficulty which surrounds his proposal that alternate blocks of 10 miles square shall be reserved to the Commonwealth. Each of them would contain  64,000  acres, and on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane'</inline> s estimate of the carrying capacity of the land, each would be capable of grazing 3,000 sheep. I say that it is absolutely impossible to get that country occupied in areas which will carry only 3,000 sheep. The cost of improving a block 10 miles square which will carry only 3,000 sheep would simply render the proposition an absolutely prohibitive one. Thus <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> would not only secure to the Commonwealth alternate blocks which would be perfectly useless, but his proposition would also render useless the adjacent blocks which will be held by the States. I think it is highly undesirable that the Commonwealth should take over land which will require settling later on, at any rate until it has dealt with the big proposition of land settlement which is contained in the Northern Territory. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> wanted to do was to suggest means by which the Commonwealth could be recouped for Commonwealth expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, I offered my honorable friend a means of getting, not the land, but the land value, but so anxious was he to recoup the Commonwealth that he could not see his way to adopt it. There is a broad difference to be kept in mind - the difference between land which ought to be left to the State and the claim which was put in yesterday and turned down by the Senate that the value added to the land, is a fair fund on which the Commonwealth might have levied. For the reasons I have stated, I am bound to vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I rather sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> for having so unwittingly drifted into the strange and uncongenial company in which he finds himself to-day. He is placed amongst some very curious bedfellows. If he will only look round he must recognise the old lion of insuperable opposition to this project in any shape or form. He must realize that honorable senators are pretending to support his proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> does not want the railway at all, but calls anathema every time it is mentioned, and only takes advantage of the proposal to get land for the purpose of thwarting, if not defeating, the object of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> does not want that I am sure. He has stood out in favour of the railway as the one refreshing, redeeming compensating gleam among the gloomy surroundings on the other side, but he comes forward now with a proposal to recoup the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> indulged in a cheer when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> set forth clearly and succinctly the object which he had in view. If that object be, to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> " to recoup the Commonwealth for the Commonwealth expenditure "- </para>

                        <para>- It simply means that although, if the railway has any object to serve at all, it is to assist the defence of the country, and to carry out an obligation that rests upon the Commonwealth, the States through which it is to be built are alone to bear the expense. There have been varying opinions expressed on the other side as to its usefulness for defence purposes. Is it right to expect that the two States in which the road will be laid should be called upon to pay the bill for securing a portion of the defence of this country in which every State must ultimately share? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> despite the most benighted state of his mind, agrees that the railway will be of use for defence purposes. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> also admit that the railway will have some use as an adjunct to the defence of the country, only he had some doubts as to what the route should be. This measure provides for a certain route, and if the honorable senator will admit that the railway will be of some assistance in the defence of the country, is it rational to expect that the two States in which that adjunct is to be laid should pay for the upkeep of the line  and recoup the Commonwealth its expenditure. He might as well expect Tasmania to pay for the forts erected in that State, or New South Wales to pay for the fortresses at Sydney Heads. </para>

                        <para>- That is a question of general policy. We know the honorable senator's views very clearly. We are specially indebted to .him for being frank on all occasions, and leaving no misunderstanding in the public mind as to what he is aiming at or drifting to. If we had more men of his calibre and stamp on the other side, many of .the misunderstandings would be cleared away, and the people of this country would be benefited very considerably indeed. They would find men of his style and stamp, aye, and steadfastness, to call a spade at all times a spade. He has recognised that the construction of this line is an obligation upon the Commonwealth. I advise him to kick his present bed-fellows out of the bed at once, and to come forward in his true light as an advocate of the discharge of this obligation, and to particularly refrain from asking the two States concerned to foot the bill.  His  amendment opens up big possibilities. If it is carried, what is to prevent a similar claim being raised in connexion with the railway to connect the Federal Capital with Jervis Bay ? Nothing, because the two proposals are on all-fours. When the latter proposal is made, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> must, if he is consistent, insist upon New South Wales giving up a further portion of her territory in order to compensate herself for building the connecting railway. </para>

It is altogether unfair, I submit, for the honorable senator to ask Western Australia and South Australia to contribute towards the construction of that line. We might as well ask Queensland to pay more than its proportionate share of the defence of Thursday Island. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> agree to a proposal of that kind? No. He would be like a howling Dervish if it were ever made here. </para>

I have noticed that he has never done anything except to be here at all times when the interests of Queensland are concerned; and for him ,to turn round and tell me that I have never voted on these questions is a misrepresentation of the grossest type. If it is conceded that this railway is an integral portion of the defence scheme, it is wrong to ask that the two States ir. which it is built shall pay the cost. If, on the other hand, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has admitted, there is an obligation upon the Commonwealth to build the line, it has no right to send in the bill to those States. </para>

                    <para>. - The attempt to represent this proposal as part and policy of the Labour party is undoubtedly very clever. But there is a very simple test which can be applied to ascertain whether those who support the amendment really believe what they are trying to represent. If this is a proposal which is in the forefront of the Labour platform, and about which Labour men are very much in earnest, why are those who so repeatedly oppose any proposition in favour of the unearned increment going to the State or the Commonwealth so enthusiastic on this occasion? That is, I think, about as good a test as we can apply to these honorable senators. The question of the unearned increment does not arise in this case, because the land over which the railway is to be built is still in the possession of the States. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that the States have the power to impose land taxation for the purpose of taking back some, of the unearned increment which they consider has been created by the expenditure of State money. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the honorable senator agrees with me. He is in favour of the direct taxation of land by municipalities, and he is also, to a very large extent, in favour of the State taxing land. Let us inquire whether this proposal does affect the Labour platform. Suppose that the Commonwealth takes possession  of these blocks. Of what use will the land be? I do not wish to see the Commonwealth or the State taking any profit out of the land for a considerable number of years. The policy of the Victorian Labour party is that, in the early years, the land occupied by the grazier, or the pastoralist, or the agriculturist should be as free as possible from taxation. If I had my way, </para>

                <para class="block">I would give all this land absolutely . free for, at least, twenty years to any man who was willing ,to take it up and make use of it. We have had a practical test of land settlement in Victoria. For the last fourteen or fifteen years we have tried the loading principle, but it has absolutely broken down, because it was partial in its application. For the men who took up the good lands throughout Australia, railways were built, increasing the value of their properties. Then when we came to deal with inferior lands, we made a partial application of the principle which, undoubtedly, should have been applied earlier to the good country. It has been found after fourteen or fifteen years of the application of this principle that it has actually retarded settlement in Victoria. The people who are now seeking land have not much money, and they are asked to compete on land that is loaded because of the construction of a railway with people who already possess land and wealth, and who are under a similar disadvantage. For this reason it has been found that the loading principle partially applied has had the effect of retarding settlement. Within the last three months an Act was passed in the Victorian Parliament with the unanimous support of all parties abandoning the principle of the loading of land because of railway construction in the early days of settlement. That was supported by the Labour party, who believe in the loading principle. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the people whom- we should desire to settle on the land are those with families who are determined to make a home for themselves on the land. To secure the settlement of such people, I believe that it would be the best policy for both State and Commonwealth to give them land free for a time from all rates and taxes. There are two factors in producing the unearned increment. The building of a railway without the attraction of additional population will not add much to the value of land. The building of this railway may enable people settled along it to get produce and stock to market. This will attract population, and may possibly create a local market by which considerable value will be added to the land. If it is found possible to graze sheep on this country, it can easily be seen that Kalgoorlie, requiring a better food supply, will provide a good market for those who take up this land. It is in this way that an increased value will be added to the land. If it be contended that the Commonwealth is going to create all the unearned increment by the building of the railway, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> should propose, not that the Commonwealth should be given alternative blocks along the line, but that it should be given every acre of land the value of which will be improved by the construction of the line. We know that if the honorable senator made such a proposal as that, honorable senators on his own side would be against it. </para>

                        <para>- Even supposing this land were sold, it should be remembered that we have Labour Governments in power in the two States immediately concerned, and they will not be neglectful of the public interests. The Commonwealth should either take over the whole of the land or none. Either the Commonwealth should build the railway, or the States of Western Australia and South Australia should build it. We decided yesterday that the Commonwealth should build the railway for defence and other reasons, apart from land settlement. I say that we should leave the land to the States unless we have absolute control over it. Honorable senators will remember that there was considerable objection to the Commonwealth taking land at Jervis Bay, in respect of which it would be in the position of an ordinary private land-holder in New South Wales.. I do not desire that the Commonwealth should take up land in that way, but I do desire that the Commonwealth, the State, or a municipality  should apply the principles of taxation on unimproved values. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> believed in that principle he would not be so enthusiastic about the partial application of it which he proposes in his amendment. </para>

                    has just said that he does not believe that the Federal Government should take possession of lands in any of the States under the conditions applicable to private persons. On the other hand, honorable senators recognise that it is reasonable that the two States immediately interested in this proposal should contribute something to the cost of the construction of this railway.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline>
                    in his amendment, indicated that as one of the propositions on which he desired further information. He asked that correspondence should take place between the States concerned and the Commonwealth Government, in order to ascertain to what extent and in what way they would be prepared to assist in the construction of the railway. It is beyond contention that the people of South Australia, and particularly of Western Australia, are anxious that the line should be constructed. It was contended that its construction was one of the conditions which induced the people of Western Australia to enter the Federation. It is abundantly clear, therefore, that this is a matter of great moment to the people of that State.

                        <para>- I am at issue with the honorable senator on that point. I admit that the railway will be a national undertaking, and of value to the whole of the Commonwealth ; but it will be of special value to South Australia and Western Australia, because it will be constructed within their territories, and will promote settlement. If two men combine to carry out a certain undertaking which will be of greater benefit to one than to the other, is it not fair that the one who is to derive the most benefit should contribute more than the other to the cost? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> argues that if this principle be applied to the proposed railway, it should also be applied to a railway from the Federal Capital to Jervis Bay. But there is this distinction between the two : Western Australia is anxious to have this railway built for the opening up of its territory, and to secure communication with the eastern States. But the line to connect the Federal Capital with Jervis Bay is not urged by New South Wales. Its construction will be solely for the benefit of the Commonwealth. New South Wales was in no way bound under the terms of the Constitution to grant any land for the purpose of connecting the Federal Capital with the coast. It was pointed out that it would be an advantage to the Commonwealth, and would assist in the settlement of the Federal Capital question, if the Commonwealth were given rights over a certain area of New South Wales land for the purpose of the construction of a line from the Federal Capital To Jervis Bay. The New South Wales Parliament did not care whether we built that railway or not, so that no parallel can be instituted between the two cases. Many years ago the people of British Columbia were very dissatisfied with their condition of absolute isolation from the eastern portion of Canada, and there was talk at one lime of their seeking admission to the American Union. The Canadian Government, in the circumstances, decided to take steps to provide communication between the east and the west of Canada. How was it done? The Government did not undertake the construction of a railway, but they got the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to undertake the work upon certain conditions. The company received grants of land in alternate blocks along the route of the proposed line. Many of the blocks were and. are but of little value, but many others are very valuable. In addition to the grants of land, the Canadian Government assisted the company, in the construction of the railway, with large sums of money. The railway was constructed, and the country opened up very much to the advantage of Canada, and of the Canadian Pacific Company .. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> does not ask that the land which he proposes should be reserved for the Commonwealth should be exempt from taxation. He says that this land, which is to-day comparatively worthless, will, by the promotion of settlement along the line, be given some value. We know that depôts must be established, even for the maintenance of the line, and settlement will be attracted, if only to provide for the wants of railway servants. The probability is that towns will grow up along the route of the railway, and is it not reasonable that the Commonwealth, whose expenditure will lead to the establishment of these towns, should participate in the increased value given to the land ? The Minister of Defence has himself admitted that a reasonable area should be granted to the Commonwealth, and has objected to the proposition of Western Aus.ralia to grant only 3 chains on either side of the line. Such a reservation, even though it might be sufficient for railway purposes, would not lead to the establishment of towns along the line. </para>

                        <para>- I do believe in State rights, and in justice and fair play between the States and the Commonwealth. The rights of the States, and also of the Commonwealth, under the Constitution, should be observed. It should be remembered1 that the Commonwealth is under no statutory obligation to build this railway. It is entirely within its own option. But if the Commonwealth, determines to do this work, surely it is a matter of common justice that the railway should be constructed on fair and reasonable conditions. I know that a proposition has been made to the Government by a great firm of engineers, who are quite capable of carrying on any work of the kind to which they put their hands, to construct this railway on certain terms and conditions. One of the features of the proposal is that they shall take land and debentures as part payment for the work. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but, of course, we could not expect a firm to undertake a public work unless they were going to make some profit out of it. I say nothing about the terms, but the fact that such an offer has been made shows the value of the Commonwealth having land for the purpose, possibly, of negotiating with such a firm. If, on the other hand, it be determined by the Government themselves to construct the line, they should have some land in their possession with which to recoup themselves. It is said that we have the power of taxation. But we cannot tax Crown lands. Our land tax simply affects alienated lands. It is not until land has been alienated by a State that it becomes liable to Commonwealth taxation. If the Commonwealth had a considerable portion of the lands traversed by the railway, it would be a means of obtaining additional revenue. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment. Personally, I should have preferred to see something like the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> adopted, under which a proportion of the added value given to the land should go to the Commonwealth to recoup it for some of the expenditure incurred in constructing the railway. </para>

                        <para>- I know ' that it is a difficult matter, but we are not now discussing methods. If I cannot get the proposition which I should prefer, I am prepared to accept the other. It is for Parliament to say whether it is a workable proposition. I know that it has worked in other parts of the world. It has been practicable in connexion with the Canadian-Pacific railway, where it has recouped the railway company for the expenditure incurred in building the railway through Canada. A great deal of the land traversed by that line is comparatively worthless even to-day, but a portion of it has been proved to be much more valuable than was imagined some years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> observes that statistics show that these big blocks of land will only carry flocks of about 3,000 sheep. But we are told that the railway will develop not only pastoral, but also agricultural and mineral country. We certainly have to recognise that much of the country that is to-day worthless will, by means  of  the railway, have some value given to it. By the application of the dry farming system of cultivation the value of the land is likely to be still further augmented, and much that is now regarded as valueless will undoubtedly turn out to be useful. I do not claim that because some honorable senators belong to the Labour party it is their duty to support the amendment. It is for them to decide whether the amendment is in the best interests of the country. If they think it is, their duty as honest men is to vote in favour of it. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment because though I hold with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it would be to some extent unworkable, I nevertheless believe that the Commonwealth ought in some way to obtain a return for the enormous expenditure that is to be incurred. It is not only the cost of the construction of the railway that we have to consider. There will also be the cost of maintenance, between£80and£90 per mile in the first two or three years. That cost will increase largely, until in the course of time, owing to renewals, it will become nearly double that amount. Then there will be the interest on the cost of construction, some £140,000 a year; and, in addition, the loss on the actual running. Altogether the expenditure will be so great that I consider that we should not be doing our duty if we did not endeavour to secure from the two States which are going to be benefited some return to recoup the people of the Commonwealth. No consideration has been given to the other States. The interest of South Australia and Western Australia only have been regarded. Some States will have to incur the cost of the conversion of their own lines later on to bring their gauges into conformity with the gauge generally prevailing throughout the continent. That expense has to be considered. I support the amendment also because it is but fair that the Commonwealth should obtain a return for the money to be spent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J.

                        <para>- Victoria has never had any legislation under which the incremental value of land was returned to the State. The principle adopted some years ago was that where a district was obtaining a railway, and where, after reference to the Railways Standing Committee it was found that the traffic would not be sufficient to recoup interest, cost of maintenance and working, a guarantee should be obtained from the land-owners to pay so much per annum to make up the loss. ' That was all that was done. As soon as the traffic on the line increased, and it became payable, the embargo was taken away. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland) {12.22]. - When I raised my point of order I was not aware, sir, that you had given a ruling. Considering the late stage of the session, I shall not proceed to the extreme of dissenting from your decision. On the contrary, I shall obey it. I do not entirely agree with the amendment of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline>
                    but I shall vote with him as a protest against the way in which Commonwealth interests are being sacrificed. I hold that some security should be given to the Commonwealth by the States of Western Australia and South Australia in return for the assistance which it is rendering to them. If the speech- of the Minister of Defence last evening meant anything, we can only conclude that within a few years the so-called desert country through which the proposed railway will pass will blossom like a rose. The Minister had evidently felt the criticism to which the Bill had been subjected, and had prepared himself most carefully to reply to it. I venture to say that any intelligent stranger sitting in the gallery of this chamber last evening would, after having heard the Minister's speech, have been inclined to exclaim, " Why that country will become a second paradise !

                        <para>- This is the first criticism to which the clause has been subjected, and yet Ministers are as irritable as a child under punishment. I repeat that the strongest justification for the contention that Western Australia and South Australia should give the Commonwealth some security for the construction of the proposed line is afforded by the speech of the Minister himself. Judged in the light of his utterance, the country through which the railway will pass will prove to be valuable, and consequently we ought to insist upon the States which are most vitally interested in the matter giving some guarantee that the Commonwealth will be remunerated for this huge undertaking. Talk about blowing hot and cold, we have had a most outrageous example of it to-day. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment goes quite far enough. It is somewhat remarkable that when we discuss land values the members of the Labour party differ among themselves upon the very first and most elementary proposition in their platform. If it were not for the congested state of public business we would be justified in contesting every inch of the passage of this Bill. </para>

Neither the clause nor the amendment now before the Chair contains any reference to the question of defence. It was when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> was proceeding to elaborate his arguments on that question that I asked him to confine himself as closely as possible to the clause before the Committee. I pointed out that while it might have been quite within the Standing Orders for the honorable senator to make a passing reference te defence, he ought not to elaborate that aspect of the question, as it had already been fully dealt with in the debate on the second reading. I do not intend to give a ruling now on a. question which may arise later. I only confirm the ruling which I have already given, and that is that the question of defence is not mentioned in the clause under discussion, and therefore no general discussion on that question can be allowed. </para>

This is the clause which authorizes the carrying out of the work, and I submit that it is permissible for those who are supporting the clause to state reasons why this power is sought. One of the reasons why it is proposed to construct this railway is that it is necessary for the purposes of defence. Those who are in favour of the clause are justified in saying that they intend to vote for it because, amongst other things, the construction of the line is necessary for defence purposes. Surely it must be equally legitimate for an honorable senator to show that for such purposes the line is not wanted. </para>

The Government must get the business put through, and if such speeches are made, what is the alternative? We shall have to abandon the ordinary time for closing the sittings. I appeal to honorable senators to endeavour to shorten their speeches, and to deal more directly with the clause, so that we may be able to make more rapid progress. </para>

I cordially join with the Minister in asking honorable senators to assist in putting the Bill through, the main questions having Deen decided last night. But I cannot subscribe to the doctrine that our rights are to be curtailed by any precedent which may be established by the decision which you have given. </para>

As you are aware, I rose to reply to a personal attack by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> on the senators for Queensland - an attack in which he said that we object to the building of a railway which is to be used for defence purposes. The Minister of Defence did not object to that attack being made upon me, and, naturally, at the first opportunity I had I proceeded to reply to it. </para>

But immediately I began <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wanted to know if I was in order. I submit, sir, that if there is to be any discussion in Committee at all, this is the only clause on which T can raise the question of defence. Both last night and previously the Minister urged that this railway is to be built by the other States for the purpose of defending Western Australia. All that I proposed to do was to read from Lord Kitchener's speech a paragraph dealing with railways, but you immediately stopped me. The paragraph contains only six lines, and if you had allowed me to proceed the whole thing would have been done with. Last night the Minister had a chance to close the debate on the second reading, and he was as severe as he possibly could be on the opponents of this measure. Surely, sir, there is a time when we can reply to the references which he men made to the subject of defence. My objection to this measure is not confined to the defence point of view. We are asked to pay for the construction of the line, and we are told that its construction was recommended by Lord Kitchener for defence purposes. I propose to read a short paragraph, so that the Committee may know what he did say - </para>

                        <para>- I want to show that our reason for opposing the building of this railway is that it has never been recommended by any military authority. The Minister of Defence has military authorities at his service here, but he has never quoted one of them to prove that the railway is essential for that purpose. On the contrary, he has tried to put the blame upon a man who was not in the country, and has not prepared a report since the trial survey was made. I am opposed to the clause because it is contingent upon an Act of Parliament being passed by Western Australia. I shall keep closely to the clause, sir, and I hope that I shall not infringe the rules any more. In Western Australia, no Act has been passed consenting to legislation by the Common wealth Parliament with respect to the construction of the portion of the railway included in that State. Yet this clause takes power to the Commonwealth Government to build a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie before the Governments of the two States concerned have attempted to pass Acts of the kind therein referred to. It is proposed to give the Minister power to build the railway, and to be the sole judge as to the terms laid down by the State Parliaments. I object to that. I protest against any Minister or Ministry being invested with such great power. It was intended under the Constitution that whenever it was proposed to spend £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 on a public work, the Parliament should know definitely the grounds on which the proposal was based. It was never the intention  that the power to spend should rest solely in a Minister. Never before has such a large .power been asked for by a Minister in a British country. No Minister in these States, or, indeed, in any British Possession, has ever applied to Parliament for the power which the Minister of Defence now seeks. Of course, it suits the senators for Western Australia to pass the clause. I. suppose that if I represented that State I might hold similar views. </para>

                        <para>- I have not been flogging those States or their representatives. I am flogging only the Ministry, and those who support a Bill of this description. In my second-reading speech, I gave those honorable senators all the credit which I could possibly give them. In this clause there is not a word indicating what the Minister expects to get from the States concerned in the matter of a land grant. Is the Committee, in its sober senses, to give the Minister power to take either 3 chains or 6 chains of land along the route? Surely it is the duty of Parliament itself to say what area is required for the purposes of the line. Surely it is not the function of Parliament to leave the determination of that question solely to the Ministry ! When I see a provision of this kind in the Bill, I want to know why Parliament exists at ali This skeleton clause does not reserve to the Parliament an opportunity of saying whether or not it is satisfied with1 the terms arranged for by the Minister. We are asked to leave practically, everything in the hands of the Minister. We have no guarantee that the States interested will pass Bills dealing with the matter; and, if we are to judge by what we see in the press, the South Australian Government have no intention to pass such a measure this year. There is, therefore, no occasion to rush this proposal through the Senate. I 3o not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment, because it proposes a reservation in alternate blocks, and I think that the land right along the line should be reserved. But if we can get no better proposal from the Government, I must vote for the amendment, in order that there may be some guarantee that the money expended on this railway will be returned to 'the Commonwealth, and that the other States will get a share of the unearned increment created by the construction of the line. </para>

                        <para>- No; they were speaking in a representative capacity ; and that is why I said I was prepared to honour their promise by voting for the construction of .this railway. But that should not debar me from seeking information, and suggesting the adoption of safeguards. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment was moved, not for the purpose of wrecking the Bill, but for the very legitimate purpose of seeking further information with regard to matters affecting the proposal. It also laid down a principle which might very well be adopted .in connexion with railway construction by the Commonwealth. If that amendment had been carried, the passing of this Bill might have been delayed for seven or eight months. </para>

                        <para>- It should enable honorable senators to make up their minds as to the best route for the railway. The amendment was not moved with any intention to deny to Western Australia this means of communication with the eastern States. I am sorry that it was not agreed to, as, in my opinion, it would have been better for Western Australia, and for the proposed railway, if that amendment had been carried. « </para>

                        <para>- There is some similarity between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment and that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> We appear now to be in a very uncertain position. The Minister of Defence says, "I am going to ask the two States specially interested to give us more land. At present we have an offer of 3 chains on either side of the line. I am going to ask for half-a-mile on each side of the line." But the honorable senator does not say that if Western Australia and South Australia will not grant half a mile on each side of the line, the Government will not go on with the work. They will be in the position of being able to come back and say, " All the States would give us was a strip 3 chains wide on each side of the line, and we have had to accept that." I think they should be prepared to take up a stronger position. </para>

Let us, instead of saying, " Such portions of the Crown lands of the State as are, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary for the purposes of the construction, maintenance, and working of the railway," say, " A strip of land half-a-mile wide on either side of the line." If the Minister will propose such an amendment as that, I shall vote for it. </para>

                        <para>- We have had these gibes from honorable senators from Western Australia all through. They attribute to every criticism a desire to wreck the Bill. I cannot help what these honorable senators think. I am here to do what I believe to be best in the interests of the Commonwealth, and I am not here to be dictated to by honorable senators from Western Australia. I think that we ought to state in this Bill the area of land we require, and the minimum reservation that will satisfy us. The South Australian Parliament will not, I believe, pass any Bill dealing with this matter this session; and so it would not hurt if this Bill were postponed for a time. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence tol'd us that in his reply to the second-reading debate he would give us all sorts of information as to how the line would be constructed, whether by contract or day labour, and, if by day labour, whether the engineer would be given a free hand in carrying out the work. But he never said a word about these things in his speech in reply, and the questions asked on these subjects have not been answered yet. I shall not support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment for the reasons I have given; but I do think that we ought to state in this clause the minimum area of land we are prepared to accept. I believe that if we included in this Bill a condition that the States should grant a strip half-a-mile wide on either side of the line, they would do it. If the matter is left to them, they may pass legislation to give us only  3  chains if they like. If the Minister of Defence is sincere in his statement that he thinks we should have a strip half-a-mile wide on each side of the line, he will put that into the Bill, and South Australia and Western Australia would then know that if that were not considered the line would not be constructed. </para>

                    <para>. - Ordinarily I should be found in hearty accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment, because I believe that a very good principle lies at the back of it. That is, that when the general taxpayers provide money for a great enterprise such, as this, they should reap some of the added value given to the land, and some of the advantage accruing from the laying out of that money. It is a principle with which the party to which I belong has been associated ever since we have had a separate existence as a party. But the present circumstances are not ordinary. They are extraordinary. Would the acquisition of this land be of advantage to the Commonwealth? On the contrary, would not the acquisition of it add to the responsibilities of those who are spending the money ? Examining the question in the light of such information as is at our disposal, I am driven to the conclusion that, instead of it being an advantage to the Commonwealth to get this land, it would be a serious disadvantage and an added responsibility. I must oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment for that reason. If it were carried, what would the effect be? We should become possessed of an enormous quantity of land. The representatives of South Australia and Western Australia would then continually clamour for this Parliament to undertake huge expenditure to develop that land. Consequently the Commonwealth, instead of being saddled with the responsibility of an expenditure of  £4,000,000  or  £5,000,000,  with an annual deficit of from  £80,000  to  £100,000,  would possibly be required to spend another million or two every year. </para>

                        <para>- That difficulty does not concern me seriously, because the Commonwealth is already in possession of a large quantity of land, and we must necessarily provide machinery foi managing and developing it. If we acquired additional land along the route of this railway, it would not be a very serious added disadvantage to manage it also. But my great objection is that the land, instead of being a sort of recoupment, would be an additional burden. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> wish to dissociate myself from the idea that we must spend millions in settling people upon the poor lands of </para>

                <para class="block">Australia. As long as we have thousands and thousands of acres of good land in Australia - perhaps the best and most productive soil in the world - it seems to me to be a suicidal policy to howl about developing the poorer lands. Let us develop those enterprises which will give us a return of 50 per cent., rather than those which will involve us in a loss of 50 per cent. every year. Until we find that there is a shortage of good land upon which to settle people we ought not to bother about settling them on poorer areas. Heaven knows, the unfortunate pioneer settler has difficulties enough to contend with, without our manufacturing more for him; and, while we allow, with the one hand, the bowelless corporation and the soulless land-grabber to monopolize thousands of acres of the best land in. this country, it is foolish to talk about forcing settlers on to the poorer land. That is a policy of which I can never approve. </para>

But I do say that some members of the Opposition who are supporting the amendment are not actuated by the motives which have influenced the mover. </para>

                        <para>- Members of the Opposition are supporting this amendment with the object, if not of wrecking, at any rate of delaying the Bill as long as they can. When I see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> supporting a proposal for securing the unearned increment, as it is sometimes called, I am reminded that not very long ago, when we were dealing with another question, and some of us desired to secure to the Commonwealth Government a part of the unearned increment that would accrue from the establishment of the Federal Capital in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> resisted the attempt. He did not then desire that the Commonwealth should obtain a share of the added value that would be given to New South Wales lands by the establishment of the Federal Capital in that State. When the territory running down to Jervis Bay was granted to the Commonwealth, the "grant was designed with the object of securing that as much as possible of the increased value should be retained outside the Federal Territory. Two narrow strips were marked in such a shape that the area was likened to a pair of breeches. The object evidently was to increase enormously the value of State lands. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was the principal representative of the Government in the Senate when that measure was forced through. Not only did he endeavour to secure the increased land value to the State of New South Wales, but he insisted on retaining the increased water-values for that State, because New South Wales refused to allow the Commonwealth to get to low - water mark at Jervis Bay, insisting that our territory should stop at high-water mark. The honorable senators who supported him then are to-day crying out that the Commonwealth should get the increased value which they took no steps to secure to the Commonwealth then. I merely rose to point out the hollowness of the professions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers,</inline> who are to-day practically advocating the single-tax, simply because it suits them to delay the passing of this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon's</inline> amendment is intended to accomplish the same object. In the interests of his State he desires the measure to become law, but as a member of the Opposition he feels impelled to throw every possible obstacle in its way. That is the reason why the discussion of a single clause has occupied the whole morning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has now submitted an amendment, and avows that he has done so with the object of assisting the Government. I claim that I have assisted the Ministry to get the Bill through by abstaining from repeating arguments which have been advanced time and again. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators upon this side of the chamber, with a desire to expedite public business, had resolved to curtail their remarks this afternoon as much as possible. Our object was to assist the Government to carry this Bill to a conclusion, a division having taken place upon a vital amendment. But if we are to be treated to exhibitions of bombast and hypocrisy by those who have been chiefly conspicuous by their absence from the chamber while the Bill has been under consideration, this debate is not likely to terminate as speedily as we wish it to terminate. To ask us to remain silent while we are made the subject of electioneering attacks and of open misrepresentation, is to ask too much of human nature. We are prepared to help the Government to carry this Bill through. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> persists in his attitude it will be incumbent upon us to show the absolute falsity of his statements. But I do not wish to do that. If the honorable senator is as anxious to secure the passing of the Bill as he professes to be, he will cease from criticism- of that character. I wish now to suggest one reason why the Minister ought to recognise the necessity for standing firm, in his demand for a strip of country on either side of the proposed railway. It is obvious that if the country through which it will pass is to be occupied at all, it will be occupied by pastoralists. Now, it is impossible to have trucking stations every mile or so along this railway, and, therefore, it is necessary to reserve to the Commonwealth half-a-mile on either side of it, to enable stock to travel to the nearest trucking station. For that reason, I trust that, if the Minister will not accept the amendment, he will be adamant when dealing with the States in insisting that the condition which the amendment seeks to impose shall be complied with. </para>

But it appears to me that they treat honorable senators with contempt. On several occasions the Minister df Defence has spoken contemptuously of politicians. Probably he knows as much about politicians as does any man in the Senate, and perhaps he speaks with authority. But we are responsible to the country for the Government and for the proposed railway. I think, if those who are supporting the Government realize their duty to the community, they will place upon record their opinion in regard to the area of land which ought to be secured by the Commonwealth. They will say to the Ministry, " This is what we want you to get from the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia." </para>

                        <para>- That is my contention. But the Government do not seem to be like Moses. They do not want anybody to hold up their hands. They wish to enter into negotiations with the Governments of South Australia and Western Australia absolutely unfettered. They wish to be free to knuckle down to the extortionate demands of those Governments. The Western Australian Government has already shown its hand. It has offered us 3 chains of land along the route of» the proposed line. Does anybody imagine that the Commonwealth, when it enters into negotiations with that Government, will get any more than that? The Government of Western Australia knows perfectly well that the Commonwealth Government are anxious and eager to build this railway. I do not know why. They seem to be tumbling over themselves in their anxiety to embark upon an expenditure of £5,000,000, without any regard to what the consequences may be. Not only that, but they refuse to be assisted by the members of the Senate. Of course*, that is the fault of honorable senators themselves. If the Government choose to insult them by declining their advice, and if they are willing to take their gruel lying down, that is their affair. But it appears to me that we have a responsibility in regard to this railway greater than that of any Government, and I say that we are abandoning our responsibility by refusing to tie the hands of the Government in any shape or form. We ought to say what we think should be done. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows nothing whatever about Australia. He comes here and talks in the wildest and most ridiculous fashion. The engineers have recommended the reservation of half-a-mile on either side of the proposed line, and yet the Government of Western Australia has offered us  3  chains. I believe that, unless something is inserted in the Bill to tie the hands of the Government in this matter, the latter will agree to the reservation of the  3  chains. </para>

                        <para>- I am worrying about the expenditure of the country's money, and about securing the construction of this line upon good conditions. But the honorable senator only worries about getting  £5,000,000  expended in South Australia and Western Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> is worrying about nothing but that Tasmania shall get her whack of what is to be cut up. I ask honorable senators to take a serious view of the position. Are they going to shirk their responsibility to the country? Here we are entering upon a new and untried policy. We are asked to spend  £5,000,000  in a country about which nobody knows very much. It may turn out to be extremely fertile, or worth nothing, or something between the two. Nobody knows what it is. Being in that state of ignorance, honorable senators ought as representatives of the Commonwealth, to take their full share of the responsibility, and not to leave it to any Government, however worthy of confidence it may be. I do not suggest that the present Government is not worthy of confidence. But I would not trust any Government in a matter of this kind. I do not think that a Government ought to ask to be trusted. What the Government ought to do is to come down and say, "What do you want done? What do you think is fair? We are here as your representatives to act." Instead of doing that they say, " Give us a blank cheque. You have nothing to do with the matter except to see us through, whether we make a mistake or not." I refuse to accept the position into which the Government tries to thrust the members of the Committee. Every honorable senator has a responsibility to the country, and he ought to stand up to it. He should not try to shirk his duty. He should accept his responsibility in a manly fashion, and do his duty to the country in the way in which it ought to be done. </para>

                <para class="block">In re-submitting this amendment I have only a few words to say. Right through, I have looked upon this Bill as being above party. It is not a party measure at all. I have always been an advocate of this project, and equally have I always been an advocate that, if possible, the railway should be built on the land-grant principle. I think that my honorable friends opposite will credit me with sincerity in that respect. Last night, the Minister of Defence gave a glowing account of the future prospects of the land to be traversed by the railway.- It seems to me that in the circumstances, I was quite justified in hoping that some of the land would be available for part payment of the cost of construction, as we have received an offer to build the line, and take land in part payment. There was no intention to keep the land for an indefinite time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has made some remarks with regard to the principle of my amendment being applicable to the Jervis Bay railway. That point has been taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others, and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will see that the cases are not parallel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> of course, had his own views, and said that he was not going to vote with me. That is a proof that we on this side have a certain amount of independence. We are not working necessarily as one party in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and I have frequently been in a minority of two or three. Sometimes persons wonder how it is that we are found voting together. I have a distinct recollection that in the first session of this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and I were once in a minority of two, and that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> asked what new party it was, we replied that it was the party of fair play. I was very much obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> for laying emphasis on the advantages of the land grant railways in Canada and the United States of America. With all due deference to honorable senators, it is not an unwise proposal that part of the cost of this railway should come out of the land to be benefited by its construction. I do not intend to delay the Committee, because I wish to assist the Government to get the Bill put through. I hope that, whatever the result of the division may be, there will be no delay in the railway becoming an accomplished fact. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> credit for being actuated by high motives in the position which he is taking up ; although I must admit that I had hopes that when I got his friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> on my side, I might get himself too. </para>

                    <para>.  - I regret very much that the Minister is not only opposing this amendment, but is opposing an attempt on the part of the Senate to get for the Commonwealth Government, or for the people of Australia, any portion of the community-created increment, which will arise in consequence of die construction of this railway. The people of Australia are asked to spend £5,000,000 to build a railway through a portion of it. The Labour party has always maintained that, wherever values were increased by the expenditure of public money, the increases in such values were the property of the people as a whole, and not the property of any section of the people. In this Bill, we are dealing with Australian money to be spent in two portions of Australia. Undoubtedly, I think, if the statements of the advocates of the Bill are true, very large increases in values will take place by reason of the construction of the railway. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. We have heard a number of curious arguments. No doubt, honorable senators felt that they were up against  rather  a difficult position, and they tried to jump the fence in the best way they could, some of them in more or less ungainly fashion. The Minister of Defence said that it would be exceedingly improper for the Commonwealth to compel Western Australia and South Australia to pay for the building of this line through their own territories. Nobody has asked them to do so. I do not admit for a moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment is a perfect proposal, but it does not ask any more than that the Commonwealth shall get one-half of 'the community-created value caused by the construction of this line. The honorable senator proposes that the States specially interested shall get the other half, and that in respect of the country within 15 miles of the terminal stations they should get the whole of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was especially severe in dealing with me. He asked how, believing as I do that the Commonwealth should get the whole of the community-created value, I could bring myself to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> proposal. I did not tell the honorable senator that I would vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> proposal, but even if I do so I shall occupy a more consistent position than that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will occupy if he votes against it. The honorable senator up-braids me for taking 10s when I cannot get 20s. in the <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline> We have had the objection that if the Commonwealth takes over these lands it will be only adding to its difficulties. Let us suppose that the Commonwealth does not take them over, and what will be the position? I am assuming now for the sake of this argument that what honorable senators supporting the proposal have said about the country through, which this line will pass is true. We have been told that it will be settled, and one honorable senator - I believe it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> - talked of a population of 15,000,000. He pointed out that arid districts of America, with a rainfall no better than that of this country, now carry a. population of 15,000,000. We can only tell what will happen upon the construction of this line by considering the results of similar enterprises in the past. We have found invariably that when a railway is built through new country the leasing and selling values of land are increased. Upon the construction of this line, if this country is any good at all, Western Australia and South Australia, instead of getting a few shillings per square mile for it, may be able to get £2 or £3 per square mile. If they decide to sell the land, they may, instead of getting 2s.  6d.  per acre for it, get as much as 5s. or ros. per acre. I repeat that if the land values of this country are increased to such a degree by the building of this railway, the Commonwealth is entitled to a share of that increase. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> told us that the Commonwealth should get its share by means of the Commonwealth land tax. But he forgets that it can get that anywhere throughout Australia, and from districts in which not a single penny of Commonwealth money has been spent. Though  1  do not approve of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment, I feel constrained to vote for it as being the best thing in sight. The Government will do nothing, and I know that no honorable senator on this side would support me in my idea as to what should be done.. In the circumstances, I feel that I must take the best terms I can get. I do not foresee any of the difficulties which some honorable senators have indicated may arise if the Commonwealth should own alternate blocks along this line of railway. Every one who has studied the subject knows that the system of railway building adopted in Canada has had most excellent results. The Canadian-Pacific Railway Company obtained alternate blocks of land from the Canadian Government for the construction of their railway. The company was exceedingly anxious for traffic, and got rid of its lands as quickly as possible by settling people upon them. I think that all that has been done in Canada might have been done without the disadvantages attaching to private railways; but we are told that there is always a soul of good even in things evil, and the system adopted in Canada has \Vorked well. The Canadian-Pacific Railway Company sold their lands for large sums, and similarly the Commonwealth could sell or lease lands acquired under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker's</inline> amendment, and the money so obtained could be paid into the Commonwealth Treasury. The Commonwealth could afterwards come along with its land value tax, as it has already done in the case of lands alienated by the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is, in my opinion, exceedingly moderate in his demands. I would have preferred to go a great deal further, but I could not get any support. I am therefore compelled to take what he offers. I have no hope that the honorable senator's amendment will be carried, but I think it is a calamity that after all the discussion we have had up and down the continent of Australia on this question of community-created values, the betterment principle, and all the rest of it, now that the Commonwealth Government have an opportunity to give an object lesson in that kind of legislation, they deliberately abandon the principle. People will say, " These men are good at preaching, but they do not practice when they have the opportunity." Others will say, " The Labour party is a house divided against itself. They do not know what their policy is; they are nothing but a lot of children crying for the moon." I think that the Commonwealth will be injured by this failure on the part, not of the Government, but of the Federal Parliament - because it is the Parliament that will be primarily responsible - to take advantage of  this opportunity to secure for the Commonwealth community-created values, brought about by Commonwealth expenditure. There will be a feeling of disgust in the minds of many people in Australia that this opportunity to place a great principle on the statute-book of the Commonwealth is not taken advantage of. Honorable senators supporting the Bill have twitted members of the Opposition with the fact that they objected to the proposal to secure for the Commonwealth community-created values in the Federal Territory. All I have to say on that point is that the position before us is a remarkably strange one. On the Opposition side we have honorable senators who a few months ago were opposed to the idea of the Commonwealth securing community-created values in the Federal Territory. </para>

                        <para>- I would not put it that way. Honorable senators are free for my part to find the word which should be applied to them. I never object to converts. I am glad to see members of the Opposition in the Senate coming round to the adoption of a common-sense policy at last. But I am exceedingly sorry to see honorable senators supporting the Government going in the other direction. Here we have the ordinary idea of parliamentary opposition run mad. If the Government proposes one thing the Opposition are against it, and if the Opposition propose something the supporters of the Government are against that. It would appear that everybody in the Senate is for the party, and nobody is for the country. </para>

I do not like to see such an opportunity as is now presented to us to get money for the Commonwealth slip by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that he does not wish to see any more money coming into the coffers of the Commonwealth. Neither do I, if it is to come through the Customs. That is another reason why we should take advantage of this opportunity to secure more of the value created by Commonwealth expenditure - that we may be in a position to reduce Customs duties. That is a reason which should appeal to every member of the Senate, especially on the Government side, where every individual is pledged to direct, as opposed to indirect, taxation. Here is a chance offered to get more revenue in a perfectly legitimate fashion, and supporters of the Government refuse to take advantage of it.

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendment. Many tradesmen will be employed in connexion with the construction of the line, and the sum mentioned in the amendment is 3s. per day below a tradesman's wages in the town of Kalgoorlie. That shows how impossible it is to fix a wage that is fair to all classes of workmen who may be employed on the line. A similar attempt was made in another place, and was practically laughed out of court. There cannot be the slightest doubt that, whatever Government may carry out this line, the workmen will be protected. There is an Arbitration Court in Western Australia, and, moreover, as this will be a Federal undertaking, the men will be able to appeal to the Federal Arbitration Court if necessary. </para>

The point may seem to some honorable senators to be somewhat doubtful ; but I may remind the Committee that, when a somewhat similar Bill to this was under discussion a few years ago, an exactly analogous provision was proposed regarding a minimum wage. It will also be observed that, further on in this Bill, powers of a wide character are given to the Minister. I take it that the fixing of a minimum wage will be one of the conditions regarding the construction of the line as to which powers are given to the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister of Defence says that the effect of my amendment would be to reduce wages, and he pointed out that, in Kalgoorlie, tradesmen are getting 3s. per day more than I provide for. But the amendment speaks of a "minimum." It is not a maximum. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not propose to say anything on this amendment until I heard the remarks of some honorable senators on my own side of the Chamber. They reminded me of the time when the party to which I belong was sitting in Opposition, and used to move similar amendments on similar Bills. . We had to face exactly the same sort of remarks that we now hear from Labour men on this side. . We used to be met with howls of disapproval" from hide-bound Tories regarding any proposition fixing a minimum wage. While we have a Labour Government in power, we can trust them to pay proper wages. But we have no guarantee that we shall have a Labour Government in power in the Commonwealth, or in the two States in which this line will be built, during the whole of the time when it is in course of construction. We have no guarantee that the Arbitration Act now in operation in . Western Australia will not be wiped out of existence years before this line is completed. It may be years, before the construction of this line is completed. Before its completion, we may have an ultra-Tory Government in power in the Commonwealth, and a similar Government may be in office in South Australia. Consequently, we have a right to see that the interests of the workers are safeguarded. </para>

                    <para>- - 1'his Chamber has long been used to the peculiar methods of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> Ignoring the real question under review, he has chosen to launch an appeal to class and party prejudice. Finding himself confronted with the simple question of whether he is in favour of a minimum wage being paid to the workers on the proposed transcontinental line, he ceased to discuss that question, and suggested that, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was acting, as he said, in conjunction with opponents of the measure, therefore .the amendment was entitled to condemnation. Now, how does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> know that the Opposition are supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart?</inline> The honorable senator suggested that the amendment had been drafted by the Opposition, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was gullible enough to vote with them. Now, as a matter of fact. I am going to vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> whole object seems to be to create an impression that anything which emanates from his opponents is absolutely bad. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody. I "suggested it, because I considered that as the Labour party, when in Opposition, endeavoured to impose these conditions on thu Government which was then in power, it was only fair that we should impose them upon ourselves. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> affirms that the amendment will merely prove an instrument to delay the passing of the Bill, my reply is that it will prove nothing of the kind. It need not delay the passing of the Bill by one second. It merely stipulates that the Government shall pay a minimum wage, and as an intelligent man, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> must know that.  His  wild heroics, therefore, were absolutely beside the mark. </para>
