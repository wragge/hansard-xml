                    <para>I experience a special pleasure in introducing to the Senate this very important Bill, from the fact that  I  am a representative of Western Australia, and that, as an Australian, I am associated with one of the biggest works which this Parliament has yet been asked to approach, and one which, I venture to say, will inaugurate a vigorous policy of development of our vast interior, which is at present lying idle and unpopulated. When one looks at a map of our vast continent and realizes that, unlike most continents, it is not bisected with waterways which will allow vessels to carry commerce, one is forced to the conclusion that the only means of developing that country and making it available is by a vigorous policy of railway development. I have recently had an opportunity of crossing the vast continent of Asia. The portion which I crossed resembles very much our continent, except in one important particular, and that is that, every 50 or 100 miles, one crosses a river capable of carrying ships and rafts of timber, and therefore capable of being used in the development of the country. Even in Asia, bisected as it is with vast rivers, railways have been found a necessity, and the Government of Russia have planned and carried out that vast work, the trans-Siberian railway. Not content with a single track, they are duplicating the railway from one end to the other. It is reported that the railway has so far justified itself ; it has opened up country which previously lay idle, and which was thought to be unusable, to such an extent that a duplication of the line was called for, and the work is now proceeding. </para>

                            <para>- For both reasons. Undoubtedly defence had. a good deal to do with the construction of the railway in the first place, and also with the decision to duplicate the track. Both for development and defence, a duplication of the line became necessary, and the work is being carried out. The great continent of America, blessed as it is with vast water supplies, has found the same necessity, and has not been content with a single track. In Canada, although it is comparatively narrow north and south, they have seen the necessity of constructing not one, but three transcontinental lines, and a branch is now being constructed of such length and character as to be almost worthy of being called a fourth transcontinental line. When one contrasts the comparatively restricted area of Canada, that is, north and south, with our vast continent, one can see how modest, after all, is the start which we propose to make. When we compare Australia with other lands, and notice our lack of navigable waters, it must be obvious that we need more railways for developmental purposes than does any other country. At the end of 1910 Canada had 24,731 miles of railway mostly transcontinental lines, while Australia,  counting in private and Government lines, possessed only ;i7,43i miles. </para>

                            <para>- They belong to a private company, although they have been paid for by the people of Canada. When we remember that, side by side with a vast railway system in Canada is the finest river system in the world, a chain of lakes which allows navigation for thousands of miles ; when we remember the noble St. Lawrence and all the other rivers, and add these conveniences to the railways, we see how far behind Australia lags. Surely it is time that we started to show that we have some faith in the continent which we have inherited. The railway which is the subject of this Bill is one which, I venture to say, can only be carried out by the National Parliament. It is too huge a task for the comparatively small communities of Western Australia and South Australia to take up on their own responsibility. When we think of that vast area of Western Australia, peopled by just about 300,000 inhabitants, and remember that they have the responsibility of developing and opening up their own territory, we must realize what a huge task they have in hand already. When we turn to South Austraia, the case is very little better. There we certainly have a somewhat larger community, but one which is heavily burdened with the task of developing the country under its control. If we consider the aspect of defence - a Federal matter - we must realize that unless we have this railway, Federation means nothing from a defensive point of view to the Western Australian people. For what, after all. can the Commonwealth give to Western Australia in the matter of defence unless this railway be built? Western Australia has a right to look to the Commonwealth to make available for her defence the forces of the other portions of this continent, just as the whole Commonwealth has a right to expect that the forces of Western Australia shall be made available for the defence of the other portions of he continent if they are threatened. The movement for the construction of this line has had a somewhat long career. I venture to say that few railways in Australia have&#39; been so much discussed, so much inquired into, so much thought over, as this particular line ; all the advantages, and the disadvantages, all the benefit,, and all the evil, that can flow from its construction, are thoroughly well known, and have been thoroughly well canvassed and investigated. So far as public action is concerned, the first move was set on foot in 1901 by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Y. O&#39;Connor, engineer-in-chief of Western Australian railways, who prepared a report on the proposed line, and who estimated the cost of construction at &#163;4,400,000. In 1903, as the result of Federal action, the engineers-in-chief of the various State railways met in Melbourne. After going into the subject very fully, they recommended the construction of a line on a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, and estimated the cost at .&#163;4,559,000. In 1907, after a Bill had been previously introduced on two occasions - it was once defeated, and once talked out in the Senate; - a measure to provide for a survey was finally passed, appropriating &#163;20,000 for the purpose. </para>

In 1.909, the survey having been completed, a report upon it was drawn up and submitted to the engineers-in-chief of South Australia and Western Australia, in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> the consulting engineer of the Commonwealth. As the result of the data collected, and the consideration of the reports submitted, the estimate of cost was reduced by the engineers to &#163;3,988,000.

                            <para>- The cost was borne by the State Government, and I do not know what it amounted to. It was comparatively inexpensive, and, of course, was not of very much value for the purpose of estimating the cost of the railway. After the engineers-in-chief had reduced the estimate, in consequence of the detailed examination of the country, the taking of levels, and other necessary investigations, working drawings were ordered to be prepared. A vote of ^5,000 was passed on the Estimates last year for the payment of a staff to work up the details collected by the survey party. That material has been to a large extent worked through, and the task almost completed. A plan of the line has been plotted to a scale of 4 chains to the inch, and the longitudinal section to the horizontal of 4 chains to the inch, and vertical scale of 20 feet to an inch. The sharpest curves are of a 20-chain radius, and the steepest grade is one in eighty. As to the route of the line, I wish to quote from a report of the railway construction branch of the Department of Home Affairs, founded upon the surveyors&#39; report. On page 4, it is stated - </para>

After leaving the Kalgoorlie-Kanowna railway the line follows practically for a distance of some 40 miles the Westralia Timber Company&#39;s tramway, bearing generally south-easterly for that length, and passing through the township of Bulong, about 23 miles from Kalgoorlie ; thence the line runs almost due east, adjacent to the 31st parallel of latitude to about 357 miles; thence it runs on a bearing of north 7g degrees east until the South Australian border is reached, at a mileage of 461 miles 77 chains $9 links in latitude 30 degrees 45 minutes south - boundary to Tarcoola. From the end of the Western Australian division, in latitude 30.45 degrees south the line runs in the direction of 10 degrees north of east across the Nullarbor &#34;Plain, cutting Cornish&#39;s line in latitude 30 degrees 28 minutes south, and strikes the sandhill country about 170 miles east of the Western Australian border, passing 3$ miles south of Ooldea well. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish now to direct especial attention to  this  question from the defence point of  view.  That is a  very  important phase of it. There is <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> doubt that a country like Australia is subject to attacks from sea. We have no land frontier. Therefore, we have to be in a position to direct our troops to any point in Australia that may be threatened from the sea. With the advent of wireless telegraphy, and with the increased speed of steam-ships, it is quite possible that we shall receive a very much longer warning of a .threatened attack than was hitherto possible. As honorable senators are aware, one of the proposals agreed upon at the recent Imperial Conference related to the extension of wireless telegraphy throughout the Pacific, and by means of a chain of stations lying to the north and north-west. By such means any movements of foreign ships coming to Australia would almost certainly be known to us by warnings communicated from elsewhere, and we should have information as to the point  of  our coast for which they were making. It is  very  essential that by means of internal lines we should be able to concentrate  our  forces at  any  point  that  might be threatened, to prevent a landing. The  report  from  which  I. have been quoting, dealing with this aspect of the matter, says- -  It has more than once been- suggested that the&#34; line opposite Eucla, at the head of the Bight,  is too near the coast. The actual distance is about 60 miles, through country which, although carrying sufficient vegetation for stock, is of an unhospitable character, because there is no water to be obtained until the line is reached. </para>
                    <para>It will be seen from the map hanging upon the wall that the nearest approach of the line to the coast is  60  to  80  miles. </para>
                    <para>It would probably take a boat&#39;s crew three days from the coast to reach the line. It is very doubtful whether there is the slightest danger of attack being made in the neighbourhood of Eucla. The character of the coast does not permit of ships lying close in in all weathers. Consequently, if heavy weather set in they would have to head right out into the Bight for safety, so that a boat&#39;s crew which had landed might be cut off completely without doing damage of any consequence. It seems, therefore, extremely unlikely that an enemy would make any attempt to land. </para>
                    <para>One of the chief objections that has been raised to this line from a defence point of view is that at one point it comes so close to the coast that it might be possible for an enemy to cut the connexion. </para>

                            <para>- I have never heard any opinion to that effect expressed in my Department; in fact, I have not heard an opinion about it one way or the other. But when one looks at the map one is forced to remember that the great bulk of the population of Western Australia is concentrated in the south-west corner, of which the line from Kalgoorlie towards the coast would form the northern boundary. On the South Australian side, a line from the head of Spencer&#39;s Gulf constitutes the country which carries the bulk of the population of the State. As we have to join up those two points, it follows that the result of the construction of the railway from a defence point of view will be to form: a link between these two populations. If we are to take the line further away from the coast we should have to make a tremendous detour, thereby adding immensely to the cost of construction and maintenance. Still considering this question from the point of view of defence, I may remind the Senate that we recently had a visit from a great military strategist, Lord Kitchener, and I am going to quote from a speech which he delivered in Western Australia on the  24th  January,  19 10. </para>

                            <para>- It was, but I can assure the honorable senator that the dinner did not prompt the speech. This speech was delivered after Lord Kitchener had had the opportunity of travelling all round Australia. It was made at the conclusion of his tour during which his mind had been concentrated for the whole time on the problems of Australian defence. Therefore, I should say he was never in a better position to deliver an opinion on the subject than he was when he uttered these words. He said - </para>

                        <para>In order to reach Western Australia we have just had a four days&#39; sea voyage. I only wish we could have come here by train, for your present isolation must be not only a great commercial and political disadvantage, but also might at any time become a serious source of military weakness. Your distinguished fellow citizen, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, has, I know, often pointed this out, and he has advocated the construction of a trunk line on the 4-ft.8&#189;-in. gauge to join Western Australia with the eastern States. I understand that this project is shortly to be taken seriously in hand, and I only wish to say how thoroughly I indorse <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John&#39;s</inline> opinion on the subject. It seems to me, gentlemen, that one of the greatest needs of Australia is , systematic, statesmanlike, and comprehensive railway extension. </para>

                        <para>Trunk lines opening up communication and developing the fertile districts in the interior of this vast country would undoubtedly stimulate more than anything else the growth of your population, as well as foster trade, and considerably increase your means of defence. At present Australia&#39;s expenditure on railway construction appears to be often spasmodic as well as unduly influenced by purely local conditions, instead of being guided by a steady policy based on national requirements, organized and directed under a central controlling authority. </para>

                            <para>- While I think that we should consider in the light of these reports the character of the country to be served by the railway, I shall show that there is sufficient to justify the construction of the line even if there were no country worthy of development at all in the space intervening between the two terminal points. A railway can be justified in crossing a desert provided you have at each end sufficient reasons why two populated centres should be linked up. It is an undoubted fact that one of the great American overland lines crosses 400 miles of absolutely sterile desert which is of no use, and apparently will never be of any use to anybody- </para>

                            <para>- That is so; the Government made dams at the foot of the rocks, and the rocks acted as a roof and a catchment area for filling the dams. It would seem that, prior to the construction of the Kalgoorlie water supply, the drought experienced in Western Australia was practically the same as that which at the sam? time was being experienced in the east, because since the water was taken to Kalgoorlie the rainfall has never been so low as it was in those years. Since then there has been on the eastern gold-fields a rainfall of 16 inches, and the dams have never been empty, though many of them have been used for railway purposes. I mention this as indicating the importance of these rocks in providing a water supply for the railway. </para>

Here the quartzite bands contain gold, and gold mining is becoming fairly prosperous. To the east of this, at Glenloth, some distance south of the railway, there is another promising gold-field. From a point west of Tarcoola to Port Augusta the country is occupied, having been taken up for sheep runs. The character of it generally is pastoral and of good quality. Around the salt lake beds which are encountered in this district there are low sandhills, which, however, after wet weather become covered with vegetation. Tablelands rising 200 or 300 feet above the rest of the country are also met with. On the top and sides of these nutritious herbage, chiefly saltbush, grows. The tablelands consist of a sandstone formation, more or less denuded, the surface of the land being covered with very hard sandstone fragments. </para>

                            <para>- The fact that the water rises 700 feet seems to indicate that this bore is within the artesian basin. It is well known that the basin extends in that direction, and the south-eastern edge of it has never yet been definitely located. As this water rises, it is ah indication of pressure, and probably the pressure is due to the  water  rising to the level of the artesian basin which extends over a great part of Australia. If this be so, this bore should supply a great deal of water before it is exhausted. There is evidence that the artesian basin receives a permanent supply from somewhere, but where it comes from is yet  a  matter of debate amongst geologists. The report continues - </para>

A remarkable feature of the country through which that line goes is that whilst at Kalgoorlie bores have been put down for a. thousand feet without tapping any fresh water, before Leonora is readied, and in the country near the elbow formed where the line going north turns to the east, fresh water can be Obtained in ample supply in some places at a depth of only 20 feet. The country is flat, with a gradual rise towards Leonora. In apparently the same class of country as that line, to the north of Leonora, and running away up to the Murchison, there is splendid underground supply of water. Geologists have not yet been able to say where that water comes from, but the district has a lesser rainfall than the Kalgoorlie goldfield, so that it is not a local supply. However, there it is in a vast area to the north of Kalgoorlie.I mention this here because of the existence of that water supply, although the country and grass is poorer than the Kalgoorlie country it has been taken up for pastoral purposes, and to-day is stocked. It follows that if the country lying south of Kalgoorlie, which is better grass country, could be furnished with a water supply, it would undoubtedly be settled for pastoral purposes: </para>

It is on the Nullarbor plains that the bore to which I have referred has been sunk, and it may well be urged that, in view of such a water supply,, it is probable, if not certain, that this area could be thrown open for pastoral purposes.

It has not yet been shown how small a rainfall will suffice for the nourishment of wheat and other crops. More rainfall observations are imperative, and it is of vital importance to determine al what time of the year the rainfall occurs. It would appear that falls amounting in the aggregate to seven inches while the crops are growing arc sufficient lo insure success, and if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> the Commonwealth Meteorologist, tells me, there are parts of Western Australia where 90 per cent, of the year&#39;s rainfall occurs in the months from April to October, there is considerable hope that some districts, with an extremely scanty rainfall, mav prove quite suitable for agriculture. </para>

I know it will be urged that no data has been collected, and that is true a* regards the Nullarbor plains; but, if honorable senators will look to the west of the Nullarbor plains,, where some salt lakes are shown near Norseman, I may inform them that rainfall records have been taken for twelve years for that district j and a little to the east of south of Norseman a station owned by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dempster</inline> has been occupied for forty or fifty years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dempster</inline> has kept records during that time, and they show that in that country lying a little to the east and south of Norseman, there has been an average rainfall of over  12  inches per annum.

Farming is carried on immediately south of Kalgoorlie, and within  60  miles south of Kalgoorlie. One of the arguments put forward for the construction of a railway from Esperance to Norseman is that it would throw open  140,000  acres of agricultural land with a proved rainfall, and capable of carrying farms. And, for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I may state, that the Labour Government of Western Australia have  announced their intention of constructing a railway from Kalgoorlie to Esperance. So much for the agricultural and pastoral possibilities. The report continues- </para>

                    <para class="block">Supply is a very important feature, and, as the result of a survey, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> reported on that subject in the following terms : - </para>
                    <para>In the Estimate of Cost furnished with the Report of the nth October, 1909, the sum of &#163;609,000 was quoted for water supply. This was figured out on the assumption  that steam locomotives would be used for hauling trains over the line. This item of the estimate has been further looked into, and I have found it possible to make a considerable reduction, partly owing to the fact that water of good quality has been proved by boring to exist below the surface at a point 344 miles from Kalgoorlie, as mentioned previously in this Report, and partly by adopting a cheaper method of conveying water to distances along the line, namely, by using wooden stave pipes instead of steel. I may call attention to a fact that is probably well known, namely, that the Mundaring water has in the past acted in a most prejudicial manner on the steel mains conveying it to the gold-fields. Not only has the asphalt coating of the inner surface of the pipes been penetrated, but the metal of the pipes has been attacked, causing so much corrosion and growth as to enormously reduce the sectional area, and consequently the carrying capacity. </para>
                    <para class="block">I may mention that the State Government brought out two scientists, from Germany I think, to report on the best method to overcome this difficulty, and that, by some chemical properties which are now put in the water, they can overcome the corrosion. </para>

                        <para>The wooden stave pipes as now manufactured bv the Australian Wood Pipe Company, in Sydney, are not liable to this deleterious action, and the cost per foot run is besides much cheaper than that for steel pipes of the same diameter. The economy thus works in a double way. In estimating the size required for steel pipes an allowance was originally made for the lessening of capacity through corrosion - that is to say, larger pipes than actually required when in their original clean condition had to be provided - but when timber is the material selected this extra size is not necessary, as the wooden pipe retains its carrying capacity through its life - and then there is the lower cost of the material. </para>
                        <para>The scheme now proposed is to take water from the Mount Charlotte tank at Kalgoorlie, convey it along the line in pipes of suitable size, delivering it for the use of the steam locomotives in water tanks about 50 miles apart, till the tank at about 257 miles from Kalgoorlie is reached. Then making use of the water at No. 3 bore at 344 miles, pump and deliver this back towards Kalgoorlie as far as 295 miles, where a tank would be placed, and sending it along the line in the direction of Port Augusta as far as the end of the limestone plain where the sandhills are entered at about 632 miles from Kalgoorlie, which is the lowest point on this part of the line, viz., about 327 feet above sea-level. Between No. 3 bore and this point tanks erected at intervals of about 50 miles would be supplied from the same main. </para>
                        <para>From the commencement of the sandhills to Port Augusta water would have to be conserved as originally proposed, that is, by making artificial catchments, by utilizing rock catchments where available, and storing in reservoirs or where water-courses with sufficient catchment area occur, by building dams, and impounding the water which occasionally runs in large volume. </para>
                        <para>By the above scheme sufficient water for engine purposes can be secured, at a total estimated cost of &#163;456,000, thus showing a saving of &#163;155,000 on the estimate of October, 1909. </para>
                        <para>If the Internal Combustion principle can be applied to the locomotives used on the railway, the provision for water can be much reduced, and it might be safe to reckon on bringing the cost down to, say, &#163;250,000, as the water requirements would then be confined to station purposes and household use. </para>

                    <para class="block">The question of using the internal combustion engine is being closely inquired into by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> who believes that at present the outlook is very promising, and that he will be able to recommend the use of the engine on this railway. If that is so, there will be very important developments in railway construction, in the dry areas of Australia. I confess that, until recently, I knew little or nothing about the internal combustion engine, but possibly what I have learned may be of information to some honorable senators. It seems that it is an engine which uses oil, and the explosion caused by the ignition of the oil supplies the driving force. It does not use water for steam power as in the case of an ordinary locomotive. It only requires water for the cooling of the cylinder in which the explosion takes place. It is really an oil engine applied to a locomotive, and as the water for cooling the cylinder can be used over and over again, a locomotive will have to carry only  a small  quantity,  and therefore the question of water supply  will be a very simple proposition. Previously the difficulty has been that they have never been able to get in one engine more than 200 horse-power. On an ordinary train that would not be sufficient, because some of our trains require 1,400 horse-power. But in America they are carrying out an experiment; they attach an internal combustion engine to each truck or carriage, and therefore get a multiplication of 200 horse-power. By employing five vehicles you would therefore get 1,000 horse-power, and by using ten vehicles you would obtain 2,000 horse-power, and so on. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it would be much more expensive than ordinary rolling-stock, but not much more expensive than locomotives of similar power. I am speaking of trains, and not of locomotives. This, of course, will be a line primarily for the conveyance of passengers, mails, and at certain times freight. If the experiments in progress are successful, as the reports lead us to expect, it is quite possible that, by the time the railway is constructed, the use of the internal combustion engine will be adopted, and then the question of water supply will be a very simple problem indeed. </para>

In his report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> says that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to give an estimate of the revenue and expenditure which can be seriously backed up. In developing a new country an estimate of revenue and expenditure must be problematical.

I hold, however, that, even if the line should be run at a loss for some years, the indirect benefits which will accrue to Australia will justify that loss. Since this proposition was first put forward certain things have happened which make it more justifiable to-day than ever it was before. In the first place, the importance of Western Australia as a State of the Commonwealth has increased enormously. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in our eyes. The population of the State is now nearly 300,000, having increased by over 100,000 persons in the last ten years. &#39;The number of horses has increased from 74,000 to 134,000, whilst the number of cattle has increased from 400,000 to 800,000. The number of sheep has doubled. The number at the end of 1910 was given in the monthly statistical abstract as 5,157,699. The production of wool has consequently doubled since 1900, and at the end of 1910 the State exported 26,197,212 lbs. The greatest development has taken place in agriculture. The area under wheat has increased from 94,709 acres to 581,482 acres in 191 1. The area under oats has increased from 9,751 acres to 61,918 acres, and the area under orchards from 6,076 acres to 16,721 acres. The total area under crop has increased from 2^,441 acres to 854,837 acres. It is, I am sure, a source of satisfaction to every honorable senator, no matter on which side he sits, that the State is making such splendid progress. The argument that that part of the Commonwealth&#39; has a right to be linked up with the eastern States is now more powerful than it was in the years gone by. Whilst we may not make any arbitrary statements as to what the revenue will be, I think it is only right to state what those sources of revenue may be.

                        <para>It appears from the returns that the passengers to and fro between east and west amount to about 55,000 per annum. This shows the extent of the passenger traffic between these two parts of Australia. There can be little doubt that were land communication established a great many people who now have a horror of the sea voyage would take advantage of the railway, and that many more who do business between the east and the west would actually make the journey themselves rather than trust to letter-writing. The time of the journey between Melbourne and Perth would be reduced from nearly five days to practically two and a-half days; the same proportionate saving of time would certainly be effected between Sydney and Brisbane and Perth when proper routes have been established. </para>
                        <para>The example of the United States of America shows how enormously traffic increases with the means of communication. Practically the eastern States are independent of the States on the Pacific Slope, just the same as the States on the Pacific Slope are independent of the eastern States, but an enormous traffic goes on between them, and when Canada is reckoned in, it is worthy of note that there are seven lines of railway crossing the continent between the Atlantic and the Pacific, and it can only be concluded that when the east and west of Australia are linked up a similar traffic in proportion to its population will result. With regard lo what has been said as to the uncomfortable travelling over the hot interior of Australia, it may be pointed out that very great improvements have been made in the fitting up of railway carriages. A journey in the interior of Australia is certainly not worse than one over the Arizona Desert, and yet I can testify that travelling is quite comfortable even in summer. Carriages are fitted up with double windows, which are closed to keep the dust out, ventilation being secured by the fanlights in the roof ; a minimum of dust comes in to distress the traveller, and the intense heat is also kept out. </para>

                    <para class="block">I propose to relate my experience in travelling across Siberia. I used to be considerably impressed with the argument that, if we had a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, persons would be deterred from using it by the fact that they would be in the same train two and a-half days. Recently I have travelled across a country where I was continuously in trains for ten days; that is, I was in one train for six days, and then I &#39;only walked across the platform into another train, in which  1&#34;  travelled for four days. From the time I left Moscow until I landed at Vladivostock, I was not out of a train at any one time for twenty minutes. Yet I was never wearied of the train journey. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There was a continuous train journey of ten days, and each train was full of passengers. A berth has to be booked a month beforehand. We were told that we would have to book a long time beforehand in order to get a berth on the train, because it is what is called an international express. An ordinary express takes fourteen days to do the same journey. We passed three ordinary expresses on our journey. One of them we passed during the night, and so I did not see it, but the other two I did see, and they were also crammed full of passengers. In addition, a large goods traffic is going on, and immigrant trains, some of which, I was told, take twenty days to do the journey, are run. </para>

                            <para>- Six thousand miles. Whilst Siberia is a cold country in winter, it is a very hot country in the middle of summer. It has the extremes of heat and cold. After Manchuria is passed, one has to cross 350 miles of desert as bad as the Sahara - rolling sand plains without a vestige of tree or shrub of any kind on them. Although we passed through the Gobi Desert in the middle of summer, yet we experienced no more than the ordinary discomfort of a hot day when travelling in any part of Australia, because the train is  well fitted up, having been built specially to combat the discomfort of heat and dust. It is made up of large carriages, which are well ventilated in the roofs. All the appointments are good, and are well carried out. I experienced less discomfort on that train journey of ten clays than I have done on many a journey 1 have  made  by steamer across the Great Australian Bight. As to the estimated cost, this  report,  on page 20, says - </para>

Most of them remain approximately the same, except that the rates of labour having been increased, it is necessary to allow for this fact. The item water supply can now be reduced from ,&#163;609,000 to &#163;456,000, steam locomotives being used, or say to &#163;350,000 if internal combustion engines are used instead. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say offhand, but I think the estimate is about two years. Now I come to the question ot gauge. The opinion of the Government on the matter is that we should have in Australia a uniform gauge, at all events as far as Commonwealth lines are concerned ; and we have no doubt that, whatever gauge is adopted for this railway, the States will, sooner or later, follow our example. The policy of developing the Northern Territory will mean that another railway will have to be constructed there. The Government had to face this question of gauge and settle it j and, after giving full consideration, to the various reports and to the experience of other countries, we decided on the adoption of the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the honorable senator has an open mind, and will be prepared to consider the evidence. One great advantage from having a uniform gauge railway running through all the Capital cities of Australia, would be this : that one set of rolling-stock would serve for all parts of Australia. That would be an enormous advantage in the event of war, and also in the event of drought or famine for the purpose of conveying stock, food, and material from one part of Australia to another. Uniformity of gauge would enable rolling-stock to be concentrated in any district where it was most required. It could be brought from any part of Australia where there was not so much need for it to any other part where there was an urgent need, at the shortest possible notice. At present, one State cannot come to the assistance of another State with surplus rolling-stock. </para>

                        <para>I would also mention that railway construction has, while developing the country, resulted in lines that would appear to be more favorable to an enemy invading Australia than to the defence of the country. Different gauges in most of the States isolate each system, and the want of systematic interior connexion makes the present lines running inland of little use for defence, though, possibly, of considerable value to an enemy, who would have temporary command of the sea. </para>

                    <para class="block">On that communication I have to make only this comment. Is this a question for Premiers to consider? Surely it is a question for engineers. It seems to me to be a strange method of dealing with a proposal with regard to unification of gauge, to notify that it will be dealt with at a Conference of Premiers ! Surely it ought to be settled apart from any political considerations. It ought to be determined by the technical knowledge of men qualified to discuss it and given a free hand to determine according to the merits. However, the Victorian Government said that they would not send their Engineer-in-Chief of Railways to a Conference of experts, but would send their Premier to a Conference of Ministers. </para>

If you put wider rolling-stock on a railway constructed on a narrower gauge you reduce the margin of safety of tunnels and embankments ; and no railway engineer will recommend you to run 5-ft. 3-in. rolling-stock through a 4-ft. 8-in. tunnel. Let us see what these alterations of tunnels would mean. Do honorable senators realize that it would involve either the complete cessation of traffic on certain lines while tunnels were being altered, or the diversion of traffic <inline font-style="italic">h\</inline> building other lines temporarily? Y&#60;&#34;&#62;u cannot have traffic going through a tunnel which is in course of structural alteration. That is absolutely impossible. Either you must build another line while you are altering the tunnels or you must stop the traffic altogether until the alterations are completed. On the railway, between Melbourne and Adelaide there are sixteen tunnels. I ask honorable senators to think of the dislocation that would be involved on that line if the width of the tunnels had to be extended. But by converting a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railway to 4 ft. 8&#163; in. there need be no such dislocation. There are railways in Australia where tunnels have been constructed on the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge. There are such tunnels on the Hawkesbury line in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- This is not a party question, and there is no need to appeal to party considerations. I want to adopt the method which will be cheapest, most efficient, and most expeditious. There is another point which honorable senators may not have considered. You can put a third rail on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge line to bring it to a 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge, because you can put it conveniently inside the existing rails. But you cannot put a third rail on to a 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge line to bring it up to 5 ft. 3 in., for the simple and obvious reason that by so doing you would get too near to the end of the sleepers. While the sleepers on a 5-ft. 3-in. track could possibly be used for a 4-ft. 84-in. track, you would have to take up both rails and sleepers to convert a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge line to 5 ft. 3 in. When you come to take ail these elements into consideration, it must be admitted that they materially affect one&#39;s judgment on the question. We have at our back with reference to the adoption of the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge all the Engineers-in-Chief, and the Railway Commissioners, of Australia, so far as they have committed themselves as to public recommendations. We have at our back also the experience of the great transcontinental railways of Canada and the United States. In Canada, the first great transcontinental railway was built on the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge. The railways there are private companies conducting their business purely for the sike of gain, not troubling about defence considerations or national considerations. Profit was their one idea in entering upon their construction policy. If their experience has proved to them that they could work with a better profit with a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, or even with a 6-ft. or 7-ft. gauge, do honorable senators think that they would not have adopted it? They had complete knowledge as to what had been done in other parts of the world, in addition to their own railway experience. Yet they have built a second and a third line on the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge. &#39; In the United States there are four, and in Canada there are three. . transcontinental railways, all of them on the 4-ft. 8r-in. gauge. </para>

                            <para>- Not in the slightest degree, because the lines in America are independent. In many cases they were built hy opposing companies, not running over each other&#39;s lines, and not junctioning with  the other lines in any way. I think that with all that experience of these private companies, and with the expert advice obtainable in Australia, behind us, had we refused to adopt the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge we should have been branded as unworthy to deal with this great project. We came to the conclusion that the evidence was overwhelming in favour of the gauge which we have adopted. I do not propose to say any more on this subject. I have already taken up more time than I had intended. But the subject is of such importance that it warranted a full explanation. I unhesitatingly commend the Bill to the Senate, and trust that whatever criticism may be directed towards it will be of a national character. I earnestly hope that we shall have no parochialism introduced, but that the proposal will be judged upon its merits. I have no doubt that if that be clone, honorable senators will resolve that we ought to be prepared to shoulder the responsibility of doing something to develop the vast unpopulated interior of Australia. </para>

We do not think that we should approach this question in the same way as a private company would do. If the States concerned had cared to construct a railway on the land-grant system, it could have been constricted years ago. </para>

                            <para>- No, they have not, because they did not think that a fair proposition to make. But I can tell the honorable senator what the State of Western Australia has undertaken to do. The late Premier of the State indorsed it, and I have no doubt the present Premier also indorses it. The State Parliament passed an Act providing that as soon as the transcontinental railway is commenced, Western Australia will undertake to construct the railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie on the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge at her own expense. That is an undertaking embodied in an Act of Parliament, and I have not the slightest doubt that it will be honored by the present Government of Western Australia. On the question of a land grant, I contend that that is not a fair proposition to make to the State Governments. The land is owned by the States, and I have no doubt that, with a Labour Government in each of those States, we can rely that whatever unearned increment may attach to the land from the construction of this line will be preserved by them for the people rather than for private individuals. </para>

                            <para>- I ask honorable senators further to consider whether, if such a condition is to be attached to the construction of this railway, it will not be fair to attach a similar condition to the construction of all railways which the Commonwealth may build. If the Commonwealth is to be given 25 miles of country on each side of this line by the States of Western Australia and South Australia, a similar demand for 25 miles on each side of the line may be made when it is proposed to construct a railway from the Federal Capital to Jervis Bay, 1 am disposed to think that if such a demand were made in that case, some of those who are enthusiastically in favour of the principle to-day would be found to have altered their tune. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire at the outset to say that I heartily indorse the action of the Government in introducing this measure for the amendment of the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth.I go further, and compliment them on some of the provisions submitted for that purpose. Every one will, I think, agree that it is the first duty of the Parliament and the people to secure that parliamentary elections shall be as pure as possible. I, personally, regard this measure as the only effort made up to the present time in that direction. I think there have hitherto been greater efforts made to prevent the exercise of a pure franchise than to encourage it. There is strong evidence of that in the history of past elections in Australia. Time and again we know that efforts have been made to place on our electoral rolls the names of people qualified to vote, and those who have been led to believe that they were enrolled have subsequently found that, by political engineering, they have been prevented from the exercise of their right of citizenship. I do not intend to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in going through this amending Bill from A to Z, but I shall give my candid opinion on three or four of the most important amendments of the existing Act proposed with the object of securing something like purity of elections. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will restrain his impetuosity, I shall relieve his great anxiety in this matter. The first attempt to really secure purity of elections is made in this Bill by the introduction of a system of compulsory enrolment. This proposal should be sup ported by every fair-minded man, because it should be agreed that it is the duty of every citizen of the Commonwealth to recognise his responsibilities to the State. In my opinion the greatest responsibility resting on the shoulders of any citizen is to have his name placed on the electoral roll in order that he may be able to exercise the right to select the men who will be called upon to make the laws of the country. </para>

                            <para>- There is a great deal of difference between compelling men to record their votes and compelling them to shoulder the responsibility of seeing that they are enrolled. I have asserted that hitherto purity of elections has apparently been the very last thing considered or attempted, and, on the contrary, every effort has been made to prevent the proper exercise of citizen rights rather than to compel it. I invite honorable senators to consider what took place at the last Federal elections. Before those elections took place, although the rolls were said to have been made up with the greatest care, it was discovered in the State of Western Australia that the names of a very considerable percentage of the qualified electors of the State were left off the rolls. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator will permit me to make my point. The result was that a supplementary roll had to be prepared to place those whose names had been left off the rolls in a position to record their votes. A number of men and women were then found running all over the State of Western Australia collecting the names of those who were not on the original rolls, ostensibly for the purpose of having them placed on the supplementary rolls. Numberless application forms were filled in, and these people who were collecting the names carried these applications away. I cannot directly charge any one, but it is very strange that when the supplementary rolls came out, a considerable number of names that had been collected by these canvassers were not to be found upon them. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure the honorable senator&#39;s party did, but I am also sure that they profited more than they lost by the proceedings to which I refer. This is why I think every one should recognise the honest attempt made by the Government in this measure to render that  kind  of thing impossible in the future. That can only be done by adopting a system of compulsory enrolment, making each and every individual recognise his own responsibility to be enrolled. Men and women have for years past been canvassing the country, not with a view to getting names on the rolls, but with a view to sorting out the names of those who would be likely to vote against their cause, and carefully leaving them off the rolls. This has been an experience common to all the States of the Commonwealth, and the Government are very wise in adopting a system of compulsory enrolment. Once the people are enrolled, we need have no fear about their exercising their votes. Yesterday afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was crying out for purity of elections. He wants a big vote every time. That is exactly what I want. I am sure that on the day when that big vote is recorded, and when we find 80 per cent, of the electors on the rolls exercising their right to vote, we shall see the last shreds of the weakly Fusion-Liberal party wiped entirely out of the political life of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply stating facts. Let honorable senators consider the election which recently took place in Western Australia. It is one of the brightest examples of the truth of what 1 say. The State roll had been very carefully looked after, and at the election the percentage of votes polled was the highest ever recorded at an election in that State. The result has been that there are only a few shreds of so-called Liberalism and an impossible Opposition left as a sort of relic of bygone days. </para>

                            <para>- They are not here now. Those honorable senators evidently feel very sore about the proposed abolition of postal voting. Ever since I entered the Senate I have battled against postal voting, and have consistently and strongly opposed it whenever the question came up for discussion. On the first opportunity afforded me here to raise my voice in opposition to the postal voting system, when I found I was beaten, I tried to make the Senate realize the ridiculous nature of the system by suggesting provisions to enable any member of the general public to witness applications for postal ballot-papers. However, that was not done. The Government now recognise the absurdity of the postal voting system, and propose its abolition. In very sympathetic tones <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> tried to make out a great case for the poor sick woman who will not be able to record her vote by any means when postal voting is abolished. That, to my mind, is a hypocritical form of argument, and I have no hesitation in emphasizing the fact. </para>

                            <para>- I said nothing of the kind. I said that the man who opposed the Bill on the assumption that it would prevent a sick woman from registering her vote was using knowingly an intensely hypocritical argument. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> vouchsafed some information which he had gathered showing the number of men and also of women who voted by post at the last election in Victoria. He did not go beyond the confines of his own State, but he fell into a sad error in merely stating the total in each case. If he had wanted to prove clearly his point, which I am satisfied he did not desire to do, he would have stated the percentage of sick women who were included in the total of postal voters. I venture to say that the experience of most persons in this respect is similar to mine, and that is that the postal vote has never been used very largely in the interest of sick persons. On the contrary, it has been used by the healthy, the strong, and the vigorous, at the instigation of the agents who travelled the country to try to prevent persons from having their names placed on the rolls. </para>

                            <para>- I am letting the honorable senator know what I have seen and what I think. I rejoice that we now have an opportunity to remove from our law a provision which is useless for any purpose other than that of corrupting the elections from time to time. There is no honorable senator on this side who would be wanting in sympathy for sick women or sick men. I regret that afflictions do come to prevent either men or women from exercising the suffrage. The abolition of the postal vote will compel a good many persons, whatever else they may do, to vote cleanly and not corruptly. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that it makes any provision, but I think that the percentage in that respect is very low indeed. Even if no provision is made, it is much better to prevent a small percentage from doing a thing which they ought to have the right to do than to leave a licence to those who are continually Studying how they may effect wrongdoing. The Bill makes another amendment of the Electoral Act, and that is in respect to newspapers. I do not know that my honorable friends on the other side need be very sorry about this amendment. It is one which ought to meet with the&#39; direct approval of every member of the Senate. We should all rejoice at the opportunity to enact an amendment of this character. It will render a very great service to my honorable friends on the other side, as well as to our party. It will prevent injustices from being perpetrated at the eleventh hour, or probably on the very morning of polling day. </para>

                            <para>- It touches not only that, but several other things. It deals, for instance, with the question of expenses. The provision on that subject will probably save the honorable senator a few pounds, and consequently, to that extent, he ought to be very glad that the Bill has been introduced. I also heartily compliment the Government on their attempt, in proposed new section 181 c, to prevent the possibility of paid canvassers being sent out. It ought to save the friends of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger a considerable amount of money, because, at previous elections, the country has been flooded with paid canvassers. The alteration, if adopted, will prevent my honorable friends from sending men round - and women too - for five or six weeks prior to an election, with a pocket full of money in order to do the best they can in the interest of the candidate by whom they are employed. </para>

                            <para>- I have no objection to an honorable senator addressing the Women&#39;s National League, in fact, I have no objection to any legitimate organization. Let our opponents do all they possible can by honest organization. I have no complaint to make in that respect, but I do object to the persons whom they have sent out for weeks and weeks together, and who, in many instances, told the most audacious untruths. I believe that many women belonging to the Women&#39;s National League have gone so far that, on Resurrection Day, God Almighty will deny that ever he had a place in  His  house for them. In that respect Ananias and Sapphira were gentle folks in comparison with some of these women. The suppression of these canvassers will have a wonderful moral influence upon the community. It will prevent persons from going to such excesses as have been resorted to. To that extent, I think we can safely claim that  the Government are proposing a change which every one ought to applaud. If we wish to secure purity of elections we shall have to shut out those influences for evil which have been so rampant hitherto. Last night a great deal of trouble was occasioned to Senators Millen and McColl by the proposed amendment, which will practically compel the retention of the ballot-papers used at an election for a period of three years, that is, from election to election. They suggested that, if the provision were enacted, a man might hold over the head of a member of Parliament for three years a threat to bring a case before the Court - which might lead to the loss of his seat - and, on the eve of an election, pounce down upon him. Can any honorable senator say for a moment that there is any strength in a statement of that kind? It is the most ridiculous stuff to which I think a man could listen. It may be taken for granted that, if a candidate were elected on grounds which were questionable, the man who wanted him put out would not wait for three years, but would try to have him put out in three days if he could. </para>

                            <para>- Because, at times it takes a little longer than the prescribed time to collect the evidence which is required. In the case of a member of this Parliament, for instance, there was a very strong suspicion that something was wrong. In fact, the events of the subsequent election showed clearly that something was wrong. There was strong evidence that, indictable offences might have been charged against several persons. What happened when an inquiry was made in another place? When the question was asked whether the ballot-papers used at the election, and so forth, would be forthcoming, the answer was that they had been destroyed. The evidence which might have been used to punish severely those who had been guilty of very questionable practices had been destroyed, and therefore the perpetrators of the offences went scot free. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the Bill will introduce, if that has not already been done, the policy of &#34;Spoils to the victors.&#34; The first clause to which I wish to refer is that dealing with voting by post. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> commented yesterday upon the very large number of persons who will lose their opportunities for voting if this provision be carried. It will press very hardly on men and women who are in delicate health, and who are unable to leave their homes. It will especially affect women. Since yesterday, I have looked into the figures relating to the population of Australia, and I find that, roughly speaking, there are 120,000 Births in this country annually. We may say that, on an average, a mother is compelled to keep to her house about one-eighth of the year preceding and following the birth of a child. Consequently, one-eighth of the mothers of this country would be disfranchised by the abolition of the right to vote by post. In other words, out of 120,000 mothers 15,000 will be disfranchised under this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> kindly drew my attention to a newspaper entitled the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call.</inline> I propose to read a short extract from it headed &#34; A tribute to woman.&#34; When I have finished, I shall ask honorable senators opposite whether they are paying a proper tribute to women &#34;by depriving 15,000 women, at every election, of the right to vote by post.

                        <para>It takes a hundred men to make an  encampment,  but one woman can make a home. I not only admire woman as the most beautiful creature that was ever created, but I reverence her as the most redeeming glory of humanity, the sanctuary of all virtues, the pledge of all perfect qualities of heart and head. It is not just nor right to lay sins of men at the feet of women. It is because women are so much better than men, that their faults are considered greater. A man&#39;s desire is the foundation of love, but a woman&#39;s desire is bom of her love. The one thing in this world that is constant, the one peak that arises above all Clouds, the one window in which the light forever burns, the one star that darkness cannot quench, is woman&#39;s love. It rises to the greatest height, it sinks to the lowest depths, it forgives the worst injuries. It is perennial of life and grows in every climate. Neither coldness nor neglect, harshness nor cruelty, can extinguish it. A woman&#39;s love is the perfume of the heart. This is the real love that subdues the earth; the love that has wrought all miracles of art, that gives us music all the way from the cradle song to the grand closing symphony that bears the soul away on wings of fire. A love that is greater than power, sweeter than life, and stronger than death. </para>

                            <para>- It has a great deal to do with the question, sir. This Bill is going to disfranchise 15,000 women at every election. They will be deprived of their right to vote by post, a right which they have hitherto enjoyed. _ Honorable senators opposite profess to believe these fine things about women, and yet they think they are unworthy to be afforded an opportunity &#34;to vote. The next clause to which I wish to direct attention is that with relation to fixing Saturdays for election purposes, and closing the poll at  8  o&#39;clock. The Sabbath of our Hebrew fellow-countrymen ends at sunset on Saturdays. The sunset in some parts of Australia is as late as a quarter past  7.  The hour mentioned in the Bill is  8  o&#39;clock. I suggest that if elections are to take place on Saturdays, the time be extended to 9 o&#39;clock. Another section of the community which should be considered is that of the Seventh Day Baptists, who also observe Saturday as their Sabbath. That denomination has increased extensively in New South Wales. For their sake, too, I think we should make some allowance. In fact, I cannot see that it is altogether wise to choose Saturday as election day on all occasions. The next matter which I propose to mention has regard to canvassers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> proved pretty clearly last night that the large industrial unions of this country have organizers who are practically paid political canvassers. I hope the Government will see their way to introduce a definition clause by which an organizer, whether of an industrial association or otherwise, shall be considered at the time of an election to be a paid canvasser. Otherwise, a great advantage will be conferred upon one section of the community over another. </para>

                            <para>- I was saying before the suspension of the sitting that the people of Australia will be able to judge shortly whether this measure is one of a statesmanlike character or rather one tinged - not to say honeycombed - with party bias. If the Bill proves to be of the latter character, it will be the bounden duty of the successors of the present Government in office to amend  such provisions as display an absence of statesmanship, and to place a more liberal measure upon the statute-book. I think- I have proved pretty clearly that, with the birthrate at present prevailing in Australia, about 15,000 women will be disfranchised by the abolition of voting by post. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. I maintain that the mother of a new-born child ought to remain in her house at least a fortnight before, and a month or six weeks after, the event takes place. A great many women are ill from other causes. I calculate that at least 15,000 women are ill at any one time in Australia. I, therefore, believe I am within the mark in saying that at least that number will be deprived of the exercise of the franchise in consequence of the abolition of postal voting. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the principal objection to it is that people often lost their elector&#39;s right. Nevertheless the system has much to be said for it. It is all very well to say that irregularities have occurred under the postal voting system, but then there . will always be some irregularities whatever system is in operation. I stand for the principle of every adult person being entitled to vote, and being given the opportunity to do so, whether he or she be ill or well. As to the woman&#39;s vote, I have always supported the extension of the franchise to that sex, my opinion being that persons who pay taxes have the right to be represented in the Parliament that imposes them. My leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> so ably and exhaustively criticised this Bill in detail last night that I need say no more than that I cordially coincide in the views which he expressed. </para>

                        <para>. - There are only three points in the measure before the Senate which appeal to me as being of very great importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who launched an exceedingly severe criticism of the measure yesterday, has dealt with the question of compulsory voting. Other honorable senators opposite have shown, by interjection, that they have the idea that compulsory enrolment is of no use without compulsory voting. I cannot understand why that objection should be urged. If there is the slightest chance of compulsory enrolment conducing to a larger percentage of votes being recorded at an election, it will certainly have a beneficial effect j and I am convinced that the proposed amendment of the law will tend in that direction. I should like to think that we could, by legislation, make compulsory voting effective. But I do- not think for a moment that any measure passed with that object in view would be effective. There is an old saying that you can take a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink. In the same way you might, by law, compel people to go to the polling booth, even against their inclinations, but many who were so compelled might, out of a sheer spirit of obstinacy, spoil their ballot-papers. The question of compulsory enrolment, however, rests upon an entirely different basis. There are hundreds of men and women in the large centres of Australia who, at election time, find that their names have been left off the roll. Many will admit that they are themselves to blame, and they express regret for their negligence. Others are omitted through some dereliction of duty on the part of officials responsible for the compilation of the roll. If we institute compulsory enrolment, we shall do away with a great deal of that kind of thing. Therefore, this is a step in the right direction.  I cannot understand my honorable friends opposite objecting if there is the slightest chance of bringing about, by this means, the casting of a larger percentage of votes at Federal elections. </para>

Honorable senators are aware that all the powerful daily journals of Australia supporting the party opposite have invariably claimed, after every political contest, that if 75 or 80 instead of 50 per cent, of the electors enrolled had recorded their votes the party opposite would have won. </para>

                            <para>- I have always urged the same contention. I am satisfied that, because of the neglect in making transfers of names from one roll to another, when people have moved from one electoral district to another, there are many names on every roll which ought not to be there. It is difficult to believe that the people of Australia, who are so keenly interested in politics, do not, to a greater extent than 50 per cent, of those enrolled, exercise the right to record their votes. That does not affect my argument, and, if honorable senators opposite really believe that the greater proportion of the big unpolled vote would be cast in their favour, they should welcome the adoption of a system which would tend to increase the percentage of votes polled. </para>

                            <para>- They propose to introduce compulsory enrolment in the belief that that will tend to bring a larger number of electors to the poll. It is obvious that that will be the effect when we consider that at every election there are thousands of people who complain that they have been unable to vote because their names have not appeared on the rolls. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was apparently more concerned about another proposal in this Bill than about the whole of the rest of the measure. In his destructive speech yesterday afternoon, he denounced the proposal to abolish postal voting. The honorable senator did not hide his belief that it has been introduced from a party point of view. </para>

                            <para>- They will get their rights. There is nothing in this Bill which will take away any of the electoral rights of any person in Australia. It will always be more convenient for some people to exercise their right to vote than for others, and there never was an Act of Parliament passed which placed every one on the same footing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> will recollect the rumours prevalent in Tasmania at the time of the last Federal election, and, doubtless, he will know that the postal voting provisions of the existing Act were largely taken advantage of by those who were able to run motor cars to remote portions of the State, carrying with them persons authorized to witness postal vote certificates, and so to secure votes that otherwise would not have been recorded. The facts about postal voting could hardly be stated without doing some persons great injury, but, without mentioning names, I can refer to cases that came under my own observation. I know of instances occurring in Tasmania where the postal voting provisions were availed of by domestic servants, who could easily have gone to a polling booth had they been allowed to do so. I will not say that they were absolutely prevented from doing so, but they were given a pretty broad hint that they might much more easily vote by post, and certain people came round and collected their postal votes, and these were nearly always cast on one side of the fence in politics. </para>

                                comes from a State which has had a very significant experience of postal voting. Perhaps the honorable senator will be able to explain how it was that after a trial of a system which extended, I think, over only one election in Queensland, the Government that introduced the system subsequently abolished it.

The matter is one which has been frequently discussed in the Senate between representatives of Queensland and of the other States. There must have been some good reason why the Government that introduced the system in Queensland subsequently did away with it. We have heard all sorts of rumours on the subject, and, doubtless, some honorable senator from Queensland will be able to tell us how much truth there is in these rumours. The postal voting provisions were inserted in the Commonwealth Electoral Act as an experiment. Many members of this Parliament agreed to the proposal as an experiment. </para>

                            <para>- I believe I did, and the honorable senator will probably find that if I spoke upon the matter at all I supported the proposal because I believed it would extend the facilities for voting. I did not believe at the time that it would increase the opportunities for corruption, but, so far as I can gather, it has operated in that direction. It has been contended that the majority of the postal votes have hitherto been cast against the present Government party, and that that is the reason why the Government are proposing to abolish the system. </para>

                            <para>- No, there are too many safeguards provided under the Act to permit of corruption in the case of personal voting. Our friends opposite do not like the proposal to abolish postal voting, because, in their view, the majority of postal votes has hitherto been cast against the Labour party. I say that this appears strange in view of the fact that a very big majority of the personal votes were cast for that party. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, a considerable majority. A considerable majority of Labour members were returned for another place, and at the last Senate election there was, apparently, no room in the Senate for a single honorable senator representing the other side. Out of eighteen seats contested, not one honorable senator representing the party opposite was returned. It would be interesting if we could find out how many of the postal votes recorded were due to sickness or remoteness from the nearest polling place. I have many friends in the backblocks of Tasmania, who reside miles from a polling booth, but I say it is not too much to ask people who are interested in the government of the country to travel 7 or 8 miles to a polling booth once in three years to record their votes. </para>

                            <para>- The pioneers, for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> expressed so much sympathy yesterday, are usually men who will not let the loss of a day&#39;s work or the travel of a few miles prevent them from recording their votes. Many of my friends have walked 15 miles in bad weather to record their votes for myself and other candidates on the same side. Whether their views on politics be right or wrong, it is clear that they value their political rights so highly that they are prepared, if necessary, to make a little sacrifice once in three years in order that they may record their votes. If it could be shown that more than half of the postal votes were recorded because of sickness, or because people could not get to the nearest polling booth, I am satisfied that the Government would not have introduced a proposal to abolish postal voting. The experience of honorable senators on this side has been the same in every instance, though honorable senators opposite appear not to have had a similar experience. Our experience of the operation of the postal voting provisions of the present Act is that very many of the 29,000 referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> could have gone to a polling booth, and those who were employed in canvassing for such votes might have been saved some little trouble, and, perhaps, expense. The Electoral Act was not framed to suit these people, but to suit those who place some value upon their political privileges and rights. The system was introduced as an experiment, and it is because its tendency has been to corruption that it is now proposed to abolish it. I do not think that my honorable friends on the other side would make such a great song about the postal voting system if they were not satisfied in their minds that it has been of service to them. They will find that, in the future, it will not assist either party. I am sure that they want the elections to be conducted cleanly, and free from anything which might conduce towards corruption. That being so, they ought to welcome, as we do, the proposal to abolish postal voting. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must know of cases where some women have had postal votes taken away by a bit of chicanery or smart electioneering practice, when they might easily have gone to the polling-booth. Would he attempt to bring up these persons, although he knows them, and got votes from them, and make them prove a case at the expense of losing their billets? He knows that their positions would not be worth an hour&#39;s purchase if they came and gave evidence. </para>

                            <para>-  I am not speaking of an invalided woman, but of probably more than one-half of the  29,000  persons who obtained postal votes at the last election. I am referring to those who used &#39;the system when they had no need to do so. That is why it is to be abolished. When our honorable friends on the other side get into power, probably they will revive the system ; but I am very pleased to think that, in the meantime, the old system will be tried again. I honestly believe that the abolition of the postal vote will do away with corruption. I do not believe in corrupt practices at elections. I do not claim for a moment that the corrupt practices come from one side only. I know that some supporters of myself and the party I belong to are not above resorting to corrupt practices. It would be absurd for any one to claim that political corruption is only practised on one side at an election. I know that the provision for the postal vote has been used corruptly by both parties, and certainly in a way which was not intended when it was enacted. The system was introduced in order to assist two classes only, viz., the invalid and the elector who would be too far away on election day to go to the polling-booth except at great loss and trouble. The postal vote has been abused to such an extent that its abolition is now proposed, and I think it is a good proposal, too. The only other provision of the Bill in which I take any great interest is the one curtailing the licence of the press in printing or publishing political matter. I do not believe in trying to muzzle the press too much, because, after all, unfairness on the part of a newspaper will, in the end, react against the party which it is attempting to assist. In Melbourne, for instance, we have had instances of the grossest unfairness in politics, and I do not&#34; believe that any of my honorable friends who are most bitterly opposed to the Labour party will indorse the actions or the tactics of the Melbourne newspapers on those occasions. Will they, for instance, indorse the action of a big journal here which, a few years ago, tried its hardest to keep a certain man out of the Senate? To use an every-day expression, it had the knife into this gentleman for a long time,, politically speaking. Amongst other causes, perhaps, was a very big lawsuit which he had with the newspaper. It went to this unfair length that, although this gentleman addressed some thousands of persons in Melbourne on the night before the election, there was not one line about his address in its columns next morning, whilst opposing candidates, who only addressed a few hundred persons, received long notices. That is party warfare. </para>

I have cited that case merely as an illustration of the extreme lengths to which big journals are prepared to go, and I suppose will continue to go, in support of their party. </para>

It does not care what kind of methods it uses to kill a party or a candidate, and to advance the interest of the candidate whom it is supporting. It is a case of party warfare, which, in the end, I believe, reacts in favour of the person whom it tries to hit. </para>

                            <para>- It had a very short spell of political sanity, and then it dropped back into a state of political aberration. It must not be forgotten that, in past &#39;elections, State and Commonwealth, the Labour party have suffered to a greater extent from press unfairness than has the other side in politics. But a time may come - and I believe that it will come within a very few. years - when the other side may be subjected to the same kind of unfair treatment by newspapers which are engaged in fighting the battles of this side. The time has gone by in Australia, I think, when there will be only one class of newspaper literature. In both Hobart and Adelaide we have a daily newspaper which is a recognised and straight-out supporter of the Labour party, and I hope that, within the space of about a year, we. shall have a Labour newspaper in Sydney, and that it will be followed quickly by the establishment of a Labour newspaper in Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend knows that, in electioneering, a weekly advocate is not of any use compared with a daily advocate, because the daily liar can get in six lies to the weekly liar&#39;s one lie. In the very near future I believe we shall have, on each side of politics, powerful journals, largely supported, and with an immense circulation, instead of, as at present, the newspapers being mostly on one side. Will not a provision of the kind I am discussing act fairly to both sides in politics? If honorable senators opposite are not going to openly champion the cause of unfair criticism or unfair tactics by newspapers, what objection have they to our trying to make the newspapers a little fairer than they have been? </para>

                            <para>- There is no word in the provision which relates to a particular newspaper. At present there are some newspapers on the Labour side, and many newspapers on the anti-Labour side; very probably in the near future, there will be more newspapers on the Labour side. But even now this provision covers all news papers alike. Do my honorable friends intend to openly support anything in the shape of unfair tactics such as we charge against the newspapers which have been fighting us so bitterly but ineffectively, as the results have shown, during the last quarter of a century ? We have thriven on this kind of abuse. </para>

                            <para>- We may fall some day ; but, so far, all this fighting has only helped us. The Labour party has not attained its present prominence in Commonwealth and State politics by reason of the assistance of daily newspapers. It has progressed in the teeth of their opposition, and that fact is perfectly well known. When, in the course of a few years, we have large daily journals supporting the Labour party in the big cities of Australia, as well as in the State capitals, this provision will be a very useful safeguard for my honorable friends. At all events, it aims at only one thing, and that is to keep unfairness out of newspaper control or tactics or policy as much as possible. </para>

My honorable friends opposite ought to welcome these proposals, as we do. I have occupied quite enough time.

                        <para>. - I do not intend to occupy the attention of the Senate very long after the very able and&#39; exhaustive speech of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday - a speech to which the Ministry, so far, have not thought fit to make a reply, probably because there is really no reply to be made to his criticisms. I wish to emphasize one or two points, and to suggest an amendment which I think will do away with a good deal of the necessity for some of the amendments which are proposed in the measure. On looking round, I found out the origin of this Bill. It seems to me to have emanated largely from the Electoral Department. The final paragraph of the report on the measure, signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> reads - </para>

                        <para>A scheme of compulsory enrolment associated with a card index system for the prevention of duplication of enrolment and fraud would not only be of enormous advantage from an electoral point of view, both in relation to representation and administration, but would be of considerable value for purposes of public administration generally, and in particular might be expected to greatly assist the postal, defence, statistical, police, and other public systems having direct relations with the public.  lt is claimed that the wonderful card-index system is a. help. I hear of the system day by day in all sorts of directions. T admit that, up to a certain point, it is a very good system, but I am rather inclined to think that we are running mad on index systems, and probably will find them in the end more burdensome and troublesome than some of the old-fashioned ways of doing business. It recalls some lines which I read a little while ago by a writer who is troubled very much in the same way- </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a good deal of truth, I think, in these lines on the idea of running every mortal thing by a card-index system. The system may be all right, and I think it is up to a certain point; but we are inclined at present to go a great deal too far, and will eventually find that it is a great nuisance. I only want to refer, as I said, to two or three points in connexion with the Bill. The first is that dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> with reference to voting by post. The memorandum to which I have referred says that, &#34; in consequence of the abolition of postal voting, provision has been made for the extension of absent voting.&#34; I had no idea, that postal voting had been abolished. I do not think that it has been. A provision for it is still on the statute-book of the Commonwealth, and is a part of our electoral system. </para>

It should have read, &#34; In consequence of the decision, of the Caucus to abolish postal voting.&#34; Then, I suppose, it would have been absolutely correct. </para>

                    <para class="block">There are there three classes of people for whom <inline font-style="italic">special</inline> provision is made in the existing law. I am astonished that the Minister of Defence, in introducing this Bill, gave not a single reason of any kind as to why this provision should be abolished. When an important measure like this is introduced, under which it is proposed to take out of (he existing law a provision of great importance, I think that, in common courtesy to the Senate, the Minister should tell us why it is proposed to make a drastic alteration ; but the Minister made positively no reference to the subject. All he did was to say that the Government intended to abolish postal voting, and introduce in place of it a more comprehensive system of absent voting. Now, what is this comprehensive system which is to be substituted ? It is provided in proposed new section 139  a  that - </para>

                        <para>On polling day an elector shall be entitled to vote at the polling place for which he Is enrolled or at any prescribed polling place for the subdivision for which he is enrolled, or he shall be permitted to vote at any other polling place within the Commonwealth under and subject to the regulations relating to absent voting. </para>

                    <para class="block">It, therefore, appears that every elector within the Commonwealth will have to go tq a polling place to record his vote. Only two classes of people can be affected by proposed new section  139A,  namely&#39;, sailors and passengers at sea. And this is described by the Minister as being &#34; a more comprehensive system of absent voting.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">The memorandum sets out that electors who are within the Commonwealth on polling day will be able to vote at any polling place ; but, apparently, they will be unable to vote anywhere else. Therefore, the new provision applies only to those who will be at sea. Apparently, any one else who wishes to vote on polling day must go to a polling place somewhere within the Commonwealth. If that be a &#34; more comprehensive system,&#34; I must confess that I am unable to recognise that quality as pertaining to it. Because, while the two classes of people that I have mentioned are provided for, all the others mentioned in section 109 of the principal Act have their privileges absolutely wiped out. There will be no chance for them to vote at all. On polling day a destitute asylum and a home for incurables may be declared a polling place. I make no complaint about that. I do not wish to disfranchise any poor incurables or derelicts in any way. But, while provision is made for such people, no provision is made for others who will be unable to go to a polling place: A man may be a cripple and unable to walk 5 miles ; or he may be poor and unable to forfeit a day&#39;s pay to go and record his vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;</inline> Keefe would say in such a case, &#34; I am sorry for you, but I cannot do anything more; you cannot vote unless you walk to a polling place.&#34; A woman in a certain state of health ought to be the subject of veneration and respect from every man. She ought to be shielded in every possible way. But such a woman cannot exercise the franchise unless she can drag herself to a polling place. </para>

                            <para>- Nonsense. And, after all, that does not touch the point. Suppose that the proposal was opposed by my party, or by the Labour party, or by any other party. If the Legislature has recognised the right of a woman to vote, that right ought not to be taken away. But I say decidedly that this Bill does take away from a woman in a certain condition the opportunity of recording her vote. It also deprives of opportunities of voting those who are old and infirm and those who are so seriously ill as to be unable to go to the poll. They have the sympathy of honorable senators opposite ; but their sympathy does not take practical effect. </para>

                            <para>- I take it to be a fact that if honorable senators opposite had positive evidence of abuse, they would be the first to bring out the facts. But, when asked for his evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> simply said that he did not intend to mention names. I do not care which party is going to lose votes by this amendment of the law. </para>

                            <para>- I did so only when interjections provoked questions. I have asked for evidence of corruption in connexion with the postal voting provisions. I do not believe that there has been such an amount of abuse as to warrant the taking away of this privilege. Under proposed new section  139A,  to which I have just referred, it is provided that a man may vote at any polling place within the Commonwealth. If a man cannot sign his name, I suppose he can make his mark. I do not know how a mark could be proved to be a forgery, and I do not see how this is going to prevent fraud. I do not see how it will apply in the case of a by-election. There is one coming off in the district of Boothby presently. Under the existing Act, electors will be allowed to avail themselves of the facilities afforded by the postal -voting provisions, but, if this Bill were in operation, how would any elector of Boothby at present outside the electorate be able to record a vote ? There will be no polling places open except those in the district, and what are our honorable friends opposite going to do with the absent elector? Are they going to appoint polling places throughout the Commonwealth at every by-election, so that electors absent from the electorate can record their votes? </para>

I know that there are people who have conscientious objections to voting. The members of a very considerable sect in my State never enrol their names, and never go to a polling booth. They have told me that they do not think it right that they should take any part whatever in either political or municipal affairs. They have a religious belief that they ought not to do so. The Government intend to compel those people to enrol their names.  1  suppose they could not compel them to vote. They might be&#39; compelled to go to a polling booth and to take ballot-papers, but they could not be compelled to mark them, or to refrain from putting so many marks on them as to make their votes informal. What is the use of this proposal unless it can be actually carried into effect? I wish to know how compulsory enrolment is going to be enforced? If I remember rightly, the Minister, in introducing the Bill, told us that 20 per cent, of the population are continually moving about from one district to another. They have not enrolled their names, or have neglected to have their names transferred from one roll to another. How are we to find out these people in order to enforce compulsory enrolment? If one-fifth of the 20 per cent, of the population referred to by the Minister have neglected to enroll their names, or to secure transfers, do the Government intend to send the police after them? </para>

                            <para>- Will this part of the Act be handed over to the Minister of Defence to see that it is carried out ? Will he send out a squad of men to scour a certain district to find out those who are not enrolled or have neglected to have their names transferred from one roll to another? When they have found them out, will they serve them with informations, hale them before a Court, and have them fined under this measure? Unless the Government are prepared to do that, what will be the value of this proposal after all ? I understand that Ministers have some business to do before the usual hour for the adjournment of the Senate, and I therefore ask leave to continue my remarks when this debate is resumed. </para>

Honorable senators will recognise that, the Electoral Bill has yet to be considered by the House of Representatives, and it is advisable that measures which have to go before the House of Representatives after being considered here should be given precedence. Other work can be proceeded with here while those measures are being dealt with in another place. </para>
