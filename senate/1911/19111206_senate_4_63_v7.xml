                <para>In submitting this motion I desire to intimate to the Senate that it has been found necessary to recommit the measure, in order to rectify errors in clause  20,  dealing with the appropriation of money. This clause was amended in another place, and in making the amendment somewhat hurriedly certain words were left in which are unnecessary. If honorable senators will look at clause  20  of the Bill they will find that it reads - </para>

                <para class="block">It is obvious that the words &#34; and the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Loan Fund are mere repetition and surplusage. They have no meaning, and it is proposed in Committee to amend the clause by leaving those words out. It is also intended to propose the omission of the words &#34; from time to time,&#34; because they are also unnecessary. If a Bill is introduced to authorize a loan for this railway it will be the only appropriation from the Loan Fund. There will be no appropriation &#34; from time to time.&#34; These errors are due apparently to the fact that an amendment moved upon the clause in another place was somewhat hurriedly drafted. I shall explain in Committee how the mistake arose, and my honorable colleague will move an amendment to take the Bill into Committee again to rectify the errors. </para>

In other words, suppose that the States say that the Commonwealth shall have only 3 chains of land for the route of the railway, and that Ministers suggest that its construction should be proceeded with, and tha Senate thought that a much wider strip ought to be secured, would it still be open to the Senate to consider the matter when an Appropriation Bill was brought forward ?

                    <para>. - The Minister of Defence has just used an expression which has created a little doubt in my mind. Of course, I recognise that his remarks had particular reference to any payment of money which may be taken out of the Loan Fund. He said that if any moneys were required from that fund, necessarily a Loan Bill would have to come before the Senate, and to that extent this appropriation, so far as loan moneys are concerned, is really of no avail until a further appeal is made to Parliament. But I understood him to say earlier that Parliament would be appealed to for an appropriation out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia)  &#91;2.56&#93;.  - The first amendment moved by the Minister, I understand, was to omit surplusage, while the present amendment is to take out words which do not affect the power of Parliament at all, that is to make an annual appropriation or to deal with the matter by means of the
                </para>
                <para class="block">Loan Fund, to which expression the phrase&#34;from time to time &#34; is inapplicable. That: is what I think the effect of the amendment is. The position of the Government, I understand, is that the clause is not intended to be, and is not in effect, an appropriation of moneys for the construction of the railway. There are two methods by which that may be done,. One is by means of a Loan Bill, which, of course, would make an appropriation once and for all specifying the amount to be borrowed for the construction of -the line. The other method is by an annual appropriation of the amount expected to be required for the financial year, and the balance, if any, will lapse at the end of the year, when there will have to be a further appropriation, so that the policy which is given effect to by the clause is that the control of Parliament will remain throughout the whole period of construction. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.8&#93;. - New clause 8b seems to me to go far beyond what is necessary or desirable. It is, of course, usual to protect public Officers as well as magistrates from ordinary actions. But this clause as it stands would go the length of protecting an officer who might be guilty of gross negligence, leading to manslaughter, or, at all -events, loss of life. If a lighthouse-keeper were guilty of gross negligence which brought about disaster, he could not, under this clause, be prosecuted for manslaughter. I think the provision ought to be restricted to protecting officers against civil actions. For this purpose, the clause might be made to read, &#34; An action or other civil proceeding.&#34; The insertion of the word &#34; civil &#34; would leave the criminal liability of the officer who, by reason of gross negligence was guilty of manslaughter, untouched.

                            GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.13&#93;.- The clause, even as proposed to be amended, would protect a Commonwealth officer, who had been criminally negligent, from any civil proceedings, although it might be that through his criminal negligence great loss of life and of property had occurred. While it may be perfectly right that the Commonwealth should be freed from any liability, still it must be evident that it would be unjust that a man through whose criminal neglect loss of property and life occurred should be exempt from any punishment unless he could be dealt with criminally. A man guilty of negligence should be made to accept the responsibility of his conduct.

                        <para>- Yes, if he was criminally negligent. Under certain circumstances a man may be careless, but not criminally negligent, and his carelessness may bring about loss of life. I do not think that this Parliament should protect a man who has been guilty of serious malfeasance of that character. The question may be asked : What is the good of having a civil remedy against an officer who is in receipt of, perhaps, only ^50 a year? But another officer who is guilty of criminal negligence as the result of which life is sacrificed, may have accumulated property. Ought he to be protected ? </para>

                        <para>- That is scarcely the point. It is coming it too strong to suggest that because a man is poor he should be exempted from the liability which would attach to him if he were rich. The amendment, I admit, will make a great improvement in the clause, but I desire to improve it still further. I submit that this Bill ought not tb shield an individual who is guilty of negligence which leads to loss of life and property. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has suggested that in such circumstances an officer should be civilly liable to the extent of .&#163;100. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Government will not agree to the amendment. The Commonwealth has thousands of public servants in its employ, every one of whom is vested with responsibility. They make blunders day by day, but, except in one case, no attempt has been made to make them pecuniarily responsible for their mistakes. But in the case of pilots that course has been followed most unjustly. They have been made responsible for negligence to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> The same thing is attempted here. There are many lights around our coast which are absolutely undermanned. There may be only two men charged with the duty of looking after a lighthouse, so that if one of them becomes ill, the responsibility of supervising the light rests wholly with the other. Yet it is proposed to make such a man civilly responsible if he should happen to go to sleep. ; .&#91; </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.22&#93;. - I would suggest to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                    that the criticism in which he has indulged strikes at the clause in its entirety. The authority whom he ought to seek to make liable - the juristic person, as the phrase is - is the Commonwealth itself. But as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    has very properly pointed out, the tendency of all modern legislation is to exempt an officer in the position of a pilot, for example, from unrestricted liability for any accident arising from an ordinary act of negligence.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline>
                    contention is that such a liability ought to attach to him, so that a person who has lost valuable property may obtain some redress. But we cannot predict that lighthouse-keepers will be in a position to pay heavy damages. It is quite just that the Commonwealth should be liable to make good any damage which may result from an act of one of its servants. That is a well -understood principle in law. Short of criminality the master is liable for the ordinary negligence of his servant. But it is useless to endeavour to retain a civil remedy directly or indirectly against a lighthouse-keeper because it would be worthless.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>
                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.25&#93;.- I recognise the ordinary rule of law that a principal is liable for the misfeasance of his servant. That is exactly the position which the Commonwealth occupies towards a lighthouse- keeper, and, according to common law, it is liable for any negligence on his part. At the same time I recognise that in a great Commonwealth like this, with the multiplicity of matters which have to be controlled, it is not in the interests of the public that the Government should be held responsible for all injuries which may result from the negligence of their officers. Otherwise interminable litigation would arise.  All that we have a right to expect is that the Commonwealth will do whatever it can to protect life and property. But while we have to adopt that attitude, we must remember that according to common law the servant is just as liable as is his principal. Yet here, it is proposed, to relieve him of that liability. I ask honorable senators whether that is a proper thing to do? If I com&#62;mit a wrongful act I have to submit to the consequences, and I fail to see why a Government employe should occupy a different position. I know that if a Commonwealth officer were guilty of culpable negligence the Government could dismiss him. But I hold that that is not sufficient. As the Bill left this Chamber it did not contain a provision of this kind. It made the Government responsible for any action which might arise as the result of negligence on the part of its servants. But the other Chamber has seen fit to insert this amendment. I do not wish to obstruct the progress of business, but I do desire that honorable senators shall be afforded an opportunity of registering their opinions upon this question. I therefore move -  flint the following words be added, &#34;and that new clause 8b be amended by leaving out the words &#39; whether negligent or otherwise.&#39; &#34;

                        <para>- It is not the intention that the Commonwealth shall make a profit from the provision made for the protection of the mercantile marine, though it will, for many reasons, be necessary to levy certain dues. If the Commonwealth is not in this matter in the position of a common carrier or an ordinary employer, why should it be made liable? I remind honorable senators that under the Acts of all the States, with the exception of Western Australia, the State Governments were not made liable for damage arising from any inefficient management of their lighthouses. Under the Act of Western Australia, the State was liable, but no case was ever brought against the State under that Act, though one claim under the Act was settled out of Court. We are in this matter adopting the methods and policy which were followed in five of the States of the Commonwealth from their inception. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> objection is concerned, the clause, as amended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment, will relieve the officer of liability for any civil action for damages. I understand that Senators Symon and Gould desire that no individual should be exempt from- prosecution for culpable negligence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment was proposed more for the protection of the officers than anything else. I do not think that the Government would be justified in accepting any amendment such as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> which would extend the liability of the Commonwealth in this, connexion. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline>
                    I think that the effect of his amendment would be to raise doubt and confusion. If we leave in the words &#34; whether negligent or otherwise,&#34; we shall make it clear that it is the intention to debar civil proceedings for damages against a lighthouse- keeper, whilst, if those words are omitted, it may become a subject of debate in Court as to whether any act or default involved negligence, and might make the result very doubtful. I am inclined to think, however, that it would be well to strike out the words &#34;the Commonwealth or the Minister.&#34; I do not see how there could be any liability upon the Minister because of negligence in connexion with any marine mark. But I think that) if possible, the liability of the Commonwealth should be retained. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                    had moved to strike out the words &#34; the Commonwealth or the Minister,&#34; I should probably have supported him., always subject to the consideration that whether the exemption of the Commonwealth, or the Minister is provided for in the clause or not, it is very doubtful whether the Commonwealth will be liable to actions of this kind. I think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                    would do well not to press his. amendment.

I am not prepared to go so far as to say that the Commonwealth or the Minister should be made liable in all cases. The Commonwealth might be mulcted in damages because of the negligence of one of its officers, who, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    pointed out, might neglect to light his lamps. This only brings me back to my original proposition. Why should an officer who neglects to light his lamp, and thereby causes a wreck to take place and a great loss of life and property, be protected by this Parliament from the consequences of his neglect. He should be made to realize that under such circumstances Parliament would not protect him, but that he would, have to put up with the consequences.

Why should a man guilty of negligence, though it may not be of criminal negligence, be entitled to the protection of an Act of Parliament? If he undertakes certain duties, he should be responsible for any act of misfeasance or malfeasance which he may commit, irrespective of whether he is rich or poor.

                        <para>- Although I make that remark, I do not believe that that is really the honorable senator&#39;s intention. But that is how it would appear to any one. By an amendment which has been made, an officer is not exempt . from a criminal prosecution, or from the liability to be suspended or dismissed, or otherwise dealt with by the Commonwealth. If we impose so much responsibility upon the officers, instead of being able to do their duty efficiently, they will live in such a state of terror and confusion that they will not know what they are doing. Take the case of a lighthouse-keeper who has a family, and has saved up a few hundred pounds. The loss of that money would mean a great deal to the family. The honorable senator should think of the position of the wife and family when the husband would be in gaol, because of his criminal neglect. He is only thinking of the shipowners. </para>

                        <para>- I know all about that. As regards the value of property, every shipping company can insure against a casualty of this description, and so protect itself. But there is no way of escape for a poor unfortunate officer who may find himself in a difficult position. On many occasions, to my knowledge, men have been placed in critical positions. There was no criminal negligence, although it might have been ultimately proved that there was. The circumstantial evidence may have been against the officers concerned, but I have known their consciences to be quite clear of any feeling that they were guilty of negligence. Under the clause, certain penalties may be inflicted upon a negligent officer, and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> might think of the position of the wife and the family of the officer, and not insist upon making him liable civilly as well as criminally. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) &#91;3.50&#93;.- I am afraid that I cannot support the amendment of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline>
                    who says that it will afford a clear cut issue. It will do so by cutting the very heart out of the clause. The real effect of the clause is to exempt these men, but if the amendment is made, it will destroy the clause altogether. In my opinion, it is a beneficial and usual provision in such cases. To preserve the liability for damages would be absolutely futile. It would be a mere drop in the bucket. The sort of damage which would result through a lighthouse-keeper omitting to keep his lights brightly burning would be the loss of a ship, the cargo, and probably some lives. How could we look to any lighthouse-keeper to compensate for the loss of a large modern ship, and the cargo ? It is obvious that my honorable friend is straining at a gnat, and swallowing a camel.

                        <para>- It is not necessary. By keeping a double liability, it will add an additional terror to the carrying out of a man&#39;s serious duty. I think that we ought to avoid that. There is a good deal of force in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has said, and it was not all sentiment. A man might say, &#34; I am quite ready to face punishment if I am guilty of negligence, which results in the loss of life. But I do not think that there ought to be superadded the taking away of my livelihood&#34;, or the taking away of anything which I have put aside.&#39;&#39;&#39; It has to be remembered that there is no difference between the kind of negligence which renders a man liable to punishment, and that which renders him liable to an action, lt is the same kind of negligence, but the remedy is different. If we are going to have the clause at all, the only object of it is to free from liability the men who are placed in this position of responsibility. The liability to punishment is retained, but they are free from responsibility for damages. The latter responsibility, I think, ought to rest, if it rests anywhere, on the Commonwealth, but .1 do not intend to move any amendment in that direction. </para>

The Government have laid down one principle for pilots and another principle for lighthouse-keepers, although they are all servants of the Commonwealth. There ought to be uniformity in this matter. I hope that when an opportunity arises, the Government will free the pilots as well as the lighthouse-keepers from liability to civil action, because the two cases are exactly on a par. </para>

                        <para>- No. he is simply liable up to &#163;100. We put no such responsibility on the Crown Solicitor, who may mislead the Commonwealth at any time. There is no liability attaching to a member of Parliament if he makes a mistake, negligently or otherwise. Why should this responsibility be applied only to lighthouse-keepers? It is absolutely unjust to saddle them with more responsibility than any other public servant has. to submit to. I hope that the amendment will be rejected, and that when an opportunity arises, other public servants will be treated in exactly the same way as light-, house- keepers. </para>

                        <para>- If there is any difference at all, it is considerably for the worse. I know some lighthouse-keepers who are placed on an island right away from human habitations, and kept there for twelve months without seeing a single individual ; and when one of them gets ill, the work is thrown upon the other, who for twenty four hours has to attend to the lights. It is very difficult for that officer to prove that he was not negligent at such a time, and that it was the officer who put two men in the lighthouse who was really responsible. </para>

Some lighthouse-keepers have no communication with the mainland. No ships pass, and therefore they are not able to signal them. </para>

We have had lighthouses reported to be without lights, and when an explanation was called for it was shown that the lighthouses were undermanned, and that the State was making a profit out of the undermanning.

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;3.57&#93;.- I certainly object to some of the remarks made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                    with regard to my object in moving this amendment. 1 have a keen sympathy with the relatives of those whose lives may be lost through the negligence of a lighthouse-keeper. The honorable senator has attempted to draw a picture of the wife and family of a lighthouse-keeper being left with nothing for their support because his savings may be taken away from him to pay damages. Carried to its logical conclusion, the argument means that we are to pity a man who commits a burglary, because he is sent to gaol. I have no sympathy with that, sort of spurious sentiment.

The honorable senator has also fallen into another mistake. He says that if the Crown Solicitor gives bad advice, he is in no way responsible; whereas every solicitor is responsible for the. advice he gives, and may be made to pay if it is shown that he has been negligent and ignorant. </para>

If an officer is negligent, the honorable senator will take away his means of livelihood by dismissal, but will not allow him, if he is in a position to do so, to compensate a person who suffers from his negligence. It is only a matter of degree as to whether my amendment is not the preferable way of dealing with a case of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- It is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to take over all lights other than harbor lights. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has seen a list, which does not include all the sea lights. But it is not to be assumed that the Government does not intend to take over all those lights as quickly as possible. If, however, there should be a light other than a harbor light which was maintained by a State, it would not be right for the Commonwealth to take dues with respect to it. Consequently this amendment is necessary. </para>

                        <para>. - It may be remembered by honorable senators that a considerable time ago a Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament.  1  am sure that every member of this Parliament was gratified that something was being done for a very deserving section of the community, namely, the seafaring folk. Later,however&#39;, an action was brought under the Act in connexion with the steamship <inline font-style="italic">Kilibia,</inline> when it was found that the Commonwealth Parliament had not all the power that we imagined we possessed. The High Court decided that section 4 of the Act was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and unconstitutional. Consequently, it could have no effect. Worse than that, the High Court decided that the section in question was not severable, and that the whole Act was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It may be asked why we are re-introducing this Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill, that is to say, why we do not propose to amend the old Act. But it will be seen that, in consequence of a certain section of that Act being <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> and not being severable, if we simply patched up the old Act we might have the High Court declaring again that what we did was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It has therefore been determined by the Government, under the advice of their law officers, to make sure of our position. We have introduced a new Seamen&#39;s Compensation Bill to meet, the situation. After it is passed, it will be a new Act entirely. It is, however, an exact copy of the old Act, with the exception of section 4, which has been entirely redrafted, and section 18, which specifically repeals the old Act. Clause 4 differs materially from section 4 of the old Act. The redrafting has been undertaken with a view to meet the objections raised by the High Court, and to bring the measure within our constitutional powers. As the whole of the remainder of the clauses were fully debated when the original Bill was before the Senate, I do not think that there is any necessity to go into then again. When we get into Committee, however, I shall have a couple of amendments of a formal character to move. The first provides that where a seaman is eligible for compensation in two countries, he may only claim in one of them. That point was not absolutely clear under the old Act. If a seaman claims compensation in Australia, he cannot go to England, or to any other country, and claim, again. The second amendment requires a seaman receiving compensation in the Commonwealth to sign a declaration to the effect that he will not apply for compensation in any other country. </para>

It is not the Commonwealth that pays the compensation, but the ship-owner or shipping company. It would be unfair to our own, and to other ship-owners, to enact a law under which a seaman or officer would be enabled to claim compensation in Australia, and also in another country. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has no desire to make blackmailers of seamen, or officers, or of anybody else, and that he will have no hesitation in agreeing to the .amendment I have indicated. At this stage of the session, honorable senators do not expect me to make a long speech; and, therefore, I shall content myself with moving - 0 </para>

                            <para>- I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that what was done then, was done in the best possible faith, and in the belief that we were entitled to proceed with that measure under the very large powers which are conferred upon us by the trade and commerce section of our Constitution. That Bill was not brought forward hastily. Time and again  1  referred it to the Crown Law officers; and, ultimately, upon their advice, it was decided that we &#39;possessed the requisite power. That mistake has brought about a position which everybody regrets. In introducing that Bill, the desire was to confer the benefits which it offered upon as large a section of the seafaring community as possible. There is only one matter connected with the measure which is now under consideration to which I desire to direct attention. I refer to a judgment which was recently given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Scholes in New South Wales. He drew attention to a difficulty which presented itself to him in a case which was brought, under State law, before the Court over which he presided. Although he was dealing with State law, it seems to me that the same difficulty is present in this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever law we may pass must be a Federal . law. But, whether this Bill will go as far as the honorable senator suggests that it ought to go, is another matter. To revert to the question which I was previously discussing, I wish to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Scholes experienced great difficulty in determining the case which was brought before him - a case in which a workman had left dependants who were both wholly and partially dependent upon him,. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council will look at the first schedule&#39; to this Bill, he will find that provision is there made for the payment of compensation to the dependants of a seaman who were wholly dependent upon his earnings. Further on, provision is made for the payment of compensation to those who are partially dependent upon his earnings. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Scholes had to deal with a case in which a workman had left dependants who were both wholly and partially dependent upon him. In such circumstances, was the Judge to ignore those who were partially dependent upon the workman, or was he to allocate the compensation between the two sets of dependants? Was he to assess the compensation upon the scale which was set out for those who were wholly dependent upon the workman, or was he to assess it upon the scale set out for those who were only partially dependent upon him? These points presented themselves very clearly to the Judge, and they appear to me to be equally present in this Bill. The same terms are employed in it as are employed in the State Act, and the same provision is made as between those who are wholly dependent upon a seaman whose death is caused by accident, and those who are partially dependent upon him. I note, too, that in this Bill, there is the same absence of direction as to how the Judge shall proceed in a case in which a seaman leaves dependants who are both wholly and partially dependent upon him. I would suggest, therefore, that the Government should carry this Bill to the point at which it will be possible to recommit it to-morrow, and that, in the meantime, they should look up the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline><inline font-style="italic">Scholes, with</inline> a view to seeing if it is not possible to devise some means of meeting the difficulty to which I have referred- </para>

It was not his decision which arrested my attention,, but the clearness with which he pointed out the difficulty which I have emphasized. I would suggest that the Bill be advanced to the report stage, and that, in the meantime, the Vice-President of the Executive Council should invite his officers to refer to the judgment in question for the purpose of ascertaining whether the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Scholes does not warrant some amendment of the measure. If so, the Bill can be recommitted with that object in view.

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.25&#93;.- Whilst the Leader of the Opposition was addressing himself to this question, I took the opportunity of looking through the Bill, and I find that provision is made in the schedule for cases in which seamen leave dependants, who are wholly, or partially, dependent upon them. But the, mere fact of a seaman leaving behind him persons, some of whom were partially, whilst others were wholly, dependent upon him, would not interfere with the construction that would be placed upon the first part of the first schedule, which leaves it to the Court to determine the amount payable as being equal either to three years&#39; salary, or ,&#163;200. Paragraph 8 of the schedule reads -

                    <para class="block">It appears, therefore, that the schedule makes provision by which the difficulty which has been pointed out may be overcome.

If that be done, it may be found that there are differences between the State law and this Bill which account for the difficulty which presented itself to that Judge. It is well that we should take special care to avoid any trouble in the future. I take it that no honorable senator will object to perfecting the Bill as much as possible during its passage through Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - If there be any doubt whatever as to the meaning of the Bill, I hope that we shall make it perfectly clear before it leaves this Chamber. But I wish to place on record my opinion that the expense involved in the administration of an Act of this character, and in settling any legal doubts which may arise, is due largely to the wrong basis upon which it has been framed. Instead of the compensation payable being regulated by the number of dependants whom a seaman leaves behind, the Bill should rest upon the assumption that a human life, no matter from what cause it may be lost, is worth so much. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. I think that the Bill is based upon absolutely wrong premises, because it lends colour to the idea that a human life is of no value unless somebody be dependent upon it. I say that there is a potential value attached to any life, and if ship-owners were liable to pay the same amount of compensation in any circumstances, where the deceased left no dependants, the money could go to the State. </para>

The powers proposed under this Bill have been narrowed down below the limits adopted in the Navigation Bill, and, if this Bill correctly defines the extent to which we can go in the matter of seamen&#39;s compensation, the same objections will apply to our Navigation Act as applied to the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act we passed in 1909.

But they would not be entitled to compensation under this Bill. We have no proof, but we are led to believe that that vessel was lost at more than 3 miles from the coast, and so the loss did not take place within our territorial waters. I was informed by the best authority in England that the relatives of the men lost on the <inline font-style="italic">Waratah</inline> could claim, had claimed, and were paid compensation under the Imperial Act.I think it has been laid clown by the High Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Kingston</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Gadd,</inline> which is the leading case defining our powers in this respect, that we can enforce the laws of the Commonwealth from port to port in Australia, no matter whether a ship goes beyond the 3-mile limit from the coast or not. I say, therefore, that this Bill does not go far enough, and it should have followed in this matter the decision in the case referred to. A ship leaving Fremantle, bound for Adelaide, must go outside the 3-mile limit, and if she is lost crossing the Australian Bight this Bill will be absolutely worthless as a means of securing compensation to the relatives of seamen on board. I do not think that that can be desired. The decision of the High Court is broad enough to justify a far wider interpretation of the law than is covered by this Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will not apply to seamen who have not been engaged in Australia. My opinion regarding the Bill is that it is much too narrowly drawn. I shall do nothing to impede its passage, as it may be of advantage to some one ; but as surely as I stand here, if this measure is passed, it will be found that an amending Bill will be necessary next year. Upon the decision of the High Court, the measure might have been made to apply to ships leaving one port in Australia for any other in another State, no matter whether on the voyage they went outside the 3-mile limit or not. It is, in my opinion regrettable that the Act we passed in 1909 was decided to be unconstitutional, and that no steps have been taken earlier to put another measure of the kind on the statute-book. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to offer only a few remarks in regard to the debate. Clause 4 of the Bill to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has referred is much more comprehensive than the honorable senator imagines. He has been reading one paragraph into another, but if honorable senators will look carefully at the clause, they will find that paragraph a refers to vessels belonging to the Commonwealth, and to these the laws of the Commonwealth will apply anywhere. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> refers to ships trading with Australia, or engaging in any occupation in Australian waters, and being in the territorial waters of any territory which is part of the Commonwealth. </para>

In the same way there are Australian ships going from Melbourne to Queensland or in the opposite direction that would be equally so, so far as our powers under the Constitution enable us to meet such cases. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has referred to the Navigation Bill, which is still before this Parliament, I point out to him that if he looks at section 98 of the Constitution he will find there a full explanation of the attitude assumed by the High Court, not only in connexion with legislation of that description, but in connexion with a Bill of this kind also.

                    <para class="block">That does not extend the powers contained in section 51, but it is explanatory of them. It is because the trade and commerce powers of the Parliament are limited that the powers in section 98, with regard to navigation and shipping, are also limited to the extent of such limitation. According to the interpretation given by the High Court, we cannot, in this or any other Bill, go outside the. trade and commerce powers. That renders it necessary, in clause 4, to deal in three separate paragraphs with the different conditions which are created under those powers. We cannot do any more than we are doing in the Bill. If we attempted to do so we should contravene the Constitution, and might have the Bill thrown upon our hands again.

                    <para>In our taxation legislation we endeavour to avoid double taxation, and in this case we want to endeavour to prevent the duplication of damages. We desire to prevent a seaman, or an officer, or anybody else, from getting compensation in Australia under this measure, and then, under the law of a foreign country, claiming compensation there. It is to make it quite clear that a seaman cannot obtain compensation twice that the amendment is proposed. </para>

                        <para>. - I really cannot understand the reason for making this provision. I admit that I did not understand the matter when I made an interjection during the debate on the second reading. While I recognise that it would be blackmailing for any person to claim damages twice, this amendment appears to me to be overloading the Bill. How can a man recover compensation except by making a claim against his employers ? I suppose that he could not, in any case, get compensation from anybody else. As his employers are one firm or company, no matter what country they do business in, if he was foolish enough to enter an action in another country the fact would be at once  a  bar and throw him out of Court. </para>

                            <para>- - I should like to know the reason for limiting the amount to  .&#163;100.  Why should it not be equal to the liability, whatever it may be? I cannot see why in a case of bankruptcy a possible claimant should not have the right to the maximum amount which he otherwise would have. I can understand why we should have such a provision, but not with this limitation. </para>

                        will see that without this provision a claimant might get only a few pounds, or perhaps nothing. It gives him priority over other creditors. We have made the clause as liberal as we can do. No matter what amounts may be due to other creditors, a claimant for compensation under the Act will have priority to the extent of at least &#163;100. Seeing that in ordinary circumstances a claimant might only get two or three pounds or nothing, and that a number of persons are placed under a disability, it is, .1 think, a very generous allowance to make.

                        <para>. - I think I can understand the object of the provision, namely, that a claimant shall get something, but, as a rule, shipowners are large companies or firms. An ordinary householder who goes bankrupt mav have assets to the amount of only half-a-crown, but when a shipping firm goes bankrupt it must have some substantial assets if it has only one ship. Consequently, this provision does not appear to me to be so generous as the Minister states it is. I think- that we should entitle the claimant to get the full amount of his claim. Is there any ship-owning firm which, it it went bankrupt, would not have ships of some kind in its estate? The employment of seamen implies the ownership of ships, and therefore the possession of considerable assets in the case of bankruptcy. </para>

                            <para>- We know that these matters are always provided for by way of insurance. In fact preceding clauses deal with the liabilities of insurance companies. The wages of all seamen employed plus the claims against, the owners for any accident would represent a very small proportion of the total assets of any shipping firm which is doing business in Australasian waters at the present time. Is it not a fact that claims for accidents would be a very small percentage of the total assets of any shipping company that went insolvent? I can quite understand that in an ordinary case of bankruptcy, if you secure anything like a total payment to one set of creditors you may deprive another set of any share whatever. But to meet all possible claims under this Act would absorb so small a percentage of any company&#39;s assets that I cannot conceive that we should be doing any injury to any set of creditors by providing that the full amount that can be claimed should be secured to seamen.

                        <para>. - I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is proposing an unnecessary extension of the provisions of the Bill. There may be hundreds of cases where <inline font-style="italic">/,00 ,</inline> would be all that was necessary. In many instances small amounts would be claimed, but the amendment would provide for compensation to the extent of  ^500  in every case, large or small. </para>

                        <para>. - In the event of one claim being made <inline font-style="italic">&#163;25</inline> and another for  ^500,  would not the fact of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> being provided for in this clause be injurious to the interests of the person claiming the larger amount? Suppose that a number of people make claims, some of whom are only entitled to&#163;50 compensation; the fact of only &#163;100 being kept back from an insolvent&#39;s estate to meet all claims would&#39; be very hard on others of them. In dealing with a humanitarian measure of this kind, in which we make provision for those who have no means of subsistence, we should see to it that they get the full amount to which they are entitled. I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has given anything like an adequate answer to my argument. He says that there may be cases in which the claim only amounts to . &#163;50, and that my amendment would insure &#163;500 being laid by to meet that liability. But under the Bill as it stands only &#163;100 would be laid by to meet a&#163;500 liability. Which is the better course, to have the larger amount at hand to meet the claims, or to make it impossible for a person entitled to&#163;500 to get more than one-fourth of that amount? </para>

                        <para>. - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has suggested a way out of the difficulty. I was exercising my mind as to whether or not I could vote for the clause with the &#163;100 limitation in it. I can picture a case where a seaman may have lost his life, and where his widow is entitled to compensation. Surely the value of a man&#39;s life is more than&#163;100. In the event of injury the compensation may be more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500.</inline> It would be far better to leave out the amount than to stipulate that it shall be only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> What I am desirous of is that the full amount shall be obtainable by the relatives of injured seamen, or those who lose their lives. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no intention of supporting the amendment which has been so crudely moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> Under our various Workmen&#39;s Compensation Acts it is the law to-day that a workman must be incapacitated for a fortnight as a result of his injuries before he can claim compensation. But I think we ought to set a better example, particularly in the case of seamen whose claims for consideration have so long been neglected. It was my intention to move an amendment upon this schedule, but I shall not do so now. At the same time 1 should like an assurance from the Vice-President of the Executive Council that compensation will be paid to a seaman from the time that he sustains any injury. </para>

                            <para>-  Clause 5 does not say anything in regard to the duration of the incapacity of a seaman. The schedule provides that if a seaman&#39;s incapacity lasts for less than two weeks no compensation shall be paid to him in respect of the first week, whereas clause 5 sets out that the employer shall not, in any case, be liable for an accident which incapacitates a seaman for less than a week. </para>

                            <para>-  I wish to point out that the two things are quite distinct. The meaning of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> of sub-clause  2,  of clause 5, is that if a seaman be injured, but is able to return to his work within  a  week of sustaining his injuries, he shall receive no compensation whatever. Now, the schedule provides that if his incapacity should last less than two weeks no compensation shall be payable in respect of the first week. In other words, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> of sub-clause  2,  of clause 5, refers to an accident which affects a seaman for only a week or less, whereas sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> of paragraph  1  of the schedule, refers to an accident which incapacitates a seaman for a fortnight or less. The two things are entirely distinct. </para>

                            <para>- For the protection of their own interests, trade unions have made such a provision in their rules, and surely, in dealing with a matter in which the general public are concerned, we should exercise the same care. We must be just and fair in all our legislation. If we follow the rules laid down by trade unionists for their own protection and benefit, we cannot go far wrong. I would just as soon that our legislation was based on them as on the Ten Commandments. Referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> remarks concerning paragraph 21. of the schedule, let me say that it covers a case, for instance, of a seaman refusing to submit himself to the examination provided for in this Act. It must be clear that if a man refuses to submit himself to that examination, there must be something wrong about his claim, and it is not unreasonable that, while his right to compensation is suspended during such a refusal, there should be no payment in respect of the period of suspension. </para>

                <para>When the Bill inaugurating penny postage was going through in another place last year, the Postmaster-General accepted an amendment permitting books printed in Australia to go through the post at the cheap rate of1d. Since that Bill became law, a number of people - commercial people principally - have claimed the right to send trade circulars, catalogues, price lists, and publications of that character through the post as books printed in Australia, and claim that they should be sent through the post at a rate of 8 oz. for1d., instead of as commercial papers at the rate  of 2 oz. for id. Of course, it was never intended that such publications should be regarded as books. It was intended that ! books &#34; should refer only to Australian literature ; such books, for instance, as the one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger published. Previous to the alteration made by the Bill referred, to, this class of matter went through the post-office at the rate of 4  oz,. for id., and under the Postal Rates Bill of last year, at a rate of 2 oz. for a Jd. The other clause of this Bill is introduced for the purpose of securing a better definition of &#34; magazine,&#34; and also to give a preference to magazines and catalogues printed in Australia over imported magazines and catalogues, or such matter printed in Australia from imported stereotypes. As the matters dealt with in the Bill are of a highly technical character, and I do not profess to have an intimate knowledge of them, I quote the following official interpretation of the alterations which the Bill will effect - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>This amending Bill is rendered necessary owing to the fact that advantage is sought to be taken of the Rates Act 1910 to send catalogues and other similar matter in book form at the cheap rate of postage provided therein for books. Under that Bill, as originally submitted to Parliament, books would have come under the head of printed papers, as is the case in all the principal countries of the_ world; but when the Bill was under discussion it was urged that encouragement should be given to Australian writers, and that the rate for books should be made the same as that for magazines. This was agreed to by the Postmaster-General, and the same rates were adopted for books as for magazines, the intention clearly being that books should mean books in the ordinary literary sense of the term. </para>
                    <para>Under State arrangements the &#34;book&#34; rate of postage was applicable to catalogues, prospectuses, and generally to anything printed and bound in book form, and the persons who had been in the habit of issuing these publications claimed that they should still be regarded as &#34; books &#34; and be allowed the benefit of the reduced rate under the new conditions, notwithstanding that the rate for printed papers, to which category they properly belong, under the Commonwealth regulations is, except in one State, not greater than the book rate was previously, and in the other five States is less than it was previously for certain weights because of the progression under the State rate having been at the rate of id. per 4 ounces as against <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per 2 ounces under the Commonwealth - thus, 6 ounces and 10 ounces in one case would cost 2d. and 3d. respectively as against 1&#189;d. and 2&#189;d. respectively in the other (the Commonwealth). </para>
                    <para>Further, confusion arose in the minds of Departmental officers as to what should be allowed the benefit of the reduced book rate, in view of the definition under State <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> and the dictionary definition of what is a book, and it is consequently necessary in order to protect the revenue that Parliament shall enable it to be laid down distinctly what articles are not to get the benefit of the book rate. This is found by the Crown Law Officers to be more easy of accomplishment than defining what are to be regarded as books. </para>
                    <para>Similar trouble has been caused through the definition of the articles which may be sent at the magazine rate, it having been claimed on behalf of catalogues and other trade publications which are issued periodically that they are &#34; serials,&#34; &#38;c, and therefore entitled to the reduced rate. It is now proposed to omit the word &#34; serials,&#34; which is unnecessary, and to amend the definition in such a way as wi!l,_ it is thought, effectively exclude publications which were never intended to come within the scope of the magazine rate. The- words &#34; for each magazine &#34; have been added to the rate, so as to make the intention clear in that regard. The Crown Law Officers have advised that as the Act at present stands more than one magazine could be placed under one cover, and postage would have to be charged on the gross weight of the packet at the rate of id. per 8 ounces instead of at that rate for each magazine contained in the cover, on the principle applied to newspapers. The anomaly therefore now exists that, while the rate for newspapers is <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per 10 ounces, as against id. per 8 ounces for magazines, five newspapers, each weighing 4 ounces, or 20 ounces in all, sent by n private individual under one cover would cost 2&#189;d. (i.e., Aid. each), three magazines, each weighing 8 ounces, or 24 ounces in all, would cost only i&#177;d. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is the official explanation as to the necessity for altering the rates. A further concession is given which will allow catalogues which are wholly set up and printed in Australia, to be carried through the post at the rate of Jd. for every  4  ozs. or part thereof. It will be seen that the object of the Bill is to carry out the intention of Parliament, and in certain respects to liberalize the rates on Australian printed matter. I anticipate that little opposition will be offered to its second reading. </para>

                    <para>- - As the Minister has said, the Bill does meet the departmental objections or difficulties; and I am very pleased to say that, so far as the printing trade is concerned, it meets with their approval. I think that, to some extent, it has arisen out of a very small deputation which I had the honor of introducing to the late Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas.</inline> Various matters were discussed on that occasion, and this measure makes good the Minister&#39;s declarations. So far as I know, as the result of inquiry, the Bill is satisfactory. There are some matters which are not connected with the Bill, but which possibly the present Postmaster- General will also consider. </para>

                <para class="block">Everything was done to make the Land Tax Assessment Bill of last session as clear as possible; but as .we live in a fallible world, the Government and their supporters do not possess all the knowledge, and of course it is not the duty of the Opposition to come to their assistance and put them right, as they ought to do when omissions and mistakes are sometimes made. Therefore it has been found necessary, for the proper administration of the Act, and also in the interests of joint owners, trustees, agents, and other persons of that description, that certain amendments should be made. When the Government found in the administration of the Act that there were provisions which were not perfectly clear, and that in some instances the High Court placed on the Act an interpretation which they did not consider was exactly what was meant by Parliament, they realized that it was necessary to amend the law. I am not saying that any fault rests with the High Court, because the Judges must administer the laws as they find them. It was probably the fault of the Government, in the first instance, and then of Parliament in not making the measure more perfect. This short amending Bill contains thirteen clauses. Some of them, of course, are of a very technical character ; in fact, without taking up very much more time than I desire to occupy in presenting the measure, I could not go into all the technicalities. I shall leave that to honorable senators, who  have  a copy of the Bill in their hands, and can see where amendments are proposed to Le made in the Act. I hope that the Bill will be speedily passed. The rapid way in which we are proceeding shows that there is an inclination on the part of honorable senators to finish the work as expeditiously as possible. At the same time, I believe that they are giving every consideration to the provisions of the different measures. I have much pleasure in submitting the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council ought to have given us more information with regard to the effect which the measure will have. I have been trying to spell it out, but the clauses are of a very technical character, and I have not had the advantage of legal assistance. No doubt, the Bill will affect the revenue from the land tax, but that is not the principal objection which I have to it, if I have any. What I want to know is whether under the new definition of &#34; joint owners &#34; it will be possible for a large estate to be held by a joint- stock company. That is a matter which I think the Minister should have made clear to the Senate. If my reading of the Bill is correct, and I hope that it is not, it will be possible for a joint-stock company to hold hundreds of thousands of acres, and to monopolize them just as effectively as a single individual could do, and yet escape land-value taxation if the number of its shareholders be sufficiently large. If that is the case, it is a pernicious proposal, and is out of harmony with one of the purposes of the principal Act, which was to break down land monopoly. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> or some other member of the Government, will give the Senate some information on that point. </para>

If that be the intention, we ought to know. We cannot afford to rush Bills through without understanding them. Though I am a supporter of the Government, I do object to this procedure. The Bill ought to be explained so that every honorable senator can understand it. If anomalies are to be rectified, let the Minister explain what they are. I know that some injustices have occurred. I have heard landholders complain of them. I believe that some have hod reason to complain. But it is most unsatisfactory to have a Bill introduced as this has been by my worthy friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline></para>

He has been kept very busy, and supporters of the Government cannot expect him to do impossibilities. It is true that he introduced the Bill very briefly ; but, no doubt, he thought it was not necessary to make a long explanation, inasmuch as he could explain any point upon which information was desired in Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is always necessary, in moving the second reading of a Bill to amend an Act with which everybody is familiar, to make a long speech. I am prepared to give any explanation that is required on any clause. As to joint owners, the provisions of the Bill are practically the same as those of the principal Act, except that the new definition makes it more clear that those who receive any benefit from an estate shall pay the full tax in the aggregate, whilst individually they pay only a fair share according to the amount they hold. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like the Government to take into consideration the hardship imposed upon persons under the section of the principal Act which this clause amends. I am aware of cases where under the terms of a will persons have been appointed tenants for life; and simply because trustees have been appointed, they have been called upon to pay their full share of the land tax, whereas, if trustees had not been appointed, they would have escaped taxation entirely. Under the circumstances, the Government might see the desirableness of abolishing the provision requiring the appointment of trustees in such cases. That would allow persons who were beneficiaries under a will to escape the heavy burden of taxation which they are called upon to pay at present. This Bill has been brought in to give relief in certain directions. If care had been observed in its preparation, it would have been found that there are cases in which positive hardship has resulted owing to the principal Act requiring the appointment of trustees. We expected great things to follow from the principal Act, but, of course, in this, as in every Act of legislation, defects have been revealed. </para>

                    <para>. - It appears that this clause has been designed to exempt beneficiaries under a will. I am not sure whether it is a good provision or a bad one from the point of view of dealing with the land monopolist. Take an estate which is valued at &#163;40,000, and which has been left by will to eight relatives of the testator. Each of these beneficiaries will be exempted to the extent of &#163;5,000; so that, while the estate during the testator&#39;s life was liable to taxation on &#163;35,000, upon his death no tax will be payable, notwithstanding that the estate has not been cut up. I object to allowing an estate to be managed as a whole without payment of any tax. This clause seems to favour the holding by families of large areas against settlement, with a view to appropriating the community-created values. In it the words &#34; by blood, marriage, or adoption &#34; are used. What is the meaning of the term &#34;adoption&#34;? My principal objection to the clause is that it permits an exemption of &#163;5,000 in the case of each beneficiary under a will, notwithstanding that the estate continues to be administered as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - &#93; would like to explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that this provision was contained in the principal Act. The honorable senator will recollect that some little concession was made to those persons who had executed their wills years ago, before there was any prospect of the imposition of a progressive land tax. But no will which was made after the month of September in the year that that tax was imposed can come under the operation of this clause. Its scope is confined to wills made in favour of blood relations, or of adopted children. I do not think that there are more than two or three of these in existence, and their provisions will naturally soon die out. In the case which has been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> it would be impossible for me to express an opinion in the absence of knowledge of the contents of the will. But I can assure him that the persons interested will be treated no worse under this Bill than they were treated under the principal Act. If a hardship has been inflicted upon them, it cannot be remedied here. I would also remind the honorable senator that, no matter what legislation we may enact, some injustice is bound to be done. If we were to attempt to legislate for all cases of hardship, we should have to pass very peculiar Statutes indeed. </para>

One man came to me some time ago in a great state of excitement, and told me he had been served with a notice that he was liable to a fine of &#163;100 for having failed to furnish a return. I accompanied him to the office of the Deputy Commissioner, where I discovered that he was not only liable to a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100,</inline> but to a second fine of a similar amount because of his neglect to supply a return in respect of the previous year. He assured me that he had not received any notice on the matter, and that he was unaware that he had to make these returns. I have heard of a great number of complaints of a similar character. Indeed, I nearly fell into error myself last year because I failed to observe the notice which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> If the Government can give more publicity to what is required of taxpayers it will greatly facilitate the working of the Act. </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that, prior to 1883, certain persons in the State of New South Wales were allowed, at their own expense, to be connected with the Government telephone exchange. Lines then erected at private expense have been continued under the original arrangement up to the present time. It is found that this makes it difficult for the Post and Telegraph Department to carry out their desire to make the telephone service more efficient. This Bill provides that the Postmaster-General, after giving two months&#39; notice to the owner of one of these lines, may acquire it. This power is sought particularly in regard to the metropolitan area. It is anticipated that the exercise of the power conferred by the Bill will entail an expenditure of between &#163;3,000 and .&#163;4,000 in the acquisition of these purchase telephone lines. The Bill provides that if the amount of compensation to be paid for one of these lines cannot be agreed upon, it is- to be settled by arbitration in accordance with the laws relating to arbitration of the State in which the line is situated. I have stated practically the purpose of the Bill, and  T  do not think there is occasion for any further explanation of it. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that this measure is entirely desirable in the public interest, for the reason that we have affirmed that the Commonwealth shall be seized of a monopoly of the telephonic and telegraphic services of the country. Some difficulty has arisen, and this was evident even before Federation, from the existence of a few privately owned lines working in with the State-owned lines. That is a difficulty which should be overcome, and for that reason this Bill is to be commended. I have no doubt that if the private owners of these lines were consulted, they would be as ready to approve of this measure as are the Government officials. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;8.5&#93;.- The explanation given by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    is perhaps more pertinent to the object of this Bill than is that given by the Minister. I do not know in what way, if at all, these purchase telephone lines interfere with the working of the general telephone system, but I am aware of the fact that the men who erected these lines at their own expense many years ago have been, and still are, charged a lower rental than are those who have had telephones put into their places for them by the Government. It is as well to state plainly that the object of the Bill may not be so much for the purpose of the efficient working of the telephone system as for the purpose of providing a larger revenue from the telephone branch of the Post and Telegraph Department. Whether that is a proper object is for honorable members to consider. It may be very desirable that all telephone lines should be under State control, but the fact remains that the people who own these lines pay a lower rental than those who use lines supplied by the Government, and it is entirely misleading to say that the Bill is introduced merely to enable the telephone system to be more efficiently worked. I have seen no evidence to justify one in coming to the conclusion that these purchase telephone lines are not worked just as efficiently, or, should I say, as inefficiently, as are the lines which have been erected at the Government expense? I do not oppose the measure, because I presume that the Government have satisfied themselves that it is a desirable Bill to pass in order that the Commonwealth may enjoy the absolute monopoly of the business. I shall not oppose the second reading, but I object to the Bill being submitted to the Senate in a way which did not disclose what I think is the real object of the Government in submitting this legislation.

I take it that there are two classes of privately-owned wires, one covering wires erected by the Department for private individuals and at their expense, and the other covering wires erected by private individuals at their own expense. The purpose of the proposed amendments is to apply the same conditions to both classes of wires? </para>

                        <para>- I know of one telephone line about 3 miles in length  which was erected by private persons after 1883. I think it was erected about the year 1891, under an arrangement with the Department, by private owners at their own expense, and they control the line at the present time. It connects two residences with the general , telephone exchange of a certain town. So far as &#39;I know that line belongs to the people who erected it, and they can prevent any one else from using it. Why should we not say in this clause &#34;prior to the year 1911&#34;? That would make it quite clear that all privately erected lines under the old purchase telephone system in whatever part of Australia they may be, may be acquired by the Government. I think that if the Minister will look into the matter he will see that it would be better to leave out all mention of the year 1883. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the reason why the year 1883 is mentioned is that since that time no telephones have been constructed under the system which we are trying to do away, with. It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell says, that under the Commonwealth Act private telephones are erected, particularly on sheep stations; but all of these are erected under licences. The telephone and telegraph systems of the Commonwealth are a monopoly, and no private person can erect a telephone to-day, even at his own expense, except under a licence given by the Department. Up to 1883, private telephones were erected by the Department at the expense of the owner, or by the owner at his own expense ; but since that year they have been erected by the Department at the expense of the owner. </para>

                        <para>- There is plenty of time to consider this Bill. I hope that honorable senators will not lose their opportunity of giving fair consideration to an important measure dealing with the Public Service. We know that in connexion with Conciliation and Arbitration laws there may be disabilities which affect some sections of the community, and the public servants of the different States. The Commonwealth stands in an entirely different position, as it has the power to make laws which will be likely to bring about peace and harmony between the public servants of Australia and the officers who may have the duty of fixing the rates of wages, the hours and the conditions of labour, and other matters of that description. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is always best to be sanguine, and never to try to meet the devil half-way, never to try, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has said, to take the fences before one comes to them. If members of Parliament will follow that principle I am sure that they will get along much better than they will if they try to do more than is really necessary at any particular time. The members of this Parliament have had various complaints from time to time with respect to the treatment of the Public Service, not only under the Public Service Act, but by the officer who was appointed for the purpose of classifying the Public Service, deciding the fates of wages, and fixing other conditions in accordance with the Act. We know that in different places complaints have been made, and honorable senators must acknowledge that, in some instances, they have been justified. </para>

                        <para>- We shall see about that. It is an honest attempt to give them an opportunity of getting satisfaction. In the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provisions had to be made for dealing with larger bodies of employes than may exist in some branches of the Public Service. Under that Act the minimum number of employes who can register as an association is  100.  In the Public Service it would be found rather difficult, in some instances, to find  100  employes engaged in a branch or calling, and consequently provision is made in this Bill to obviate that difficulty. Any number of employe&#39;s can band themselves together as an association. But it must be remembered that they can only obtain the benefits of conciliation and arbitration through an association just the same as the employes in any other industry can do. </para>

                        <para>- The principal Act provides for an association of  100  persons or over. But this Bill only requires that there shall be an association, and three-fifths of those comprised in an association can appeal to the Arbitration Court. Suppose, for instance, that the heads of the seven Departments formed an association, and that five of them felt that they had a grievance, the latter could go before the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; only the Bill provides that any number can form an association. I think that honorable senators will see that, under the Bill, there is ample opportunity for those following every occupation in the Public Service, if they have a grievance, to get it adjusted before the Court. The Public Service stands in an entirely different position from the employes of a private individual, and the public servants have a right to expect Parliament to do them justice, and to see that, in all circumstances, justice is done by them. The general public have also a right to look to Parliament to see that fair play is meted out to them, and that they are not burdened to any serious extent by any decisions which may be given in the Arbitration Court with respect to public servants. Consequently it is provided that when an appeal is made to the Court by any body of public servants, and a decision is arrived at, the decision shall be reported to the Attorney-General, and to the Prime Minister, and then laid on the table of each House within fourteen days, &#39;if Parliament is sitting, or if it is not sitting, within fourteen days after it re-assembles. If the members of Parliament see that by that decision full justice is not done, any member of Parliament can move to disapprove of the award. </para>

                        <para>-I will deal with him in a minute or two. The Conciliation and Arbitration Court, under this Bill, can take cognizance of any appeal or complaint that is made by any body of public servants. That Court can even make an award which is not or may not be in accord with any law or regulation of the Commonwealth. But when such an incident occurs, such decision has to be reported to the Attorney-General, and the  President  of the Court has also to furnish a report showing in what respect his award goes beyond the laws of the Commonwealth- The matter has then to be reported to the Prime Minister, and the papers must be laid upon the table of both Houses of this Parliament. They are to remain upon the table for thirty days. Honorable senators will see the necessity for allowing for a fairly long time in connexion with any decision of the Court which goes beyond the laws of the Commonwealth. If within the thirty days any member of either House of the Parliament moves a resolution, which is carried, disapproving of the decision of the Court, it cannot take effect. But if, at the end of the thirty days, neither House of Parliament sees any reason why such a motion of disapproval should be carried, the award will have the force of law, notwithstanding any other law existing in the Commonwealth at the time. The consent of Parliament will be regarded as having been given to the award. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has asked why the decision of the Public Service Commissioner should not be all that should be required for the government of our Public Service. </para>

                        <para>- I have already explained that it would be impossible for Parliament to deal with all the difficulties and grievances that might arise in the Public Service. By this Bill, an opportunity is afforded to public servants collectively to lay their grievances before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. All the aspects of those grievances can be reviewed by the Court, and evidence taken. We in Parliament cannot take evidence. We cannot do a number of things that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court can do. What position does the Public Service Commissioner occupy? He stands in the position of an authorized employer on behalf of the Commonwealth. He is placed there by the Government to represent the Commonwealth. Through him., the Commonwealth employs its public servants. The Commissioner may be the wisest and best of men, and yet, in dealing with the ramifications of the Public Service, is it not possible that he may make mistakes sometimes? It is possible that the public servants and Parliament itself may consider some of his actions to be mistakes. Nevertheless, he may be firmly convinced that he has done the right thing, and the public servants may be unable to get redress when they appeal to him. He can say, &#34; That is my decision, and you will have to abide by it.&#34; The only remedy which the public servants then have is to come to Parliament. But they cannot come to Parliament as a body. They can only approach some member of Parliament, or some member of the Government. According to the Public Service Act, however, it is not within their province to do so. They have no right to appeal to members of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- They went to the High Court, not for a rectification of grievances, but for an interpretation of the law. The question of law at issue was decided against them. Consequently, they were not satisfied. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> does not expect that any body of public servants, or any body of the public, when they have a grievance, and go to the High Court, will be perfectly satisfied- if, in consequence of a legal technicality, the decision is against them. We have to accept decisions of the High Court as final. Our personal opinion may be that a particular decision is wrong. But we must have finality. The only other thing that can be done in regard to the Public Service is to amend the Public Service Act. That probably will be a very tough job when it takes place, because the diverse opinions held by members of the Senate and another place as to how public servants ought to be treated, would render it -almost impossible for us to come to a conclusion on that point. As in regard to all legislation, a compromise would be effected, and it would not give satisfaction to all the public servants. But here we place a Court at their disposal. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> liked to open his mouth wide enough, he could tell us that the seamen of Australia were not altogether satisfied with everything they got under an Arbitration award lately given. </para>

                        <para>- I know that they did not do badly ; and for what they did not get, they will just have to wait patiently until another opportunity offers, when perhaps they will be able to make out a better case.&#34; The Constitution probably would not allow the  President  of the Court to give them all they wanted. Probably the same thing will occur in connexion with the public servants when they go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. They will be like most other members of this enlightened community. They will ask for a great deal more than&#39; they really want, hoping to get a near approximation to what will be satisfactory to them. I do not justify anything of that kind ; but we know that it is done in connexion with Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. We are now doing all we possibly can to provide a tribunal to do justice to the public servants, and to enable them to get fair play. We are also providing, by this legislation, that the measure of justice and fair play meted out to them will have to come before this Parliament in order that we may see that nothing is done in behalf of one section of the community which will be to the prejudice of another. When we consider that the Public Service Commissioner has been endeavouring to do his best, and has not given satisfaction, we may hope that by this legislation the Arbitration Court will be able to take a hand in endeavouring to adjust those grievances and complaints. That will be another step towards effecting a remedy. If that fails, there will be Parliament to appeal to. If the public servants require more than that, I am afraid that they will have to wait until they die, and get it at the great Judgment Day. We are doing the best we can for them under present conditions ; and I am sure that no body of legislators could do more. I therefore have much pleasure in moving the second reading of the Bill </para>

                    <para>. - May I be permitted to make a personal explanation? It is apparent to all that we shall shortly have the Estimates before us in the form of the Appropriation Bill, and, consequently, it seems to me that it would be a waste of time, at this stage - of the session, to debate the Treasurer&#39;s Budget. I therefore propose to defer any remarks that I might otherwise wish to make on that subject until the Estimates are under review. </para>

In the very nature of things, the Estimates cannot reach us till very late in the session. If no honorable senator has any desire to speak upon this motion to-night, the Government cannot help that. If honorable senators wish to postpone its consideration, it will be necessary for one of them to move the adjournment of the debate. </para>
