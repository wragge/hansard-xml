I have been conferring with my honorable colleagues, and they are of the opinion that an adjournment for three weeks should be proposed. </para>

            <para>- If the Bill were before the Senate, or there were any other business to be done, we would not be asked to adjourn to-day. It is simply because there is no business ready that this proposition is made. As a rule, measures have to be introduced in another place, and, consequently, at the beginning of a session we have not as many measures before the Senate as we should like to have. I would urge upon the Government the advisability of proposing an adjournment for three weeks, which would suit equally well the requirements of those who are favorable to a fortnight&#39;s adjournment. </para>

          <para>. - I am more than astonished at a motion of this kind being moved by the leader of the Senate thus early in the session. It is the most extraordinary proposal I have ever heard put forward in this or any other legislative assembly. After a recess of nine months, and after sitting for a fortnight, we are asked to adjourn for a fortnight because there is no business to be done. That seems to me to be the most extraordinary position in which a legislative body could place itself, especially if it consented, without a protest, to an adjournment. Of course, we know that all Governments are prone to love recesses because there is less bother and trouble when Parliament is not in session. </para>

            <para>- I find that human nature is pretty well the same amongst all parties. What I want to emphasize is that, after a recess of nine months, apparently there is no business to engage the attention of the Senate for another fortnight. That can be the only possible reason why a motion of this kind is proposed thus early in the session. The GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech outlines a very considerable programme. I notice that it enumerates several measures which may be initiated in the Senate. If that is the case, then we have a right to complain if the Government will not provide us with the necessary work to occupy our time. What will be the position if this sort of thing is allowed to continue? The opinion will be formed by the public, and will be amply justified, that the Senate is entirely unnecessary. If that be so, then honorable senators are only committing political suicide. I do not know whether the Senate is unnecessary or not, and I am not going to debate that subject. My opinion is that some better system should be adopted whereby all the work could be done in one Chamber. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, while the Senate is in existence, I emphatically object to its members being kept in Melbourne cooling their heels all the time instead of doing the work of the country, which they are paid to do. It does not matter whether it is a Labour Ministry or another Ministry, a Ministry which will not provide proper work for Parliament to do, especially after a long recess such as we have had, is worthy of condemnation in that particular regard. The Navigation Bill has been before the Senate for about seven years, and it is still on the business-paper. </para>

The honorable senator is aware that there are postponed clauses to be considered which are exceedingly contentious. No doubt he would be very pleased if he could sneak them through without discussion, but I can assure him that as long as I am here they will not pass without debate. I am here to see a fair deal to every part of Australia, and no favours or concessions given to any one part above another.

            <para>- I do not want any more years to pass it, but I desire an opportunity to consider it. I am anxious to see the measure passed, but in a form in which it will be not only acceptable to the people, but thoroughly equitable and justifiable. If it is proposed to rush the Bill through simply for the sake of getting a holiday, as the Minister indicates by his interjection, that is not what we are here for, nor is it a proper way in which to treat legislation. I wonder why with an immense programme of legislation outlined in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech, a large portion of which could be initiated in the Senate, no measure is ready to engage our attention. We have only a few short months at our disposal before the usual time for closing the session will arrive. </para>

          <para>. - Although I bow, of course, with resignation to the desire of the Government, I certainly think that the proper remedy is to have in the Senate two Ministers with portfolios. We should then have a better opportunity of showing that the Senate is not merely a replica of a Legislative Council. This is the first Ministry, which has had three representatives in the: Senate, and for that concession we thank them. At the same time, I think that at. least two of them ought to have portfolios. If nobody else can have a portfolio, let the Attorney-General be in the Senate, as he does not have to deal so much with money matters as have his colleagues. </para>

I think it is up to myself and others to protest against the Senate being reduced to an absolute farce. If we cannot do any good work; why not adjourn <inline font-style="italic">sine die?</inline> The argument that the Senate should be abolished does not meet with my approbation. I would rather see the House of Representatives abolished. I think that the Government is in danger of making it appear to the country that the Senate is of no use by failing to submit to it now some of the measures which will in all probability be rushed at the latter end of the session. .If, however, there is no business to be done we may as well adjourn, but a better system might easily be arranged. I understood at the beginning of the &#34;session that an arrangement would be made by which the work would be divided better, and that some measures which did not exceed our powers in regard to finance would be introduced here. </para>

I realize that some system should be devised to prevent the necessity for adjourning. I would remind honorable senators that three of the principal Ministers were absent from their Departments for a considerable time, being engaged in London in transacting business on behalf of the people of Australia. Since their return they have not had a sufficient oppportunity to prepare Bills for the Chamber. </para>

            <para>- If there is no business for us to transact, obviously we must adjourn. But will any business be forthcoming at the expiration of a fortnight? If not, the Government might reasonably extend the proposed adjournment to another week in order that representatives from distant States may be afforded an opportunity of visiting their constituencies. I regret the necessity for any adjournment, but, under the circumstances, I recognise that such a course of action is unavoidable. I appeal to the Government to amend the motion by making the adjournment cover three weeks. </para>

          <para>.-- I entirely agree with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> At this period of the year the weather is admirably suited to travelling, and after having enjoyed such a long recess surely the Government have some business for us to transact. Ministers did not consult me in regard to this motion. I am opposed to it, and I am also opposed to the attitude which has been taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. I would not like to inflict an injustice upon any State, but the representatives of Western Australia only arrived in Melbourne a week or two ago, so that on this occasion they have a very poor excuse to put forward. To suggest that the Senate is an unnecessary branch of the Legislature, even by way of fun, is entirely out of place. Perish the thought. We must have State rights recognised and protected. I enter my protest against the unpreparedness of the Government to proceed with the work of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. - Unfortunately some honorable senators from other States appear to think that all the representatives of Victoria reside in Melbourne, and are desirous of obstructing them whenever they wish to have a holiday. I have never known any Victorian senator who resides within a reasonable distance of this city to prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> from taking a holiday just when he chooses to do so. Therefore, in discussing a motion of this character, it would be just as well to drop that ghost. I recollect that some time ago there was an agitation in favour of an additional Minister being appointed to this Chamber. With the advent of the present Government, the Senate gained an additional Cabinet representative, and it was then thought that the day was dawning when this branch of the Legislature would become a real working Chamber. But apparently that hope is to be disappointed. Before we are asked to adjourn we should have had at least one Bill submitted by each member of the Government in the Senate. If they are not going to take an active part in the work of the Ministry, we shall be no better off than we were previously. I have no sympathy with those honorable senators from other States who wish to hurry back to their homes. We have spent a sufficiently long period in our homes during the past nine months, and it is about time that we got to work, and that the Government provided us with some business. I intend to vote against all attempts to adjourn the Senate this year. </para>

          <para>. - If this motion be defeated, the result will be largely owing to the lack of discretion displayed on the part of the Government. Personally I have an entirely open mind on the question. I have my family in Melbourne, and it does not matter to me whether the Senate adjourns for a week, two weeks, or three weeks. But I would prefer that we should proceed with business. If, however, that business is not forthcoming, it is absurd for us to continue sitting, and to make a pretence of doing something. I cannot understand the action of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in merely moving the motion without assigning any reason for it. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. As has already been pointed out, a large number of measures are outlined in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech. If the VicePresident of the Executive Council can show that there are reasons why we should adjourn for a fortnight, I am sure that the Senate will meet him in a fair spirit. I am satisfied that Ministers have no desire to belittle the importance of this branch of the Legislature. There may be reasons which render it impossible for the Government to proceed with business, and if so, we should be told that frankly, and we should then be in a better position to record our votes upon the motion which is under consideration. </para>

          <para>. - One would think from some of the speeches which have been delivered this morning that at no time was it contemplated that the Senate should be adjourned. To my mind that is a much overdrawn picture. We have only thirty-six members in this Chamber as against seventy-five in another place, and is it to be seriously contended that we ought to sit here day after day merely for the purpose of filling in time, and of making the people believe that we are doing some work? The practice which we have hitherto followed is to meet for the purpose of transacting business while there is business to be done. But at the present time we know that there is no business to be transacted. The incident that we have had an eight months&#39; recess has been stressed unduly by some honorable members. In referring to that circumstance they forgot to mention that last year we passed through six or seven of the most strenuous months in the history of this Parliament. We sat upon four clays a week, and for about twelve hours each day. I daresay that those months were the most strenuous in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament, and at the close of the session we were entitled to a long recess in order to recuperate. To me it does not matter whether we adjourn now or at a later period. But if we have not work with which to proceed, it is idle to remain here to indulge in loquacity. I intend to support the motion, but I regret that the representatives from distant States are not to be afforded an opportunity of returning to their homes during the proposed adjournment. That adjournment will only extend over eighteen days, and if I am lucky enough to catch a steamer immediately, twelve days will be occupied in journeying to and from the State which I represent. I would suggest to the VicePresident of the Executive Council the wisdom of amending the motion so as to permit &#39;of an adjournment for three weeks. I recognise that honorable senators from Queensland occupy a similar position to my own. </para>

            <para>- We are living in a state of isolation all the time, and it is unfair to the representatives of Western Australia to adjourn only for a fortnight, and to make us hang round Melbourne killing time. The Senate cannot continue to sit merely for the purpose of keeping time with the other Chamber. It is a physical impossibility to do so, and no sane person would ever dream of such a thing. Seeing that the Senate is only half as strong numerically as the other branch of the Legislature, the suggestion that we should do so is a reflection upon our intelligence. It may be said that this adjournment is proposed too early in the session, but it is not more than a week or two earlier than the usual time for proposing such an adjournment. We have no work to do now, and is it not as well that we should adjourn, so that when we come back we may have a lengthy programme of business before us which will occupy our attention till the close of the session ? If the period of the proposed adjournment is not extended, honorable senators from the Western State will be prevented from going to their homes, while we know that representatives of this and the neighbouring States can reach their homes within twenty-four hours. The Government might consider whether it would not be desirable to postpone the motion for another week, and then propose an adjournment over a more lengthy period. </para>

The condition of the business-paper discloses the reason which has induced the Government to bring forward this motion. They are not prepared to submit business for transaction in this Chamber at the present time. In the circumstances, what is the sensible thing for us to do? Should we come here next Wednesday and adjourn immediately, after spending a more or less fruitless half- hour in questioning Ministers? Is that a purpose for which we should be called together ? I regret, as every other honorable senator must do, that Ministers have not seen fit to apportion the work of the session more evenly between the two Houses. </para>

            <para>- I am not prepared to bite my nose off to spite my face. I do not propose to penalize myself and my fellow senators by compelling them to come here for nothing. Our trouble arises, as has been pointed out by previous speakers, because it is, perhaps, not unnatural that a Minister should desire to father his own Bills. The result is that, as we have only one portfolioed Minister in the Senate, we are handicapped by the fact that many measures are introduced in another place which under the Constitution might be introduced here. That is a state of affairs which began with the Federation, and has continued until to-day. It will continue until the dominant party in the Senate takes up a firmer attitude on the matter than it has so far been disposed to do. I should be delighted if Ministers would recognise the necessity of more evenly apportioning the work of both branches of the Legislature. It would lighten our labours, and tend to a more careful consideration of legislative proposals. Under the existing system they are brought to. us in a heap towards the close of a session, when frequently under the pressure of time we are compelled to pass them with insufficient consideration. After all, we have to accept this motion, or remain here next week to mark time. What is the practical thing for sensible men to do ? There is only one answer to that question, and I therefore intend to support the motion. </para>

The reasonwhy an adjournment is necessary has been explained already by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> Our numbers are so few that we can do the work in about half thetime occupied by another place. I . remind honorable senators of the rapid way in which yesterday we got through so many of the remaining clauses of the NavigationBill, which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> it has taken us seven years to consider. That will show the expedition that can be exercised by members of the Senate. I do not know whether that was due to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was not present, but the honorable senator has expressed his intention to obstruct the measure in the future. That expression from the honorable senator was, I think, hardly fair.

            <para>- I will withdraw any insinuation that the honorable senator would be guilty of obstruction. I am sure, from my knowledge of him in the past, that he would never attempt to do anything of the kind. If honorable senators will look at the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, they will find that the most important measures mentioned there could not, under the Constitution, be introduced in the Senate. The most important is that for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank. Honorable senators could not expect that that measure would be introduced here. The next is the proposed Bill to authorize the construction of the transcontinental railway to Western Australia. That could not be introduced here. The Electoral Bill might be introduced in the Senate, but, as honorable senators are aware, members of both Houses desire some time to consult the Home Affairs Department with respect to the provisions of that measure. It is not quite ready yet, but as soon as it is it will be introduced. </para>

            <para>- I hope so. With my colleagues in the Senate, I shall do all I possibly can to get it introduced here. It has been said that the adjournment proposed is too short, and that if we are to have any adjournment it should be of sufficient length to enable members of the Senate to go to the most distant parts of Australia. I hope it will be recollected that at the beginning of the month we made provision for only one month&#39;s Supply. </para>

            <para>- It will be the 4th October before the Bill reaches the Senate, and after that the honorable senator will have as much time as he pleases to discuss it. Of what use is it for honorable senators to be continually discussing the items of temporary Supply Bills, when they know that after the Budget Papers are laid on the table they will have an ample opportunity to discuss everything connected with the finances of the Commonwealth?  I  agree entirely with the Leader of the Opposition that it is not our duty merely to make play. We know we have done our work expeditiously. We have passed the AddressinReply, whilst the debate on the motion for its adoption is still being continued in another place. No matter how the business of Parliament is distributed between the two Houses, with seventy-five loquacious individuals in another place,  if  we sit as long as it does we must often  be  wasting time to no purpose. Honorable senators should recollect that while either House continues to sit, the expense is continuous, and if we adjourn there will be something saved. </para>

            <para>-Yes, we can save something on paper, ink, electric light, and other things. If honorable senators will view calmly, and without prejudice, the programme set before them for this session, they will see that this is the proper time for a reasonable adjournment. We should do our marking of time now, and some marking of time will always be necessary while we have the same work to do as another place, where there is double our numbers. I hope that this motion will be carried, and that honorable senators will come back on the 4th October prepared to pass the Bills which will be laid before the Senate. I anticipate that, even if no measures come up from another place, such Bills as can be introduced here will be at hand, and that we shall be fully supplied with work. </para>

            <para>- Quite so ; I am coming to that point. I am not particularly concerned about what is said of me personally, but I am concerned about any reflection that is cast upon those who have had the honour to be elected to the Senate. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger classifies me as a schoolboy, but I will venture to tell him that, while his knowledge of Australia is possibly confined to the curb-stones of Queen-street, Brisbane, I crossed his State long before he had been outside that city. </para>

            <para>- I think there are ample grounds for my action. If we are to tolerate an honorable senator going about casting reflections upon the Senate, we cannot very well complain at the action of those outside who may follow in the same path and do the same sort of thing. If we are not jealous of the honour and importance of the Senate - we who are members of it - it is little to be wondered at if other persons are not particular about our honour. When we find one of our members - one of the thirty-six who have been sent here to represent the people - casting a serious reflection upon the Chamber, I say that there is distinct warrant for entering a protest, and taking some specific action which will be a warning to any person who may be inclined to do likewise in the future. What has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger done? He has gone out of his way to libel as &#34; schoolboys &#34; senators who have been sent here by the deliberate choice of the people of Australia. At the same time he has labelled himself as one of &#34; the ripest intellects in the country,&#34; whereas, as a matter of fact, he has been the standing joke of the Senate since he has been a member of it. He is one of those political accidents who occasionally find their way into Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I withdraw those words j but I hope I may be permitted &#39;to bear testimony to the fact that, time after time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has provided humour for. and evoked merriment in, trie Senate by the way he has spoken. While withdrawing the words, I indicate what must be the inmost feelings even of those on the &#39;honorable senator&#39;s own side. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has taken it upon himself to hold this Chamber up to public ridicule or odium, I think that we should be lacking in our duty if we did not take the opportunity of put. ting him in his place and repudiating everything that he said yesterday. I do not want to refer to the way in which he got here, nor to the various means by which he tried to get here. He marched under every political banner which has ever been unfurled in this island continent, in order to get here and elsewhere. When he cast a reflection on a majority of the members of the Senate, he in turn cast a reflection on the matured opinions of every man and woman who voted on the 13th April last. </para>

            <para>- I would not cast any imputation on the Leader of the Opposition were it not that I was endeavouring to follow the lead of the bright intellect which has come amongst us. He told an audience - he did not happen to be amongst his petticoat friends on that occasion - that we have here &#34; a collection of schoolboys or youths who should be at school.&#34; I was simply following the example of - this unapproachable intellect which has arrived amongst us - and the radiance of his smile is, of course, enough to make us wither within ourselves at our own insignificance - in  tracing  how he got here, just as he was equally entitled to trace how we got here. However, we will let that phase of the question pass. All I am concerned about now is the entering of an emphatic protest against the action of the honorable senator in referring to the Senate as he did. </para>

I hope that every honorable senator will recognise the necessity of dealing with this glaring instance of breach of privilege. If they do, it will serve as a warning to those who may in future be tempted to foul their own nest in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has done. </para>

            <para>- That may be so. I think that honorable senators ought to show some respect, and I think that they would if they had a correct conception of the position which they occupy, in referring to a youthful man. If a man looks youthful it does not necessarily follow that he is of rusty intellect. I have seen trees which had grown for years without bearing fruit at all. They were as barren of fruit as a stone is of hair. The same thing may apply in human nature. It is quite possible that a youthful man, or a man in middle age, may be considerably riper in intellect than even the honorable senator. </para>

Therefore the younger men in the Senate today are, in my opinion, a very great commendation of the intellect of the people of Australia,, and their credit and ability to choose representatives not because they have grown old and ripe, as. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger remarked. </para>

Personally, I feel that the best way to give an emphatic contradiction to the statements alleged to have been made by an honorable senator is to entirely disregard them. I think we can rely upon the good sense of the people of Australia to form a fairly accurate opinion of this Senate. They will not accept as their view either the opinion of a member of the Government or that of a member of the Opposition. They will judge us by our acts, and it seems to me that, by taking any cognizance of them, we are giving too great prominence to the remarks to which our attention has been directed. </para>

Does the Senate take up the position that it is beyond criticism? To me it is perfectly plain that, as members of this Chamber, we shall not improve our position if we show ourselves restive under the criticism of anybody.

At the same time, I think that when attacks of this character are made upon us, if we do not repel them, we cannot expect anybody else to repel them for us. I only moved the motion because I felt that the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger were liable to be interpreted in distant parts of the Commonwealth as those of one who is in a position to form an impartial judgment. It was with a view to correct any such erroneous impression that I submitted the motion. I am quite aware that some attacks of this kind may be best met with contemptuous silence; but there is another way in which they may be treated, namely, by setting the public mind right by taking stern action here. 1 withdraw the motion- </para>

          <para>. - I would suggest to the Minister of Defence that in this clause we ought to make it clear that these very wide powers are to be exercised only as required by the Act. I admit that the powers enumerated are necessary ; but we have to recollect that they are exceedingly wide powers, which the Minister ought to exercise only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act. Consequently, I suggest that we ought to insert in the clause some words to make it clear that these great powers are given only for a specific purpose. Under clause 408, it is provided that any person authorized by the Minister may search any vessel in any port whenever he believes the search to be necessary &#34; for the clue performance of his duty under this Act.&#34; Why should not the same restriction be placed on the Minister in this clause? That is all I am suggesting. </para>

          <para>. - It is advisable that we should not tie ourselves down in the administration of the law without very good reason. Is there any danger that the Minister will interfere with the rights and liberties of any person? I do not think there is. The officers will only take action under this clause on the order of the Minister. I can give the honorable senator a case which occurred only a few years ago, in which, for a certain purpose which I can only mention confidentially, it was necessary to enter a certain ship. </para>

The persons who wished to go on board the ship had no right to do so, and it was found necessary to get officers of the Customs Department to go on to the ship. Entrance to the ship was necessary in this case, not for Customs purposes, but for quite another purpose. Why should we tie the Minister up? </para>

The honorable senator has said that the Navigation Department does not desire to be tied up in any way. I think that is quite probable. I have never known a Department or an official that desired to be tied up. They all prefer to be autocratic. </para>

            <para>- It is for Parliament to decide who shall be given the power to administer an oath. It should not be left to the Navigation Department. Under this clause the Minister could summon any one he met in the street to attend at his office, and there administer an oath to him on  a  subject that had nothing whatever to do with the <inline font-style="italic">navigation</inline> laws.  I  do not think the Minister can show that there is any necessity for such a power as that. As a matter of fact,  I  think the omission of the words &#34; for the due performance of his  duty under this Act &#34; from this clause is a mere drafting omission, because they are to be found in the immediately preceding clause and in other clauses. </para>

Here we are giving the Minister the right to inspect any premises, and administer an oath to any person in connexion with a matter which has nothing whatever to do with navigation. I believe in giving the Minister the fullest possible powers to carry out the provisions of a measure of this kind, but we should not give him power to enter premises or summon persons before him and administer oaths on matters which have nothing to do with navigation. </para>

            <para>- One almost despairs of discussing things in this Chamber when the most serious statements are turned aside as a joke. I am submitting, in all seriousness, what I regard as a serious proposition. Under this clause, the Minister - and this may mean the officials of the Navigation Department - may hale up any private citizen and administer an oath to him on some matter that is not set out in the Bill. I am prepared to give the Minister every power necessary to carry out the provisions of the Navigation Bill, but I decline to give him a blank cheque. For all I know, the Minister, in calling up some one to administer an oath to him under this clause, might wish to find out something about land settlement, about sanitation - which ought to be dealt with by the health authorities - or his personal relations with any member of the community. Surely honorable senators will not contend that such a power as that is desirable. </para>

            <para>- I do not; but when we find a similar provision in that Act we may rest assured that there are good reasons for it. As a member of the Navigation Commission, I may say that I never heard this clause challenged by any of the witnesses who came before the Commission. There might be some objection to the clause if it were proposed to give this power to a mere petty officer of the Navigation Department, but it is a very different thing to intrust it to the Minister. He must be given very wide powers, because we never know when a new case may crop up. </para>

          <para>. - The powers proposed under this clause are very drastic, and the reasons why it should be carefully considered have been  well stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> However, apart from Hie navigation law, it is necessary that the Minister should have drastic powers. I direct attention to the fact that during the Civil War in America, a vessel called at Port Phillip. The authorities had some information concerning that vessel, but it got outside Port. Phillip again after some partial fitting here, and afterwards took part in the Civil War, and led to the British Government being cast in damages under the Alabama Claims. One of the powers here proposed is to call upon persons to produce documents, and if that power could have been exercised in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Shenandoah,</inline> the vessel that called in here, it would have been possible to discover where that vessel was going. I suggest that as a possible reason why in the Merchant Shipping Act such a provision occurs, and why it may be necessary for us to take drastic powers, so that all ships shall be subject to the Minister in this respect. An emergency such as I have indicated might occur again, and the Commonwealth might have to pay damages. That may be why the Minister seeks to have these powers. If so, there is some justification for them, because, notwithstanding the Declaration of London, we have to be careful that, in case of war, or preparations for war, vessels shall not use our ports to the detriment of allies or neutrals. </para>

Sub-clause _ 2 gives power to the Minister to compel shipowners to disclose to him their aggregate earnings on account of all ships registered in Australia.

            <para>- Consequently the clause would not apply to 95 per cent, of the shipping engaged in our trade. Yet it is proposed to require shipowners whose vessels are registered in Australia to disclose their earnings. To that extent we are giving a certain privilege to foreign ship-owners.

          <para>. - ,It is quite correct that a clause somewhat similar to this was contained in the Merchant Shipping Bill as introduced to the House of Commons.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Under this clause, the only obligation is to give a return showing the gross earnings. The House of Commons Bill provided for a disclosure of profits, because the shipowner had to give a return of expenses. Here the ship-owner is not called upon to give a return of expenses, but only of gross earnings. I have no doubt that it was the provision as to disclosure of profits which led to the rejection of the clause in the Merchant Shipping Bill. For statistical purposes, and for keeping a proper check on navigation, these returns will be of very great value. At the same time, the giving of the information cannot be said to injure the ship-owners, because no disclosure of profits is entailed. </para>

            <para>- Speaking from memory, I do not recall an instance. It will he observed that care is taken that the information given is not to go to any one but the Minister, who, by watching the fluctuations of gross earnings, will be able to know how the navigation law is working. He will, for instance, be able to judge of the effect of the coastal clauses, and as to whether they lead to an increase of gross earnings or otherwise. Seeing that the clause does not involve a disclosure of profits, and is not, therefore, on all fours with the clause rejected by the House of Commons ; that it safeguards the disclosure of the information, and also that it is restricted to ships registered in Australia, I trust that the Committee will adhere to it. </para>

          <para>. - I have no doubt that it would be very useful to obtain from any industry such information as might be necessary to guide Parliament in shaping- laws for the conduct of that industry. But it is somewhat anomalous that we should single out a particular industry, and call upon owners of vessels registered in Australia to make returns, whilst we do not similarly call upon the proprietors of other industries. Provided that we made a similar demand upon others, I should be in favour of the proposal. I do not know whether it would be harassing for ship-owners to give the information required; but, if so, the effect would probably be to cause them to transfer their registration from Australia to New Zealand. </para>

            <para>- I know that manufacturers are very sensitive about disclosing information concerning their business. Whether that sensitiveness arises from a genuine or an imaginary fear of injury is beside the point. That they are fearful is obvious. The Minister has already pointed out that there is no difficulty in transferring from the Australian to the New Zealand register. The mere fact of being on the Australian register confers no privilege ; whilst this clause imposes upon owners whose vessels are on the Australian register an obligation which will not apply to vessels on the New Zealand register. I am sure that is not the desire of the Minister or of the Department. The desire must be to encourage local registration. I submit for consideration whether it is not desirable to wait until we are dealing with an amendment of the Census and Statistics Act before calling upon ship-owners to disclose the information specified. </para>

          <para>. - &#93; ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> whether it is not desirable in this clause to fix the numerical strength of the Marine Council, because otherwise there might come a time when, possibly under political pressure, the Minister might be asked to make further appointments, or to limit the number of members. I think it is desirable to prescribe the number in the clause itself, but if it should be passed in its present form the Minister could, if he liked, appoint 500 representatives. That, I think, is hardly intended or desired. </para>

          <para>. - I quite recognise and appreciate the difficulty which the Minister has stated. But my object was not to secure absolute parliamentary control of the constitution of the Council, but to prevent, possibly at a very critical time, the exercise of any political, or commercial, or other pressure -on the Minister to interfere with, or colour its composition. If a set number were prescribed in the Act, the Minister could not alter that number no matter what pressure might be brought to bear upon him, or what influences might be at work. But I recognise my honorable friend&#39;s difficulty. I think that until the Act has been brought into operation, it will be impossible for any one to determine what the strength of the Marine Council should be, and therefore I regard the Minister&#39;s amendment as probably the best solution of the difficulty at this juncture. </para>

            <para>- Just so. Nor is there anything to prevent the appointment of any ecclesiastic to say prayers. If these particular interests were deemed to be of sufficient importance to be specifically represented, the inference to be drawn is that they, and they alone, would be represented, and that, probably, will be the case. I admit that the Minister will desire to conserve the interests of the public, but he will only be nominally able to do that.  His  very varied duties, sometimes his very arduous duties, will prevent him from doing any special work in regard to a Council of this kind. Therefore, I fail to see how the public interests will be represented. As regards the ridicule cast upon my suggestion that some persons might be in favour of having a bar on a ship, and others might not, that one person might want the provision of fans, and perhaps another might want the provision of refrigerators, it must be recollected that there have been numerous instances where persons have been specially appointed to represent the public interest. </para>

There were three men appointed to the Commission, two, avowedly as departmental officers, who were acquainted with land administration or surveying, and the other to specially represent the general interests of the public. While that may not be the best instance that could be cited, it will serve my purpose. There are numerous other cases where a Government has appointed some persons to represent the interests of the general public, and has exercised a wise discretion in making a choice. </para>

If these interests are to be represented by different persons, it will be an unworkable and very costly Council. If, however, the amendment be made, the regulation providing for the composition of the Council will be tabled, and we shall be afforded the opportunity to discuss the appointments made by the Minister. I repeat that, in my opinion, too many interests have been chosen to be represented, and it should not be forgotten that they all represent sections of the general public. </para>

          <para>. - I think that the insertion of the words proposed by the Minister of Defence will meet the requirements of the case. I know how the difficulty to which reference has been made, operated in Western Australia some time ago. In that case the crew of a vessel were engaged in Adelaide by the Adelaide Steamship Company, and taken to Western Australia. Practically the whole of their work lay between Albany, Esperance, and Eucla. Its members were engaged on a regular run between those ports. They very seldom were afforded an opportunity to return to their home port, and to be paid off there. To meet such cases a clause of this kind is absolutely necessary. </para>

          <para>.- This clause does away with the necessity for a discharge being given and produced where a seaman, immediately on the expiration of one agreement, re-engages on the same ship. The clause is taken from the New South Wales Act of 1898, which followed the New South Wales&#39; Act of 1864, but has not, so far as I am aware, been adopted elsewhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> objection to it was couched in the following terms - </para>

          <para>Supposing a man has been employed, say, for two years, on four agreements of six months each. In the ordinary course, apart from this section, he might have received four good discharges. Then, perhaps, a change takes place in the command of a ship. The seaman may fall foul of the new master, and at the expiration of his next six months may determine not to seek re-engagement. The new master may give him a bad discharge, which would, under this section, be the only discharge the seaman could produce for this whole two and a half years&#39; service. Apart from this section, he would have four good discharges to set off against the one bad one. </para>

A ship is to be deemed to engage in the coastal trade if she takes on board passengers, or cargo, at any port in Australia. Certain important exemptions are, however, made, and I particularly object to the last exemption. Honorable senators will recollect that, in the Bill, in the form in which it was originally presented to the Senate, provision was made in the same direction, but in entirely different words. The change which has been effected in the wording of this clause will achieve the original object- </para>

            <para>- It will achieve the same object without any specific mention being made of that object. Now it is just as well that honorable senators should understand the position. In the Bill, as it was originally introduced, a specific exemption was made in favour of oversea steamers in the matter of carrying passengers to and from Western Australia and the eastern States. That exemption was inserted because Western Australia was isolated from the other portions of the Commonwealth, and because the coastal service was not regarded as being too satisfactory. Consequently it was recognised that residents of that State should be allowed the opportunity of travelling in the oversea vessels calling there. But I would point out that there are several other parts of Australia which are just as isolated from the remainder of the Commonwealth as is Western Australia. In this Bill we declare that Labour principles must be applied to our navigation, as well as to our other laws. We maintain that those principles are eminently fair and equitable. Consequently I hold that they should apply to every part of the Commonwealth. No portion of it should be exempted from their operation. My own opinion is that the coastal service, between here and Western Australia, is a fairly good one. The facilities offered by that service for the carriage of passengers and cargo are fairly satisfactory, although I do not attempt to defend the extortionate rates which are charged for those facilities. But the people can get no concession from the oversea vesselsinthe matter of fares and freights. Those vessels will not charge less than the coastal steamers. Now, as a matter of fact, the only two lines of steamers which will be affected by this clause are those of the Peninsular and Oriental and the Orient Companies. If we retain the last exemption in the clause we shall place the vessels belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, which carry black labour, in just as good a position as that occupied by the steamers of the Orient Company, which have to comply with our laws in the matter of the labour conditions. Our coastal vessels have to pay fair wages and provide proper conditions to those whom they employ, from the captain down to the sculleryman. </para>

            <para>- I have already admitted that. We have laid down special conditions for our own shipping, and it is not fair to do that if we allow steamers which are not subject to any such conditions to come in and take the trade from them. Under this clause the latter would be able to get the cream of the passenger traffic all round Australia. </para>

There is nothing in this Bill to prevent the Peninsular and Oriental Company from reducing its fares and freights between Australian ports below those charged by our coastal vessels. It is unjust that, a person engaged in a particular trade, should be subjected to certain conditions, whilst another person, who is employed in the same trade, should not. </para>

            <para>- Of course it is. There is only one reason for the inclusion of this exemption. That reason was frankly on the face of the Bill in the form in which it was originally introduced. But since then it- has been covered up. There are certain portions of Queensland and the Northern Territory which are far more isolated than Is the greater portion of Western Australia. It was suggested, in connexion with the original Bill, that the last exemption in this clause should apply only until the transcontinental railway was built. That circumstance is conclusive proof that it was primarily intended to benefit the residents of the southern part of Western Australia. I hold that we should not depart from the principles of equity for the purpose of benefiting anybody. If those principles are to be set aside, let us wipe this Bill out altogether. It will not be worth a straw to the seamen and others engaged in the coastal trade of Australia if we allow oversea British ships to engage in the passenger trade between Western Australia and the eastern States under this exemption from its provisions.

            <para>- First of all, as regards the competition for passengers, the area within which the provision would apply is limited, and it cannot be disputed that the mail boats passenger charges to and from Western Australia are at least  25  per cent, higher than the charges made by Australian-owned ships. The Australianowned ships therefore cannot complain of any competition in the matter. Freights do not come into the question, because no cargo is involved in the proposal. Let us look at the position of the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that there are no British ships trading there. That is so, but is it not possible that if under this provision the exemption is allowed in the case of British ships, whilst foreignowned ships are excluded from the benefit of it, it may operate as an inducement to British ships to trade with the Northern Territory ? </para>

            <para>- We are all agreed that it is desirable that the Northern Territory, in the development of which the Commonwealth is at present specially interested, should be given all the facilities of communication with which we can supply it. The shipping companies will no doubt regard this provision from a commercial point of view. No shipping company will go to the Northern Territory unless it can make a profit by doing so. We have never disguised the fact that the provisions of this Bill will increase the working cost of the shipping around Australia. If we say to ship-owners, &#34; We shall exclude you from trade with the Northern Territory or the northern ports of Queensland unless you comply with all the provisions of this Bill,&#34; they will reply that in that case it will not pay them to go there, and they will not go there. The consequence will be, not that we shall have Australianowned ships engaged in the trade with those parts of the Commonwealth, but that there will be no ships trading there at all. Steamers that are now giving ports in those parts of the Commonwealth some service, though a poor service, will pass them by. I ask honorable senators if they think that that would be desirable? The time no doubt will come when these ports will have developed, and Australianowned ships will go there. When such a lime arrives we may be sure that the Government will withdraw this exemption, and the trade will be reserved to Australianowned ships. Until such time as there is a sufficient passenger trade with those remote ports to justify Australian-owned ships in taking up the trade, we must, in order to promote their development, give the proposed exemption to ships that do not comply with our coasting trade conditions, but call at those ports for the convenience of passengers. I am as anxious as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> can be to secure the whole of the Australian coasting trade for Australianowned ships, but we should in such a matter exercise a little common sense, and endeavour to accomplish our purpose without inflicting hardship on people in isolated portions of the Commonwealth. Coming back to the position of Western Australia, I remind the Committee that, with the exception of the Northern Territory and the northern portions of Queensland, that State is in a very different position from, other States of the Commonwealth. There is railway communication between the other States with the exception of Tasmania, but that State is in very close proximity to Victoria. Undoubtedly the Australian-owned ships now trading between the other States and Western Australia are a good type of vessel, but they give Western Australia only a weekly service. In these days of rapid communication and business pressure it is desirable to afford the fullest facilities to persons travelling between Western Australia and other States for the transaction of business. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said, that the British ships can comply with all our conditions, but it will not pay them to do so in order to secure the limited amount of passenger traffic between Western Australia and the eastern States. We must face the fact that the local steam-ship companies are not complaining, nor have they any reason to do so, of the competition of these British ships for the passenger traffic. They acknowledge that the Western Australian trade is the most profitable trade around the Australian coast. They are building their steam-ships practically out of the profits derived from that trade. I am not prepared to say that the Government will grant an exemption under this clause in the case of all the places to which I have referred, but I can mention another part of the Commonwealth in respect to which a case of some sort might be made out for an application for the exemption. </para>

            <para>- A good case can be made out for the application of the provision, but a case of some sort might be  made  out for the application  of  the pro vision to the trade with Tasmania. There is a very considerable tourist traffic between the mainland and Tasmania, and during the apple season the British ships to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> referred trade between Sydney and Hobart, and a considerable portion of the tourist traffic is carried by those boats. There is at the present time no local line of steamers doing the same trip. We have not heard any complaints from local steam-ship owners that the carrying of passengers between the mainland and Tasmania in these boats constitutes a serious grievance with them, while I venture to say that it has been the means of the introduction of a large sum of money into that State which would not  Otherwise  have found its way there. By  Striking  out this provision for exemption we shall not be doing anything to benefit Australian-owned ships. We  shall not  put a penny into the pockets of their owners. We shall be merely limiting the facilities  Which  people at present enjoy. I trust that, the Committee will not accept the amendment, but will leave this discretionary power with the Governor-General in Council. I have said that if at any time it is shown that trade with remote ports has so far developed that all necessary facilities of communication can be afforded by locally-owned shipping, any Government of which I may be a member may be trusted to see that those facilities shall be availed of. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that there is any other way in which to deal with such a speech as Kas just been delivered by the Minister of Defence. I never heard a more plausible speech, and it really answers itself. Take the last statement the honorable senator made, that any Government of which he was _ a member would, whenever the trade with any port by Australian-owned ships was sufficiently developed to satisfy local needs, see that this exemption was withdrawn. Let us apply that to the State of Western Australia. Is not the trade of that State developed sufficiently, and yet that is the very State which it is intended shall be given the benefit of the proposed exemption? We have well established coastal lines now running between Fremantle and the eastern States, yet it is proposed that this exemption shall apply to the Western Australian trade. Let us examine the Minister&#39;s argument a little further. He instanced the Northern Territory, and pointed out that this provision was necessary for the development of that Territory. Am I to understand that we can only hope to develop the Northern Territory by cheap black labour, because that is the effect of the honorable senator&#39;s argument? I am sure the honorable senator cannot mean that, yet his statement simply means that in order to develop the Northern Territory it is necessary to permit certain ships which, for the purpose of my argument, will be worked with black labour, to be exempt from the conditions which are applied to Australian-owned ships. If that be a sound argument to apply to shipping, it may be applied to the construction of a railway. </para>

            <para>- The Minister said that, by giving British-owned ships the benefit of this exemption, they would be permitted to take advantage of this trade. Let me put the matter in another way. The Minister contended that this exemption would be useful to enable the Northern Territory to be developed. What does that mean ? It is proposed to give an exemption to trade to the ports of the Northern Territory, to vessels like those of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, which carry black labour. If it is necessary to give an exemption to blacklabourcarrying vessels in order that they may take the produce away from the Northern Territory, it should be equally necessary to permit black labour to produce the commodities taken by the black-labour steamers. And if it is necessary to do this, why limit the exemption to passengers ? It is far more important to the Northern Territory just now to secure means of getting produce away than to get improved passenger accommodation. </para>

            <para>- Probably that may be one of the attractions to those who support the proposals. I should like to apply to this Western Australian traffic the same argument that the Minister applied to the traffic of the Northern Territory. The Minister&#39;s argument was that if you could by law shut out foreign vessels from the Northern Territory, you would thereby encourage British vessels to go there. Apply that argument to the Western Australian traffic as it exists to-day. If you could shut out British-owned vessels from the Western Australian trade, sooner or later that trade would get into the hands of the coastal boats, and so do a great deal to bring about that weekly service which is the desire of the Minister. I am not saying whether there should not be some exemption, but if you are going to lay down a law, you should apply it all round, and not permit the Minister to pick out certain ports to meet the convenience of a certain section of the public who use a certain line. </para>

          <para>. - The last argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be appreciated by those who best understand the question at issue. When talking of the coasting trade, honorable senators must bear in mind that there are very few coastal trips in any country in the world to be compared with that between Western Australia and the eastern States. The distance by sea from Adelaide to Fremantle is 2,000 miles. Fancy that being dubbed a coastal trip ! It is really an oceanjourney. Because of the great distance which has to be travelled, and because  of  the large number of people living in Western Australia who travel to the eastern States - largely, I suppose, because so many of them have left the eastern States and settled in the West, and, consequently, have many attractions and friends over here - itis desired to make a special exemption in their interest. According to the argument that has been used here to-day, however, those people are to have their best means of reaching the eastern States cut away at one fell swoop. The length of the journey, and the roughness of the water to be traversed, form strong reasons for this exemption. Personally, I prefer to stand by the finding of the Royal Commission, which, although there was only one Western Australian upon it, recommended that there should be an exemption in favour of Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- It is just as well to give such a statement an emphatic denial. The names of the signatories to the report of the Commission are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Groom, Senator Guthrie, Mr. S.</inline> Mauger, and myself. The other members of the Commission dissented. As to the present form <inline font-style="italic">ot the</inline> clause, I may say at once that I am not in love with iti. I should prefer to see the clause as it stood in the first Bill. That would confine the exemption to a specific case, and we should know exactly how it was going to act. I believe that the recommendation that, as soon as the railway systems are connected, this exemption should cease to operate, is a wise one; and as a Bill for that purpose is about to be introduced, I do not believe that the clause, as far as Western Australia is concerned, will need to be put into operation at all. But if that railway connexion is not to be made, and we are robbed of the present travelling facilities, we shall have inflicted on the travelling public of Western Australia a serious wrong, that State being left even more isolated than it was before Federation. The people of Western Australia surely did not join the Federation to be placed at a disadvantage, and that really would be the effect of precluding them from travelling by the mail boats. I know sufficient of the Western Australian people to be confident that they would prefer to travel by the Australian vessels if other things were equal. But people who are not good sailors naturally prefer to travel in as much comfort as possible. To give honorable senators some idea of what the journey to Western Australia really is, I may mention that the last time I went over there I travelled on one of the mail boats between Adelaide and Fremantle; and, although I am a fairly good sailor, and am very seldom knocked out by bad weather, nevertheless I was not able to go on deck during the whole six days of the journey, nor was there a passenger on board who could go on deck. </para>

            <para>- It is quite common for persons to join a boat at Adelaide and not to be seen on deck again until she has passed the heads at Fremantle. That is the invariable rule with bad sailors. It must be admitted that, between bad sailors and good sailors, there is a large number of persons who, when they get an opportunity to travel in a good vessel, can make the trip with less discomfort. Not only would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> rob these persons of that advantage, but he would rob all persons of the advantage of having a second vessel in which to go to that State once a week. That is, I submit, a restriction which my honorable friends should not ask the people of any State to endure. If the people who travel from the eastern ports to Fremantle were as few in number as those who travel to the northern parts of Queensland and Western Australia, we might be justified in not considering the interests of a few. In this case, however, there is a big traffic. It will be generally admitted, I think, that the travelling public should not be treated in the way proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> I am pleased that those who have spoken against the provision have not ventured to state that there is any unfair competition. The representatives of the shipping companies, when they were examined by the Royal Commission, did not suggest that they were subject to unfair competition by the deep-sea boats, for the simple reason that the latter charge higher rates. </para>

            <para>- No; the honorable senator is mistaken. As a matter of fact, the deep-sea boats do not carry any freight between the east and the west. Consequently, to give those boats any such advantage as the honorable senator has referred to, would be to give them something which they have not asked for. That is the trade which is reserved for the Australian coastal vessels, and that, by the way, was shown by the representatives of the deep-sea boats to be much more profitable than the carriage of passengers. The rates for freight between the east and tl,r west are enormous ; in fact, as much as the rates between Australia and the Old Country. It is a profitable traffic indeed, and is reserved for the Australian coastal vessels. </para>

            <para>- I would not like to say that there is an arrangement with the companies; I do not think that there is. I understand that the steamers, when they get to Fremantle, wish to hurry eastward, and get the mails delivered at Adelaide as quickly as possible; and then before they leave the eastern States their cargo space is fixed up in such a way that they do not want to be taking in and discharging small quantities of freight between ports. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister of Defence prefaced his remarks by stating that, to me, Western Australia was something like King Charles&#39; head, and that I was always ready to oppose anything which was for the benefit of that State - in fact, that I had a &#34; down &#34; on it. It is a curious thing that if any honorable senator has the audacity to argue that the same law should apply to every part of Australia - to Western Australia, as well as to the State which he represents - he must, therefore, be accused of having a &#34; down&#34; on Western Australia. I did not ask that it should be subjected to any law to which I was not perfectly willing that the State I represent should not also be subjected. I fail to see, therefore, that the Minister had any justification for a remark of that kind. I am prepared to do the same justice to Western Australia or South Australia or Tasmania as to the State I represent, or the State in which Parliament is sitting. What do the Minister&#39;s remarks amount to, after all has been said and done? and they were emphasized by the view put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. They all come back to this original proposition, that the proviso has been inserted for the one purpose of allowing two lines of mail steamers to carry passengers between Fremantle and the eastern ports. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator was emphatic in stating that we should not deprive the people of Western Australia of the facilities which they possessed prior to Federation. Let us examine that contention for a moment. The facility which they had in this direction before Federation was to travel from Fremantle to the eastern ports, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> in two lines of mail steamers manned exclusively by coloured labour, as against travelling in the coastal boats manned by white labour. </para>

            <para>- Let us examine this proposal a little closely, to see whether my contention that the verbiage of the subclause is a mere subterfuge is not correct. We are asked to believe, especially by the Minister, that this provision is required for the Northern Territory and the northern portion of Queensland, just as much as it is required for Western Australia. I want to point out that it will not apply in the case of the Northern Territory and North Queensland, &#39;because it is a fact, which is known to honorable senators generally, that there are no British-owned vessels trading there continually and carrying passengers regularly. The only line of vessels which are unquestionably owned by a British, company are the boats of the British India Steamship Company, which travel down the coast of Queensland. These vessels are almost exclusively manned by coloured labour. Is it suggested that we should place our own shipping under a disadvantage in order to provide facilities to people to travel by ships which are manned almost exclusively by that class of labour? This question of fair and unfair competition has been very much stressed by the Minister of Defence and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. The latter stated that there was no question of unfair competition at issue. But I hold that we have no right even to allow opportunities for that unfair competition to exist. We have no guarantee that the mail steamers will not reduce their passenger fares between Australian ports below those charged by our coastal steamers. </para>

            <para>- The Minister of Defence declared emphatically that the Government had not attempted to disguise the fact from themselves that the passing of this Bill would have the effect of largely increasing the expenditure at present incurred by Australian shipping companies. I quite believe that, on account of the better wages which they will be required to pay, and the improved conditions which they will have to provide, that the cost of running their vessels will be increased. They are not engaged in the business for the benefit of their health; and in order to recoup themselves for the additional outlay they will probably have to increase their passenger fares. Have we any guarantee that the mail steamers will raise their passenger rates accordingly? If they do not, may not that circumstance in itself attract to them practically the whole of the passenger traffic between Fremantle and the eastern States? </para>

            <para>- Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie prepared to advocate a return to black labour conditions in order to get out of that combine? We all know that it is proposed to build a line of railway to Western Australia, and consequently I do not see that the residents of that State would be placed under any disadvantage if they had no alternative but to travel by our coastal boats. In the northern half of Queensland, there are just as many people as are to be found in Western Australia, and they travel to the southern portions of the Commonwealth in just as large numbers as the people of Western Australia journey to the eastern States. Every vessel travelling to the north of Queensland is filled with passengers. In the winter months, when the weather here is unpleasant, a great number of tourists visit that portion of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Probably that was because she was tied up at the wharf, and had discharged her passengers. My own experience is that at that season of the year it is almost impossible to get a berth on board the vessels travelling to Queensland. The northern portion of that State has not asked for an exemption of this kind. Tt is distinctly unfair to impose one set of conditions on our own people who are engaged in our own trade, whilst permitting outsiders, who are engaged in the same trade, to be free of all restrictions. </para>

            <para>- The Minister of Defence knows perfectly well that I was referring to the passenger trade. We ought not to impose on our own people worse conditions than we impose on everybody else. If the oversea steamers wish to engage in our coastal trade, they should be at perfect liberty to do so, provided that they conform to the general conditions which we lay down for the conduct of that trade. Unless we are prepared to adhere to that equitable . principle, we shall be open to the accusation of having penalized our own people who are engaged in our own shipping trade for the benefit of the foreigner. </para>

          <para>. - Upon this matter, I am very much in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> It seems to me that if, under this clause, we allow the Government to declare what particular British ships may be exempted, we shall be giving them a dangerous power. We all know that the vessels of Burns, Philp and Company, which are British-owned, do a very large trade with the Philippines. I understand that the Minister of Defence, in reply to a question, has stated that those ships will be eligible for exemption. </para>

          <para>. - I ask the Minister to consider what the effect of this proposed exemption will be. Clause 284 authorizes the licensing of foreign-owned vessels about to engage in the coastal trade, and the conditions of the licence provide that, amongst other things, the seamen shall be paid wages in accordance with Part VI. of the Act. I wish the Minister to say whether, in exempting these foreign-owned vessels as here proposed from the necessity of obtaining a licence, that will have the effect of exempting them also from compliance with the conditions stipulated by the licence. What will be the position of the vessel relieved from the necessity of obtaining a licence? Will it also be relieved from the obligation of conforming to the conditions of this part of the Act? </para>

          <para>. - The honorable senator has raised a legal question, and I do not, of course, give my own opinion in reply to it. I am advised that the proclamation would be a general proclamation exempting the vessel, and would not bring it under the conditions laid down for a licensed ship. My recollection of the matter is that this clause is necessary in connexion with the most favoured nation clauses in a number of existing treaties. By these treaties, the British Government undertake to give equal rights to countries that reciprocate. There are very few of these treaties now in existence that bind the Dominions, but there are some ; and at the recent Conference we brought forward the question, and secured an undertaking from the British Government that they would enter into negotiations with the countries with which such treaties still exist, and endeavour to secure for the Dominions the same rights as they have now, so that we may not be brought under their provisions unless we so desire. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHATAWAY</inline>(Queensland) f3-54&#93;- - By interjection, I asked the Minister whether he proposed to define in this Bill the words &#34;bounty, &#34; 01 &#34;subsidy.&#34; I now ask the honorable senator to take that matter into consideration, and inquire whether it would not be worth while, in order to make the Bill clear, to insert a definition of those words. I remind the Minister that in September, 1906, when the Brussels Convention was agreed to by the Powers, there was great difficulty in defining the words &#34;bounty&#34; and &#34;subsidy,&#34; and the terms were discussed by legal authorities all over the world. In the interest of the Bill itself, will the Minister have the matter looked into ? </para>

        <para class="block">That will absolutely reverse the effect of the clause as it at present stands. Of course, it will not alter the liability of the pilot up to &#163;100. This clause has been considered by a departmental Committee of the Board of Trade, and the report of the Committee has just reached the Trade and Customs Department. I shall read a few extracts from it to show the way in which they deal with the matter. At page 75 of the report, they say - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A most important effect of compulsory pilotage, and one that has the most far-reaching consequences, is that resulting from section 633 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, which enacts that an owner or master of a ship shall not be answerable to any person for any loss or damage occasioned by the fault or the incapacity of any qualified pilot when the employment of a pilot is compulsory by law. It is also provided by section 74 of the Harbors, Docks, and  Piers  Clauses Act- 1847 (IO Viet., c. 27), which is incorporated in many local Acts, that the owner of a ship which damages the harbor, docks, piers, quays, or works, shall be answerable to the &#34; undertakers &#34; for the&#39; damage done by such ship, or by any person employed about her. This section enlarges the common law liability of the shipowner, as its effect is to make him liable for the acts of a wrongdoer, whether the latter is or is not his servant, except in the one case where thewrongdoer is a compulsory pilot, for the section goes on to say &#34; provided always that nothing herein contained shall extend to impose any liability for any such damage upon the owner of any vessel, whether such vessel shall at the time when such damage is caused be in charge of n duly licensed pilot whom such owner or master is bound by law to employ and put his vessel in charge of.&#34; It is difficult to exaggerate the hardships inflicted by these sections on innocent persons whose property nas received damage from a vessel in charge of a compulsory pilot. Evidence to this effect has been given before us by ship, wharf, and barge owners, which confirms the evidence given at previous inquiries; and, in fact, the hardship and injustice inflicted by this law to persons whose property is damaged is so universally admitted as to make it. quite unnecessary to multiply evidence on this point. </para>

          <para>It has been brought to our notice that it frequently happens that when the owner of a ship or a wharf which has been damaged .by the faulty navigation of a ship is unable to recover from the owner of that ship, he seeks to recover what he can from the pilot. Our attention has been called to -cases where the pilots have in consequence been made bankrupt. </para>

          <para>If the pilot is negligent his licence can always be dealt with by his pilotage authorities, and it is, in our opinion, wrong in principle that pilots should have in addition to the responsibility of their danger a financial ruin just because the profession which they follow entails the handling of property of great value. </para>

          <para>We recommend that at all ports the pilotage authorities should have power to make by-laws requiring the pilots to give a bond, and that when such a bond is, given the liability of the pilot shall be limited to that amount, together with the amount of pilotage payable in respect of the vessel. A by-law of this nature should not be made unless it is desired by a majority of the pilots at the port. </para>
