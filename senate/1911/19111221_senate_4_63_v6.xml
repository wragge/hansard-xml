I also thank the members of the Opposition for the vigorous manner in which they have presented their case in connexion with all contentious business. They have carried out that duty manfully against great odds, and deserve to be congratulated. I hope that they go away without any ill feeling, although the battle has been waged to the very. castle gates. The supporters of the Government deserve the sincere thanks of every Minister, for they have stuck to us in all emergencies, and kept a quorum, at great self-sacrifice sometimes. I sincerely thank', on behalf of the Government, the  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees, whose arduous duties have kept them here for very long hours and at great inconvenience. I also sincerely thank, on behalf of the Government, the officers and the attendants. No doubt they have felt the strain which has been put upon all concerned with this Chamber during the last two or three week?. At all times and in all circumstances both the officers and the attendants have done their duty faithfully and well.

                            <para>- I am sure that every honorable senator will agree with me that although for the last week or two both Houses of this Parliament have been sitting for long hours, those gentlemen have stuck well to their work. Honorable senators will find that the reports of their speeches are as good now as when those gentlemen had more time at their disposal. With a parliamentary experience covering nearly eighteen years, I can say that in no Parliament of which I am aware have the utterances of its members been so faithfully recorded, and sometimes when the staff were labouring under very serious difficulties, as they have been in this Parliament. Therefore, the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff deserve the thanks of the Government, and I am sure that honorable senators will join with me in thanking them for the able manner in which they have carried out their duties. </para>

                        <para>. - I indorse the remarks addressed through you, sir, to honorable senators present by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I desire to acknowledge, on behalf of honorable senators sitting 011 this side of the Chamber, the unfailing courtesy and impartiality with which you have invariably exercised your authority under circumstances which, I may be permitted to say, perhaps occasionally, with a less happy temperament in the chair, might have created  irritation I specially desire to acknowledge the unfailing response which the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff have given to the very trying demands we have made on their resources and their strength, and also to bear testimony to the assistance . which we upon this side of the Chamber have received from the officers of the Senate. Passing from that, and striking a note more personal to honorable senators, I very cordially reciprocate the kindly remarks which have been made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. We do, I trust, strive as much as we can to give expression to the views we are here to represent, and it is one of the happy features of this Chamber that though occasionally an impulsive word may be uttered, I have never known a session to close without feeling that when the battle is over we may part as good friends. I am inclined to think that we are the better friends because of our conflicts. After passing over the little incidents which will ruffle the sweetest temperament we seem to come together with a better appreciation of each other's qualities and of each other's duties. I am inclined to think that there was a period prior to the termination of last session when there were signs of a little heat and friction, the re-echo of the previous general election. It is a very gratifying feature that this session has marked their disappearance. I cannot recall any session in which the work has been so strenuous, the demands upon the time and patience of honorable senators so severe, and the proceedings marked by so little personal conflict, as has this session. I desire to conclude by wishing the Vice-President 'of the Executive Council and honorable senators the very best wishes for the coming new year. </para>

When we have returned to the legislative arena like giants refreshed, it is a disappointment to learn that the Government have declined to allow us a little time to discuss private business of an urgent character. I fear that I shall not be here next Wednesday, and that there will not be a quorum present on that day. We are all here, the day is young, and yet our desire to work is frustrated at this early period of a short session. Whilst re-echoing the kindly feelings which have been expressed, I repeat that I am deeply disappointed. </para>

I was hopeful that before the session closed I would be afforded an opportunity to deal with a certain measure which I had placed upon the business-paper. But" I am sorry that I shall have to again place it upon the business-paper next session. </para>

I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank honorable senators for the good-tempered way  ins  which they have at all times - and occasionally there have been stormy periods - assisted the occupant of the chair to maintain that order and decorum which have been a feature of the Senate from the very inception of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to thank honorable senators for the consideration and ' courtesy which they have uniformly extended to the Chair. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> hasobserved, it is sometimes difficult for honorable senators to realize that decisions- arrived at by the Chair are altogether impartial. But I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition and the Vice-President of the Executive Council have stated that they are able to bear testimony to the fact that whilst a little friction may occasionally arise, anything which is done by the Chair is done in an absolutely impartial way, and without taking cognizance of that friction. I also desire to thank the officers of the Senate, who have had to undergo a very strenuous ordeal. So far as the  Clerk  is concerned, the work has been particularly hard upon him, because he is not enjoying' the best of health. But I am glad to say that he has been able to stick to his post throughout the whole of the long and arduous sittings which we have undergone. I desire to thank both him and the  Clerk  Assistant for the help which they have rendered to the Chair, and to say that without that help the record of the session might have been somewhat different from what it is. I' wish, further, to thank the attendants of the Chamber, who, notwithstanding that they have had to work long hours, have never exhibited the slightest unwillingness to do anything which they were called upon to do. </para>
