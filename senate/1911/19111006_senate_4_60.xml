              <para>- I have given the official reason for the exercise of compulsion, and I will now put forward my own reasons for the change. In my opinionthe right to vote is a duty as well as a privilege. Too often it is looked upon merely as a privilege, because people throughout the world have had to fight for it - in some instances under distressing conditions - for many years, and because it has at last been granted as a concession <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> popular clamour, or has been the result  of pressure brought to bear upon the Governments of the day. But I venture to say that in a country like Australia, where we recognise that every man and woman should have the right to vote, that right becomes more than a privilege - it becomes a duty. Hence we declare that the law should compel every citizen to discharge his duty in this connexion. In doing so we are by no means breaking new ground. There are many persons who still believe that it is a mistake to educate the masses, and who declare that the acquisition of knowledge beyond the three &#34; R&#39;s &#34; has the effect of making them dissatisfied with their position in life. We have all heard the argument that educated persons become discontented with their lot. </para>

              <para>- If a shearer has been engaged in shearing greasy sheep he certainly will require one. The community long ago decided that education is not merely a privilege, but a duty - that it is in the interests of the State itself that its people should be educated - and consequently parents are compelled to send their children to school for a certain number of years. The same remark is. applicable to the much more debatable question of vaccination. There are many individuals who refuse to have their children vaccinated because they do not believe in it. But in most of the States the law is that they must have them vaccinated. Again, in regard to the question of defence, we have affirmed within the last two years that it is the duty of our citizens to defend the country. There are many who urge that it is not, who declare that the principle of military training outrages their conscientious opinions and religious beliefs, but nevertheless we compel them to undergo military training. Therefore, when we come to regard the duty of electing repre sentatives to our Legislatures - a duty which affects the very foundation of our national life- </para>

              <para>- I am sure that if there are any illogical points in my speech they will not be overlooked by the Leader of the Opposition. It seems to me that the duty of voting carries with it an obligation on the part of every elector to enrol himself. Passing away from that phase of the question, a distinct advantage will be conferred by the method which is laid down in the Bill, because we shall, by coupling the system of absent voting, under which electors will have to sign their names for the purposes of identification, with thf card system, obtain the signature of every elector throughout the Commonwealth. Thus we shall have a ready means of defeating all attempts at impersonation. Another advantage of these proposals is that they will apply to voters who move from one electoral division to another, and who fail to obtain electoral transfers. The Bill will stop the immense leakage from the rolls which exists in this connexion, by overcoming the failure of  20  per cent, of the electors who move from one electoral division to another to secure transfers. It will, therefore, assist the Electoral Office to maintain a thoroughly up-to-date and pure roll. When an elector moves from one division to another, although he will be disqualified from voting in his old division, he will not be disqualified as an elector for the Senate. </para>

              <para>- We will do so if it be necessary. I wish now to deal with the filing of a return of the expenses incurred by political organizations. First of all, we have to recollect that, under our Electoral Act, we compel all candidates for Parliament to make a return of their election expenses. What is the object of that compulsion? Simply to insure that each candidate has complied with the conditions imposed by the law, with a view to preventing corruption, bribery, and fraudulent practices for the purpose of securing his return. But we know that to-day the candidate plays a very small part in the conduct of an election. Under our party system, especially on account of the extent to which it has grown in Australia, party organizations have become more and more the factors which conduct and finance elections. Consequently, a candidate can furnish a return of his election expenses which is absolutely <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> and which shows that he has complied with the law in every respect, notwithstanding that in his election corruption, bribery, and fraudulent practices may have l-een ram pant. That must be patent to everybody. Therefore, in this Bill the Government say that if the candidate should be obliged to furnish a return of the expenses incurred by him, so also should every organization which takes part in an election, and thus the people will know exactly how an election has been conducted. It seems to me that this proposal is merely the complement of the section in the existing Act which requires each candidate to furnish a return of his election expenses. In the absence of such a provision, the section of the Act to which I refer must be a dead letter. </para>

They will under this provision be informed, for instance, that what purports to be a report of facts is really a political opinion that has been paid for. We say that people should have an opportunity of knowing that many of the statements published in the press in connexion with elections are not reports of facts or circumstances, but opinions paid for with the deliberate object of influencing the election. </para>

              <para>-  Will this cover a misreport of a speech by a candidate paid for by an opponent?  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE.-</inline> I think I shall have to ask for notice of some of these questions. I need not labour the matter, because it is obvious that organizations and the authorities of newspapers should be called upon to disclose what they have been paid to do in connexion with an election. I give honorable senators notice that it is intended, when we get into Committee, to negative clause 34. The clause was inserted in the Bill to strengthen the provision governing the use of vehicles at elections, but, on reconsideration, we have decided to stand by the Act at present in force. </para>

              <para>- In order that public attention may be directed to the matter. I think this is a perfectly fair proposal. I do not see why the press should be utilized to enable people to put forward party statements under the guise of the statement of the publicist or the opinion of the press. We all know that considerable importance attaches to statements appearing in the press, especially if they are not plainly associated with the work of candidates or political parties at an election. We all have absolute knowledge that many statements published under the guise of expressions of public opinion are really advertisements inserted by political parties. We say that the people should be informed of the real nature of these statements, and&#39; should know that they are merely advertisements inserted by political parties or candidates with the object of influencing an election, . and that they are published in this insidious way in order to mislead. When people can see for themselves that these statements are merely advertisements, they will be informed of the source from&#39; which they come, and will be able to estimate their value. By clause. 35 also we propose the insertion in the Act of a new section 181c to the following effect : - </para>

          <para class="block">If a candidate makes use of the services of a canvasser the expense incurred must come within the expenditure set out in the section I have quoted. This, I think, is a necessary complement to the prohibition we have provided in the principal Act against bribery and corruption. I have now dealt with the principal clauses of the Bill, and shall skim through some of the less important clauses. Clause  5  provides for the appointment of a divisional returning officer or assistant returning officer in case of emergency. It has happened that at a time very close to the date of an election a divisional returning officer has been taken suddenly ill or has died. Under the existing law a fresh appointment can be made only by the Governor-General by an Order in Council. What has had to be done in such cases has been to permit the Electoral Officer for the State to make an appointment, which was afterwards validated by an Order in Council. This clause makes provision for such appointments by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer. Clause 6 is intended to simplify the process of reconsidering the adjustment of electoral boundaries. Under the existing law, commissioners have to prepare a map, which has to be exhibited, and a certain time must elapse within which the proposals made may be objected to. They have then to come before Parliament, and if Parliament should disagree to any of them the whole process has to be gone over again. </para>

              <para>- Yes, to simplify the process and secure the readjustment of boundaries within a reasonable time. Clause  9  provides facilities to prevent names being on more than one roll. Power is given to the Chief Electoral Officer in each State to rectify these anomalies. Clause  10  gives power to returning officers or registrars to add to a roll the names of persons he is satisfied are entitled to be enrolled. If honorable senators will look at sub-section  2  of section  62  of the principal Act, they will see that it is clearly intended that that should be done, but under the law as it stands the power is not actually given to the Chief Electoral Officer to rectify obvious errors in the rollsThis clause will make it clear that in future that can be done. Clause  12  extends the time for the return of a writ from sixty to ninety days. This is necessary to amend an obviously unworkable provision of the present Act. There has never been a general election since the inauguration of the Commonwealth when the writs have been returned within sixty days. It will not follow on the adoption of this clause that in all cases the full ninety days will be taken. In the case of a by-election, where it is practicable to return a writ in thirty days, that will be done. But the clause will give power to the Electoral Officer to fix ninety days for the return of writs. Clause  13  provides for a merely administrative alteration in the nomination form which has been found necessary in practice. Clause  11  fixes Saturday as the day for polling. </para>

              <para>- I understand that the Hebrew Sabbath lasts until 6 o&#39;clock on Saturday evening. The hours for polling will be extended until 8 o&#39;clock, so that adherents of the Hebrew religion will be able to vote. The reason for choosing Saturday for polling day is that in the great majority of cases it is the most convenient day. In the country districts the farming class usually make their visits to the town on Saturdays. In many towns market day is Saturday, and Saturday afternoon is also usually a holiday for the working class. </para>

              <para>- I quite admit that that is rather a painful proposition for the candidates. But on the other hand, it may sometimes be a blessing, because candidates will not know the evil&#34; fate that awaits them. Many of the questions arising under the Bill are rather suitable for discussion in Committee. We believe that though some of the proposals may be revolutionary as compared with what has been the practice in the past, they are nevertheless the result of the observation of certain abuses which have gradually been growing. These amendments are intended to remove those abuses. It is believed that they will secure to the people a better means of registering their opinion, and of coming to a decision on fair grounds. We also believe that the amendments will give every political party and every candidate a chance of having a fair straight-out fight, and of laying his views before the people. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WALKER</inline>(New South Wales). (11.19&#93;. - As a member of the Library Committee, I have much pleasure in supporting the second reading of this Bill. It requires only to be glanced through for the object of it to be understood. The members of the Library Committee believe it to be important that the measure should be passed as soon as possible, because if any-&#39; thing happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick,</inline> and the measure were not on the statute-book, his collection might go to his heirs. We wish to secure it for the Commonwealth for all time, in accordance with an agreement entered into, under which we have given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> a life engagement. He desires to be called the &#34; Archivist,&#34; It is a matter which rests with the Library Committee as to what the title &#34; Archivist &#34; means. Practically, in this case, it means that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> will look  after  the archives in connexion with his collection. The subject being of considerable interest,  I  have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. </para>

          <para>. - When this Bill was before the Senate last session, I moved the second reading, and the debate was adjourned on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> It was quite within the province of any other honorable senator to resume the debate this morning. If I had risen to make an explanation, the  President  would have taken my speech as a reply upon the whole debate, which would thus have been closed. As there seems to be no inclination to prolong the discussion, I may explain that the Bill is of considerable importance to the Commonwealth Library. The members of the Library Committee have long since recognised the value of the Petherick Collection, and have no desire that by any circumstance they should lose this accession to the knowledge which is at the disposal of the members of this Parliament at all times. Consequently, it is thought desirable that expedition should be exercised, and that we should give effect to the agreement arrived at which can only be ratified by the passage of this short measure. Last session some doubt seemed to exist in the minds of some honorable senators as to the wisdom of ratifying the agreement, but, from what I can learn from members of the Library Committee, and from both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  President  of the Senate, it appears clear that all difficulties have been removed, and that the Committee are unanimously of opinion that the best thing we can do is to ratify the agreement, which is attached to the Bill. The ratification is included in three clauses. When they are passed into law, the agreement entered into in 1909 between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> and the Commonwealth Parliament will take effect, and all danger of losing this valuable collertion will have been avoided. We shall be in continuous possession of it. </para>

        <para>That this Bill be now read a second time.  This is a comparatively unimportant measure, though we believe it to be a very necessary one. The object of it is to prohibit traffic in naval and military decorations. These decorations are given to the members of the Defence Forces for services rendered. As long as the bestowal of these decorations is continued as a military and naval custom, we think that precautions should be taken that they are not used for the purpose of obtaining money or in any such way. This Bill penalizes both the seller and the buyer ; but I have circulated an amendment, which I shall move in Committee, by which the Minister may grant permits to public institutions, or <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> collectors to acquire and retain decorations, and, further, that the Act shall not prevent the disposition by will of any decoration. I think it is desirable that we should keep up the value of these things. </para>

          <para>. - I do not see any reason why a man who has served his country well and earned a medal, and who, possibly owing to the disregard paid to his claims, has fallen upon evil days, should have another injustice heaped upon him, namely, that he should not be allowed to dispose of his medal when and where he liked in order to buy bread for himself. If the Minister of Defence had presented to him by this country a medal, which is well deserved, if only for the action which he has taken in military matters, and if, owing to unforeseen circumstances, which we hope will not occur, he were reduced to such a position that the disposal of the medal would relieve him from pressure, why should he not be able to do what he liked with the medal ? Many persons have received medal!* because of the services which they have rendered to their country, but owing to the disregard of those services afterwards bv the country they have been reduced to the unfortunate position of having to dispose of the medals. Why should they not be allowed to sell them in the best possible market ? </para>

            <para>- Why should not a man be tree to pawn his medal ? Pawnbroking is a legitimate business in this country, from the banks downwards. Therefore, why should we interfere with one small class in the community? Why should the time of the Senate be taken up in considering a measure of this kind? I suppose it is because it jars upon the sensitive feelings of some persons to see in a window a string of medals which have been won in wars. One thing which they suggest to my mind is the unfortunate fact that the Governments which availed themselves of the services of the winners of the medals allowed them to drift into such a position that they were obliged, perhaps, to pawn them to get food. </para>

          <para>-35j: - I think that the set of conditions referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is one which we need not bother about very much in Australia. Whilst there may have been veterans &#34;who have been brought to sore straits and have parted with their medals to pawnbrokers for small sums, I think that such a position is not likely to arise in Australia. When any member of our Defence Force who has earned a medal is no longer able to make a living, he will be provided with an old-age pension. </para>

            <para>- No, I formed these ideas twenty years ago. I am just as conservative as is my honorable friend. I have not altered my opinions on these matters very much. We should not, under existing conditions, go out of our way to pass a law imposing penalties unless some considerable demand for it has been shown by an evil having grown up. Do we find any great evil arising from the want of a law of this kind? If a law is needed at all, I would have only one clause of this measure, and that is clause 5, providing that a person shall not, unless lawfully entitled so to do, wear or make use of a decoration belonging to another person. I think that all our laws should be aimed at penalizing dishonesty and fraud. Undoubtedly if a person tries to secure an advantage to himself by wearing a decoration which he has not earned, it is fair to punish him. But it appears to me that to attempt in any other way to limit the right of an individual who has gained a decoration to do with it as he pleases, is just stepping out of our way, for the sake of finding ourselves a job, to manufacture a law, and thereby create a new phase of criminality which certainly does not exist to any extent at present. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has talked of the pawning or disposal of these decorations by persons, in order to buy bread or other necessaries of life. We know that that has frequently happened in regard to decorations bestowed by the British Government on military or naval heroes. It is a common thing to hear or read of men who have gained the Victoria Cross dying in a workhouse in England. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said, or I understood him to say, that our old-age pension system will avert that disaster from Australian heroes who may be decorated, but I do not think that it will. </para>

            <para>- No. An old-age or invalid pension would not relieve a man, especially if he had family cares, from dire necessity. I maintain that a man&#39;s decoration should be his property to use as he likes, provided that no one shall commit a fraud by wearing an article which he is not entitled to wear. Either I would enact one clause, if that is necessary, to prevent a person from wearing a decoration which he is not entitled to use, in order to impose upon the community, or I would abolish decorations, and then nobody could use them, for, after all, they are only a bit of flam, like this measure. </para>

          <para>. - It seems to me that, by an amendment which he has outlined, the Minister has recognised the weakness of this measure. The measure as drafted contained an absolute prohibition against the sale of these decorations, but, at the last moment, the Minister recognised that the enactment of that provision would probably do some injustice. So he circulated an amendment which will destroy the Bill itself, because it will allow the sale of these articles to a limited number of persons. If the possessor of a decoration is entitled to sell it, I contend that he ought to have the widest possible market at his disposal. As it is the Minister says, &#34; No, we will limit the business to a few favoured individuals who are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> collectors.&#34; Who would purchase these things? It could not be the public collectors who keep shops, because, although they are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> collectors, they only buy the articles to sell them. They would not buy these things, because they could not re-sell them. The only individuals who would be purchasers for the articles would be a few wealthy men who make a hobby of collecting such things. If an individual possessor of a decoration is entitled to sell it he ought to be allowed to do so in the widest possible market. </para>

            <para>- Personally, I think that he is. It is his private property just as much as a watch presented to him by his constituents would be the private property of the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has pointed out the only portion of this Bill which is entitled to consideration. I repeat that a naval or military decoration in the form of a medal is the private property of the recipient. The Minister proposes to restrict the sale of such medals so that their possessors are bound to get the minimum price for them. Personally, I see no reason why the owners of medals should not be allowed to do just what they choose with them ; but there is an objection to flaunting such decorations in public, because that practice may lead to fraud, and it seems to me that that is the only point upon which we may advantageously legislate. </para>

          <para>. - In reply to the arguments used by the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I would point out that naval and military medals are not bestowed upon their recipients because of their intrinsic value. Their value lies in the fact that they are regarded as distinctions. There are many things in this world which possess a value far beyond their intrinsic value. The object which any country has in presenting medals to individuals is to give them something in the shape of a reward or distinction for services rendered. Thus, a medal is intended as a reward to a particular person, and no other person has a right to wear it, or to have it in his possession ; to trade in it, or to make money out of it. The Bill is in- . tended to prevent that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has spoken of the hardship which will be inflicted upon men who have earned this distinction if we prohibit them from raising money from the sale of it when they are in necessitous circumstances. I quite agree that it is a hardship when men who have rendered signal service to the community find themselves in necessitous circumstances. But there is a proper way of dealing with such cases. This Parliament has endeavoured, by means of old-age pensions, to meet the cases of many who in other countries are left to starve. Similarly, it has provided, by means of invalid pensions, for those who may become incapacitated. Then section 43 of the Naval Defence Act sets out - </para>

They can easily ascertain when a medal was pledged, and no policeman would render himself liable to an action for vexatious prosecution. I would ask honorable senators to allow the Bill to get into Committee. Then, if any desire be exhibited to empower the Commonwealth to purchase these medals at their intrinsic value, I am quite willing that a provision to that effect shall be inserted in the Bill. </para>

In this case, however, I have no doubt that I am right, and I trust that the Committee will negative clauses 3 and 4. As I stated on the second reading of this Bill, we should not create crimes, but prevent their commission. &#39;, Under the general tenor of this Bill we shall be creating artificial crimes; but I think we are entitled, as is proposed in clause 5.. to say that a man shall not lay himself open to commit a fraud on any member of the community by wearing as his own a decoration he never earned. If a man chooses to make use of such a decoration for any other purpose  I  should give him the utmost freedom to do so. I hope we shall confine this Bill to the prevention of the fraudulent use of these decorations, and not prohibit their sale or exchange. </para>

          <para>. - I quite agree with what has been said about this and the next clause. I do not think that this Bill can be of much use, but what is desired is to prevent a person displaying a decoration which he did not win in order, it may be, to excite the sympathy of people around him. Why should a man be prohibited from selling a medal or decoration because of some sentimental value attaching to it ? A collector of such articles may be willing to give for one of these decorations very much more than its intrinsic value, and if the owner would be very glad to get more than its intrinsic value for it in order to relieve his necessities, I do not see why he should be prevented from disposing in that way of .what is his own property, given to him for services rendered to the State. We should strike out clauses 3 and 4, and it will be sufficient if we pass clause 5, which will prevent a person, not entitled to do so, wearing any of these decorations. </para>

        <para class="block">I  am very much in favour of this Bill. I have always considered it very objectionable to have medals or decorations gained for military services, or in sports, hanging up in a pawnbroker&#39;s shop. I hold that when a man receives a decoration of this kind it is of value only to himself, and should be of value to no one else. To meet the feat of some of my honorable friends that the owner of a decoration, if in dire necessity, may require to exchange it for some earthly comfort, I propose to give him the privilege of returning it to the Commonwealth Government, who will give him value for it. I have no objection to men who are hungry or bootless or sockless, disposing of these decorations to relieve their necessities. They may be of no more use to them in such circumstances than the possession of gold is to a man who is lost in the bush. But I think that in such a case the Government might be willing to purchase such decorations at whatever value they thought proper to place upon them. </para>

          <para>. - I appeal to the Minister to agree to clauses 3 and 4 being negatived. The honorable senator must see that great difficulties will arise if they are agreed to. They must be considered together, because clause 3 is proposed to prevent the holder of a decoration from disposing of it, and clause 4 to prevent any one buying such a decoration. There are a great many people in our cities who, from time to time, purchase medals and decorations, which they dispose of subsequently to collectors of such things. If these clauses are passed a serious injustice will be done to persons who have been engaged in a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and legitimate business under the law. </para>

            <para>- We shall not get any nearer to fair dealing by appealing to prejudice against persons engaged in any particular line of business. We know that the demand for old coins, medals, decorations, and stamps is very widespread in every country in the world. A medal which may be of no value, because of his necessitous condition, to the man who won it, may be of very great value to persons who are making collections of such things. This Bill would put  a  severe handicap upon such collectors, since it would do away with the middleman between the original holder and the collector by declaring his business illegal. I hope that in the circumstances the Minister will see the wisdom of postponing the further consideration of this Bill. In the meantime, the honorable senator may see that in trying to overcome one evil he may be perpetrating another. I agree that it is rather objectionable to have in the window of a pawnshop a medal or decoration given for military services. We all know of the enthusiasm over Mafeking and the report of the victory at Elands River, but the heroes of those occasions may have been driven by stress of circumstances to dispose of the decorations they received for their services. </para>

            <para>- I bow to your ruling, sir. I was drawn aside by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s interjection. In all seriousness I ask the Minister to postpone these clauses for more lengthy consideration. By rushing this Bill through a number of interests may be affected, to which most of us have not given much consideration. It will be admitted that it is a desirable thing to encourage the collection of medals and decorations which may represent steps and stages in our naval and military history. A man may have gained a medal in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He may have had to wait, as some have had to do, for thirty or forty years before the War Office authorities sent his medal on to him. After thirty or forty years he may receive a medal for services he has rendered, the intrinsic value of which may not be more than 5s. ; but there may be a sentimental value attaching to it of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> That medal may have come into the man&#39;s possession through participation in actions which the British people will be proud of as long as there is any one left to speak the language. Suppose that that man sees an opportunity of disposing of his medal to relieve some physical difficulty which, if not relieved, may end his life altogether. Why should the Government step in, and say, &#34; Although you won this medal in another country, nevertheless, having come to Australia, you cannot do what you like with your own here&#34;? I quite understand the sentimental value that attaches to decorations of this kind. There are men who would sacrifice everything before they would part with a medal. The sum of .&#163;500 would not purchase from them a piece of metal intrinsically worth only a few pence. But that is no reason why we should debar them from disposing of their property as they please. I also see that grave injustice may be done to curio dealers if the Bill passes as it stands. No matter what a man&#39;s occupation may be, we ought, in passing legislation, to see that no injury is done to him without compensation. Why should we pass a Bill the effect of which will be to say that articles in the possession of curio dealers which have a commercial value to-day shall have no such value tomorrow? I would ask the Minister to adjourn the further consideration of the Bill until we have had more time to scrutinize its provisions, and to insure that we do not do great harm by interfering with legitimate business. </para>

            <para>- It is idle to assume that a man would want to sell a piece of metal, the intrinsic value of which was very little, to get food for his wife and children. I know an old man living in Newcastle, New South Wales, who is possessed of two medals. He has lived for thirty years in Australia, and has worked as a coal miner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watkins,</inline> a member of another place, ascertained that a pension was payable on account of one of these medals, and induced the old gentleman to apply for it. He then found that he had two, to both of which pensions were attached. Now, I am glad to say, he not only enjoys his old-age pension, but the two pensions which pertain to his medals. </para>

            <para>- Then the amendment will be useless. I defy any man who has an atom of political honesty in his composition to assert that a direction to do a thing casts any obligation to do it. If the amendment laid it down that any person who wished to dispose of a medal could get market value for it from the Government, there might be something to be said for it. But as no obligation is cast upon the Government to buy, there can be no guarantee that the possessor of the medal can sell. Consequently, this is a useless concession. In fact, the amendment is one of those efforts frequently made by legislative bodies to try and please all sides by making an alteration which means nothing. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> is in earnest in wanting to dispose of the objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and others, let him propose an amendment that would not throw dust in our eyes, but would be of real value. In my opinion, if the Senate were possessed of a keen sense of humour, it would ridicule this kind of legislation out of existence, and make it impossible to bring such political trash before a deliberative body again. Because this Bill is nothing better than that. If I Had ever deserved, or had won, any decoration, I should have to be reduced to the last straits before I would part with it. </para>

            <para>- Just so. There is no reason why, if I had won a medal, I should be debarred from parting with it for- what might appear to me to be of more value than the decoration itself. I would also impress upon those who have a keen regard for that sentiment which looks upon a thing as almost sacred if it has been won in a great cause, that you cannot more effectively kill such a feeling than by trying to make its retention compulsory. What value will be attached to a medal if the owner of it is compelled to keep it even against his will? What will become of the sentiment if you lay it down by law that he may not dispose of a medal? I have the utmost respect for a person who would suffer great hardships before he would part with an article to which a sentimental value attached, whether it were a family photograph or a medal, or anything else. But I venture to think that, however much inclined a man may be to reverence such articles, and however much he might be prepared to make sacrifices before parting with one of them, he would cease to attach any sentimental value to them if he were compelled by law to keep them. </para>

If it is desired to tighten up the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> in the direction suggested, I shall be quite prepared to see that it is tightened up in another place, where such an amendment can be introduced. Let us examine the objections which have been raised. In the first place, honorable senators bring in two classes, namely, the persons to whom medals have been issued, and the persons who are now in possession of the medals. With the first class I have every sympathy, as I think we all have. We have every right to sympathise with a man who is in possession of his medal, but have we any right to consider a man who is in possession of a medal not awarded to him, but which was given for a specific purpose? The <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> collector who, for historical or other purposes, desires to make a collection of ancient coins or medals is provided for in the amendment which I have circulated. </para>

            <para>- As a curio, it will. I take it that if a person were to satisfy the Government of the day that he desired to purchase these medals for historic purposes only, he would be allowed every facility to do so. I have no sympathy for those who simply purchase medals from persons who have disposed of them for one of two reasons, either because they have ceased to value the medals, and sold them for whatever they would fetch, or because, as happens in the majority of cases, while suffering a recovery from the effects of drink, they sold the medals in order to get more liquor. It is idle to talk about these medals being sold by the winners because of necessitous circumstances. I have already disposed of that argument. The aged soldier is provided for in the Old-age Pensions Act, the decrepit or incapacitated soldier is provided for in the Invalid Pensions Act, while the disabled soldier is provided for in the Defence Act. </para>

            <para>- I think it is. It is said that this clause, if passed, will render of no value the present stocks of medals and decorations. Now, either it is desirable that the practice should be continued, or it is not. I think that it should be stopped. At one time in this country there was a legal traffic in opium, and persons acquired large stocks. Public opinion declared that it was not desirable that opium should be sold, and suddenly a measure was passed to stop its sale. </para>

            <para>- In the Department there is a long series of letters on the subject. For years there has been an agitation for this legislation on the part of those who are entitled to wear medals and decorations. When Parliament intervened and stopped the sale of opium, did it compensate those who had stocks of opium ? No ; the holders had to lose the value of the stocks which they had acquired quite legally. </para>

            <para>- That is another matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has stated that the effect of this provision will be to cheapen the value of medals. If he were in possession of a medal which had been awarded to him because of his conduct in battle or for long service or for good conduct - I am rather doubtful about him getting a medal for good conduct - nothing could cheapen the sentimental value of that medal in his mind more than for a person to come along and tell him that he could go round to a certain pawnshop and buy half-a-dozen such medals for 5s. The intrinsic value of the medals is small, and the parading of them in pawnshops destroys any sentimental value which is attached to them. The winners of medals are, after all, the only persons whom we should consider. So long as the Commonwealth gives or recognises medals, we ought, by our legislation, to preserve the real value of them, and that is the value arising from the fact that the wearer has won them. </para>

I think that it had better be disposed of straight away. I would point out to the Minister that a man who has won a medal does not want to dispose of it unless he is absolutely bound to do so. The winner of a medal may become penniless, either through misfortune or because of his indulgence in intemperate habits, and what is the use of enacting that if he disposes of his medal he shall be liable to a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20?</inline> Where could he get the money if he were fined ? </para>

          <para>. - The longer this discussion proceeds the more apparent does it become that the Bill is likely to be more or less futile. We might retain clause  5,  because it strikes at what is a fraud. Why is it that the Minister gives such attention to military and naval decorations, and brings in a measure to prevent the sale or misuse of them? I regard many scholastic and literary decorations as quite as honorable as, if not more honorable than, the medals which are obtained for good service or for good conduct or for valour in war, military or naval. It is regrettable indeed to see these medals sometimes in the hands of,, unfortunately, pawnbrokers, and at other times legitimately in the hands of&#39; dealers. But, notwithstanding that, no Government in the world has attempted to prevent the sale or pawning of decorations and distinctions. </para>

          <para>. - I am surprised at the sympathy which has been exhibited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for a certain class of legal traffickers in articles of this description. I have no sympathy for them. I have lived in a very poor neighbourhood all my life, and I fully recognise what a curse pawnbrokers are. In my capacity, as a justice of the peace, I have frequently had occasion to attest the affidavits of persons who have lost the tickets of articles which they have pledged. From my own personal knowledge I can say that these legal traffickers make paltry advances, even upon men and women&#39;s clothing. These articles are pawned at the beginning of the week and released at the end of it. The less that a community has to do with such a class the better. I would like to see the pawnbrokers wiped out entirely. I hope that the Bill will be passed, and that, at least, one spoke will be put in the wheel of these legal traffickers for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has so much sympathy. </para>

But merely because certain things are disagreeable to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> he is prepared to put a spoke in the wheel of all who are engaged in a particular class of business. I would point out to him that the pawnbroker never comes into contact with the poorer classes until they need relief from their necessitous circumstances. He then steps in and affords them that relief under conditions which are clearly laid down, and strictly regulated. I would suggest to the Minister that the words &#34;out of&#34; in the concluding lines of the clause, should be omitted, and that the words &#34;in or for &#34; should be inserted in lieu thereof. Then this clause will not interfere with the great army of individuals who possess medals at the present time, not awarded for service in or for Australia, and who may wish to. dispose of them. </para>

Upon his arrival here the Government practically say to him, &#34; You may dispose of your watch and clothing, but you must not dispose of the medal which has been bestowed upon you by another Government.&#34; I take the strongest exception to such an interference with his liberty, just as I take the strongest exception to the prejudice exhibited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> The lowest pawnshop in the land is conducted upon the same principle as is our biggest banking institution, and does quite as legitimate a business. I recollect the period when the New South Wales Government made free grants of land to volunteers for services which they had rendered to it. What would be thought of the action of this Senate if it carried a resolution affirming that a man who had received such a grant should not be permitted to dispose of it? What an outcry there would be if we declared that the individual who had purchased it should not be allowed to part with it? </para>

But merely because a pawnship proprietor has conducted his business in a way that is unsatisfactory to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> the latter would wipe him out altogether. What about the institutions which have given mortgages over land grants made by the New South Wales Government for voluntary services rendered years ago? Will he put a spoke in their wheel? No. Why will he exempt them? Merely because they are the big gilded pawnshops. The real cause underlying the introduction of this Bill is that, in certain quarters there are persons who hold military medals, and who feel ashamed when they see similar medals exhibited in pawnshop windows for a few shillings. On account of this snobbishness- </para>

It is merely the disgust which has been created amongst certain superfine and supersensitive persons which has prompted the introduction of the . Bill. I ask the Minister whether he is prepared to accept an amendment of the clause which will provide that where the owners of military medals bring them to the Government, the latter will inquire into their circumstances, with a view to affording them relief, and whether, if the legitimate owners of such medals are deceased, they will return them to their legitimate heirs ? </para>

            <para>- During the adjournment for lunch I have considered other arguments against this clause. I think one of the strongest may be deduced from the speech of the Minister of Defence in moving the second reading of the Electoral Bill;. The honorable senator reminded the Senate that Parliament has invaded the liberty of the individual by compelling the attendance of children at school and the attendance of youths at drill. This clause, and1 the next, involve what may be considered a very slight inroad upon the rights of individuals, but I hope the Committee will not agree to them, because there has been no demand for any such legislation. I suppose that there are not more than 10,000 people in Australia who are in possession of medals of this kind, and the number of these who wish to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of them must be so small that it becomes absurd of the Government to utilize the whole machinery of Parliament to prevent them having the right to do so. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator overlooks the fact that the law against murderers is for the protection of the rest of the community. Surely he will not contend that the rest of the community will be injured if a man who has rightly earned a medal sells or disposes of it in any other way. The medal may have been conferred upon him by the Government of another country, and he may have come here with it in the belief that this was a free country. </para>

            <para>- Interjections of that kind ought certainly be put down. The argument that a justifiable interference with the liberty of the individual in one case may be used as an excuse for such interference in another case, is pressed to the breaking point when it is proposed to interfere with the right of a very few people to do something which can injure no one. I should like to know who has demanded legislation of this kind. I never heard any one ask for it from a public platform or anywhere else in the State I come from. If this Bill should become the law of the land about the only result that is likely to follow from it will be that the Commonwealth will be put to considerable expense to prosecute some unfortunate fellow who has sold a medal, and some other unfortunate person who has purchased it from him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> has very rightly asked whether it is really worth while to impose a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline> upon a man who, to relieve his necessities, sells a medal which is not worth 20s. </para>

            <para>- I think we should have some enlightenment on the point. It is up to the Minister to make his case good. The Government propose to say to the owners of these medals, &#34; We shall not permit you to part with them on any consideration whatever. We shall make it an offence on your part if you do dispose of them, and an offence also on the part of any person who may buy them from you.&#34; I should like to hear the Minister explain that these medals are not the private property of those who have honestly won them. I claim that they are as much their private property as if they were sovereigns. </para>

            <para>- They are the valued personal property of those who have honorably won them, and rightly prize them. To propose such legislation to impose penalties upon the comparatively few people who, driven by stress of circumstances, may be obliged to pledge, exchange, or sell these medals, is like setting up the most uptodate and expensive machinery in order to crack eggshells. I am at a loss to understand the anxiety of the Minister of Defence to press on with this measure. I fail to understand why the time of the draftsman should have been taken up in drafting it. I look upon it as pernicious legislation. I do not remember the worst of our opponents when in power going out of their way to interfere with the individual liberty of persons, who were doing no injury to the community, when there was no call or occasion for that interference. </para>

            <para>- I shall be most pleased if my opponents will quote it against me. I do not think that any other Government in this or in any other country ever tried to make it an offence to do something which injures nobody. The Government propose to make it an offence for a man to sell a medal worth a few shillings in order to tide him over a difficulty, and though its sale would not injure in the slightest degree any one in the community. It will be the duty of the Minister of Defence, before this clause passes, to show the necessity for it. I hope, if I have done nothing else, that I have made it clear that there is no reason for the proposed interference with&#39; the individual liberty of the rightful owners of these medals. There might be something to be said for the proposal if we were dealing solely with Australian medals presented by a Commonwealth Government. It might be contended that they were not given with any idea that they would be parted with again, or would be traded with indiscriminately. But this Bill will deal also with medals presented by Governments with whom we have no power whatever to interfere; yet it is proposed in free Australia to treat them differently from any other valuable possession. I may have a trinket of some kind that is of value to me. If I want to dispose of it, I am able to do so to whomsoever will buy it from me. But when a nian comes to this country with a medal which he has won, perhaps in one of the great wars of the last half-century, why should we, by our legislation, say to him that he shall not dispose of it as he pleases, even though he may be in distress, and the sale of the medal may be the means of tiding him over a difficulty for a. considerable time? Without attempting to prolong this discussion further, I express the hope that we shall heed the warning given by the Minister - because we must take it as a warning - that we have already interfered with individual liberty in many directions. We have interfered with individual liberty in the matter of compulsory training ; we propose to interfere with it by compelling people to enroll for electoral purposes ; and we have interfered with it under the Education Acts. Surely we have reached the limit of interference with- individual liberty when a measure of this kind is introduced. </para>

            <para>- A speech which, I venture to think, transcended the importance of the poor little subject to which it was directed. That question is my justification for rising again. Since we dealt with this subject this morning, I have had an opportunity of ascertaining the legal position in which recipients of military and naval medals stand. The bulk of such medals are conferred by the King, either personally, or by delegated authority. For all practical purposes, such decorations are, in the Imperial service, considered to be the property of the Sovereign. </para>

            <para>- I shall show that immediately. They are granted by the King, with permission for the retention thereof by the grantee or his next of kin. Under the Army Act, section  156,  subsection  1,  any person&#39; who buys, takes in pawn, &#38;c, any such medal or decoration, is liable to a fine not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20</inline> for the first offence, and for a second offence, to a similar fine or imprisonment up to six months, with hard labour. Sections 2 and  4  of the same Act provide that any person found in possession of such a medal or decoration may be arrested without warrant. Under sub-section  5,  the medals and decorations may be dealt with by Order of a Court - that is to say, by court-martial. The Regimental Debts Act  1893,  section  11,  provides that medals are not part of a man&#39;s estate with respect to creditors or administration. They cannot be sold in bankruptcy ; and in cases of intestacy, are allotted to .the next of kin in order of seniority, as shown by King&#39;s Regulation  1759.  Under the Army Act, and the Pay Warrant Act, a soldier may forfeit his medals for misconduct - which again shows that they are not his personal property. Otherwise, they could not be taken away from him in that manner. </para>

          <para>. - I think that the Minister has proved a little too much by his quotations from English legislation on this subject. He has proved thai military decorations and medals are not the personal property of those who hold them. In that case, the Minister himself is going a great deal too far in this Bill, because he is going to license persons who may buy such articles. If a man has no right to sell a medal, surely the Minister has no right to give a licence to some one who will buy. But that is exactly what the Minister is going to do. </para>

            <para>- I am very careful not to transgress the Standing Orders at any time. Despite what the Minister says, he cannot deny that it is his intention to move for the insertion of a clause in the Bill for the purpose of licensing persons to purchase medals. We should be wise to strike the clause out altogether, and also to have nothing to do with the clause which the Minister intends to propose, which would license certain persons to buy medals. If we prohibit traffic in medals and decorations, we shall prevent them being hawked about, and shall then have done quite enough. </para>

If this new doctrine - that medals are not the property of the individual, but of the Defence Department - is to be admitted, the holders of such decorations will be put very much in the position of those who were victimized by a game which was familiar to most of us in our boyhood. The game was to fasten an apple to a string and lay it upon the footpath. Someone would come along and stoop to pick it up, when the string would be pulled, and the apple would disappear. </para>

            <para>- Well, my honorable friend&#39;s methods were always more barbarous than mine ! As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> speech, I recall a criticism of his some time ago when there was a proposal to send representatives of this and the other House of the Legislature to Great Britain. We must all have been gratified at the honorable senator&#39;s tone to-day; and I am sure that we appreciate the good effects that have followed from his short visit to the Old Land. In view of this very pleasant experience, I suggest to the Government that the experiment that has succeeded so admirably in this case is entitled to further application. The Minister said one thing that is quite correct, namely, that this Bill is not worthy of the consideration that has been given to it. I should like to know the real reason for its introduction. I should like to see the genesis of it. </para>

            <para>- And these officers, having ready access to the administrative ear, have probably induced an innocentminded Minister to introduce this measure. They are really responsible for its introduction. I do not believe that it has any other foundation. But I do not see why we should pass legislation imposing penalties, and creating new crimes, whilst, at the same time, in no sense rendering a service to the public, or conferring any advantage upon anybody, under such influences. If the Minister can show that any section of the public of Australia will be injured by the rejection of this Bill, I am sure that every member of the Senate will listen to him. </para>

But I point out in all seriousness that, though persons of conservative tendencies may attach an altogether exaggerated veneration to these bits of trinkets, and may want to impose all sorts of penalties on other people who do not, nevertheless, we ought to have sounder reasons given for the passage of this Bill. That does not account for my opposition to the measure, but certainly accentuates it. The Minister actually said that even if I were to live to be a veteran I would probably never gain a medal for good conduct. I really think that I am entitled to ask him to withdraw that serious reflection upon me. It has strained my loyalty to the party almost beyond breaking point. </para>

          <para>. - I rise because the Minister answered one of the unimportant points which I raised, but skipped over the others. In his attempt to prove that medals are not private property, he quoted from the military law that a medal can be taken from a soldier; but he quoted no authority for the assertion that a medal can be taken from an ex-soldier. I take it that a medal can be removed from a man while he is in the service of his country. If after a medal is awarded to a soldier, he does anything to degrade the service, it is right that it should be taken from him. </para>

            <para>- The Minister, in attempting to prove his case, proved too much. He proved that a soldier in service might lose his medal for misconduct; but I do not think that the quotation he made proves that the military authorities can interfere with a man after he has served his time. I venture to think that it would not be as easy as the Minister suggests for them to take from a man what is rightfully his property. In the case of debt, almost everything that a man possesses can be taken, but you cannot interfere with his medals, which are his personal property, and pass to his heirs on his death. That is a very strong reason why we should oppose the measure. The Minister has stated that the time which we are occupying on this question is out of proportion to its importance, and that more than justifies my opinion. It must be very objectionable to the Minister to find that we have time in which to try to prevent him from passing a piece of legislation which very few persons have asked for. We will admit that the veterans who are wearing their medals with honour and credit are rightly annoyed that some men who have served their country equally well, and have been rewarded, are not valuing their medals at the same high price, but have disposed of them. But how many persons in the community are annoyed by the way in which men conduct themselves? If ten times as many persons as the veterans went to the Minister and asked for legislation of this character, would he consent to introduce it? No. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that there are probably only one or two active spirits, who feel somewhat incensed at the way in which medals have been disposed of as cheap trinkets, behind this matter. The Minister, I repeat, has proved that the medals are considered so sacred as individual property, that they cannot, under the law of the Old Country, be taken for debt or other purpose. Another statement he made was that we have wasted too much time on this matter. Now, is it a waste of time to discuss a clause of this character, which perhaps was put into the Bill without even the Minister reading it? Is it a waste of time to consider at this stage all the grounds which can be urged for or against the enactment of the measure? I think that, instead of being anxious to get to a vote, the Minister should, seeing that there is a reasonably strong objection to the principle of the cuause, consent to an adjournment at an earlier hour than usual. </para>

            <para>- Yes; I was in favour of going on if it was not the intention of the Minister to reconsider the clause. Whether a vote is taken now or an hour later will make no difference to me. I suggest that perhaps an adjournment at this hour might help him to get the Bill put through more quickly. Even if this clause, on which there has been a lengthy discussion, is passed, the next clause is still more objectionable, and so on right through the measure. I think that the honorable senator might be generous enough to the opponents of the clause to agree to an adjournment. I ask him as a favour to accede to my request. </para>

          <para>. - I do not feel that I can support clause 3. In my opinion, the attempt to treat the vendor and the buyer of a medal equally is very ineffective. If clause 3 were passed, we should have the humiliating spectacle of a person who is generally regarded as a hero being dragged before a police court&#39; because he was obliged to pledge his medal for two or three shillings. There would be a howl throughout the community if a veteran were treated in that way. </para>

            <para>- That shows the folly of passing the clause. I am in favour of clause 4, because I think that pawnbrokers should be prevented from buying or receiving decorations. I think that we can gain our purpose by passing clause 3 and dropping clause 4. We are all familiar with the old story about a man having a medal and a wooden leg. The treatment of veteran soldiers has led to many reforms. I hope that we shall never witness here a state of affairs common in older lands, and which Australians generally have condemned from every platform and in the press. I trust that if we cannot do anything to keep a veteran out of the position of having to pawn or sell his medal, which sentimentally is worth a good deal, particularly to the members of his family, we shall not drag him before a police court. That would show a very poor appreciation of the services which had entitled him to receive the medal. It may pain an individual more to pawn his medal for, perhaps, 2s., than it would pain the community to hear of the fact. A veteran may pawn his medal with the fullest intention of redeeming it at the earliest opportunity, although that might never come to him. I shall support clause 4, which, I think, will achieve all that the Minister desires; but I shall vote to protect the poor veteran who is driven to dispose of his medal or decoration. The special circumstances in which men win their medals should secure to them that exemption. </para>

          <para>- - As we have passed a clause making a penalty attach to the man who sells any naval or military decoration, we cannot logically refrain from imposing a similar penalty upon the man who buys it. But, as it seems hopeless to expect the Minister to recognise the merits of this question, I think that we may reasonably allow the remainder of the Bill to pass. </para>

          <para>. - It is obviously impossible to accept the amendment, because we have already passed a clause which imposes a penalty upon any person who pledges a naval or military decoration. That being so, surely the person who receives .such a decoration should be equally liable. I wish also to say that the threat made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is rather unworthy of him. I have not attempted to bludgeon the Bill through in any way, and I do not think he is treating me fairly when he says that, unless the amendment be agreed to, he will &#34; stone- wall &#34; the Bill until 4 o&#39;clock in the hope that it will never be heard of again.

          <para>. - I am very sorry if I have said anything which reflects on the Minister. I had no intention of doing so, and I most unreservedly withdraw any remarks of mine which bear that complexion. But I consider that I have just as much right to express my opinion on this Bill as has the Minister. I admit that he has not attempted to bludgeon the measure through in any way, and that he has met the criticism which has been levelled against it with a surprising amount of good temper. I honestly believe that if the Minister had anticipated the opposition which has been shown to this measure, it would never have been introduced. There will be some justification for the time wasted over it if the discussion will prevent the introduction of such trivial legislation in future. While that may not have been intended, it is, in effect, an insult to the Senate to bring such absolutely futile and inept legislation before it. I feel it keenly when, because of it, the Senate is delayed in the performance of duties which it might perform with honour and credit to the country. It is not what honorable senators who are opposed to the Bill have said, but the Bill itself that is reducing the work of the Senate to an absolute farce. </para>

            <para>- I hope he will. There is another aspect of this measure which may be worthy of the Minister&#39;s consideration. What will be the position if, after this Bill is passed, it is found to be in conflict with a State law ; if, for instance, the law under which pawnbrokers in New South Wales obtain their licences, permits them to take pledges of this kind? I do not pretend to be an authority on the Constitution, but I have grave doubts whether it gives us the right to interfere with the licences issued to pawnbrokers under a State law. </para>

We on this side have had a lesson calculated to impress us deeply with the way in which the States resent any undue interference with their rights on the part of the Commonwealth. Only a few months ago the electors in several of the States told us to halt when we proposed an interference with what they regarded as State rights. I do not &#39;know whether the Minister of Defence remembers the incident? It was so slight a matter that perhaps it should not be included in the same category as a great measure of this kind, but it was an instance of the resentment of the electors at the Commonwealth proposing to interfere with the right of State Parliaments to enact certain legislation. Perhaps, in the circumstances, we might have the opinion of the Attorney-General, or of the Crown Law officers,  as to whether this Bill will not involve an interference with State laws. </para>

I do not say that the Minister made such a promise in so many words, but I sat down immediately when I was discussing the last clause, after the honorable senator made a statement, which 1 took to mean _ that that would be the last clause dealt with to-day. I think the further consideration of trieBill might well be adjourned until some of us get more information on the matter. If that course is adopted, I shall try to get some definite information on the point as. to whether the passing of this Bill would interfere with the business of people who are licensed under a State law, and is not something beyond the powers of this Parliament.

        <para class="block">The Government are proposing in. this clause to regulate the business of people whose business at the present moment is regulated by a State law in each of the States. Some persons may have a very lofty contempt for the business of a pawnbroker but such businesses would not flourish as they do if they did not receive the support of large numbers of people in the community. It appears that pawnbrokers are to be permitted to take apparel and almost anything else they like in pledge, but a naval or military war medal is to be a sacred thing on which they shall not be allowed to lend money. I think that the less law we have the better for thc.people, and we might well devote a very long session to the consideration of laws already on the statute-book that have become unnecessary. We are discussing a clause here, which, if passed, will never be given effect to.  Let us consider the kind of case which might be brought before the Courts if this measure were passed.

I ask the honorable senator to imagine what his feelings would be if, after the passing of this Bill, he were to see a case reported of a man being brought before a Court, and fined, because he lent some unfortunate individual a shilling on a war medal. I know what we should say if the other side tried to pass such a measure. Such a thing might happen if we pass this legislation, which is asked for by no one, but, perhaps, a few people who may rightly feel resentment against medals presented for services in war being treated as matters of no value. We have to consider how this clause would operate if passed. A man might be sufficiently high-spirited to refuse to take money as a gift, though he would be disposed to accept a loan, giving his medal as a pledge, but this clause would make such a man an offender against the law. It is repugnant to our feeling of right to make a man an offender unless he does something which is injurious to the community. This clause would prevent a man obtaining a loan .upon an article which was his own property. </para>

            <para>- That is exactly what I do not remember. I am not convinced by the Minister&#39;s statement that medals do not belong to the holders. Then, take the case of a man who buys a medal which was conferred upon a soldier who has been dead many years, and has no living heirs. It may be that such a medal has passed through half-a-dozen hands. What sense is there in saying that the present holder of such a medal should be regarded as an offender against the law?* What will happen to an individual like myself, who may have a medal offered to him for sale, and may determine to buy it ? I might say, &#34; These medals are getting very scarce, and I do not mind giving the price asked for the specimen offered to me.&#34; Why should I be regarded as an offender against the law because I am willing to make such a bargain? If the Government really want to stop medals being disposed of in this manner, why do they not impose a Customs duty upon them, and prevent them coming into the country? I am afraid, however, that this Bill has been introduced at the instance of a few military &#34; Johnnies,&#34; who, because they wear gilded uniforms and have a few decorations, do not like to see medals similar to their own hanging in pawnshop windows. If these persons are displeased to see such things, let them buy up the medals themselves. However, I do not wish to &#34;stone-wall&#34; the Bill, and, though I have much else to say, shall sit down and give some one else an opportunity of speaking. </para>

          <para>- If this discussion has done nothing else, it has produced a magnificent joke from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon.</inline> But, incidentally, the_ honorable senator made a suggestion which may contain within it a serious point. It was that there was a possibility of this Bill being altogether unconstitutional. _ Is the Minister perfectly certain that this Government have a right to interfere with a man&#39;s right to dispose of a medal which has been given to him by the King for services rendered as a member of the Imperial Army? If such a man comes to Australia, goes to a pawnshop, and obtains a loan on his medal, has the Commonwealth the constitutional right to prosecute him? Has the Commonwealth any control over medals which it has not conferred ? If a soldier who was so treated chose to take a case to the High Court, I am not sure that his contention would not be upheld. Of course, if he had only a few shillings, it would not matter very much if he embarked his whole fortune on testing the point, hut it might involve the Commonwealth in many thousands of pounds of expenditure. </para>

            <para>- Though a man may have only a shilling or two, the Judges, it is wise to assume, know the law of the land ; and I am not at all sure that they would not uphold the point that the Commonwealth Parliament has no right, by its legislation, to dictate what shall be done with a medal given to an old soldier by the King for services in the Imperial Army. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> deserves credit for raising this interesting legal point. I am inclined to think that the Commonwealth has no more right to legislate with regard to a medal of that kind than it has to legislate concerning the possible inhabitants of Mars. I should be very much inclined, if I were a pawnbroker who had taken a pledge in this manner, to resist the law of the Commonwealth. If a policeman came into my <inline font-style="italic">mont it</inline><inline font-style="italic">piete</inline> to execute this law of the Commonwealth. I should be inclined to take him by the slack of the nether portion of his garments and hurl him out into the street. </para>
