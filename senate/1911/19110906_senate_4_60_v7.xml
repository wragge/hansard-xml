                        <para>- Yesterday, sir, - in this chamber a motion of congratulation to  His  Majesty on his coronation was moved and seconded, and I should like to ask you whether it was formally carried. There is no reference to the matter in either of the daily newspapers. Both newspapers' report such a motion as having been carried by the House of Representatives, making it appear that the Senate had abstained from passing a vote of congratulation. </para>

                    <para>. - On looking through the Speech addressed to Parliament by  His Excellency  the Governor-General yesterday, I am forced to the conclusion - which I think would be arrived at by less experienced parliamentarians than those sitting on both sides of this Chamber - that the length of the document is in inverse ratio to the substance contained in it. It appears to touch upon almost every subject under the political sun ; but, nevertheless, there is only one matter to which the Government has definitely committed itself. We have the assurance that the Government is carefully considering this matter; that it is deeply pondering the other; but there is only one project upon which Ministers speak with any definiteness, and that is our old friend the Navigation Bill. We have at length the comforting assurance that that measure is to be passed into law before the close of the present session ; but with regard to everything else, it appears to me that the Government have left it optional either to go on with any Bill that is foreshadowed, or to drop it as they please. Before I proceed to discuss what we may consider to be the proposals foreshadowed in the Speech, there are one or two other matters outside the document itself to which I desire to direct attention. In doing so, may I make just one reference to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell yesterday afternoon. The honorable senator is always more or less interesting in the speeches which he delivers here; but I want, if he will allow me, to make a suggestion to him I hope that, being my senior, he will not regard it as a species of impertinence on my part if I suggest that his speeches would be likely to make a more lasting impression upon the Senate if he would, at some time or other, deliver one which was free from the personal feeling that characterized his remarks concerning a colleague from his own State. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, I know what my honorable friend's position is. He and his friends are the only persons who have the right to attack their opponents whilst they appear to arrogate to themselves the exalted privilege of being free from attack in return. Passing from that, I desire to offer my congratulations to the Prime Minister of this country upon the distinguished honour which has been conferred upon him. and the title which he has accepted. It was an honour of which any man might reasonably be proud, to be called into the inner circles of counsel of the monarch of a great empire like the British Empire. The honour which has been conferred upon the Prime Minister has been marred only by one thing, and that is by the efforts made to apologize for his acceptance of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, it</inline> required no apology. The acceptance of this honour by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was, I repeat, marred by that one fact, that it was considered necessary to put forward a kind of excuse in the form of a pretence that the title was accepted only because it was thrust upon him. I also offer my congratulations to the Government in another connexion. I do not know whether the statement be correct or not - if it be incorrect, the Vice-President of the Executive Council will, of course, put me right - but I understand that the Government has treated its delegates to the Imperial Conference with a greater degree of liberality than has ever been shown by any Government before. I wish it to be distinctly understood that, in my opinion, the Government have acted rightly. I am not finding fault with them in the slightest degree. Hitherto, it seems to me, Governments have paid too much attention to a kind of criticism that has been made outside - and a great deal of that criticism, it must be remarked, has come from the Labour party - with the consequence that we have seen delegates sent to Great Britain provided for with a distinctly parsimonious hand. But, having expressed the opinion that the Government have done rightly 'in this matter, I proceed to point out - as I am fairly entitled to do - that it is a little curious that the party which! has always preached Spartan simplicity is the first one to send Home a Labour Premier who has deemed it necessary to have a personal attendant, and which has provided for Ministers who were sent Home with the Prime Minister more liberally than any previous Government had done. I merely point this out in order to express the hope that, in future, my honorable friends opposite will not be so captious in their criticism in regard to similar expenditure which may be authorized by other Governments. Hitherto, I say again, the allowances made to representatives on such occasions has been parsimonious.. A Labour Government have been the first to set a new example. I do not find fault with them. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I think that if I turned up the records I could find that there was on previous occasions rather sharp denunciation from honorable senators opposite on account of expenditure on what has been termed " picnics " of this kind. I take quite a different view. I say that if we send Home representatives to participate in conferences such as that recently held we should see that they are reasonably provided for, and not compel them to draw upon their personal means, or prevent them, through insufficiency of provision, from upholding the dignity of their position. Having said that, however, let me express my sincere regret that a Government which so liberally handled the public funds to provide for the expenses of its own members, did not view with the same liberality a proposal which was made to send Home a contingent of our troops to take part in the Coronation ceremonies. The reason cannot have been insufficiency of funds. Otherwise I assume that a Ministry which is supposed to be representative of severe economy and simplicity would not have sent a Prime 'Minister with a large retinue, provided for more liberally than any previous Ministers had been. It must have been rather humiliating to Australians who were in London to see that the Australian Prime Minister was escorted by Canadian troops. There can be no questioning the fact that a contingent of our troops would - I unhesitatingly say this - have compared more than favorably with troops from any other portion of the Empire. There could have been no better advertisement for Australia than would have been provided by sending a small and select body of Australian soldiers. I further point out that the Government cannot for a moment pretend that they are not anxious that Australia should be advertised, because the whole tenor ot recent speeches made by Ministers has tended to advertise Australia, and to bring before the minds of those 111 the Mother Country who may be anxious to emigrate the great advantages that Australia offers to them. There must have been some reason why it was thought on this occasion inadvisable to send troops to London. It cannot, as I say, have, been that there were no funds available. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently not. That is the whole point of my argument. I am pointing out that a Government which could double the allowance to Ministers, and which could send Home a Prime Minister with a retinue rivalling that of an Eastern potentate, was still unable to provide a few pounds for the sending Home of troops on an occasion when troops from all parts of the Empire were represented. If it was not a question of money, what was it? Here is a Prime Minister who is supposed to have been brought up and to be living in Spartan simplicity, and he is the first representative of this country to go Home provided with a valet. I should like to know the reason. Turning now to the Conference itself, I desire to say that there has been jio more important gathering of the representatives  of the Empire than that which recently concluded its labours in London. It was important first, in my judgment, because of the increasing gravity of the international outlook. Whether it be well founded or not there is unquestionably a growing belief in the minds of most people that many years will not pass over our heads before a great trial of strength will be witnessed. That being so, it appears to me of increasing importance that the various portions of the Empire should have these conferences for the interchange of ideas, the understanding of one another better, and, it may possibly be, learning more of the point of view of different sections of the Empire, with a view to united action when the hour of trial comes. There is, in addition, another matter which marks this Conference as distinct from any of its predecessors, and that is, that, for the first time in our history, the representatives of the outlying Dominions have been admitted into the very inner councils of the Empire. That is the statement which has been made by our representatives, and we have a right to accept their assurance. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> would not be himself if he did not joke even upon an important matter of this kind. I say that this matter not only marks a distinct advance towards the time when there will be closer unity of action between the Motherland and the outlying Dominions, but something else of greater importance. I believe that the admission of the representatives of the outlying Dominions to the inner councils of the Motherland means something more than merely the imparting of information. I consider that it throws an added responsibility upon those who have been admitted to the Conference. It is idle to assume that those, who have been made participators in that information, and intrusted with that confidence, can have done otherwise than come away impressed, I hope deeply impressed, with the fact that upon them there is now an obligation to consider, not merely the requirements of Australia, but also the obligations and requirements of the Motherland. They cannot share in this confidence without also to some extent being held responsible in the way I have indicated. There is this further reason why that responsibility should be theirs. Rightly or wrongly I take this view as to the future: Hitherto wars in which Great Britain has been involved, have been wars in which the interests of Great Britain were principally involved. The next war, in my view, is going to threaten the British Empire. Hitherto Australia has lent some very useful assistance to Great Britain in wars in which she has been engaged. |Tn the next war Australia will not merely be assisting Great Britain, but as a part of the Empire, will be fighting for her very national existence. Therefore, I regard this disclosure of Imperial policy to representatives of the outlying Dominions as another step towards the time when we shall have established more frequent communication between the different portions of the Empire, with a view to joint action in such a time of stress as that to which I have referred. I have not the slightest doubt that, as time goes on, some means will be devised by which common counsel can be taken, with a view to that united action. Passing from that to the next paragraph of the Governor-General's Speech, I see a somewhat audacious reference made to the Naval Agreement. One would have thought that the Government, as a result of the Conference, had drafted some entirely new Naval Agreement. As a matter of fact, the position is practically the same now as that which existed after the agreement arrived at by the Conference to which the previous Government sent  Colonel Foxton  as their representative. The statement is made that - </para>

                        <para>- The policy of the present Government was limited to the use of small coastal boats. That was the original policy of the Labour party. The larger scheme which is now being carried out is unquestionably the scheme formulated at the Conference at which Colonel Foxton represented Australia. These are simple facts beyond serious 'controversy. I therefore say it is a little audacious of the Government to frame this paragraph in such a way as to make it appear that they are making some entirely new agreement, and turning over a fresh page in Australian naval history. Another paragraph that strikes me as curious is this - </para>

                        <para>- No, they were not. My honorable  friends  need not think for a moment that they will turn me away from the interesting paragraph dealing with the Japanese Treaty. I might, perhaps, repeat it with advantage in order that  honorable  senators "might be impressed, not so much with what it contains, but with what it omits to say. If there is anything at all in the traditions of Parliament one would think that it is rather the business of a Government to tell Parliament something as to what they have done in the name of the people whom they represent, but there is not a single word here as to whether this agreement was, or was not, approved by the Australian delegates. The press has informed us that that approval was given, but there is not a word of it here. </para>

                        <para>- There is not a word here at all as to whether it was approved or not. There is simply the bald statement which we knew all along that this agreement has been extended for ten years. It does appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> moving about in the Old Country,  amidst the environment there, did, as the newspapers informed us, express his approval of it, but when he comes out here, somehow or other, he appears to display a little timidity, probably because some of the more militant members of the party, fearful of the view which might be held by certain voters, have restrained the honorable gentleman, and so we find not a single word in this document to tell this Parliament whether or not our principal representative has approved, in the name of Australia, o£ the renewal of that Treaty". Surely we were entitled to that information. We were entitled to know how far our statesmen committed Australia in this important matter. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the Government to say what they have done in the name of Australia. I venture to say that none but a Labour Government would have had the audacity to commit Australia in an important matter of this kind without at the earliest opportunity telling Parliament what they had done. Are we to understand that because they are a Labour Government, they consider they are under no obligation to do so. It was their duty to tell Australia what they have done, but we have not heard a single word  as to whether they were consulted, or whether they expressed approval or disapproval. I can only put their action down to a fear which is almost groundless - the fear that if they approved their action might be misunderstood. I sincerely hope that they approved. But for that renewal the position of Australia would indeed be perilous. </para>

                        <para>- I am certain that whether this Government fails by omission or commission, it will not make the slightest difference to its supporters. I venture to say that if a Liberal Government had been on the Treasury benches, the moment it failed to make a statement as to what it had done in the name of Australia, my honorable friends on the other side would have been scarcely able to contain themselves. Let me pass on to one or two minor matters before I draw attention at a little greater length to the referenda. The first is a reference to the Australian Notes. Act. The Speech assures us that it is intended to bring in a Bill to extend the usefulness of the Act. That, of course, is a euphemistic way of saying that already, although the Act is not twelve months old, it is the intention of the Government to commence to undermine it. The objection of the Opposition was not to the mere issue of Government notes, but to the fear that, little by little, the safety of the notes would be tampered with, that, little by little, the Government would commence to destroy its reserve, until, perhaps in a time of financial stress or shortage, they would go beyond the safety line in their desire to utilize that which ought to be held in reserve. </para>

                        <para>- The. principal objection which animated those who objected to the issue of Government notes was the belief that the integrity of Government paper, in order to meet the requirements of the Treasury, was always liable to be violated. No one can cite an instance where a nation has gone in one step from a sound paper currency to an unsound paper currency. It has always been done little by little. This is the first step on a downward path. I do not believe that we shall find, when the Bill is introduced, any very drastic alteration proposed. But we shall find that, in less than twelve months, the Government are commencing to whittle away the reserve for which they took so much credit twelve months ago. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. There can be only one way in which the Government can propose an amendment, and that is to cut down the margin of reserve. Reference is also made in the Speech to the invitation for designs for the Federal Capital. I ask the Minister whether his attention has been drawn to the protest from a society which, I believe, represents the architects of Great Britain, as to the composition of the Board to adjudicate upon the designs. If I understand the position disclosed by correspondence in the press, the architects of Great Britain - and, presumably, those on the Continent and in America as well - will decline to submit designs unless they are assured that the tribunal to adjudicate will be fully competent, and a request has been made that the Board should be nominated now, so that men who stand high in the profession may know that their designs will be submitted to persons fully qualified to judge. That request has, I believe, been made to the Government, and I do urge - it is not too late yet - that it should receive their most serious consideration. However we may differ as to where the Federal Capital ought to be, there can be no possible room for division on that point. We want the best brains of the most skilled architects of the world to give us their assistance in laying, out a Capital of which we can all be justly proud. </para>

                        <para>- I say at once, without any disrespect to Australians, that if it is really intended to appoint three officials as a Board, then, in my judgment, it will not be satisfactory. I do not suggest that you cannot find in Australia men competent for the work, but it is assuming a little too much to suppose that in Australia you have men whose experience is as wide as that which can be claimed by architects in a larger way of business in the older countries of the world. However, I am not urging a particular constitution of the Board ; I am merely drawing the attention of the Minister to what appears to be a very reasonable request, namely, that such a Board will be appointed as will guarantee to  architects throughout the world that their designs will be considered by a thoroughly competent tribunal. I pass from that to a matter which, perhaps, will excite the interest of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell even a little more. </para>

                        <para>- I did. The one thing which prevailed with me was expert advice, but the advice which came from the other side was not presented in a sufficiently expert way to alter my views. I desire to say a few words about the Tariff. I am sure that it is extremely comforting to Protectionists like the honorable senators who have been born and bred and "nurtured on a Tariff to have this pathetic picture presented to them through the medium of this Speech - this picture of the Government with heads wrapped in towels consuming gallons of midnight oil seriously considering and carefully watching the Tariff. I want to know what terms my honorable friend would have employed if he had received the same assurance from any other Government? </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that, so far as this session is concerned, the honorable senator will get as much Tariff from this side as from his own. Here is the point I want to emphasize : That the previous Government made a proposal which, I believe, sooner or later, this country will adopt, and that was the appointment of a non-political body - call it what you like, Inter-State Commission or Board of Trade - which would have had delegated to it the duty of continually watching the operations of the Tariff, and free from all party bias or feeling would make periodic reports to Parliament as to how the Tariff was operating. </para>

                        <para>- That was another function of the Board. I am not dealing with that matter, but with the Tariff itself. Sooner or later, in my opinion, Australia will come to adopt that idea, whether in that exact form or not I do not know. Assuming that it is committed to the Protectionist principle, we certainly require some non-political body. The best course is to establish a non-political body, whose mission it will be to watch the operations of the Tariff, and free from' any party colouring to report to Parliament how it is working, leaving it to Parliament to make such alterations as it may see fit. I desire to know from the Minister whether there is any authority for the threat which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has uttered as to the repeal of the sugar duties. It seems to me that this Government can hardly be still considering the effect of the Tariff on industries when one member, certainly by no means the tail of the Government, can be uttering these threats in the press regarding the sugar duties. If it is the intention of the Government to disturb these duties, surely Parliament should be the first to have that intimation ? It ought not to be given .by any Minister through the columns of the press. One of the things which we have always safeguarded more carefully than anything else is the intention of the Government towards the Tariff. I say nothing at all as to the purpose for which the threat was made, though, to my mind, it was a most indecent thing to do. Here we had a member of the Government declaring in the press that so far as he was concerned he was out for the repeal of the sugar duties. </para>

                        <para>- If it is desirable, or is intended for any reason, to repeal the sugar duties, the Ministry ought to make a collective announcement on the subject. If that is their intention, Parliament is the place in which to make an announcement, and not the columns of the press. What would be said of a Minister who went round the country, and suddenly declared that he was going to put a duty on some article? That would be tantamount to defrauding the revenue. </para>

I understand that a big resumption has just been effected, or is in progress, in Western Australia, and I have no reason to believe that it is undesirable, but it seems to me that there should be a limit to the power of the Government to acquire properties without apparently any reference to Parliament. </para>

Are honorable senators prepared to approve of a system under which a departmental head - which we have the assurance too frequently means the permanent official - is to be at liberty to purchase big blocks throughout this country without the proposal first being submitted to Parliament? If honorable senators tell me that they believe such power should be intrusted to the heads of Departments, I recognise that I may as well cease talking on the subject. But I do not believe, that inwardly they hold that opinion. I believe they are just as keen as I am to insure that Parliament shall first be consulted. </para>

If the Government are at liberty to purchase £20,000 or £30,000 worth of land in Perth, there is nothing to prevent them purchasing ,£50,000 worth of property elsewhere. Now, if there is one thing more than another about which all Parliaments and parties have hitherto been exceedingly careful., it has been to see that in transactions of the kind I have indicated the fullest opportunity for publicity and parliamentary discussion was afforded. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. That "is the system which is always employed in New South Wales. There, a proposal is made to the owner of any particular property - I am speaking of voluntary resumptions - and an agreement is arrived at which is afterwards submitted to Parliament. I believe that the same procedure is adopted in regard to compulsory resumptions. At any rate, it is well that the Government should always free themselves from suspicion. If it be intended to carry out the spread-eagle proposition which has been outlined by the Minister of Home Affairs, I do seriously suggest that the Government should take some such step as I have indicated. I wish now to make a passing reference to the question of finance. Honorable senators will recollect that when twelve months ago that marvellous Budget was presented by the Treasurer in which the revenue and expenditure were made to balance to a penny - it was the first Budget to my knowledge that ever did so balance - it was pointed out by members of the Opposition that the Estimates had obviously been framed with a view to bringing about that result. That criticism has been amply justified. As was pointed out at the time, our revenue is now very much larger than the amount which was forecasted. But large as it is, we have still to recognise the fact which was emphasized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> yesterday, that very shortly we shall be brought face to face with the problem of borrowing. We cannot hope to construct the railway to Western Australia, still .less to carry on an energetic policy of development in the Northern Territory - and I trust that we are not going to play with that Territory - without incurring an expenditure which may amount to anything from ,£10,000,000 to £20,000,000. Holding that view, I was very pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> say that, while he was opposed to borrowing generally, he believed in borrowing for certain purposes. </para>

Then we were assured that all the questions which were embodied in the referenda were to be re-submitted to the people. We had the valiant assurance that whether the electors liked them or not the Government intended to push them through. </para>

But the electors practically said, in reply, " We do not believe you." That was the answer which they gave. They clearly understood that an effort was being made to divert their attention from the merits of the Government proposals, and by a majority of 21 per cent., they turned those proposals down. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friends opposite attempted to make it a class vote. Their efforts in that direction were so palpable that the people resented them, and by an overwhelming majority rejected the Government proposals. In referring to this matter, I wish to draw attention to the marked change which has come over the extremely aggressive attitude which the supporters of those proposals exhibited when they were first introduced to our notice. When it was urged that the questions embodied in the referenda should be submitted to the people separately, the suggestion was scornfully rejected by both branches of the Legislature. A little later, we had the marvellous statement from the Prime Minister that if the people did not accept them they would get something worse. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want such a declaration every month. But if it were competent for Ministers to make that declaration on the 28th April last, surely they are in a position to tell the Senate what they propose to do with these questions? I desire to draw particular attention to the peculiar wording cf the paragraph which I have quoted. It will be recollected that the referenda dealt with something more than mere trusts. It dealt with industrial legislation. Yet there is not a word about industrial legislation in the Vice-Regal Speech. But Ministers-  are very strongly of the opinion that the ever-increasing exactions of the Trusts make an extension of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth imperative. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the constitutional amendments. The referenda dealt mainly with two things, industrial matters and trusts. Now we are merely told that the Government are convinced that the enlargement of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth to enable it to effectively deal with trusts is imperative. It was not said after the referenda campaign that the Government intended to drop the proposed alterations of the Constitution dealing with industrial matters. But now we are told that all they have time for is the extension of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in regard to trusts. Are we to assume, then, that they have determined to drop their proposals with regard to industrial matters ? </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend did that on the 26th April, and he must have been astonished to find that the anarchistic weapon, as is so often the case, blew him up with his own explosives. The statement has been made here by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that the result was due to the smallness of the vote. It is just as well to clear up this position, and to see whether there is any reason for  that excuse. Let me tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> this. If the vote at the referendum had been as large as the vote on the 13th April of the previous year, the Government must still have been defeated. The actual figures were as follow : - In connexion with the Financial Agreement, about .1,300,000 electors- went to the poll. At the referendum on the proposed amendment of the Constitution, 1,156,000 went to the poll. That is to say, 148,000 fewer voters went to the poll as compared with the previous occasion. Now, if those 148,000 electors who abstained from voting had gone to the poll, and had all voted " Yes " to these proposals of the Government, they would still have been defeated. What is the good of pretending, therefore, that the smallness of the vote was responsible for the defeat of the policy of the Government? It requires no better illustration of the emptiness of that pretence than the fact that if every man and woman who voted on the 13th April of the previous year had voted at the last referendum, and if the whole of those who abstained from voting at the referendum had voted for the Government .proposals, they would nevertheless have been knocked out. </para>

If he means to say that the party to which I belong collects funds for campaign purposes, I simply say, " Of course it does." So does the party of honorable senators opposite. But we do not levy upon the salaries of members of Parliament. We do not compel them to put their hands in their pockets for campaign purposes. Every contribution received by our party is a voluntary one. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator means to sa.y that members of this Parliament are paid for their advocacy of any particular policy in the interests of trusts, I am entitled to ask him either to withdraw his statement or to prove it. It would be just as easy for me to say that he is corruptly paid for what he does politically. We cannot conduct political controversy on decent lines if these reckless accusations are to be hurled about the chamber. I quite understand, however, how the iron has entered into the souls of my honorable friends opposite when they resort to .accusations of this kind. I venture to say that there is no party in this country that would shrink so much from having its political funds examined into as the party to which my honorable friends opposite belong. </para>

The same smart practice of engaging all the available halls was resorted to recently in a bye-election in my own State by the Labour party. That was not reprehensible. But when, as alleged, the same thing was done in Tasmania, to the inconvenience of the Labour party, it was reprehensible. </para>

                        <para>- Any one who has done any electioneering is well aware that extra rates always have to be paid for electioneering notices, but if it is alleged that our party paid double rates to newspapers for political services, the statement is absolutely incorrect. What I suppose my honorable friend to mean is that my party paid higher rates than his own, but that simply means that in spite of their denunciation of sweating by others they themselves cut down rates every time. I come back to these figures concerning the referendum, and to the statement that the defeat of the Government policy was owing to the smallness of the vote. I have already pointed out that if every absent voter had voted for the Government propositions, they would nevertheless have been defeated. Let us take another view of the case. Upon the Financial Agreement, 1,300,000 voted. The majority against the proposal was only 2 per cent. We heard nothing then about the smallness of the vote. My honorable friends were delighted with their victory. There was no attempt on this side to ignore the fact that the proposal had been defeated, though it was only beaten by 2 per cent. Their own proposals at the last referendum, however, were beaten by 21 per cent. Are they not pitiful - these efforts which are made to ignore the effect of the verdict of the people, a verdict which, I venture to say, will require more than eloquence, more even that the arts of my honorable friends, to reverse it within any period that we care to forecast? As showing how emphatically the proposals of the Government were defeated, let me point out that there are seventy-five Federal electorates. At the time of the referendum, thirty of those electorates were represented by Liberal representatives, and forty-five by members of the Labour party. Of these electorates every one represented by  a  Liberal declared against the Government proposals, whilst of those represented by Labour members, seventeen voted " yes," and twenty-eight voted "no." In other words, fifty-eight electorates declared against the proposals, and only seventeen declared in favour of them. </para>

                        <para>- That is a serious reflection upon two sets of people. It is a serious reflection, in the first place, upon the electors to tell them that they did not understand the proposals that were made to them; and it is also a very serious reflection upon the members of the Labour party to say that they were unable to explain their own proposals. </para>

                        <para>- That is not correct. Every Saturday, in spite of his numerous other duties, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is able to expound the policy of the party in the newspaper to which I have referred ; and, what is more, I have seen in that newspaper, during the heat of the campaign, no less than two pronouncements by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on the same day in reply to one by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> one in the form of an interview, and the other in the form of a speech. What is the use of saying, therefore, that the party opposite is not able to make its voice heard in the newspapers ? They have been treated with exceptional liberality. The newspapers which oppose them have treated them with a generosity which the Labour papers have never extended to us. </para>

                        <para>- Misrepresentation ! Why, when the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> commences to speak even respectfully of a political opponent, I shall be prepared to recant what I have said on this subject. But I have never seen a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> that has even been decently respectful towards an opponent. Only the other day I saw in its columns a reference to one of the most brilliant members of the Liberal party - a man who is not a member of the Senate - who was described as a " blitherer." This is the type of "literature" which is regarded as being fair to opponents by a Labour journal. </para>

I wish, However,, to come back to the reasons why the proposals of the Government were beaten. It is said, that the people did not understand them. 1 think the reason was because the people did understand them. But if there is any truth in the statement that they were not understood, why was that? </para>

                        <para>- I am free to admit that,, while the honorable senator is present, there is ample opportunity here for a Sunday school teacher. I ought to apologize for these frequent interruptions. I wish to point out why there was some excuse for the people if they did not understand these proposals, though I think they did understand them. First of all, we have this statement made in Sydney at his great meeting there by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> He said, speaking of the Government - </para>

                <para class="block">That was a plain and easily understood statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went on to elaborate his argument.

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has correctly followed the quotations I gave, and still adheres to that statement, all I can say is that I must have a very feeble understanding of the ordinary meaning of English words. I will put it in another way. 'One man says. " I want what is on that table," and another says, " I want only what is not on that table." Those are clearly irreconcilable statements. We have the same thing in the quotations I have given. One Minister said, " We want what the States have not got," and the other said, " We want what the States have got," and yet I am told that there is no conflict between them. A large number of the electors thought there was a conflict between them, and decided that as the sponsors of these proposals could not themselves give a clear definition as to what they were, they could hardly do better than turn them down. Let me give another quotation. Honorable senators will, perhaps, recollect that after the proposals had been framed, the Government of New South Wales communicated with the Federal Government asking for a clearer definition of what was wanted. We might assume that as the Government of New South Wales was not composed of dullards, they were fairly competent to interpret the proposals for themselves. Still, they sought information from the fountainhead, and, as a result of their request, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the Attorney-General of the Federal Government, sent a memorandum, I believe to all the State Ministries, but certainly to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales. In that memorandum, there appeared this paragraph - </para>

                <para class="block">Naturally, the question follows, " If you do not contemplate any measures not covered by existing powers, why do you want additional powers? " I say that it was because of conflicting statements of this kind that a very large number of electors came to the conclusion that it was not desirable to accept these proposals, at any rate in the form submitted; and, therefore, whatever may have been their sympathies in ordinary politics, they voted very largely to assist in negativing the referendum proposals. </para>

                        <para>- I think they will lose a great deal more if they continue to keep my honorable friend where he is. I shall give another illustration. We had assurances from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and others that, as the Constitution now stands, the Commonwealth was impotent to deal with trusts, and, although we passed legislation, it was so much waste paper. I think I am fairly stating the declaration made from beginning to end of the campaign. The people of New South Wales were rather puzzled by that declaration, because, at the  very time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was declaring that there was no power under the Constitution to deal with trusts and combines, he was lavishly expending public money in prosecuting a combine. He was upon the horns of this dilemma : either there was at the time Dower under the Constitution to proceed against the combine, or he was guilty of a scandalous waste of public money in a mere game of bluff. Either there was upon the statute-book a law which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> considered sufficient for the purpose, or he would not have launched the prosecution against the Coal Vend. If he believed the Constitution to be defective with regard to trusts, and our present legislation insufficient, he was guilty of a scandalous waste of public money in launching that prosecution. </para>

This was the position at the time of starting the campaign : <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> as legal adviser of the Government, stood forth as the head and front of the case against the Coal Vend ; but only a little while before he had published this in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph -</inline></para>

                    <para>Bad as things are in the North (Newcastle), they would have been worse if cut-throat competition had continued. The miner is paid by the ton of coal hewed - we contend he is paid insufficiently - and the rate goes up and down with the declared selling price. The Vend fixes a price - that price controls the market, which is thus not subject to violent and erratic fluctuations. The miner knows exactly where lie is, and consumers are able to make contracts and arrangements with something like assurance of a fixity of price. </para>

In the circumstances, it was reasonable for the electors to ask themselves : "Is there any sincerity in this? Why is it that always on the eve of an election, when votes are wanted, we have this talk of trusts, and the moment the votes are cast our representatives in Parliament are found to be the stoutest champions of trusts and combines wherever they exist ?

                        <para>- Yes, but the facts are very different from those which were promised. They can no longer claim that theirs is a party which stands for principle- Principles, as I shall show directly, are torn up when it does not suit the convenience of its members. They can no longer pretend that their platform is so plain and simple that he who runs may read, because there have already been two crises brought about by the inability of the rank and file to determine what it does mean. They no longer live by denouncing those whose painful duty it is to uphold law and order when the necessity arises. We know that at the last general election in New South Wales the cry was " The Coercion Act." We know that at the Federal election the echo of that cry was heard and largely influenced the minds of people. What has become of the Act? Although its repeal was promised it is still on the statute-book and a Labour Government is carrying out its penal provisions. Had any but a Labour Government been in office we should have expected to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> - or somebody else on the other side - rising here as he did on one occasion and protesting vigorously against the sending of police to Lithgow. I would remind my honorable friend that he questioned a previous Government about the despatch of soldiers to Broken Hill. For fear that I might do him an injustice I shall quote his actual words - </para>

                <para>I  also desire to ask whether the Government have any opinion as to whether it is not a violation of the Court for any State to keep armed forces for intimidation or any other purpose.  If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> held those views then and the question was not asked for the mere purpose of vote-catching outside, let me ask him whether in his official position he is prepared to make a protest to the State Government against the action which they have taken? </para>

                        <para>- Apparently, when the police are sent by one Government they are sent to provoke trouble, and when sent by another Government the object is to ease out the trouble. My honorable friend virtually says, " Let the horse out of the stable and then lock the door." If there is trouble why has not the Coercion Act been repealed? Surely the Labour Government have had time enough to do that? They declared at the general election that if returned it would be wiped off the statute-book within twenty-four hours, but it is still there, and the members who denounced it so bitterly are enforcing its provisions to-day. It is no.t long since there was a strike on a railway being constructed by day labour from Moree to Mungindi. What happened when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffith,</inline> the Minister for Works, came to deal with the strike? He bought a plant and sent up a number of men to break the strike. That was the action of a Labour Minister. Before taking that step, however, he offered the strikers the provisions of the Coercion Act as a means of settling the dispute. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend does not see the point, surely. If these things were wrong when done by a Liberal Government, they cannot be right when done by a Labour Government. We know that whenever they have been done by a non-Labour Government Labourites have bitterly denounced them, and attacked the Government for doing them. Let me point out another effect which has arisen from the fact that my honorable friends have been successful in the political arena. Hitherto it has been claimed that their programme was so simple that any person who could read could immediately grasp its meaning. Yet we have had, first with regard to the Financial Agreement, the party almost torn asunder in its effort to interpret what the Brisbane Conference determined. More recently in New South Wales a crisis has been brought about. Why? Because the Ministry of the day - that is, the parliamentary party, were not able to decide what was meant by the plank relating <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the nationalization of land. </para>

                        <para>- The point of the reference to the land policy was simply to show that the claim that the programme was so plain and so simple that he who runs may read can no longer stand, because the party itself is split in its efforts to interpret its meaning. I want to deal with another subject raised by this Speech, and that is the question of immigration. Here, again, we see a considerable difference in the attitude of the Labour party since it has taken office, as compared with that which it manifested when in Opposition. We have first of all the very interesting statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> in a public utterance on his native heath. He had been entertained by the Ayrshire Miners' Union, and he was speaking not merely to agricultural labourers, but to miners. He then appealed to those contemplating emigration to turn their attention to Australia. Almost on the same occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen,</inline> the Labour Premier in my State, said, in a press interview, that he was surprised that more people did not go to Australia, where there were opportunities of sunshine and comfort which did not exist in the older civilizations. I want also to quote a few utterances from some prominent Labourites, to show how different they are from those they delivered but a few months ago. I turn again to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffith,</inline> who, referring to the Newcastle men, many of whom are out of work because of the slackness of. the times there, said to a press interviewer : - </para>

                    <para>There is not a district in New South Wales to-day, except Newcastle, where the single man willing to work cannot get regular work and good wages. It is the married men or men with family obligations in whose interest I am taking all the trouble. I told them at Newcastle, and I reiterate it now, that there are 1,000 miners in the Newcastle and Maitland districts out of work, and if for that thousand permanent work can be found in other parts of the State it will be better for them and better for Newcastle. As long as there is a surplus of miners hanging round the mine proprietors have always got the big end of the stick. </para>

                </para>
                <para>I am not much concerned about that, said the Minister. All the new chums I have met have far too much sense than to refuse regular work at good wages and sit down beside a mine that works two days in a fortnight. The new chums go out where work is available, and men are wanted, and the surplus worker of Newcastle will have to do the same. </para>

Here is one in connexion with the sugar workers' strike. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> D.

But he knows perfectly well that I can, if I wish, put on the business-paper a question relating to it, which, I assume, would receive an accurate reply. At present, however, it is optional for him, if he is in possession of the information I seek, either to give it or withhold it.

He pointed out that the area which would be seriously affected by the impost would be insignificant. It was only  a  few estates, he affirmed, which would be seriously penalized by it. The result proves that he was correct. </para>

But the case that the honorable senator cited confirms what I have said, namely, that the tax has not lowered values. The fact remains that today, whatever else may be the case, the land tax has not had the effect of securing cheaper land for the people. </para>

                        <para>- A land tax could only have the effect of bringing down land values at the time of its imposition. There is no possible means by which you can secure " cheap" land to the ultimate user of it, unless in some country that is fast going to pieces. You may pass any legislation you like ; you may even take land and give it to people for nothing ; but that land' will not be cheap to the man who has to use it ultimately. You may give a block of land to a man to-day, but when he sells it he does not give it away for nothing because he got it for nothing. </para>

                        <para>- There is not. There never was a time in New South Wales when you could not purchase land if you were prepared to pay the market price, for if. The market price previously was declared to be speculative, but, nevertheless, prices to-day are higher than they have ever been, and I venture to predict that they will continue to be high. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> says, land values are going, up. No matter what the cause may be, prices are rising. Therefore the fact remains that, the imposition of this tax has- not fulfilled its purpose, and that the prediction of those who said that it would secure cheap land to the people has been falsified. I venture to add that promises of cheap land for the people always must be falsified. </para>

                        <para>- I claim to have as intimate, a knowledge of matters, concerning the land in New South Wales as any one in this Chamber, and I say now that, whilst probably there may be a few estates which, for sentimental and family reasons, have been held up in the way suggested, I do not believe that there is any considerable number of them ; and, what is, more, I say that, irrespective of the operation of the land tax, I do not believe that any great number of those estates which are now being subdivided were seriously affected by the tax at all. What has brought about subdivision has not been the Federal land tax ; it has been the recognition of the fact that good seasons have widened the area devoted to agriculture. The consequence has been that agricultural prices have been offered and paid for land that has hitherto been dealt with on a pastoral basis. The result is that prices have gone up ; and the promise that the land tax would have the effect of securing, land cheap and abundant for the people has been falsified, as such a promise always must be falsified. </para>

                        <para>- We were always told that the price of land in. this country was above the true productive value. The answer to that is that, in spite of the land tax, land is being, sold to-day at higher prices than it ever was before. There can be: no speculative values affecting those prices. There is, I repeat,, no means by which you can secure to the ultimate user of land, cheap land.; and by cheap land I mean land at a price lower than it will command in the open, market. Let me demonstrate this point clearly, because to me, as to my honorable friends opposite, the land question is. always full of interest. Some of the State Governments are endeavouring to give cheap- land to" the people. In Western Australia, land has- been given for nothing. In New South Wales, land has been supplied to settlers at a price considerably below what it would command in the open market. What is the effect? Will the ultimate user obtain cheap land? Not a bit of it. A man having got his cheap land from the Crown, and having worked it for a few years, will, when it passes from his hands to some one else, take care that he does not sell it cheap. He will demand the full market value for it. </para>

                        <para>- It may be. I have never, as my honorable friend Is aware, contended that the demands of the leasehold advocates are not entitled to serious consideration, although I do not pretend to be an advocate of them. Suppose that a man pays the Crown  £25  a year for land which is really worth  £100  a year. When he sells that land, he does not sell it for <inline font-style="italic">£2$.</inline> He sells for a sum which represents  £75  capitalized. The result is that the man who buys is no better off than he would have been if he bought his land at auction. The ultimate user of the land is no better off, whilst the Government is much worse off. </para>

                        <para>- Neither the land tax nor any other device will secure cheap land to those who have ultimately to work it. Leaving that point, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence to one or two matters connected with his Department. I am spurred to do so by a paragraph in the Governor-General's Speech which refers to the fact that the compulsory training of cadets has been successfully inaugurated. As far as the boys themselves are concerned, I think we may indorse that statement, except that a little friction has occurred in isolated cases. On the whole, it may be said that young Australia has responded with good feeling and all readiness to the call made by the Commonwealth. But when the Government say that the system has been successfully inaugurated, I am entitled to point out that that term cannot be applied to cases in which boys have actually fainted on parade in consequence of the scanty, insufficient, and unwholesome conditions under which they were being trained. </para>

                        <para>- In a case that has come under my notice, at Mittagong, four boys fainted at one' parade. When such a thing can occur, there must surely be something wrong. Further than that, some of us have seen statements in the newspapers from parents who have made bitter complaints about the unsatisfactory accommodation provided for these boys when they went up for medical examination. ' I was told of one place where boys were examined, and must say at once that I do not believe that the Minister himself would come to any other conclusion than that it was not creditable to the Defence Forces of Australia, and not likely to create a favorable impression in the minds of the boys, that such conditions should prevail; whilst, at the same time, it was not fair to the officer responsible to the Government that he should be expected to carry out his important duties under such circumstances. The Minister, I am sure, must have had instances of the kind brought under his notice. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking solely of that. The Minister must be aware of these claims, because in a statement he made to the press, he complained that halls in various places belonging to the parents of the lads were not made available to the Defence Department, although the Department, in the excess of its generosity, offered to clean the halls afterwards. Is the Defence Department to loaf for its accommodation? In most communities where halls have been erected for any purpose, the residents have contributed to the cost as shareholders, and it is expected that by the income earned, the buildings will pay for themselves. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I do not mean to say that they must attend to the whole of the actual work. But, if I understand the nature of the work thrown upon them, it represents continuous occupation for the officers appointed. The effect of the payment of £150 per year has been, what I suppose was intended, that the officers appointed, give only their spare time to the work. In the more important areas, and certainly in the more scattered ones, where travelling is a great feature, the work is sufficient for the constant occupation of any man. If that be so, a salary of ;£r5° a Year &gt;s quite inadequate for the position. I suggest to the Minister that the whole success of the scheme is dependent upon the proper administration of these areas. </para>

                        <para>- I must differ from my honorable friend on the point. I went round with one area officer, and though, perhaps, his work may have been a little heavy at the launching of the scheme, I came to the conclusion that these areas cannot be effectively administered in the spare moments of the area officers. To ask men who have to do their ordinary business during the day, and, not unfrequently, as is the case with most of us, have some work to do in the evenings, to accept the responsibility of administering an area in their spare time, seems to me, I will not say to invite failure, but to militate against the success of the scheme. It might even be desirable to reduce the number of areas, and have permanently paid officials in charge of the work, so that we may have men devoting the whole of their time to it as a means of livelihood. We should then be much more likely to have the work done effectively than we shall be if it is left to men who have to depend upon other things for their livelihood, and must give the greater portion of their time to their private concerns. There is a matter connected with the Postal Department upon which I wish to touch. I am not going to refer to the continued chaos which exists in that Department further than to say that it is one of the things which the party opposite talked loudly about remedying, before they came into office. They said that they would put it all right in a very short space of time once the electors placed them in a position to do so. But we have had the admission from the other side that the state of affairs is now as bad as it ever has been. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator says that in a palliative sort of way, but he made the statement that since the advent of the Labour Government- there had been nearly a strike in the Department in South Australia. We did not get near to a strike under the previous Ministry. It took a Labour Government to do that. I wish to refer to another matter, and I will ask my honorable friends opposite to say whether the statement I am about to make is correct. I am informed that the company which was given a licence to establish wireless telegraphy at the Hotel Australia did so, and started its business on a certain tariff, and that the Government then came along and insisted upon the company raising the tariff and charging more for the work, it was doing for the public than it was content to receive. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Government compelled this company, known, I think, as " Wireless Limited," to raise its tariff. We had a long debate last session on the system of wireless telegraphy to be adopted for Government stations. This company obtained a licence to establish a station of its own for the transmission of private business until such time as a Government station was erected'. The company issued its tariff, commenced to do business, and then the Government came along and insisted upon it increasing its tariff by 50 per cent. The position is anomalous, and I think indefensible. If the company was prepared, and it is said that it was, to do business for 4d. per word, it is little short of an iniquity that the Government should compel it to charge 6d. per word. The reason given throws a little light upon the advantages of private enterprise as against State enterprise. It was just this : that by-and-bye when the Government station was at work, it would have to charge higher rates. The Government could not stand a private company working at a lower rate before the Government station was in operation. It was thought possibly that some odium would attach to the Government if they came along later and raised the rates. </para>

                        <para>- No; that is the explanation given by the Department. The Minister representing the Postmaster-General can correct me if the statement is not correct. The statement is made from an extract from an official letter to the company from the Government, laying down the rate to be charged at 6d. per word, whereas the original tariff issued by the company was 4d.. per word. Before the debate closes, the Minister can say whether I am correct in this statement. Let me point out again that this trouble arises not through the Postal Department, but from the tendency of the Defence Department to loaf upon other Departments. The reason the Government would have to charge higher rates at the public station is that to meet Defence Department requirements it will be a high-power station, whereas for ordinary commercial messages, such as those sent by the Wireless Limited, a low-power station is sufficient. A high-power station will, of course, cost more to erect, and the Government must charge a higher tariff in order to make it profitable. We must have a high-power station, not for commercial purposes, but to meet Defence Department requirements, and the whole of the commercial community of Australia is to be penalized because our defence service requires the establishment of a high-power station. </para>

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to show that it is because of the requirements of the Defence Department, and the loafing, as I call it, of that Department upon other Departments of the service, that we are likely largely to restrict the use of wireless telegraphy. It is world-wide experience that the lower a tariff in postal and telegraphic matters, the greater the volume of business. Messages will be sent for 4d. per word which would not be sent if the charge were 6d. per word. It is unreasonable that those engaged in the commerce of the country who desire to make use of wireless telegraphy should be handicapped to such an extent because of the requirements of the Defence Department. We should not permit the Defence Department to loaf - and I can find no other word for what is done - upon the Postal Department. Even if it will be necessary when the Government station is completed for the Government to charge this higher tariff, why should not the commercial community in the meantime be given the benefit of the lower rates which the private company is prepared to charge? What justification is there for penalizing the commercial public at the present time? It will be some months before the public station is established, and why should we in the meantime deprive commercial people of the advantage of the cheap tariff the private company offers? A great deal is said about the desire of the present Government to cut down prices, and to see that the consumer and the general community are fairly treated, but here we have a case of a private company - for which my attitude in the debate last session indicates that I .have no possible regard - prepared to do business upon a reasonable tariff, and the Government, merely because they fear there may be some protest against the higher charges which they would have to make, in virture of their monopoly, compelling the company against its desire, and against the interest of the users, to raise its tariff by 50 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The action is on the same lines, but I have not heard such a specific charge against the Sugar Company as I now make against the Government. Let me refer now to another little matter. During the recess the Government appointed an accountant for the Commonwealth Military College. I should like to know how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Binnie</inline> came to be appointed. I do not know anything about the position or what it is worth. All I know is that a gentleman was appointed to the position without anybody else having an opportunity to apply for appointment. The particulars of the case are, perhaps, best given in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> when he was interviewed by the press on the subject. </para>

                <para>General Bridges thought it necessary that there should be an accountant, and the matter had been one of urgency. If an advertisement had been called for a  position  of this kind there would have been about 1,000 applicants, and the examination of their credentials would have taken a very long time. Private negotiations had been entered into with half a dozen men who were applicants for the position. </para>
                <para>How did they know of the position? " Oh," replied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> " it got about through some one recommending this man, and some one else recommending that man. It was on General Bridges' recommendation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Binnie</inline> was appointed." </para>
                <para>Was his application supported by a particular Federal member? " I do not think there is any letter from a Federal member. The appointment is only on probation." </para>
                <para>But does not that mean permanency? " Yes, if he proves suitable during his six months' probation." </para>

We were supposed to have this Act which was to prevent Ministers conferring positions on favourites or obliging friends by placing relatives in positions. Here we have the Acting Minister for Defence apparently going outside the Act and making an appointment. What is the excuse given? The reason given is that there would have been a thousand applications if called for, and that only six persons were given the opportunity of applying for the position. </para>

The fact that there would have been a thousand  applicants only shows that 994 persons have been unjustly treated in being denied the right to apply for a Government position. The Ministry should have some better excuse than that published by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> They may have, for all I know to the contrary, but unless they have I venture to say that their action is not one which will commend itself to the Senate, lt is not one which we can quietly allow to take root and develop. I have occupied the time of honorable senators very much longer than I had intended, but for that I am sure they will largely accept the responsibility by reason of their interjections.

I ask the Minister to remember that rarely has there been a session when we have not been, as it were, marking time, when we have not been working half shifts. I feel perfectly certain that the desire of honorable senators is either to be at work or to be free from the necessity of attending here. </para>

When there is work to be done I believe that a majority of honorable senators are prepared to attend to carry it through, but we ought not to be brought here merely to, as it were, trifle with the work. I know that there is a sort of general feeling that we ought not to close the Senate for fear of creating a wrong impression outside. If we, being the smaller body, can get through with our work in less time than can the other House, there is no sound sense in keeping us here one moment longer than is necessary. </para>

                        <para>- It is desirable that the Ministry, as far as the exigencies of public business will allow, should give us work to keep us constantly employed ; and when there does come a gap or a lull, to recognise the fact and adjourn the Senate for a period instead of bringing us over for a half-day's work a week. I feel sure that in their hearts Ministers quite agree with me. A liberal supply of Bills has been foreshadowed, and I look to Ministers to see that a fair number of the more important measures is introduced here. With regard to some matters there is a difficulty arising out of the Constitution, but this list contains a sufficient number of measures of first class importance, which could be introduced here just as well as in the other House. If Ministers will take that course they will equalize the time which will be required by both branches, and will, I think, find themselves not so jammed towards the end of the session. </para>

                        <para>- I think that on this occasion the honorable senator has hardly done himself justice in regard to some of the subjects which he dealt with. At the outset, for instance, he brought up the question of the expenses of the delegates to the Imperial Conference. Now, comparisons are always odious, but, notwithstanding that fact, the honorable senator took it upon himself to make comparisons between those who attended the recent Conference and those who attended previous ones. He, therefore, placed me in this position, that in order to do away with the impression which he has endeavoured to  create, I, teo, have to draw comparisons. I do not know where the honorable senator got his information as to the expenses of Ministers, because I do not think that a return has yet been tabled; it can be produced whenever it is asked for. I presume that he has gone by what he has read in the press. Let me point out that on this recent occasion Ministers were sent to a Conference at a time just preceding the Coronation of  His  Majesty the King. I feel sure that it would not be the wish of either the Senate or the country that the Ministers who were sent to that Conference should, immediately it was concluded, skedaddle from the country and return without waiting for the Coronation to take place. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator dealt with the matter in that way, and I intend to act similarly. On the recent occasion, the Conference lasted for a longer time than did any previous Conference, possibly because it dealt with a greater variety of subjects, some being of very great importance. That necessitated Ministers representing the Commonwealth in an official capacity remaining in England longer than our delegates at previous Conferences had to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> Barton, as Prime Minister of Australia, was our first representative to an Imperial Conference. He was voted on the Estimates the sum of ,£1,850, and no member of Parliament raised any question. Australians are not a mean nation, they believe that their representatives should be able to take up as good a position as the delegates from other countries. No cavil at the expenditure was made by the Opposition or by the Labour party, which was then the third party, or by the members of the Government party. Later we had a member of the Cabinet who was not the Prime Minister going to the Navigation Conference - one which dealt with one subject only, and was held when there was no Coronation, and when, consequently. expenses were not so high as they were on the recent occasion. That Minister was paid the sum of £750. Again, there was no protest or criticism of his action by any member of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted the expenses in corresponding cases. The honorable senator also referred to the parsimony of the present Government in not sending troops to the Coronation. I had some doubts as to our wisdom in not doing so until I saw the procession, and then they were absolutely dispelled. During the second day's procession I had the advantage of a seat in a stand which was occupied almost entirely by Colonials. Certainly Colonials should have been able to tell Colonial troops if anybody could. One could understand a Londoner or a man from Glasgow being unable to pick out New Zealanders, or Canadians, or Australians. As a matter of fact, there was only one body of troops in that procession which was identified by people sitting near me as Colonials, and these were guessed to be Australians as often as South Africans. There is a rooted idea in the minds of persons all over the world - and there is good ground for it - that the typical Colonial uniform is a khaki uniform with a hat turned up at the side; but, as a matter of fact, the Canadian happens to have two uniforms. They have the service uniform - that is a khaki uniform - but they have also a full-dress uniform which is an imitation of the English regiments' uniform. The New Zealand men originally had only a service uniform. But on the way to England the idea struck the commanding officer that it would be better to appear in something more showy than the ordinary service uniform, and accordingly he invented a uniform - certainly a most gorgeous one - with the result that people along the line of "route could not identify the New Zealand troops. They were associated with practically every British regiment, but scarcely anybody picked . them out as New Zealand troops. Of course, there were a few who said, " They do not look like Colonials, but they must be, because they are following the carriage containing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward and General Botha." There was nothing to indicate that they were Colonials, and certainly their uniforms more resembled those of British regiments than any Colonial uniform which I have seen. So that when it is urged that the value of the presence of an Australian contingent at this demonstration lay in the fact that it would have given a magnificent advertisement to Australia, my reply is that ten out of every twelve persons along the line of march_ if asked whether there were .any Australian troops in the procession would reply "Yes." When the South Africans went past, in five cases out of six they were mistaken for Australians. </para>

                        <para>- There was no public demonstration on that day. It has been said that it would have been a splendid advertisement for Australia to have had troops in London during the Coronation celebrations, and I am merely pointing out that if there was any value to be got out of such an advertisement we got it. I now propose to give the reasons why the Government did not send troops to London. The Ministry hold the view that if we are to represent Australia to the people of Great Britain as we think it ought to be represented, we do not wish to do so as if it were merely a military nation. It is not a military nation. If we desire to give to the people of Great Britain a true idea of what Australia is and what we wish it to be, it must have representation in some other form. To cultivate the idea in the minds of Britishers that an Australian is a soldier and nothing more- </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. But there is no harm in our differing from the other Dominions. The question is, Are we right? We think that we are. Another consideration which we had in view was that last year the defence expenditure jumped up about £1,000,000. It will go up considerably this year. Nobody can say that the Parliament or the Government of Australia are not doing their duty in regard to the question of defence. There are plenty of persons who say that we are doing too much. Certainly nobody can say that we are not doing a fair thing. I ask honorable senators to recollect that we are straining every nerve to provide ourselves with an adequate defence scheme, and that our one hindrance is the lack of money. If we had £40,000 to spare we could provide some of the drill halls which the Leader of the Opposition considers are so essential to the training of our youth. Seeing that we have not that money, would we have been justified in spending a similar amount in sending a body of troops to represent us in London? Does anybody doubt our loyalty to the Empire? </para>

So that, between 1903 and 1906, his views changed. </para>

                        <para>- I am not criticising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> for his change of views. Circumstances often alter a situation. I am merely justifying our claim to be the originators of the policy of creating an Australian Navy, on the ground that we were the only party which stood out for it in 4903. Now I come to the question of who originated the Naval Agreement, which, we claim in the Governor-General's Speech, embodies our policy. I have here the report of the Imperial Naval Conference of 1909 - which contains a report of the resolutions that were agreed to by that body - at which  Colonel Foxton,  the honorary member of the Fusion Government, represented the Commonwealth. I wish, also, to show what led up to that Conference, what proposals were put before it, where they originated, and how they came before it. The first tangible proposal contained in the document in question - the first tangible proposition of a workable character embodying proposals for an arrangement between the Admiralty and the Australian Government - is headed, " The Governor-General to the Secretary of State. Received 4.40 p.m., 15th April, 1909." It sets out a telegram which reads : - </para>

A cablegram from the Acting Governor of New Zealand reported that the Prime Minister expected to arrive in London on the 24th July, and suggested that the Conference should meet a few days later. But the memorandum to which I refer was drawn up and submitted by the British Admiralty on the 20th July. It states : - </para>

                        <para>Under certain conditions the establishment of local defence flotillas, consisting of torpedo craft and submarines, might be of assistance in time of war to the operations of the fleet, but such flotillas cannot co-operate on the high seas in the wider duties of protection of trade and preventing attacks from hostile cruisers and squadrons. The operations of destroyers and torpedo boats are necessarily limited to the waters near the coast or to a radius of action not far distant from  a  base, while there are great difficulties in manning such  a  force and keeping it always thoroughly efficient. A scheme limited to torpedo craft would not in itself, moreover, be  a  good means of gradually developing a self-contained fleet capable of both offence and defence. Unless a naval force - whatever its size - complies with this condition it can never take its proper place in the organization of an Imperial Navy distributed strategically over the whole area of British interests. </para>

                        <para>- I know that; and what did the Conference do? I have it here. The Conference adopted in principle exactly what was contained in the Fisher Government's telegram to the Admiralty as to a working arrangement, and they also adopted, almost exactly in the words submitted, what the Admiralty recommended as to the composition of the fleet unit. What, therefore, becomes of my honorable friend's claim that his Government originated this idea? I come back to what is stated in the Governor-General's Speech. It says nothing at all about ships. We make no claim on that ground.- We never claimed that, but only the working agreement, under which those ships were to be controlled; and I point out that that agreement is practically on all-fours with the telegram despatched by the Fisher Government on 10th April, 1909. If honorable senators compare the working agreement which we have brought back with us with the telegram despatched by the Fisher Government as to the mode in which those ships are to be controlled, and how we and the Admiralty are to work together, it will be found that they are identical in their  effect. So that the idea as to the nature of the ships originated with the Admiralty, whilst the working agreement originated with the Government which represents the party that has always stood out in Federal politics for an Australian Navy. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend raised that point in connexion with the Perth Post Office site. What has been done in that connexion is exactly similar to action taken by other Governments ever since Federation commenced. It is obvious that if a Government is going to make a purchase of land it would be foolish of them to put money for the purpose on the Estimates, and let all the world know about it. The result would be that when Parliament, two or three months later, passed the Estimates, the price of the land in question would go up enormously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has been talking this afternoon about increases in land values. I venture to say that we should witness a rise in land values that would eclipse all previous prices if we adopted the method of purchase recommended by him. </para>

                        <para>- What has been done by the present Government was done previously by the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was a member, and by every other Government. It is this : When it is considered to be necessary to obtain land for Federal purposes the Department of Home Affairs first of all satisfies itself as to the value of the land desired. Then that Department obtains the Treasurer's authority to take the initiatory steps towards purchase. That being done, the Department puts the Lands Acquisition Act into operation, and as soon as Parliament meets it is made acquainted with the proposal, and the money is obtained by a vote.. That is the process that is always followed in connexion with these transactions, and that is the only way in which we can conduct them. What happened in the present case was this : The State Government of Western Australia, which owns part of the General Post Office, Perth, notified the Federal Government that they required the whole building. Honorable senators are aware that the buildings occupied by the Federal Government have not yet been finally paid for. This building was partly a transferred property. It is, however, inadequate for the purpose for which it is used, and has been so for a long time. In order that we might, on meeting Parliament, have a definite proposition to bring forward, the Home Affairs Department made inquiries as to the price at which land could be acquired in Perth. They also made an arrangement by which we could obtain land that was considered suitable, and the <inline font-style="italic">Treasurer's</inline> sanction was secured. The necessary preliminary steps having been taken, Parliament will be asked in due course to approve of what has been done. I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> references to the referenda. Of course, he is entitled to crow over the result of the referenda. I do not begrudge him his opportunity of crowing. I venture to say that if the referenda had been initiated by honorable senators opposite, and we had won by the substantial numbers that they did, we should have crowed. It all depends, however, on what you are crowing about. What I look at is this : Have the people of Australia anything to crow about? Are they continuing to crow about the result ? I think that they are not. They are beginning to realize that they have something to learn about the matters on which they voted, and they wish now that they knew before what they have since learned. We have the people of Australia to-day paying £3 per ton more for their sugar, whilst this Parliament is absolutely helpless to deal with the question. We know, also, that in die State we Western Australians represent, the Meat Trust has been imitating its stronger brother, the Sugar Trust, in raising prices. There was a little rift in the lute over there a few days ago, when one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> supporters realized  the mistake that had been made at the referendum, and said so in public. The other evening, at Fremantle, Councillor Jones, who has always been against the Labour party, and never hesitated to say so, got up and asked the Mayor to call a public meeting to urge the State Government to deal with the Meat Trust. Councillor Jones said, " You told me at the referendum that there was no need for the Federal Government to have power to deal with this question of trusts, because the State Government could deal with it. We have been fooled, because we now find that the State Government will do nothing, and I wish we had given power to- the Federal Government. ' ' </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the people of Western Australia will be inclined to take the honorable senator's advice any more. What have we to crow about? That certain powers that were asked to be conferred upon this Parliament have been refused to us. Well, who is the gainer? Are the people of Australia any better off because those powers have been refused ? I do not think that can be contended. Nor do I believe that the people -of Australia now see the matter in that light. On the contrary, I think it can be easily demonstrated that the people are worse off, and will continue to be worse off, because it is a fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has stated, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> has also affirmed, that we were asking for powers which, whilst the States had them, could not be used except to a limited extent, whereas the Federal Government could have used them in such a way as to protect the people's interests effectively. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and another by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> as though the two conflicted. But do they? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said, "We only ask for power to do what the States cannot do." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> said,  We only ask for the same powers as the States possess." I say that both statements can easily be reconciled. That is to say, a State can possess the absolute power to deal with trusts - and that is what we were asking, for, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was right in saying we were only asking for the power which the State possesses - and, although it possessed that power, it could not follow a trust an inch beyond its own border. </para>

                        <para>- I give the honorable senator the benefit of that if he cares to claim it. I make the statement for the reason that people who know the merits of the question vote on them, whilst people who do not know the merits vote only on one side always. That is to say, they say to themselves, " We do not know what the effect of the proposals will be, but if we vote " No," we- shall keep things as they are. We will therefore vote ' No.' If we vote ' Yes,' we shall make an alteration, the effect of which we do not know. We know how things are now. If we vote ' No,' there will be ' no alteration, and we will therefore vote 'No.'" In this way, we  always get the votes of those who do not understand the question on the side of the " Noes," where they vote at all. I have on that account always held that the referendum has a conservative rather than a progressive tendency. I venture to say that when these questions are submitted again, as they will be- </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and I venture further to say that if they are defeated again, they will come on again. It has not been the history of the party who launched these questions that once it is defeated it drops out of the running. The whole history of this party has been one series of defeats, followed by the members of the party rising again with the same question until they have finally triumphed. Defeat is no new experience for this party, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> gleefully prophesies that, because the referenda went against our proposals, there is a swing of the pendulum, and public opinion in Australia is now not merely against those proposals, but against the principles advocated by this party, he strikes no terror into any heart on this side of the chamber. We are used to such experiences. We never asked to be placed in a position on the Treasury benches until we had a majority of the people at our back. We have always been the party who demanded one man, one vote, and one vote, one value. We never asked that we should be placed in power to pass certain measures, because a section of the people in a property-elected House voted in a particular way, as has been done on the other side. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that all his dismal prophesies as to what is going to happen in the future will not distress us in the least. .We shall go on as we have done in the past, and as the Governor-General's Speech shows we are prepared to do in the future, bringing forward measures to give effect to the policy on which we were elected. We have put a progressive policy before the people. If it is not accepted to-day, or this year, we shall continue as a party to advocate it until it is accepted, and then no doubt we shall have our honorable friends on the other side claiming it as their policy. </para>

                        <para>- In dealing with die voting upon referenda, we have to remember that we get on the side of the " Noes " the votes, not only of those who, because they do not understand the question, vote against any <inline font-style="italic">change, but also of those who</inline> have been misled on the question. I venture to say that a considerable proportion of the "No" vote in the last referenda was cast by those who were misled. One of the most energetic party organizations in the referenda campaign was established in Victoria under the title of " The People's Party." It is to be noted that these Tory organizations always adopt the most democratic title they can find. I suppose that the organization which flourished under the name of " The People's Party," in common with many others, of the same type, had a common origin in Flinders-street, which appears to be most prolific in the production pf Tory political organizations. This People's party was evidently made the channel through " which those who contributed money to bring about the defeat of the legislation against trusts decided to spend it. It was most energetic in the distribution of leaflets throughout the country. It flooded the country with red, black, and white literature on the subject of the referenda. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, because by the time an election is over the old name has become so discreditable that they must get a new one or render themselves liable under the Vagrancy Act as suspicious characters. Let us look at the first proposition put to the farmers of Victoria, and, I suppose, of Australia generally. They were counselled to vote " No " in order to retain their local independence in State - and that was arguable, of course - and in municipal affairs. I say that no one by the wildest stretch of imagination could contend that any one of the proposals would interfere with municipal government or municipal independence in the slightest degree. </para>

                <para class="block">Whether any member of the party in Australia is in favour of export duties or not, I ask, What on earth had the referenda to do with the imposition of export duties on primary products ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and every honorable senator opposite must know that if the Government pleased they could today introduce a Bill to impose export duties on primary products, and if every question put to the people at the referenda had been carried, we should not have had a single tittle of power more than we have at present to deal with that question. The People's party tried to make the farmers believe that the referenda proposals were intended to give the Labour party the power, and that they had the intention to impose export duties on primary products. No one with any sense of honour will refuse to admit that that is a direct misrepresentation, or that any person who was induced to vote " No " because of that second reason was misled. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say anything of the kind. The members of the Ministry may be sympathetic with silver coinage for all I know. I am not their father confessor, but I do know that the question referred to has not been placed upon the Labour platform, and that neither this nor any other Labour Government has ever made a proposal to that effect. Even though every member of the Ministry and of the party believed in an export duty on primary products, it would have nothing to do with the question. It would be like "the flowers that bloom in the spring." The question was whether we were seeking these powers in order to impose export duties on primary products, and the only answer that could be given to that was " No." We had the power to do so, if we chose, before the referendum. </para>

If this Parliament has the power - and the High Court says it has - to confiscate a portion of the economic rent of land, it has the power - and had it before the referenda were taken - to confiscate the whole economic rent of land. This Parliament had, therefore, before the referenda, the power to nationalize land. </para>

                        <para>- Confiscation, taxation, or purchase are only means to an end. The matter referred to in this leaflet is the nationalization of land, and an appeal is made to the farmer to vote " No," because, if he votes " Yes," and assists to carry the referenda proposals, he will be supplying this Parliament with an instrument by which it can nationalize land. In that sense it is an absolute fabrication ; it is untrue in fact. The three statements, with the exception of that part of the first one which refers to State independence - and that is arguable - are simple lies. This is only a sample of the literature - no doubt bounty-fed literature - with which the Commonwealth was flooded, and under these pretences farmers in thousands no doubt voted "No," believing that they were preventing the Federal Parliament from interfering with municipal affairs, from imposing export duties on primary products, and nationalizing the land ; whereas the fact is that their " no" vote or their " yes " vote could not affect in the slightest iota any one of those three questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

Whenever we have lived for a time with a family in a district, and find it desirable to go elsewhere, we always retain a distant interest in the people upon whom we have turned our back. In the days which are gone <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had some little association with the Labour party, and therefore he naturally feels an interest in the small family troubles which occur from time to time therein. As regards his attempt to show the country that there has been any serious discord or any want of solidarity in our party, I want to tell the people whom he has been addressing, and whom I also hope to reach, that the Financial Agreement was a question which concerned the Federal Labour party. The interpretation of that plank lay with this party, and with no State Labour party. The Federal Labour party interpreted that platform, and I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to name one single Labour candidate throughout Australia who did not support the Financial Agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Can the honorable senator claim the same cohesion for his party? Certainly in New South Wales there were State politicians who disagreed with the interpretation which the Federal Labour party put on that plank, but they were in the position of the ordinary man in the ranks. The power to interpret that platform had been placed with the Federal Labour party, and not with any State Labour party in Australia. In the same way the power of interpreting the State platform has been reposed in the State Labour party, and we have no more right to interfere than has an ordinary man in the organization. </para>

                        <para>- I come to the honorable senator's criticism of our attitude on immigration. There was a time when the Labour party was hostile to immigration. We were perfectly honest about our attitude. We said that under the conditions existing up to the time the Labour party got into power immigration had simply been a policy to bring in cheap labour, lt was a policy which on the one hand locked up the lands of Australia, and therefore prevented the access of labour thereto, and which on the other hand would flood the country with labour in an overstocked labour market, and thereby bring about a decrease in wages and worse labour conditions. We always said, whether in the Federal or the State Labour party, that if we had the power to deal with the land question, and could apply our remedy, in our opinion there was room in Australia for millions of white people. When we obtained the power we did place on the statute-book a measure to open up the lands of Australia, and we are proud to say - and we have made the statement in the opening Speech - that it is having that effect. It is doing more than that, for it is the best immigration agent which Australia has had for many a long year, as is shown by the immigration returns. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> spoke of cheap land for the farmers of Australia. Which party stands for cheap land for the farmers? Is it the party with which the honorable senator is now associated? It is notorious that that party, whether in the State or the Federal sphere, has always been the one which has been prepared to give land in huge blocks to big corporations, and which has never taken any step to give the land to the people who wanted to use it. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely correct. It is the Labour party throughout the States and in the Federation which has been fighting always for land for the man who wanted to use it. Our endeavour has always been to burst up the big estates which prevented farmers from getting areas, and no better weapon to that end has ever been forged than the progressive land tax which was passed last session. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Government in South Australia is also making land available. One of the planks on which the Labour party in Western Australia is fighting the elections is " cheaper land for the people." Its contention is that for some time the Government has been raising the price of land to the genuine settler, and has inaugurated a policy which I referred to a little while ago, and by which certain men are able to get huge blocks to the detriment of the genuine settler. We did not say in the opening Speech that land was cheaper; what we said was that land was available. There is all the difference in the world between land being cheap and not available and land being dear and yet available. That is the position to-day. As soon as the land tax was brought into effect in Tasmania, the Van Diemen's Land Company - one of the biggest land monopolies in these States - saw fit to change the policy of half a century, and its property has been purchased by a company with the deliberate intention of being cut' up and sold in small estates. The Western Australian Midland Railway Company - a twin brother of the- other company - is taking energetic steps to dispose of a large quantity of its land, lt is providing homes, fencing, and clearing, and bringing immigrants from England in order to get its land on the market and avoid the land tax. You cannot pick up the newspapers of any State without noticing that estate after estate is coming into the market which has been locked up for half a century and more. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria only a few years ago the tenant farmers on a neighbouring estate waited on the owner of an estate situated at a little distance from Ballarat, and asked him to subdivide it and sell, but he point-blank refused. Within six months of the land tax coming into effect this estate was put on the market. These are only isolated instances; they can be multiplied.

                        <para>- I am going to ask Senators Millen and Vardon to have a little colloquy, because their remarks are mutually destructive. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, the land tax is not having the effect of breaking up big estates, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> must be wrong, because the latter said that our policy was one of confiscation and robbery. Now, if estates are not being broken up, there is no confiscation, and, therefore, no robbery, because the estates are still in the hands of the original owners. Before my honorable friends get up here and make these wild and whirling charges, they should confabulate outside, and come to a common agreement as to which horse they are going to whip. I come to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement on the floor of the " Chamber. In answer to interjections from this side, and Somewhat heatedly, evidently without weighing what he had been saying, -and after he had been arguing for a quarter of an hour to prove that land was not available, he said that men are selling land more freely to-day, and at a better price, than they ever did. That is what we said would be the_ effect pf the land tax. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; we said that one result would be that the land tax would bring so much fertile land into use that, whilst one tendency might be to lower <inline font-style="italic">the:</inline> values, die increased prosperity brought about by the increased settlement would tend to bring values back to their original level. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statement shows that that is exactly what is being done.  1  now come to the question of the defence scheme. My honorable friend mentioned - and I recognise that he spoke in no captious spirit - that at the inauguration of that scheme some of the boys felt the arduous nature of the task given to them, and that there were some cases of boys fainting. That is by no means peculiar to this particular scheme, because I can remember a case which occurred under the old cadet system where, on one parade, not fewer than eighteen boys fainted on a hot summer's day. That arose, not from a particular scheme, but from an over zealous or foolish officer giving lads too severe a drill under inclement conditions. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the case. We are having an investigation of the methods under which the medical examination was conducted, and the low percentage would seem to suggest that, perhaps, a more rigid one should be carried out. I regret, as anybody must regret, the instances which have occurred. But I attribute them to the fact that the majority of the area officers and the noncommissioned officers who were detailed were young. They were naturally eager to get to work, and do the best they could. I attribute what has happened rather to over-zeal than to any intent on their part to do an injury to the lads. </para>

                        <para>- I think that they have been over zealous, giving too much drill, and the lads, not being used to drill, have felt the exercise rather much. Some time ago when the Vice-President of the Executive Council was acting for me, an instruction was issued that these officers were to use a little more discretion, that they were not to make the drill so arduous, and that they were to fit it to the physical capabilities of the lads. That is now being done, with the result that we hear no complaints. I ha%'e no knowledge of any want of accommodation for the carrying out of the medical inspection, but I am aware that there is a lack of accommodation for drill purposes. It is easy to see how that arises. To-night, we have some 80,000 or 90,000 lads drilling in various parts of Australia. Twelve months ago scarcely any of them were undergoing drill, and surely we cannot expect that in one short year adequate accommodation can be provided to that extent. If we were to provide halls for the whole of the cadet force, it would cost us upwards of £1,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- When we come to rent premises, we have to pay a pretty stiff rent, and in most cases it would pay us better to erect a hall of our own than to rent one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to our " loafing " upon somebody. Let us look at this question. Throughout the Commonwealth, the various municipalities, roads boards, and district councils - bodies of taxpayers - have erected halls. Anybody who goes through our country districts will see these halls in darkness upon five nights out of seven. Very often there are offices in them, which are occupied only during the daytime. These buildings are the property of the people - of the very taxpayers who would have to build drill halls if we decided to erect them. They are the same people, I repeat, and it is nonsensical that we should spend public moneys in erecting drill halls in townships where there already exist halls, which are unoccupied when we might be using them. We have made an appeal through the State Governments to the various authorities I have mentioned, and I am glad to say a very large number of them have responded to that appeal. We have told them that we are willing to pay for any damage which may be done by the cadets, and that we are also prepared to pay for the lighting. All we ask is that, wherever accommodation exists, the people who own that accommodation should make it available to themselves. </para>

                        <para>- We do not expect to get halls of that description placed at our disposal. The local authorities would not lend them to us, for the simple reason that the drills would spoil the floor. But in nearly all these halls there are rooms in which we could store equipment, and where the area officer could do his work. Generally, too, there is a show ground where the lads could drill upon an earthen floor. I am glad to say that the people are bringing pressure to bear upon these various bodies to induce them to grant us the necessary accommodation. As time goes on, we will provide all the accommodation that is required, if Parliament will vote the money. But the thing must be done gradually. Coming to the question of the area officers, I am sorry that the Leader- of the Opposition has such a very short memory. If he had only cast his mind back to the time when he introduced the Defence Bill, and to Lord Kitchener's report, which was made afterwards, he would have remembered that one of the questions which Lord Kitchener specially stressed was that each area should eventually be placed under the charge of a graduate from the Military College. Dealing with the transitional period through which we are now passing, that distinguished officer went so far as to say - </para>

                        <para>- Three years from the end of the present year the cadets who entered last year will come from the Military College. They will then go for a year's training either to India or England, and upon their return they will' be sent out to the different areas. From that time there will be a gradual flow from the College into those areas. Consequently, what we had to do was to appoint the best men in Australia to these areas to carry on for the time being. If we had taken these men from their civil avocations and turned them adrift in four years' time, we would have inflicted considerable hardship upon them". Accordingly we decided, with Lord Kitchener's approval - he knows what has been done, and he told me in London that he thought we had done the best thing under the circumstances - to appoint the best militia officer available to insure an efficient administration. All that the area officer has to do is to supervise that administration and we have limited the amount of time that he is called upon to sacrifice to not more than four days in one quarter.  His  duties have been defined, and every individual who applied for the position of an area officer knows exactly what he is expected to do. Under the circumstances we find that these officers are doing their  work as well as can be expected of them. Indeed, I think that considerable credit is due to them for the way in which they have done their work. We have not had any serious complaints that they have been overworked. I wish now to draw attention to the fact that the Military College is not under the Public Service Act, and that the accountant of the college is not subject to the Public Service Commissioner. The man who has been appointed, Binnie, was in the temporary employment of the Department of Home Affairs.  His  name was on the Public Service Inspector's list of applicants for temporary employment. The practice in all the Departments is that when an officer is to be appointed outside the Public Service Act resort is had to the list in the Public Service Inspector's office of the State concerned, and a man is taken from there. If suitable, he is appointed on probation. That is exactly what has_ been done in Binnie's  case. He is simply carrying on the work on probation, and the question of his permanent appointment will come up later. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. That practice has been in vogue for some time. If Ministers had to attend to appointments of this kind their whole time would be taken up by them. 1 do not know that there are any other points to which I need devote attention. In our opinion the policy put forward by the Government is a progressive one, although it is not as progressive as we would like it to be. We would like to have had power to deal with many of the evils from which the people of Australia are suffering to-day - notably with the trusts which are flourishing here. But the people have not given us that power, and if they prefer to leave the matter where it now stands we must bow to their will. But when they have had a little more experience of these commercial trusts I believe they will recognise the wisdom of giving us the fullest power to effectively cope with them. </para>

                    <para>. - Personally, I do not think much is to be gained as a rule by having a debate on the Address-in-Reply. But on this occasion I desire to say a few words. The Vice-Regal Speech is an inordinately long one, and its value seems to be infinitesimal. It starts with a note of congratulation on the continued general prosperity of the Commonwealth, and concludes with the expression of a pious hope that under Divine guidance our deliberations may promote the welfare of the people. </para>

I have no doubt that there was sincere regret on the part of the Government at the defeat of their referenda proposals. We heard last session about a certain mandate which the Government had secured to carry out that kind of legislation. But the people's verdict on 26th April last was entirely against giving the power asked for. Today it seems to me there is a mandate from the people to resist in all possible ways this particular kind of legislation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, to resist the proposals put forward at the time when the referenda were taken. Because, after all, the proposition of the Government was to make a radical alteration in the Constitution, the effect of which would have been to change the form of government from a Federation to a Unification. There was an attempt to .take away from the States their rights of self-government, and to hand some of their powers over to the Commonwealth. It has been said that the people voted " No" because they did not understand the question. I claim that the people voted " Yes " when they did not understand it. It was the duty of the Opposition to educate the people as to what the proposals really meant, and the people understood what was intended, with th'e result that they turned the propositions down. We were informed that if the proposals of the Government were rejected, others would be put forward which would make us fall down with fright. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the people gave a very emphatic answer, and their decision was that they did not want the legislation foreshadowed, and were not going to have it. If, as the Minister of Defence says, the same propositions are to be put forward again, I venture to think that the people will give the same answer. The effect of the referenda was to discredit altogether the representatives of the Government in England. People' could not understand how it was that a Government which had been defeated when its policy was submitted to the country remained in office. I was asked the question over and over again - " Why does not the Government resign?" Of course, there was a very good reason for their not doing so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W.</inline> Russell, in moving the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, made no reference whatever to the severe defeat of his party. Instead, he simply turned round and indulged in vulgar personal abuse of myself. </para>

Reference is made in the Governor-General's Speech to the Imperial Conference. I have not yet had an opportunity of reading the proceedings of that Conference, but, as far as' I am able to judge from the newspaper reports, its results were, generally speaking, of a negative character. I cannot understand the want of backbone shown by our own representatives with regard to the Declaration of London. I cannot understand why, although they went to London with a motion to oppose the Declaration, they eventually gave way and assented to it - gave way, too, in face of the opposition of nearly all the Naval authorities, and in face of resolutions by chambers of commerce pointing out the danger to our own trade. We, I suppose, shall have now to take the risks arising from the Declaration. Reference is made in the Speech to the working of the progressive land tax. It is said - </para>

                <para class="block">The wonderful thing is that this should have been accomplished in so short a time. Almost immediately after the tax was imposed we are led to believe that it has had a desirable effect in attracting immigrants. I am under the impression that the good seasons we have had during the last six or seven years have had something to do with the advancement of the price of land and the throwing of areas open for settlement. The advance in price has simply made it more profitable to cultivate than to feed sheep upon the land. </para>

That was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator W'.</inline> Russell, who said that, on. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maslin's</inline> estate in South Australia, the land tax took two-fifths of the value of the property. The effect was that the owner could not afford to keep the estate for pastoral purposes, and was willing to cut it up and allow it to be sold for agricultural purposes. </para>

                <para class="block">This was issued in 1908, before any progressive land tax was imposed, and before the present Government came into power. I could give, if honorable senators needed them, particulars from Western Australia and other States to show that these things were going on before the imposition of any progressive land tax, and before the present Federal Government came into power. It is all very well to talk about this tax and the effect it has had, and to say that it is not an excessive tax. But I hold that if we tax the economic value out of a man's land, we rob him of that land. What is the effect of the tax on the owners of factories and warehouses in large centres of population? Are their lands burst up and subdivided ? The effect in those cases is simply to increase the cost of production, send up the cost of the goods a man makes for sale, and put the burden of that extra cost on to the consumer. There is no getting away from that. I notice, in paragraph 12 of the Governor-General's Speech, a reference to the question of Protection. To my mind, it is a very unsatisfactory paragraph. It says - </para>

                    <para>The effect of the Tariff upon Australian industries is being carefully watched by my Advisers, with a view to revision wherever the information obtained by them shows this to be necessary. 1  have never posed here as a high Protectionist, but I admit that, as a Commonwealth, we have adopted a policy of Protection. I am quite sure that that policy will not be changed for a good many years, or until there is a change in public opinion demanding it, which I think is a long way off. But as a system of Protection has been .adopted, I think we have a right to see that the Tariff bears equally on all industries. </para>

                        <para>- The cost of production regulates the price to the consumer. If the honorable senator is going to take it upon himself to fix duties and wages, and also the price to the consumer, he is going to undertake a very big task. More than that, I say it is an economic impossibility. The cost of production must at all times regulate the price to the consumer. It is the consumer who must pay at all times. I admit that the question of wages is important, but I say that to-day efforts are being made in every State to see that the workman gets a fair return for his labour. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it does. If a duty is imposed upon raw material it must affect the cost of the production of  the finished article made from that material. But the consumer has to pay the duty and the higher wages" whatever they may be. The burden must be upon the consumer and it is impossible to put it on any one else. J think experience has proved that the Tariff is in need of revision. We ought to undertake to make it complete and just to all parties concerned. The Government have no right to put a paragraph of this character into the Governor-General's Speech, and say simply out of a spirit of petty spite, " Because you have not carried certain proposals which we laid before you we shall leave the Tariff as it is, or touch it very gingerly." The revision of the Tariff ought to be taken up. Where there are anomalies, and the Tariff bears hardly upon certain people, relief should be afforded, and we should not shirk the task because some people are displeased with the result of the submission of certain proposals to the public. </para>

                        <para>- I usually am generous ; I wish the honorable senator were so. I believe that the proposed gauge of 4 ft. in. is the right gauge on which to build the railway, but I do not see any reference to a railway so far as the Northern Territory is concerned. I see no mention of any policy for the administration of that Territory. I do see, however, by reports coming in every day that it is in a state of chaos, and dissatisfaction exists in regard to pretty well everything connected with it. If the Northern Territory is to be properly administered and developed a railway from south to north is as necessary as a  railway  from east to west. </para>

                <para class="block">If the railway is to be one to develop the resources of the Territory it must be constructed right through the centre of it. If the Government had said that they intended to extend the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line for another 200 miles, and carry it to the MacDonnell Ranges at once, the 'deficit on the line that now appears so large would bc very considerably reduced, because it would be carried into profitable country. There would be more traffic for the line,, and it would become more nearly reproductive than it is at the present time. As a matter of justice to South Australia and to the Northern Territory itself the Government should have stated distinctly their policy with regard to the Territory, how they intended to develop it, whether they intended to construct the railway, how soon, and by what route. Unless this is done I do not see how we can hope satisfactorily to develop the Territory. I trust that when we are considering the question of railways we shall demand, not only that the railway to Western Australia, but that the line to Port Darwin also shall be constructed within a reasonable time. I noticed a reference, not in the Governor-General's Speech, but in the Supply Bill we passed last night, to the matter of advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. There was in the Supply Bill an item of £5,000 put down for the purpose of advertising the Commonwealth, but nothing to show how the advertising is to be carried on, or what shape it is to take. Certainly Australia had a very poor show in London. There were no soldiers representing the Commonwealth in the Coronation procession. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure that the honorable senator himself would have made a very grand demonstration, so far as Australia is concerned, if he had happened to be there. I regret that there is not a Commonwealth soldier with a Coronation medal on his breast. I am sorry, too, that the cadets who went from New South Wales were treated so shabbily. Not being recognised in any way, it was very difficult even for them to get a Coronation medal. So far as advertising Australia is concerned, the States were altogether behindhand. I do not blame the Commonwealth altogether for that position. The Agent-General for South Australia told me that he did all he possibly could to urge his Government to make some show at the Crystal Palace, but he was refused an opportunity. That, I think, was a great pity, lt was exactly the same with regard to the Crystal Palace and the White City. At the Crystal Palace I saw a notice with an index pointing to Wild Australia. I expected to find an advertisement for the Commonwealth, but instead of that I found some dummy figures of Ned Kelly and his bushranging gang. I went afterwards to the White City. There I saw an advertisement for Australia, and when I went to see what it- was like I saw three fellows on old screws galloping round, and was told that inside there was a performance going on. I went in to see what it was, and found that it was a representation of the Ned Kelly gang, and the most screamingly funny thing in the way of bushranging which one could imagine, Is that the kind of thing which we want to advertise? Is a thing which happened a quarter of a century ago always to be held up in London as an advertisement for Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that the authorities in London are responsible. We ought to take some step to counteract this silly rubbish. We should let the people know that bushranging has long ago passed and is gone, and we ought to be doing a great deal more. There was a sum of  £5,000  appropriated for advertising Australia. I want to know how it is to be spent, and what sort of advertisement we are to get. I went down to the great Agricultural Show at Norwich, and there I saw a model of a house which is put up for settlers in Canada, and a booth chock full of literature, with a small platform outside, from which, every half hour, a man descanted on the advantages of Canada. We have nothing of that sort going on. If our country is as good as I believe it to be, it is worth advertising. From London I returned in the company of a high civil servant of New South Wales who had been to Canada. He told me that, as regards settlement, Canada did not compare with Australia. Another gentleman who had spent some months in Canada, and who had been in Australia, told me that, as regards natural advantages, the former could not compare in any way with the latter. The only advantage which Canada has is that it is a good deal nearer to the Old Country. A man can go to Canada in a week, and, if he does not like it, he can return for  £5.  The proposal to buy a site in London for Commonwealth offices is, I think, a very good one, and an admirable site has been selected. If the Commonwealth offices are established in that locality, and surrounded by the State offices, it will concentrate attention on Australia, and no longer will a person in need of information have to go from the West End to the East End, and from the Strand to other places. On the contrary, he will go to one spot, and there get information about any State, and also information from the Commonwealth office itself. I hope that the proposal to buy this site will be accepted. I believe that it will be a good investment in every, way, and certainly to the advantage of Australia, for the site is a splendid one.  1  want to make a few remarks about the military regulations. I find that with regard to certain officers there has been a reduction of the age of retirement, "but no notice of this vital change seems to have been given to any of the officers. Moreover, it was made retrospective, and not prospective. In South Australia there is one officer who has, I think, been very hardly dealt by. He asked for leave which he was entitled to on account of the services he had rendered. He got this leave on 10th December.  His  retiring age, as he understood it when he went away, was sixty-two years. When he was in England, in March, he received a cable telling him that the regulation had been altered, arid that the retiring age for his class had been reduced to fifty-eight years. If this alteration was contemplated before he went on leave he ought to have been informed accordingly.  His  leave ought, I think, to have been refused. In that case he might have gone on to the end of his term and got the full leave which he was entitled to at the end of his service. Instead of that, he was allowed to engage return passages for himself and his wife, which meant a very considerable loss to him, before he received any intimation of the change, and he is to get no recompense. This is a hard case. I think that if this regulation had to be made, it should have been made to apply to officers joining the service in the future, and not to men already in the service. Tt seems to me that a very grave injustice is done to a man who has rendered services to the Commonwealth to the best of his ability. I hope that if representations of this character are made to the Minister of Defence, he will give them careful consideration, and see that injustices of this kind are not perpetrated. If officers are to be treated in that way, it will 'bring the Commonwealth into disgrace. It is not acting fairly to the men who have been called upon to do service for us. Reference has been made to the cadets and to the drills which they are called upon to undergo. I understood, when the Defence Bill was being discussed here, that the Junior Cadets were simply to be put through athletic exercises and plain drill, and that no rifle, not even of a miniature character, would be put into their hands; but I understand that they are drilling with a small rifle, and that a great many of the parents object to it, and I think rightly object. I do not think there is any necessity to give the Junior Cadets anything more than athletic drill and the ordinary marching drill. They ought not to be called upon to bear arms of any kind until they get into the Senior Cadets. I hope that, for the sake of a great many parents who object to what is being done, the Department will drop this practice of making little boys carry miniature rifles, and go back to the original idea. There is one other matter I wish to refer to, and that is the question of transferred properties. According to a paragraph in this Speech, it seems as if this question were coming to a head.I think that the States have a right to claim from us interest in respect of the transferred properties, at any rate for last year and this year. I hope that there will be a satisfactory settlement arrived at, so as to bring the Commonwealth into proper relationship with the States. I think it is high time that the question of consolidating the State debts was undertaken, because, as was hinted here yesterday, if the Commonwealth intends to construct railways, it cannot do so out of revenue. I believe that the money for that purpose will have to be borrowed. It would be ten thousand pities to put a seventh borrower from Australia on the money market. It would be much better to consolidate the State debts, and then simply have one borrower so far as Australia is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. We cannot tell what the States will do until we test them. I think it would be certainly the best policy to adopt, because we should have one central authority for the purpose of dealing with these loans in time to come. I have no more to say in regard to the Speech, except to echo the last part of it, that the session may result in the passing of useful legislation for the benefit of the Commonwealth. </para>
