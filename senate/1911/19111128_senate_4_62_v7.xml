            <para>. - I should like to say at once that in objecting, as I did, to this motion going as formal, it was not my intention to unduly occupy the time of the Senate, nor do I think that it is the intention of any honorable senator on this side to do so. But as the Opposition view the proposals in this Bill, and other matters connected with it, as of grave moment, it was thought desirable that we should, as briefly as the importance of the matter warrants, summarize the objections which we have endeavoured ineffectually to press upon the notice of honorable senators during the Committee stage. In doing this it necessarily follows that I shall be recapitulating to some extent the objections already voiced in this Chamber rather than breaking any fresh ground. Still, it is thought well to put in a precise and concise form the objections which have animated honorable senators on this side in the hostile course they have taken with regard to this measure. The first point I wish to present is that there has been no justification shown by argument advanced or evidence furnished for the very drastic changes proposed. We have heard vague unsupported statements of fraud and corruption under the existing law. There has been no serious attempt to substantiate them or to produce the facts which ought to exist before such statements are publicly made. The absence of this justification is one of the reasons why the Opposition, at what might have appeared to supporters of the Bill an undue length, considered it right to voice their ineffective protest. As no attempt has been made to justify the charges of fraud and corruption, the Opposition feel entitled, in view of the provisions of this Bill and the attitude of its supporters, to affirm that it has been drafted rather with a regard to the interests of party than with any particular desire to afford equal facilities to the great body of the electors. </para>

With these preliminary remarks, I propose to summarize more in. detail the objections taken to this Bill.

              <para>- Of what use is it to tell a man who is unable to attend a polling booth within  5  miles of him that he is at liberty to vote at any other polling booth in the Commonwealth? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> means to say that some other electors are given additional facilities,  I  am prepared to agree with him. Whilst the Bill withdraws a facility enjoyed by electors under the existing Act, it offers no substitute for it. In addition, this Bill withdraws the facilities hitherto afforded to women in maternity cases to. record their votes. They are unable at such a time to attend a polling booth, no matter how near it may be to them. It cannot be pretended for  a  moment that a woman who is unable to leave her room is compensated for the withdrawal of the postal vote by being permitted to roam all over Australia, and to cast her vote where she pleases. The third  objection is that under this Bill it is deliberately proposed to withdraw similar facilities from the infirm, lt is idle to pretend that one whose infirmity prevents him from going 100 yards to record his vote is provided with a better system in being given the liberty to vote at any polling-booth he happens to be near on the day of election.  His  difficulty is to get to the nearest polling-booth, and it is no compensation to him to be told that he may, if he pleases, record his vote at the booth furthest from him. These are briefly the objections of the Opposition to the withdrawal of the postal voting facilities. In addition to this, the Bill, while providing for the holding of elections on Saturdays - in respect to which every one admits that a strong case can lie made out - makes no provision at all for those who, by reason of conscientious motives, are unable to vote on that day. The Government affirmed that by extending the hours of polling to 8 p.m. they have met that difficulty. I appeal to honorable senators to say whether the official clergy of the Hebrew faith, the particular denomination in question, are not better guides in this matter than is any member of the Senate, or any person outside their faith ? They have told us in a petition to the Senate that the extension of the hours of polling to 8 p.m. will not meet their difficulty. I am not going into their difficulty. I do not know enough about it, but I say that I am entitled to accept the assurance of the official heads of this church that the extension proposed will not meet the difficulty which arises from the forms of their religion. I contrast the denial of the .privileges asked for these people with the extraordinary provisions made in this Bill for the benefit of another class of voters. In Committee on the Bill, I proposed that, to meet the conscientious scruples of people of the Hebrew faith, a provision should be made to enable them to vote on the day previous to the day of election before the Electoral Registrar. The Government declined to accept that proposal, and, with the solid support of their party, turned it down. I wish the Senate to recollect what the Opposition then offered. There is in this Bill a clause which provides that a seaman or other person, who may be leaving Australia some weeks before polling day - before even the names of all the candidates are known - shall be entitled to go before the Electoral Registrar and record his vote. Yet, when we asked that a similar privilege should be extended to those who have conscientious objections to voting on Saturday, that privilege was denied them. In view of this circumstance, one cannot resist the conclusion that in the shaping of this Bill party interests have been allowed to exercise considerable and undue sway. </para>

              <para>- Only on the big boats. The Bill contains this extraordinary provision - a provision which is not to be found in any other electoral law in the world - that before nomination day a certain class of electors may cast their votes, and cast therm under conditions as to which we are in absolute ignorance to-day. If the Government can safely put forward a proposition to enable one section of the electors to vote weeks before polling day, surely it is only reasonable to say that those electors who, from conscientious reasons, decline to vote on Saturday, shall be entitled, under the same regulations, to vote one day before polling day. The latter proposal, however, was solidly voted down by the supporters of the Ministry. That is one of the objections which impelled the Opposition to adopt a hostile attitude towards this Bill. Having dealt with the things which the measure does not do, I now wish to say a few words in regard to two radical alterations of the existing law which it proposes. I refer to compulsory enrolment, and to what, for want of a better term, I may describe as the ultra-divisional voting. Both these provisions may or may not be good. It will depend entirely upon how effect is given to them. Unless the new set of regulations which has to be framed has regard to all the circumstances, it must be obvious that the doorway to fraud will be opened wide. Whilst there is some  merit in one of these proposals, it is obvious that that merit will be entirely destroyed unless it be hedged round with some safeguards which will wholly eliminate the liability of fraud. But concerning this, the Minister gave us no information whatever. He declined to explain how this compulsory enrolment is to be carried out. We were simply told that the card system is to be adopted. We were not vouchsafed any information as to what the regulations will contain, although the Minister was frequently asked to enlighten us upon that point. In regard to ultra-divisional voting, the Bill provides that an elector entitled to vote in one division, shall, if absent, be allowed to record his vote in any other division in the Commonwealth. No doubt the end i» view is a laudable one. Certainly the objective of the provision received the cordial approval of all sections of the Senate. But it must be obvious that the degree of safety with which that proposal can be adopted, will depend entirely upon the safeguards which surround it. Yet the Minister declined not only to say how it should be worked, but to set out in the Bill the nature of the safeguards to be adopted. They are to be left entirely to the Department, or to the Minister in office for the time being. I will now point out the particular danger which arises from the introduction of these new proposals, minus the safeguards which ought to have accompanied them. Under our enrolment and voting system, we have hitherto had the great safeguard of local knowledge. Our electoral law has proceeded upon the assumption that we should localize both the enrolment and the voting. Each elector was gathered round his own centre, and, consequently, the local policeman had a reasonable opportunity of knowing the local elector. Local knowledge thus constituted a great safeguard against corrupt practice. Even scrutineers were of some value under that system. But now we are to have a system under which an elector of Balmain, Sydney, will be entitled to vote in Brisbane, or anywhere else . in the Commonwealth. The safeguard of local knowledge will, therefore, be entirely eliminated. The Department has power to make regulations, as to which the Minister will not utter a single word. It has been said, " Surely we can trust the Government." As an abstract proposition, I would not dispute that contention. But when radical alterations in our electoral system are pro- posed - alterations which suggest the possibility of considerable fraudulent practice - it is an obligation upon the Government to' fully explain the proposals, which, if the Bill passes, they will be called upon to launch. I have already admitted, as an abstract proposition, that one may fairly trust the Government of the day. But there are special reasons why one may feel more than anxiety and doubt as to the wisdom of excluding from an Act of Parliament general directions as to the conduct of elec,toral matters. It will be within the knowledge of honorable senators that quite recently in two of the States there has been a considerable amount of corrupt practice,, which suggests the possibility of Governments, for their own purposes, condoning, offences against electoral administration. The first case to which I will refer is one which happened in my own State. There it was shown conclusively that an elector had been a party to an absolute forgery of an electoral claim - that he had induced  a  young girl to forge a claim for enrolment - and that he had wrongly witnessed that claim. He was proceeded against on two charges, both of which were proved. The Attorney-General of the State then stepped in, and, referring to the offence as " the act of a well-meaning enthusiast," reduced the fine, which was a substantial one, to  a  paltry 2s. </para>

          <para class="block">Bridge, who had been committed for trial on another offence against our electoral law. He had been committed for trial, but the Attorney-General declined to proceed against him. In that case also I am justified in saying that the offending persons were attached to the party represented by the Government of the day. While I make no personal charges against my honorable friends opposite - I should be sorry to do that - I say nevertheless that when we see a tendency on the part of a Government in this country, to abuse a power that is given to them at the call of party interests, and always to take a more or less warped view of things when those party interests are involved, this Senate will be proved to have been entirely wrong in allowing a. Bill of this kind to pass from it without insisting on necessary safeguards and precautions with regard to compulsory enrolment and absent voting being inserted in it rather than being left to regulation. As showing to what an extent these possibilities of corruption may take place, even under our democratic system of Government, let me refer to what has occurred in another State than my own. In this case absolute proof has been put forward of gross irregularities amounting to forgery and the stuffing of rolls. A Committee was appointed in South Australia, to investigate the circumstances. A minority of that Committee consisting of members of the" Labour party, whilst in no sense denying the facts set forth, attempted to palliate them. </para>

          <para class="block">The whole twenty-seven, in fact, were fraudulent. These are not the statements of the enemies of the dominant party in South Australia. They are the admissions of its friends. When we find not only that these things can be done, but that when done they are defended and sought to be justified by gentlemen holding such a responsible position as the Vice-President of the Executive Council does, I say that we may reasonably look for a repetition of this sort of thing if we allow the present Bill to pass from us as we are doing, without insisting on the insertion of safeguards in it, instead of leaving them to the Electoral Office or to the Ministry of the day. It is for that reason rather than any hostility to the provision for widening the facilities for voting, or for compulsory enrolment - it is because of the absence of necessary precautions, and because it is evident that there is a tendency on the part of certain individuals in the ranks of the Labour party to view with such tolerance any fraud against the Electoral Act which may help their party - that honorable senators on this side of the Chamber have felt justified in persisting in their opposition to these proposals. I have endeavoured as far as I could to deal with cold facts, because I have sought to make my few remarks a summary of the reasons which have justified the attitude of the Opposition. I recognise that it is too much to hope that any alteration of the Bill will take place here. It is, perhaps, too much to expect that even in another place better counsels will prevail, but I have still sufficient faith in the honesty of public opinion as a whole to believe that the average elector desires to see equal facilities afforded, irrespective of political views. And because I am firmly convinced that all electors want honesty in legislation and administration, I have ventured again to utter a protest in the hope that if nothing can be done in Parliament, the time will arrive when they will assist us to put right that which is wrong. </para>

When a document of that kind has to be filled in, how often does it happen that the husband is able to write better than the wife, and does not think that he is committing a fraud? I regret that not only in this case, but in many others, the Opposition impute wrong motives. Let us take the other persons who, it is said, will be debarred from voting, and that is the prospective mothers.

              <para>- I wish to show that the system of postal voting is" not being abolished to injure one particular party. We are absolutely fair, and are prepared to take our chance. The law will apply just as harshly to our side as to the other side, and when both parties suffer equally, it is most unreasonable to impute unfairness. I do not think that there is one honorable senator who would take the right to vote from any person unless he was satisfied that sufficient cases of abuse had occurred to make it clear that a great injury was done to the community by placing a weapon in the hands of certain persons. The fact should not be lost sight of that while the Bill takes from certain persons the right to vote by post, it extends the facilities for voting to an unheard of degree. We are extending to these persons the right to vote at any polling booth, not merely in the State, but in the Commonwealth. </para>

Suppose that a man was unable to go to a polling booth a few hundred yards away, and desired to vote. In the first place, he had to get a responsible person to come to his bedside, and sign an application for a postal ballot-paper. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. I have quite sufficient proof that a wrong use has been made of postal voting, and regretfully I am driven to the fact that we must do away with the system, because it is clearly a weapon in the hands of unscrupulous persons. The difficulty which confronts those who wish to make an honest use of the system is so great that it is not worth while to retain it. It should be remembered that, although postal voting is being abolished, it is to be replaced by something better. </para>

              <para>- The ease with which honorable senators speak of the roads to corruption convinces me that they know the tracks very well. We are told of certain convictions in New South Wales when, as a fact, the cases were most trivial ; so trivial, indeed, that the Attorney-General rescinded the fine, or failed to collect it, or refused to proceed. Yet these are called cases of corruption. The new system of witnessing signatures was introduced in New South Wales- </para>

There is always some one on the look-out to drive a coach and four through an Act of Parliament. We shall do a great deal more for the community if we recognise the fact that elections have been carried on with a surprising degree of honesty, especially when we remember, not only the facilities, but the inducements, which have been offered for corruption. </para>

If ever there was a party which won its present position by the straightforward, honest votes of unpurchaseable electors it is the Labour party.

            <para>- - I think that every reasonable man in the community will share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> regret at the repeal of certain facilities for voting. He can scarcely defend the repeal of postal voting by directing his remarks to the scathing criticism of the Leader of the Opposition. He seeks to defend the action of the Government on a plea which is ever put forward when certain persons have to defend an iniquity &gt; and that is that it is for the good of the State, for the good of the people. Unable to specify charges of fraudulent practice at elections, which have been proved against the party to which he belongs, he palliates them, he excuses them; indeed* he almost goes to the length of saying that in all cases they are perfectly justifiable. That supports our statement that this measure is framed in such a way that it will strike heavily against our side. When we give sufficient proof of fraud on the other side, it is somewhat ominous that such a defence is made and that such excuses are put forward. What have honorable senators on the other side to say with regard to the abolition of postal voting? They have practically admitted that it is proposed because it has been found comparatively useless to a certain section of the community. That is not the argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> used previously. The reason he gave previously for the proposed abolition of postal voting was that it had been used as an . engine of fraud, presumably against his own party. The two arguments are utterly inconsistent. May we ask that before the Bill leaves the Senate, honorable senators opposite will, at least, endeavour to understand enough about it to enable them to be consistent in their defence of it. Does not every member of the Senate know that postal voting must of necessity have been a great convenience to very many of the electors, male and female? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardined</inline> mentioned the instance of a fencer in a remote district, who might be unable to go to the poll on the day of an election. But it was exactly for that class of men that postal voting was intended. </para>

              <para>- A cursory analysis of the figures with regard to postal voting will show that the system was used by fencers,, boundary riders, shepherds, and others who were miles away from a polling booth. It was a great convenience to such people to be able to apply for a postal ballot-paper, it might be six weeks before the day of the election, in order to  enable them to exercise the franchise. It must be obvious that postal voting was a tremendous advantage to all classes of electors in scattered districts. When the franchise has been given to women it is surely an inherent right that they should be allowed to anticipate their approaching motherhood, and that it should not be a bar to their exercise of the franchise. I do not care on which side the majority of the postal votes were cast, I speak now in the highest interests of woman, and especially to guard her privileges when she is approaching motherhood. </para>

              <para>- It displays a warped intellect, or the absence of any sense of relevancy to drag the question of the birth-rate into this matter at all. Honorable senators opposite have, in spite of warnings inside and outside this Chamber, decided to deprive women in a certain condition of the right to record their votes. They know that they have done that* and their inconsistent arguments show that they are aware that the position they have taken up is indefensible, and that they regret it, or are more or less ashamed of it. Let us look now at the contrast which the Government have presented to the world so far as the franchise to women is concerned. It is a fact that, under this Bill, a woman is disfranchised at a time when she is about to become a mother, whilst the prostitute of the streets is enabled to walk triumphantly to the polling booth and vote. </para>

              <para>- I understand the interjection in that sense, and whether I have twisted it or not, the fact remains that, in this Bill, there is a remarkable contrast between the treatment meted out to the most deserving of women, who are disfranchised by reason of their condition of maternity, and the infamous women, who are not touched, and may take the place of the others at the polls. </para>

              <para>- That is a characteristic interjection, and a characteristic defence of the Government position. I have stated the case as it stands, and honorable senators opposite cannot . rub it out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to what he called trivial offences against the electoral law, and objected to our saying that they were cases of fraud. I point out that, under this Bill, the most trivial offences, even against regulations of which we know nothing, are punishable by remarkably heavy fines. In one case the Government propose the heaviest penalties for a purely artificial offence. If the proprietor of a newspaper .does not print in a certain kind of type a statement to the effect that certain matter is an advertisement, he is to be liable to a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£500.</inline> In answer to some criticism by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> interjected that there are some laws which he would break. If ever there was a law which, by reason of its oppression, would excuse its breach by the community, it is a law of this kind. The Bill creates a purely artificial crime in order to strike at the proprietors of newspapers who are supposed to be powerful assistants of a certain political party. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> suggest that the proprietors of these newspapers should break this artificial law, or does he justify the heavy penalty proposed for what may be merely an act of negligence on the part of a newspaper proprietor? The Labour party, because certain guides of public opinion- have made  their influence felt with the electors of this country, entertain a desire to strike at them. </para>

              <para>- Everybody who is opposed to the party opposite is charged with being unfair. In face of such strong corroborative evidence, is it wrong to say that this Bill has been deliberately framed, not for the purpose of doing justice to the electors of Australia, or to extending to them facilities in every proper direction, but for the purpose of enabling the Labour party to avenge itself upon a political foe? I believe that it was conceived in a. spirit of political vengeance, that it was born in political iniquity, and that, sooner or later, it will meet with the fate which it deserves. </para>

            <para>. - I have no desire to delay the third reading of this Bill, but a great part of the discussion which has taken place upon it has ranged around two features. One portion of the measure which has aroused a great deal of opposition provides for the abolition of postal voting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, in a very impassioned speech, has accused honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber who supported the abolition of postal voting of disfranchising that class of elector in Australia who, more than _ any other class, is entitled to our sympathy. When the honorable senator and others hurl such charges across the Chamber, 1 throw them back at them. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator's arguments have not been based on the assumption that only one woman will be disfranchised by the abolition of postal voting, but that thousands of women will be disfranchised. The truth is that members of the Opposition recognise that this is a good fighting placard for them, and, in their opinion, it is a great misfortune that we are not a little closer to the next general elections, so that their high falutin might exercise a better effect. But when they charge us with having no sympathy for the female voters who will be disfranchised as the result of the abolition of postal voting, they know perfectly well they are absolutely unfair. It is only because we desire to minimize the opportunities that exist for corrupt practices that we favour the abolition of the postal-voting system. The Leader of the Opposition has asked why we have not supplied proof that such practices exist. But he has been answered time and again that it is' impossible to bring forward proof of corrupt practices even when one knows that they exist. I find from the figures to which I have alluded that at the last general elections 2,894 male and 3,325 female electors voted by post in New South Wales. In Victoria, 7,700 female and 6,300 male electors availed themselves of that system. In Queensland, 2,-300 females and 1,600  males voted by post. In South Australia, 791 females and 960 males used the postal vote, whilst in Western Australia, 850 females and 1,100 males exercised their franchise in the same way. In Tasmania, 703 females and 530 males voted by post. So that throughout the Commonwealth the postal voters numbered 15,759 females and 13,490 males - a very small difference indeed. While recognising that it is a misfortune that a certain number of electors will be deprived of their franchise by the abolition of postal voting, I say that when we consider the many opportunities which <inline font-style="italic">that</inline> system affords for corrupt practices, the weight of argument is in our favour. There is just one other phase of postal voting which is worthy of consideration. At the last elections, although 36,780 postal ballot-papers were issued, only 22,940 were returned, thus showing a discrepancy of several thousand. Does not that fact appear significant? </para>

              <para>- The discrepancy gives colour to the idea that it is the practice of a number of professional electioneering agents to get as many postal ballot-papers as possible for the use of the political party which employs them. I am quite satisfied that the postal provisions of our electoral law have been used for corrupt practices by both political parties. If my honorable friends opposite are anxious that those laws should be purified, they ought to be satisfied to abolish the system of postal voting. </para>

              <para>- During the course of this debate it has been made abundantly clear that it is almost impossible to do that. Postal voting opens the door to corruption. There is only one other feature of this Bill in regard to which I would like to offer a few observations. A great deal of political vituperation has been hurled at Ministerial supporters, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition, because it is proposed to set apart Saturday as the polling-day at elections. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> - My objection was that the Bill does not make provision for the Hebrews. </para>

              <para>- I happen to know intimately quite a number of people of the Jewish persuasion in this city, and I am satisfied that the provision made for them does meet their case. The answer of the Opposition will doubtless be that these persons reside close to polling booths, because they live in the city. But these may be taken as fairly typical of Jewish people all over Australia. I refer to this portion of the Bill because I resent very strongly indeed the allusions made, especially by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> to those who support the Saturday polling day. The honorable senator asked : " Why should you interfere with anybody's religious convictions? " </para>

              <para>- My answer is that sufficient provision is made in the Bill. When honorable senators opposite protest so loudly that they believe in freedom for every one's religious convictions, I reply that I am as tolerant as any one in the Senate. I fully agree that we should not interfere with the religious convictions of any person. But this Bill does not interfere with them. </para>

If this Bill commits such a flagrant disregard of the religious convictions of the Hebrews, it is a remarkable thing that we did not receive petitions from every part of Australia. Personally, I am prepared to take the views expressed by quite a number of Jews. </para>

              <para>- Of course, honorable senators opposite aTe making as much political capital as they can out of this incident, as also out of the abolition of postal voting. They say, " Here is a party which is absolutely trampling on the religious convictions of a section of the community." But they know that their statements are absolutely incorrect. Having had little opportunity of expressing my views on the subject while the Bill was in Committee, I am glad to have been able to take advantage of this occasion to place them on record. </para>

            <para>- - Standing order 209 provides that a Bill may be re-committed on its third reading. I wish to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether he will consent to the re-committal of the measure for the purpose of rectifying certain omissions of a consequential character ? Clause 32 provides, in proposed new section 172A, sub-clause 1, that " every organization, association, league, or body of persons " shall do certain things. On the motion of the Leader of the Opposition, in Committee, the words " trade union, registered or unregistered," were inserted. The same words ought to appear in sub-clauses 2, 4, and 5. I understood from the  Chairman  of Committees that the alterations were consequential, and would be made in the Bill. But they have not been made. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council consent to the re-committal of the measure for the purpose of rectifying the omissions ? </para>

              <para>- Yes, with both feet ! The Labour party have always claimed to be anxious to extend the franchise, and to give people opportunities for registering their votes. But they have not maintained that attitude in regard to this Bill. The principal Act provided that any person who was more than 5 miles from a polling booth might have the privilege of recording his vote by post. When it was proposed to repeal that provision, certain honorable senators said that the farmers had horses and traps, and could easily record their votes although living 5 miles or more from a polling booth. I quite admit that; but what about the farmer's man, who cannot afford to lose a day to go to record his vote ; and what about the wife of the farmer's man, who ought not to be compelled to walk 10 miles for the purpose? These people are to be deprived of their votes. A woman in ill-health, or in a certain condition, who ought to receive the utmost respect and veneration from every man, is also told that she cannot vote. Then, again, the man who is old and feeble and unable to walk, is denied his vote. If a man or a woman is in a hospital or suffering from illness at home, the exercise of the franchise will be impossible. I desire it to be known throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth that the party opposite are depriving these persons of their right to vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> has quoted figures to show that the difference between the number of males and of females voting by post was comparatively small. That is quite correct. But is that a reason for taking the opportunity of exercising the franchise away from 15,759 women ? </para>

              <para>- Let it be supposed that a number of those men and women were lazy, and voted by post because of that. Supposing that one half of them were affected that way, is that a reason why 19,600 people, who are honestly unable to go to the polling booth, should be deprived of their votes? Yet that is what this Bill proposes to do. Why? The reason given is that there has been some abuse of postal voting.  I do not say that there has not been abuse. I never knew of any system, however good, that was not abused to some extent. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> mentioned that, in one or two instances, when postal votes were counted, it was found that they turned an election against the Labour party; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> also said that it was found that three out of five postal votes were against that party. Those were the only reasons which I heard given for the abolition of this system. As a matter of justice, these people have no right to be deprived of their votes. </para>

              <para>- Under certain conditions, yes. It has been said by the Minister that although the Bill abolishes postal voting, it introduces a more comprehensive system of absent voting. It is a splendid system of absent voting so far as sailors and passengers at sea are concerned, because they will be able to record their votes even before the writs are issued. They are the only persons who will be able to vote in that way. Persons who are not within their own division on polling day may vote at any polling place in the Commonwealth. I do not intend to Object to that provision. The Electoral Act contains about four pages of provisions to safeguard the use of the postal vote. But what precaution is taken in this measure? There is not a provision of any sort to safeguard absent voting. When the time came to hold a scrutiny of postal votes, the duty of the Returning Officer was to open the votes before the scrutineers, compare the signatures on the applications with the signatures on the ballot-papers, and so see that no fraud was perpetrated. What is to be done with absent votes? Will the Minister tell me if they are to be compared in a similar way. </para>

              <para>- We must wait until the Minister does reply, but I venture to think that it is not intended even to open the absent votes and compare the signatures before the scrutineers. In that case, what is the use of them? A man who is enrolled for the Melbourne division may go to the Returning Officer and say, " My name is John Thompson, No.  hi  on the roll," and get a voting-paper. If a man in North Queensland goes into a polling booth and says, " My name is John Thompson, No. 111, on the Melbourne roll," and makes a declaration, or signs a form, he will receive a voting-paper. If the votes are not to be compared before the scrutiny takes place, who will say whether a fraud has been committed or not? </para>

              <para>- We have not been told what regulations will be put in force to safeguard absent voting. It is not fair to the Senate or the people for the Ministry to decline to put in such safeguards as are to be found in the present Act. These are conspicuous by their absence. With regard to Saturday polling, I do not believe that even the Department or anybody else had a thought of the Jews when the polling time was extended by one hour. I think that the extension was made for another purpose. We have received from the leading Rabbis in the Commonwealth a petition in which they, speaking for the whole of the Jewish community, asked for some consideration. We on this side proposed to meet them by giving them an opportunity of recording their votes on the day previous to the day of election, but the Ministry and their supporters refused to grant the privilege. That is doing a distinct injustice to persons who have a conscientious objection to voting on a Saturday. I believe that under the new system of absent voting the door for fraud will be opened in many cases. I look upon this as a party measure pure and simple. The Labour party have the power to alter the Act as they please. They say, " We can amend the Act so that it will suit us better than it has done," and therefore it H.s to be altered. I believe that that, and that only, is the reason for the alteration, except the one fact that the Department wants to institute a card system which they know will be imperfect and this they have admitted, by introducing certain provisions to meet every expected breakdown. </para>

            <para>. - It is not often?-' that one likes to take exception to a measure at this stage. When one realizes the steps which have to be taken before a Bill reaches its third reading, it is generally to be assumed that it commends itself in the main to favorable consideration. I do not intend to recapitulate any of the particular features of this Bill to which attention has been drawn to-day, as I wish to be as brief as possible. From the debates which have taken place, one cannot but think that the Bill occupies a unique position in connexion with any legislation which has ever been introduced here. -Whether it is a question of omission or commission, I think that the Bill stands absolutely condemned. That the electoral law is in need of amendment is, I think, undeniable. That it is in need of radical amendment will, I think, be apparent to anybody who knows anything of it. When we had submitted to us for consideration a Bill which purports to amend the law, and which is guilty of so many omissions as this is guilty of, amendments which should have been made or dealt with, but which are absolutely ignored, no matter what the merits of the Bill may have been, one might have been almost justified in voting against the second reading, or, indeed, against the third reading. But when, added to these glaring omissions, We have what might be called the sins of commission - the introduction of totally new principles, and the absence of any legislation governing or guiding in connexion with some of these most novel features - in that respect also the Bill would stand condemned, even if it made provision for remedying the electoral law in many of those important particulars in which it is altogether defective. . Judged from every point of view, it is one which, I submit, can only meet with general condemnation on the part of any fair-minded person. It omits nearly everything which it should have provided for. It introduces nothing in the way of novelty which does not stand self-condemned on its face, and for that reason I intend to vote against the third reading. It has been noticeable throughout these proceedings that there has been very little said in support of the Bill by those who have been supporting it by their votes. It cannot be said that the reason for any lack of vocal support from its voting supporters has been that the Bill speaks for itself, as to its merits and as to why it should be accepted. It 'does nothing of the kind. This Bill has been in the hands, in turn, of every one of the Ministers representing the Government in the Senate. The Minister of Defence moved the second reading; in Committee it was in charge of the Honorary Minister, who should have introduced it, and its third reading is taken in hand to-day by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. What other measure introduced in this Chamber has had, in turn, to be submitted by the full strength of the Government. </para>

              <para>- I am not taking any exception to the fact that the Honorary Minister is not in charge of the Bill to-day. I am pointing out that it has been taken up at different stages by each of the Ministers. The reason I say this will be apparent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> when I draw attention to the fact that, notwithstanding this exceptional treatment - and within  my recollection no measure ever submitted to this Chamber has been dealt with in a similar way - we have been treated to a pitiful lack of information from the Ministerial bench. This Bill has stood condemned through all its stages from the time it was introduced. I believe that when the people realize in what respects it amends the electoral law they will commend those who have voted against it at every stage. </para>

I do not object to the Leader of the Opposition, and any number of his followers, repeating the tactics which have been indulged in from the moment that this measure was introduced. But I consider <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> last remarks very ungenerous, as coming from an honorable gentleman who, I believe, has some little human sympathy. Owing to certain circumstances the Bill has been in the hands of every member of the Government in this Chamber. That is to say, merely, that every member of the Government in the Senate has accepted his responsibility. There is nothing wrong or irregular about it. It has been the result of accident throughout. Consequently, any reference to the matter can only be made as a reflection on the individual member of the Government who should have had charge of the Bill all the time. </para>

              <para>- It was due to the illness of the Honorary Minister on a previous occasion that the second reading was moved by the Minister of Defence, and it is again due to his illness that I have charge of the measure to-day. I had a wire from him this morning to say that, unfortunately, through illness, he would not be able to be here to-day, but would be here to-morrow. It is beneath the dignity of Parliament altogether for the Opposition to descend so low as to refer to incidents of this description. With respect to the summary of the Leader of the Opposition of the objections that have been expressed by honorable senators opposite, we have not been surprised by it. They have made these complaints all along. The complaint that sufficient information was not given from this side should not have any weight, in view of the fact that so much nonsense was talked by the other side, not for days, but for weeks, that it prevented all possibility of proper explanations being given. Honorable senators opposite may laugh, but they only throw ridicule on their ridiculous conduct. The supporters of the measure are quite satisfied. 'They understand it. They have everything in the Bill that they want and if honorable senators opposite had been able to suggest provisions which would have conferred advantages on the electors of Australia, we, on this side, would have been only too happy to accept them. Let us see what this brief summary, supplemented by a few cursory remarks from honorable senators on the other side, really amounts to. Does the Leader of the Opposition object to compulsory enrolment? If he does, for what reason does he object to it? It ought to be the object of every member of the community, and of every parliamentary representative, to make it quite clear that every citizen of Australia should be on an electoral roll, and should have an opportunity to record his vote. </para>

              <para>- When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is a member of a Government, and the question of compulsory voting comes on, he can express his opinion on the subject. The time for suggesting, so far as this Bill is concerned, has gone by. It will pass its third reading now. It is not going to be recommitted, and it is, therefore, useless to make suggestions at this stage. It has, for a long time, been apparent that something should be done to secure as complete and as accurate a roll of the citizens of Australia as can be compiled. The Government came to the conclusion that this is the only way in which to secure it. Honorable senators opposite ask how we are going to carry this proposal out. To my knowledge, the Honorary Minister in charge of the Bill explained on three occasions how it is going to be done. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator has been a free agent to his own detriment hundreds of times. I have been the same. We are always better off, and occupy a stronger position in the community, if we are under some regulations. That is one reason why honorable senators on this side approve of this Bill - it puts the general public under regulations. I was pointing out that when the card is filled in it is returned to the Electoral Office and bears evidence on its face of the signature of the elector. Is not that something to have attained? Then so far as the future is concerned, there will be no further delivery of cards. Every elector will be required to look after his own interests, to get a card when it is required, and to send it in. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable senator means that an elector in New South Wales, after being enrolled there, is going to Tasmania, to Victoria, to South Australia, and to Western Australia, to be enrolled in those States also, his argument is ridiculous. No one would go to the expense of travelling from one State to another in order to duplicate his enrolment. It could not be done in any case, because the signature on each card would have to be the same. I do not think it does justice to the intelligence of the Leader of the Opposition to suggest impossible conditions, which he knows could never arise. The honorable senator must know that there will be no duplication of enrolment under the card system. </para>

              <para>- I hope the honorable senator will not make a bet on it, and then try it on himself, and get into gaol for endeavouring to evade the law. That finishes the explanation of the card system of enrolment. The next great grievance of the Leader of the Opposition and his ardent supporters is the proposed abolition of postal voting. Some members of this party, including the Honorary Minister and the Minister of Defence, have given explanations showing the necessity for the abolition of postal voting. In our opinion there has not only been a great possibility of corruption, but there has actually been corruption in connexion with postal voting in the different States, and particularly in the State of Victoria. </para>

              <para>- Then it is impossible to prove anything to the honorable senator. Honorable senators opposite have declared that the abolition of postal voting will affect the motherhood of Australia. They have made a great point of that. We cannot help that. From a party point of view that makes very little difference. I believe that the greatest difference will be experienced by supporters of this side, because there are nearly double the number of legitimate mothers amongst the working classes who support this side. When honorable senators opposite raise an argument of that description, they only make their case far worse. In electorates such as Melbourne, East Melbourne, and Toorak we had a greater proportion of woman voters using the postal vote than in country electorates, where they might have been more than 5 miles from a polling booth. That evidence is conclusive enough for me.- It is sufficiently conclusive to satisfy my colleagues and Ministerial supporters. Honorable senators opposite may remain dissatisfied just so long as they please. The next complaint of the Leader of the Opposition was that the substitute which we offer for postal voting will lead to even greater corruption in the future. We propose that every elector shall be at liberty to vote anywhere in Australia that he may happen to be at the time of an election. In the first place, I think that that is a  legitimate provision to make. Every elector who is near a polling place ought to be afforded the privilege of recording his vote. That is the primary principle which is at issue. But the Leader of the Opposition, asks, " Why do not the Government frame regulations to govern this system of voting, and to prevent corruption?" That was the honorable senator's question, was it not? </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator himself assisted a previous Government to do exactly what we propose to do now. He ought to listen and learn what his own party did, instead of interjecting furiously before he knows what he is talking about. I say that the Government are acting on the advice of their officers, and upon their own common-sense; and they conceive this to be the most effective way of accomplishing the end which they have in view. As soon as the regulations are framed they will be laid upon the table of the Senate, if it be sitting, and if it be not sitting, they will be laid on the table as soon after as possible - long before there is any necessity to put them into operation. So that every honorable senator will see them and have an opportunity to object to them. If he does not choose to avail himself of that opportunity, those regulations will become law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> own judgment ought to suggest to him the character of the regulations which it will be necessary to frame to safeguard the whole Commonwealth against impersonation. One honorable senator opposite has put before us a supposititious case to illustrate the alleged danger of the system which we propose to introduce. He said that John Thompson, an elector for a division in Victoria, might go to the polling booth for which he is enrolled in this State and record his vote, and that away out in the back-blocks of Queensland another man might enter a polling booth and say to the presiding officer, " My name is John Thompson. I am on the roll for an electoral division in Victoria, and I claim the right to vote here." Need I point out that the regulations will provide for such a case as that ? Honorable senators opposite have repeatedly asked why any mark other than that of the Returning Officer of an electoral division should appear upon a ballot-paper. Here is a case in which it may be found necessary to provide that some additional mark shall be placed upon the ballot-paper which is issued to an elector in the back-blocks who claims the right to vote for an electoral division in Victoria. Such a mark will be a general one throughout Australia. Every care will be taken to prevent the identification of the elector so long as the vote is honestly recorded. But if fraud be committed, the additional mark will identify the elector, and when the counterfoil is sent down- - </para>

              <para>- The election cannot be completed until this has been done. Upon its arrival here, it will be compared with the card of the elector, and if the signatures are not found to be identical, an attempt will be made to discover the individual who impersonated John Thompson, of Victoria. But whether he is discovered or not, when the particular paper has been identified, it will be rejected. What more do honorable senators want, unless it be the punishment of the impersonator? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knew all this, or ought to have known it, because, at one time or another, it has all been explained piece by piece by the Minister who had charge of the Bill. I come now to the next great difficulty which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has summarized, and I may be pardoned for occupying a little time on this occasion, seeing that I have not previously spoken on the Bill. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he does not object to Saturday being set apart as the polling day for elections. He is merely anxious about the conscientious scruples of a few poor Hebrews. I sympathise with them very greatly, because I am a bit of a Hebrew myself, but I have no sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> who professes great anxiety upon this score. He comes from a State where Saturday has always been set apart as polling day, and where the poll has closed at 7 p.m. He was a member of a Government which had the power to alter the polling day from Saturday to any other day, and to extend the hour for closing the poll to 8 p.m. But he never attempted reforms of that description.  His  very hint - like all the hints which emanate from him - contained a nasty Christian insinuation </para>

Why is the honorable senator not honest enough to state what is that sinister purpose? He has had opportunities for doing all these things. Any other points to which I refer have already been dealt with so thoroughly that they require no further elucidation. Honorable senators opposite might just as well have allowed the third reading of the Bill to pass without debate, for all the good they will accomplish, because the public of Australia are too wide-awake to be caught by their chaff. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> takes his little handful of salt to cast on the tails of the electors for the purpose of catching them, he must remember that he has now to deal with an educated people, who are quite different from what the people of Australia were twenty or thirty years ago. </para>

This policy is ultimately bound to supersede every rotten policy that may be advanced by any Fusion that may come into existence. What is the policy of the Opposition?

            <para>. - When the Senate adjourned on Friday afternoon I was dealing with the report of the Engineer-in-Chief for Western Australia, and commenting upon his statement that the country to be traversed by the proposed railway for about 1,100 miles is uninhabited, uncultivated, and waterless. Referring again to the speech made by the Minister of Defence in moving the second reading, I find that I was wrong in one particular. He distinctly stated that the line is to go by Tarcoola, and he also spoke of the soil, the water possibilities, and so forth. At page 167 1 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is reported to have said -  </para>

            <para>While I think that we should consider in the light of these reports the character of the country to be served by the railway, I shall show that there is sufficient to justify the construction of the line even if there were no country worthy of development at all in the space intervening between the two terminal points. A railway can be justified in crossing a desert provided you have at each end sufficient reasons why two populated centres should be linked up. It is an undoubted fact that one of the great American overland lines crosses 400 miles of absolutely sterile desert which is of no use, and apparently will never be of any use to anybody. </para>

          <para class="block">Since I spoke on Friday I have received a typewritten letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> W.

            <para>Having some considerable personal knowledge of the country lying between Port Augusta and the Western Australian boundary, I would like to point out how the conditions of that country affect the consideration of the route selected for the preliminary survey, and generally understood to be the route which it is proposed eventually to follow. Fifty miles beyond Tarcoola the desert commences, and extends right up to and beyond the border. There is no feed, and <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> rainfall of about 4 inches only. Therefore, no one will take  up  the country for stock, and there arc no mineral indications of any value. It  has  been urged in favour of the route that it would help to develop the mineralized district of Tarcoola itself. But if that object is of a substantial character it would be better t» attain it by a special line to Tarcoola i run- Port Augusta or from Murat Bay - 130 miles distant. The water difficulty by the proposed route will be enormous. Out of six bores put down by the Government on Nullarbor Plains, not one has yielded water suitable for human consumption, or for locomotive purposes, and only two produce  a  supply which is passable for stock. On the other hand, a line which bore more southerly from Port  Augusta  through the Gawler Ranges  would  traverse a lot of good farming and pastoral country around Chandada. It could then take the place of the Port Lincoln Une from Chandada to west of Fowler's Bay, say, 250 miles. A great and permanent advantage of the route I propose is that it would be sixty miles shorter than the surveyed line. That is an important matter when we consider the initial cost of construction of sixty miles of railway. Not only has the interest on that cost to be borne for ever, but every passenger and ton of goods for all time has to pay for sixty miles  of  unnecessary haulage. When conveying troops the time thereby lost, quite apart from the mere cost, might be serious. By the official route sixty miles of loose drifting sandhills have to be crossed, involving permanent cost in keeping the line clear for traffic. I have been over the coastal country from Chandada to Belladonna. Of this, 250 miles is good farming country, and the rest good grazing land. Again, I have several times travelled inland over the country which the official route traverses, and I have seen nothing worth occupying. It was stated before a Commission which inquired into the matter that within South Australian Territory the official route would serve country that would carry three million sheep. From my personal knowledge of it, I am convinced, as a practical man, that within the next half century it will never carry 30,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, recognised as an expert on such matters, has never hesitated in his place in Parliament or on public platforms to advocate the claims of the coastal as against those of what for convenience I call the official route. Before the Commonwealth is finally committed to such a vast undertaking I would urge that a survey of the coastal and shorter route from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie should be made, and should be accompanied by a detailed report of the value and prospects of that country as compared with those of the official line. Apart from the saving of distance, Eucla would furnish a permanent base from which coal and construction materials could be supplied to the coastal line. Every ton of coal for the official line must be hauled over the railway either from the Kalgoorlie or the Port Augusta end. There is a considerable extent of the country west of Fowler's Bay fit for farming, but if it is_ to be profitably occupied for agriculture, a railway to serve it must eventually be provided. The whole of the Commonwealth is undoubtedly interested in getting absolutely the best route. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr. O'Connor</inline>states that the revenue would be derived from the carriage of  400  passengers each way per week, or  800  in all. I am quite aware that at that time there were fully as many passengers going to and fro by water as there are to-day. But on the. point of cost, the comparison which he instituted would hardly apply to-day, because I understand that the fare by water is more than it was ten years ago. How many of the passengers who travel by the deep-sea boats are likely to get off at Fremantle and not only pay the railway fare, but also pay for their meals while travelling by train to Adelaide or Melbourne, when they have already paid for their carriage by water to that place? Who, I ask the Minister, would care to pay, according to this estimate, an additional sum of <inline font-style="italic">£8</inline> in order to complete the journey by train? </para>

              <para>- Many do, and many do not. I admit that, if a man had to be in Melbourne by a certain date, he would leave the boat at Fremantle, but otherwise he would not take that course, especially in the summer months, to cross the desert in a train. Even the Minister in charge of the Bill has admitted that for a certain distance the railway is likely to be covered up at any time with sand. On our visit of inspection from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, we saw a strip of country similar to that which he recently described to the Senate. There were stone houses which the Government had erected, and which were buried in sand. Our attention was called to the places by the Engineer-in-Chief for South Australia, and also by the Minister of Railways. </para>

              <para>- In one place we saw the top of a chimney, and naturally we concluded that below there was a house. We were told that if we were to come later we might see most of the houses which were then buried in sand. It was stated that, in the course of a month or so, the wind would sweep away the sand, but that it would accumulate again. The houses were in such a state that no person would think of living in them, unless he wished to be buried alive. That was conclusive evidence that it was not the kind of country through which to take a railway at the expense of the Commonwealth. Although troops in transit to the west would be liable to be blocked at any time by the shifting of the sand, yet we are asked by the Minister to build a railway across such country. </para>

We are told that it can be constructed at a certain cost. I propose to quote the views of all the engineers who have had anything to do with the proposal.

              <para>- Yes, I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger was very near being imprisoned because of a statement which appeared in a newspaper. I accept the statement of the Minister of Defence that no such telegram has been sent by the Premier of South Australia, and I shall not dilate upon that matter any further. I must say, however, that there does not appear to be any very great amount of enthusiasm in regard to this line in Western Australia or South Australia. Looking to the press again, I see no evidence of any excitement on the subject. We have no public meetings being called in those States to ask the Commonwealth Government to push on with this railway. I am given to understand that the South Australian Government say that if this line is built on the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge, they will look to the Commonwealth Government to meet the cost of altering the existing gauge of their lines. I should like to ask the Minister of Defence whether that statement is correct? I saw that in a newspaper also. </para>

          <para class="block">All this data was received from officers of the two States that are vitally interested in the construction of the railway. It is wonderful what information the Government' will accept when it suits their purpose, and what information they will refuse if it does not suit their purpose. The information on which this report is based was all accepted in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's time. The Engineers-in-Chief also gave an estimate of the revenue to be derived from the railway, which they estimate to cost£159,000 more than a previous engineering estimate. On this information, the whole of the people of the Commonwealth are to be asked to construct a line that we know nothing whatever about, since no plans and specifications have been laid before us. They estimate that the railway will cost  ^4,559,028  ros.  3d.  They went so close as to include the  3d.,  the previous estimate of the cost was  .£4,400,000.  We are told that the revenue on the opening of the line will be  £205,860.  No pence are mentioned this time. The working expenses are estimated at  ,£1 14,400,  interest at  3  J per cent.  £[159,566,  leaving a deficiency of  £68,106  on the working for the year. Then they looked to the future which, if the railway had been constructed when the report was made would be about this time, and they say that ten years after the opening of the line the revenue will be  £[411,720.  By some legerdemain or sleight-of-hand which is not explained, they reckon upon the revenue more than doubling itself in the ten years. They cannot give us any data upon which to arrive at this estimate. We cannot ask them to do so, because they know no more about it than does the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and that is nothing. They estimate that in ten years from the opening of the line the working expenses will be  £210,000.  Interest on original capital, plus  15  per cent, for improvements at <inline font-style="italic">si</inline> per cent., is put down at  £[183,501,  and these figures give a net profit at the close of ten years' working of  £18,219.  This is offered as a reason for the construction of the railway. Would any man in his senses put his own money into a speculation of that kind? We are asked to make the people of the Commonwealth pay, roughly speaking,  £[5,000,000  for this railway. That is asking them to do too much, when, at the same time, they have to bear the expense of developing their respective States. If honorable members will consult the map of Australia they will find that we have nearly  2,000  miles of coastline without any means of defence. Yet we are asked to build this railway to protect Western Australia. If I believed that it would protect Western Australia I should not hesitate to vote for it, but before they ask the people of the whole of the Commonwealth to tax themselves to build this railway, the people of South Australia and Western Australia ought to try what they can do in the matter themselves. At the present time Queensland is spending  £10,000,000  on the extension of railways. She is not coming to the Commonwealth Government, cap-in-hand, to suggest that these railways are being constructed for military purposes and for the defence of Australia. The people of that State are putting their hands into their own pockets, and financing their own railway proposals. They do not come to this Parliament and say, " These are works of national importance." I quote the following figures showing the indebtedness of the various States in respect of moneys borrowed for the construction of railways : - New South Wales,  £[48,925,348;  Victoria, £43&gt;i42&gt;329; Queensland,  £[24,336.372 ;  South Australia,  £[13,879,523  ; Western Australia,  £11,377,262;  and Tasmania,  £[4,048,416.  There is also  £[1,000,000  for railways in the Northern Territory which the Commonwealth have taken over. I ask honorable senators to say whether it is fair or reasonable to ask a State that, at the expense of its own people, has built a greater mileage of railways per head of population than any other country in the world, to permit her people to be taxed for the construction of a railway, no part of which will be within many hundreds of miles of her borders? </para>

The different States have altogether spent  £147,000,000  in the construction of railways. The population of Western Australia and South Australia combined is about the same as the population of Queensland. Yet Queensland has already constructed a greater mileage of railways than the two States mentioned, and is now spending a further  £10,000,000  on railway extension. Western Australia has spent only  £[11,000,000  on railway construction, whilst Queensland has spent  £[24,000,000. </para>

The honorable senator may sneer, but he does not need to go any further than the election for the division of Boothby, in South Australia, which took place a few weeks ago, to discover how the tide has turned. According to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> volume  4,  page 712, South Australia and Western Australia combined possess about the same population as Queensland, and have spent about the same amount of money in railway construction. Queensland is developing her resources at the expense of her own people. Upon the hustings I pledged myself to oppose the construction of the proposed line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, and if I did not respect my pledge, I should be a renegade to the trust which has been reposed in me. </para>

              <para>- No. The people did not ask me to do that. They are content to accept my word. In an appendix to the report of the Engineers-in-Chief of the States is to be found an estimate of the cost of the labour and material that will be required in the construction of the proposed line. The clearing of the 1,100 miles of country which the line will traverse is set down at£6 per mile. From what I have heard, that is a very fair estimate. Fencing is set down at£1,100. I do not think a fence can be constructed for that sum. The cost of the earthworks is estimated at £280 per mile, which, in my opinion, is a very low estimate. Bridges and culverts are set down at . £150 per mile, and rails at . £7 per ton. Since this estimate was framed the cost of rails has increased a very great deal. I do not suppose that the Minister in charge of the Bill will ask us to believe for one moment that they can be purchased at the same price to-day. </para>

            <para>Memorandum of Instructions to the State Engineers-in-Chief for Railways, assembled at Melbourne this tenth day of February, 1908, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, in connexion with the trial surveys for the purpose of the transcontinental railway line from Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, to Port Augusta, South Australia. </para>
            <para>Gentlemen, </para>
            <para>Since your report of the 27th July,1903, on the proposed transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, to Port Augusta, </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">South Australia, the authority of the Commonwealth for an expenditure of £20,000 on the survey in connexion with the railway above referred to has been given by Act No. 4 of 1907, which provides that- " Upon the formal consent of the South Australian Parliament to the survey being received, the Minister may cause a survey to be made of a route for a railway to connect Kalgoorlie, in the State of Western Australia, with Port Augusta, in the State of South Australia." </para>
          <para class="block">I ask the Minister if any land has been transferred by Western Australia or South Australia to the Commonwealth for the purpose of enabling it to build the proposed line? My information is that no land has been so transferred. Consequently, we are being asked to sanction the construction of a line when the Commonwealth has not an inch of land upon which to build it. I take it that the Minister's silence means that neither Western Australia nor South Australia has transferred any land to the Commonwealth. There are two more reports from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> to which I might refer, but I have no desire to " stone- wall " this measure. I find that New South Wales has 3,643 miles of railways, Victoria 3,480, South Australia 1,912, Northern Territory 145, Queensland 3,661, Western Australia 2,144, and Tasmania, 469, so that 3,661 miles of railway have been built in Queensland at the expense of the people of that State. Consequently, they are justified in saying that if the proposed transcontinental line is of as much importance to Western Australia and South Australia as the Minister would make it appear to be, the people of those States should construct it at their own expense. The citizens of Queensland are prepared to pay their fair share of legitimate taxation. But the construction of this line, and of the other proposed transcontinental railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek will mulct her people in an expenditure of anything from .£1,000,000 to £1,500,000. We are informed that this railway is to be built over a vast tract of country where there is no timber. Queensland has had to build railways into timber country for the purposes of railway construction. But from what source is timber to be obtained for the building of the line between South Australia and Western Australia? It will have to be bought at high prices. All the sleepers and every foot of the rest of the timber will have to be railed from some port on the coast to the route of the railway. I trust that the Senate will see its way, before sanctioning the construction of the line, to obtain guarantees from the South Australian and Western Australian Governments as to how the .taxpayers of the Commonwealth may be recouped in future years. I believe that the Western Australian Government at one time offered to build its share of the line. But South Australia is doing nothing. She is sitting back, expecting to benefit from the expenditure of the other States. I remember the time when every South Australian representative was up in arms in support of the railway. But, for some reason or other which I do not understand, they say nothing now. They know that their State is going to get the best of it. They make no offer, and the Federal Government professes that it in-, tends to carry the work through, no matter at what cost to the Commonwealth. I hope that the representatives of other States will do their best to see that their interests are protected, and that money is not squandered on the line. </para>

              <para>- The earlier reports were prepared merely to enable members of Parliament to give a vote as to whether a survey would be justified or not. Since that time there has been a great change. Not only has the survey been undertaken, and not only has sufficient data been produced to impel the Commonwealth Government to bring in a Bill for the construction of the line, but public opinion has changed. To-day those who supported the survey are prepared to support the construction of the line. I welcome the introduction of this measure, and am very glad indeed to have an opportunity of supporting its second reading. I do so for two reasons - first because it is a matter of national moment and national policy; and secondly, because the Act of this Parliament in giving its imprimatur to the Bill will be a measure of tardy justice to the people of Western Australia, who have long looked for a proposal of the kind. </para>

In answer to him I have to .say that if there were no other motive than national safety, I should ask the opponents of this Bill to pause before casting a vote with the object of defeating the measure or delaying its progress.

              <para>- Well, chiefly. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> in his closing remarks stated that the gauge question was a burning one, particularly with South Australia and Victoria. I recognise the importance of that aspect of the question. But I do not wish it to be understood that in determining the gauge of the transcontinental railway any State has been ignored, or that any State has been given an undue advantage over another. As a matter of fact, when the Commonwealth Government was endeavouring to arrive at a determination as to what gauge should be chosen, every State was consulted. Every State sent a representative to a conference. I refer to the War Railway Council. </para>

          <para class="block">In face of that Council's resolution, I am justified in saying that there was no attempt on the part of the Federal Government to ignore or to take undue advantage of any State. Another War Railway Council meeting was held in May. Again we find the same officers present. Each and every one of them was an expert. On the top of their advice we have that of the Commonwealth consulting engineer. I wish to contrast the advice of those practical men, whose life's work it is to consider these particular matters, with the advice tendered to us by  a  section of the Australian press - particularly of Victoria - and the advice of certain honorable senators. Let me refer for  a  moment to  a  leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the  24th  of this month. It commences by saying that the question of the building of this line is one of national policy and moment; that it is also a question for the States, and that it looked to the Senate as the States' House to conserve the rights of the States. I have always looked upon that newspaper as the guardian of national rights, rather than as the guardian of State rights. But that article struck me as somewhat contradictory in its advocacy of National and State rights at the same time, for I fail to see how it can be considered as a national policy and at the same time conserving State rights. What I think our aim in this discussion should be is to conserve the Commonwealth rights, and to secure the most direct railway service that is possible for man and beast, and the quick despatch of troops between the eastern and western portions of the continent. </para>

              <para>- Engineers may have said so. I am not posing as an engineer, as my honorable friend is aware, but I know that the hauling power of locomotives is being increased almost daily. On the railways of Western Australia I have seen an engine capable of carrying a certain load on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and another engine capable of hauling a greater load on that gauge. I shall quote in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> a statement which appears in one of the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> and which, I think, will verify my statement - </para>

            <para>Wilh regard to the hauling power of locomotives, it is probably not known, except to a few, what development is taking place. Here our heaviest locomotives and tenders weigh together in working order, say, 105 tons. In the United States the builders have succeeded in producing locomotives 500,000, 600,000, and 700,000 lbs. in weight successively. The most recent design is for a locomotive and tender weighing combined 850,000 lbs., or 425 tons American, equal to 378 British tons. Seeing that this result can be achieved with the 4-ft. gauge, is it worth while going to increased expense to adopt a gauge 6£ inches wider? </para>

              <para>- In the western State I have seen cases where the hauling power of the locomotive has been increased without interfering with the gauge. I understand that it is the intention of the Government, if this Bill is passed, to construct the line on the day labour principle. I am very glad that that is their intention. I suggest that they should endeavour to get all the necessary material on a somewhat similar system. It is well known that several thousands of sleepers will be required. </para>

              <para>- I know that representations have been made to the Government that they should enter into negotiations with the two States concerned to procure timber reserves from which they could get the sleepers they require, and thus save the contractor's price. If it is intended to build the line on the day labour principle, why should we not endeavour to get all the material we possibly can on the same principle? If we can obtain from the State Governments reserves in which men will be employed in felling trees, and hewing and shaping sleepers, and sending them direct to the men engaged on the construction of the line, I think it will be found that we shall save a considerable sum. I hold in my hand an estimate as to what may be saved by adopting such a method as that. I will not give the figures as accurate, but they have been supplied to me by a gentleman who is recognised as a very capable engineer.

The next question I desire to discuss is the cost of conversion to the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge as against the.5-ft. 3-in. gauge. Whether we like it or not, we shall shortly be faced with the question of adopting a uniform gauge for Australia, and, therefore, we must consider what the cost will be to convert the present gauges - 5 ft. 3 in., 3 ft. 6 in., or whatever they may be - into a uniform gauge. Once this Bill is passed, I presume it will be necessary that the States shall fall into line. </para>

              <para>- If they refuse to fall into line they will be foolish, but I am picturing to myself the day when the necessity of a uniform gauge for Australia will have to be faced, and I realize the vast difference in the cost of converting the gauges to 4 ft. 8^ in. rather than to 5 ft. 3 in. Honorable senators know perfectly well what that vast difference is, and I need not recapitulate arguments which have been used in that regard. The difference in favour of the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge will be from £2,000,000 to £2,500,000. Honorable senators ought to pause before they commit themselves to a vote which might mean an unnecessary expenditure of money so far as conversion to a uniform gauge is concerned. Following up that question, I desire to refer to a paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> which was presented to Parliament in October last, and which is entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Gauges of Australia and their Unification.'</inline> Despite the fact that every State in the Union has been consulted as to the gauge, that the expert representative of each 'State has indorsed the proposal to build this line on the 4-ft. 8j-in, gauge, and that the Government have gone abroad in order to buttress them in their position, if such buttressing is necessary, we are asked to halt and, as it were, to mark time in order that further inquiry may be made. If we are to travel further afield for fresh information on this subject, I do not know where we are to get it. I might, if I were so disposed, engage the Senate by a reference to the various gauges upon which railways have been constructed in different countries ; but it is sufficient for my purpose to give some totals. I find that there have been 4°7 <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> S°S  miles of railway constructed on the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge, as against 47,659 miles on the 5-ft. 6-in. gauge.

              <para>- It is so small as to be scarcely worth mentioning. Only 7,887 miles of railway have been constructed on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and this represents but 1.27 per cent, of the total railway construction of the world. It is, therefore, quite beyond what is reasonable to ask that we should wait for further inquiries before deciding what shall be the gauge of this railway. I realize that the opposition, if any, to the Bill will centre round the question of gauge. From what I have read and heard on the subejct, I believe the Government have adopted the wisest policy in proposing that it shall be constructed on the 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge, in the hope that that will become the uniform gauge throughout Australia. I have nothing to add, except to appeal to the Senate to pass this Bill in its entirety, and, by so doing, hasten the day when we shall be able to say of this Commonwealth, that really and truly we are one people, with one flag and one destiny. </para>

            <para>. - I should regret to prolong the debate, but that it appears to me that some points in connexion with this matter have not been as fully developed as they might have been. I do not propose to discuss details of the weight of engines or the weight of rails, but I do think that the Senate should consider whether, as a matter of policy, this is a line which ought to be built. We know that the South Australian Parliament have passed a measure which restricts the Commonwealth Parliament to follow South Australian lines to a certain extent. So far Western Australia has not passed any such law, and I honestly believe that the people of that State are more anxious for the construction of this line than are the people of South Australia. To suggest that, as a matter of policy, the Commonwealth should build this line to develop Australia in the ordinary sense of the term, is to suggest that we should go beyond our duties under the Constitution. It is true that the Constitution lays it down that, with the consent of a State the Commonwealth' can build railways; but that undoubtedly means that we can build railways for the purpose of defence. If it could be shown that this railway is necessary for the. defence of Australia, it should be built, whatever sacrifices might have to be made to accomplish its construction. Let us consider the proposal from the point of view of defence. Lord Kitchener's report has several times been referred to as the best possible text from which the necessity for the construction of this line can be proved. I venture to say that nineteen out of every twenty Australians who read Lord Kitchener's report, particularly in relation to railway construction, have misunderstood it. He said in his report - </para>

          <para class="block">What does he mean by " interior connexion " ? He undoubtedly referred to the fact that we have been building lines all round Australia, where they might be easily seized by an enemy who could secure a landing, whilst the interior termini of our lines have not been connected. At the present time it is proposed to connect the interior railway termini in Queensland, and this applies also to some extent . to New South Wales and South Australia. We have built the circumference, so to speak, and the spokes inwards, but have never connected the spokes in the interior. That was what Lord Kitchener referred to in his report. We have the exterior connexion now from Adelaide to Rockhampton, in Queensland ; but it is the interior connexion of our railway termini that Lord Kitchener clearly referred to. </para>

              <para>- I am not my brother's keeper. I do not know what my colleagues may have said, and I do not particularly care. I take it that we are not supposed to follow each other in the discussion of a matter of this kind like sheep going through a gate. Are we to understand that this .Bill is to be made a party measure, pure and simple? I remind the Senate that it is not easy to reconcile some of the remarks which have been made by members of the party opposite. It seems to me that, by adopting the route proposed for this line, we shall not be complying with Lord Kitchener's recommendation to link up our interior connexions. It will not be admitted that I am right at any time, but the Minister of Defence, if he looks into the matter, and studies the secret information imparted to him by the higher Imperial officials, will recognise that Lord Kitchener objected to the construction of railways close to the coast where they might be cut by an enemy. </para>

              <para>- It appears to have been left out of the expurgated and bowdlerized publication of Lord Kitchener's report. I believe the line should be taken very much further inland. It is an absolute source of danger to run our lines close to the coastline. So far as the defence of Western Australia is concerned the construction of this railway might be postponed for the next twenty years, or until Australia has a navy capable of defending her shores. We shall only need to put troops into Western Australia from the east, or bring troops from the west to to the east, when we have lost command of the sea. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator should know that it is impossible to construct railway lines in such a way as to meet an enemy attempting a landing at any possible place. I refer the honorable senator to a report on this matter made by Admiral Creswell in 1905 or 1906 to the Commonwealth Government. He points out how utterly impossible it is to imagine that we can handle troops on land in such a way that they will be able to meet an invading party wherever they may attempt to land. The question of gauge has been raised, and a good deal has been made of it. I notice that the fight has been in a most cheerful manner between Victoria and South Australia combined and New South Wales. Stephenson, the original inventor of railways, said that if he had not been making engines of a gauge of 4 ft.8¾ in., I think it was, he would have liked to have had a line of a few inches wider gauge. That may be some consolation to our Victorian friends who have adopted the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. </para>

              <para>- No, he favoured a few inches wider than 4 ft. in. But Stephenson has been very dead now for a long time, and conditions have altered since his time. I ask 'honorable senators to recollect that we are now being invited to pay for a gauge which will probably be out of all proportion to our requirements for many years to come. I have heard the mileage quoted of the railways which have been constructed in India, upon various gauges, and I hold in my hand a copy of the report of the Secretary of the Railway Department of Queensland, who has just returned from a visit to that country. As a matter of fact, he was called back rather hurriedly owing to the death of the Railways Commissioner of that State.  His  report is dated11th August of the present year. Whilst he was in India he made inquiries in all directions, and upon page 2 of his report he gives the mileage of the different gauges which have been laid down in that country up to 31st December, 1909. He says that on that date there were31,490 miles of railway open to traffic, and that the mileage of the different gauges was as follows: - 5 ft. 6 in., 16,309 miles; 3 ft.3¾ in., 13,323 miles; 2 ft. 6 in., 14,445 miles; 2 feet, 415 miles. It will be seen, therefore, that practically 48 per cent. of the whole mileage of railways in India has been constructed upon a gauge of less than 5 ft. 6 in. Further, there is not a single railway in that country built upon the gauge that it is proposed to adopt upon the line which forms the subject of this Bill. These figures relate to a country which possesses an enormous area, and in which the railways, although they did not pay a few years ago, are paying handsomely now. If honorable members wish to know something more about the railways of India, I would refer them to a volume of Lord Curzon's speeches. I have no desire to quote these at any length, but I wish to show how Lord Curzon, in his view of transcontinental lines, entertained the same view as Lord Kitchener. Amongst other things, he said - </para>

Indeed, I would like to go farther, and to free railway policy and finance. from many of the shackles by which it is now hampered.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The figures supplied by the Secretary of the Railway Department of Queensland, which I have already quoted, show that they have been exceeded. Let me also remind honorable senators of what Foster Fraser said in reference to the Siberian railway. He declared that, while the Russian Government had found it necessary to duplicate that line, they did not propose to widen the gauge. For military purposes they evidently consider that the gauge is all  right. The only trouble with which they have to contend is that which we might experience if we endeavoured to convey troops for long distances over a single line. Otherwise there appears to be no ground for supposing that a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge would not meet all requirements. I ask honorable senators to divest their minds of the idea that a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge is the standard gauge, and to recollect that in Australia there is a greater mileage of lines on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge than there is upon any other. A similar remark is applicable to South. Africa. That gauge is recognised as the cheapest and best for pioneering purposes. Yet we are asked in this Bill to determine the gauge of the proposed transcontinental line. Assuming that we do so, what will happen? In the first place, Western Australia will have to widen the gauge of her line from Perth to Kalgoorlie, and also to widen the existing tunnels and culverts. South Australia, too, will have to convert her 5- ft. 3-in. gauge between Adelaide and the border to 4 ft. 8J in., whilst Victoria will be obliged to convert her line from the South Australian border to Melbourne, and from Melbourne to Albury. Then, unless New- South Wales will complete the north-west coast line within a reasonable time, Queensland will have to widen her line <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Little and Big Liverpool Ranges to Toowoomba, thence to Warwick, through the rough country to Wallangarra. That is to say, the whole of that length of railway will have to be converted from a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge to a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge. The tunnels and culverts will have to be enlarged before a train can reach Brisbane without a break of gauge. </para>

No estimates have been made of the probable earnings of the line. It is said that the engineers have supplied an estimate. But what do they know of its probable earnings ? We want the opinion of some persons in authority. Before we finally decide upon a particular gauge this question should be carefully inquired into. Although the Commonwealth may construct the proposed line on a 4-ft.8½-in. gauge, it has no power to compel Victoria, South Australia, or Queensland to convert their existing main trunk lines to that gauge. As a matter of fact, Western Australia has promised to convert her line, but only in this morning's newspapers I read that the Premier of South Australia has said that though the Commonwealth may build this railway upon the 4-ft.8½-in. gauge, he has made up his mind to adhere to the old gauge. </para>

              <para>- This Bill says one thing, and yet the Government are acting under the authority of an Act of South Australia, which says something entirely different. The Vice-President of the Executive Council may laugh as much as he likes, but I am anxious that the Commonwealth should not be robbed for the benefit of the few people, whose lands will be enhanced in value because the Commonwealth is going to build a railway. It behoves the Government to look into this matter, and see that a blunder is not made ; or, if a blunder has been made, the sooner it is rectified the better. I also think that the Government should have brought before us some definite policy, or some statement as to what the railway is going to cost. We should have known something about the Department that is to control the construction of this, and other railways. I say frankly that if £[4,500,000, or whatever the sum may be, is to be handed over to the present Minister of Home Affairs, who usually manages the kite-flying business of the Government, it will be a matter of very great regret. We do not know what the expenditure will be, or anything else that is definite. </para>

              <para>- I was speaking not of aeroplanes, but of kite-flying ; and the kite-flying of this Government is the monopoly of the Minister of Home Affairs. I should be perfectly satisfied if I could be assured that the management of the building of this railway was to be in the hands of a common-sense man like the Minister of Defence. But it is certainly a matter for regret that a business matter of this kind, in which millions of pounds are involved, should be undertaken without Parliament being given so much as an indication as to what authority is to have the spending of the money. Parliament is entitled to have that information before it authorizes the expenditure. This is one of those slipshod pieces of business that has become common ever since 13th April, 1910. </para>

              <para>- No ; I cannot forget it, because ever since the Government have been plundering Trust Funds, and doing all sorts of things that they should not have done. I am not asking anything unreasonable when I request that we shall be furnished with information of a detailed character. We, as representatives of the people, have to go back to our constituents, and. justify the taxation that will be laid upon them to carry out this work. We should be able to tell the people what the work will cost, and how it is to be carried out. As far as we can learn, the Commonwealth is to be pledged to something like £4,500,000 on building a railway close to the coast, where an enemy could smash it at any time, and through a desert where we shall probably have to keep a large staff of men employed to prevent the sand from hiding the railway after it is built. </para>

Even at this late hour of the day, even after Parliament has authorized the construction of this railway, the members of the Senate ought to reconsider the situation, which is attempted to be created by the present Bill.

              <para>- My opinion is that, no matter if we had 50,000 miles of railway, our position, from the defence point of view, would not be one whit better than it is now. What we want for the purpose of defence is more population. When we have more people in Australia, then we shall be in a better position to defend ourselves against foreign aggression. Having come to that conclusion, I ask myself how many persons this precious railway of 1,000 miles in length, and estimated to cost £5,000,000, is going to settle on the soil of the Commonwealth? Will it settle one person per mile of its length? </para>

              <para>-The honorable senator says " Yes," but he knows just as much about the matter as the man in the moon, and that is nothing. If we are going to estimate the settlement along the line by the territory through which it will pass, I think I am very safe in saying that, at the very most, it will not settle more than 10,000 persons. What is the nature of this country ? Everybody knows that it is practically country at which even a squatter will not look. It is, to all intents and purposes, a desert; no one can say anything else. It is within a reasonable distance of the coast, and if it had been anything like useful country I am sure that it would have been settled a long time ago. In the 1,000 miles of its length, I do not believe that there are a dozen settlers. Yet the Commonwealth is asked to spend a huge sum - a sum which, I think, might be very profitably expended in other directions, and in other portions of the Commonwealth - in building a line which is not going to be of the slightest use, either to the Commonwealth as a whole or to the people of Western Australia. I have np doubt that we shall be told that Western Australia wants this railway. Of course every State, every municipality, every shire council, every tin-pot place in the Commonwealth wants public money expended in its particular locality. Western Australia is just like other portions of the Commonwealth. What the Western Australians, and the South Australians, too - for they are both in the one boat - say, I have no doubt, is this : " This railway will cost £5,000,000. The money will be spent within our boundaries, some of it is bound to stick to our fists, and, therefore, of course, we are in favour of the expenditure. The Commonwealth will bear the burden; we will reap the benefit, and all will be well." Again, if the line is ever built, it will have to be kept in good running condition, whether there is any traffic or not, and I believe that that expense will be very large. The country to be traversed is more or less a desert, with, I believe, a large amount of drifting sand. That being the case, the sand plough will, I suppose, have to be kept going constantly, whether passenger or other trains are run or not. I think it is something approaching a national crime to waste public money in this fashion - money which, as I have said, might be very much more profitably utilized in other directions. If we 'want to strengthen Australia for defence purposes, our policy is obvious. Let us get more people settled on the soil and create industries. That, it appears to me, would be a much more serviceable policy with regard to the defence of Australia than the mere building of a railway through a desert. That is one reason why I oppose this proposal, and ask the members of the Senate, notwithstanding what has been done hitherto, to, even at this late hour, throw it out, and show its capability of rising to the height of useful patriotism. We have reports here, and, of course, we know' that they are more or less coloured by the wishes of the Government of the day. When you are dealing with public servants, you get, in nine cases out of ten, the kind of report which they think you want. It is just the same as when you consult a lawyer ; he tries to find out, first, the kind of opinion which you are anxious to get, and then he gives it to you. </para>

              <para>- I have had very little experience, I am thankful to say; but I have profited by that of other persons. I do not think that this railway will settle many persons on the soil, for the simple reason that the country is not suitable for settlement. Therefore, I am of opinion that it will be exceedingly unprofitable for the Commonwealth to build it. We have an estimate of revenue and expenditure. I do not know the principle on which the engineers or the writers of this report proceeded in framing their estimate. </para>

              <para>- No ; the engineers do not know anything about the revenue. They have calculated it at about £200 per mile, but I do not know where they are going to get it. I think I am very safe in saying that very few of the people of Western Australia will patronize the line in any shape or form. They certainly will not get their goods from the eastern portion of Australia by that means, because they can get them carried very much more cheaply by steamer to Fremantle, and distributed from there by the existing railways in Western Australia. The passenger traffic across the proposed line will be very small indeed. In fact, I believe that the bulk of the traffic will be composed of the carriage of members of Parliament, who will go across on their free passes, simply because the Government will not pay their fares by steamer. If they could get a steamboat passage to Fremantle, I am sure that they would very much prefer to travel by water to being hurled 1,000 or 1,500 miles across a trackless desert. </para>

              <para>- It is a very small Bight. I have been trying to discover in Queensland a railway that will bear comparison with the proposed line, even in the faintest way. I have not been able to get one which I could fairly say is on similar lines. But I have found one which I may cite, and that is a line from a place called Julia Creek in North Queensland to Cloncurry. That part of the country is known to Senators Givens, Sayers, and St. Ledger. </para>

              <para>- That is the very word that I wanted. A Labour Government cannot always do right. Any Government in Western Australia will be compelled by the wishes of the electors to give facilities for people to travel westward to Perth and Fremantle, so that as much of their money as they can get out of them will be spent there, rather than that they should travel eastward along the Commonwealth line. From whatever point of view one examines this matter, the only conclusion which can be arrived at is that the line will not pay its way for at any rate fifty years. At least, that is the opinion at which I have deliberately arrived, although I may be wrong. There may be some remarkable discovery of gold and minerals. </para>

              <para>- No, it is just drifting sand. It is not fit for agricultural, pastoral, or mineral development. What in the name of goodness is it fit for ? It is country that, if Western Australia were left to herself, she would never seek to develop, because she would know perfectly well that it could not be profitably done. But the Commonwealth has a broad back and a long purse. If the Commonwealth has not the money in its purse, it knows where to find it, and the people of Australia will be able, if they are not very willing, to bear the burden. </para>

I did not drag in the sugar industry, but as it has been dragged into the discussion I may be permitted to say that we are paying just a trifle more per pound for our sugar in Australia than the people are paying in Free Trade Great Britain.

              <para>- Yes, in Queensland we built our railways ourselves. We borrowed the money for the purpose, and it has not yet been paid back, but we did build our own railways, and gradually settled the country. That is an example which I think Western Australia, might very well be asked to follow. We have heard a great deal about the wealth of Western Australia. We are told that she is the richest State in the Commonwealth, and yet she comes begging at the gate of the Commonwealth, beseeching the people of the rest of Australia to build a railway for her. </para>

              <para>- Though I should object, in any case, to the Commonwealth building railways purely for State purposes I could see some reason, some sense, and some profit in this proposal if it could be shown that the railway would develop country and settle people upon the soil. But to build a railway through country of this character seems to me to be the height of madness. What is more, it will, if constructed, be a highway for some enemy to enable them to cross this desert waste in comfort, whereas, if this country were left without railway communication the march of the enemy across this desert would be like the march of Napoleon from Moscow. I am not going to say anything about the gauge. </para>

If it was their own they were dealing with, I do not suppose they would put sixpence into such a proposal. I do not suppose that there is an honorable senator in this chamber to-night who would put sixpence of his own money into this railway. But we are dealing with the money of the Commonwealth, and some honoraBle senators are prepared to throw £5,000,000 away on a scheme like this. </para>

              <para>- I am taking the estimate of the supporters of this proposal. I believe, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> that it will cost very much nearer £6,000,000. Goodness knows, the Commonwealth bill of costs is mounting up with alarming rapidity, and, so far as I can discover, this railway will only result in an annual charge upon the Commonwealth of at least £100,000, and that for a period of anything from twenty to fifty years. Honorable senators should consider seriously before they embark upon an undertaking of this character. They ought to view every aspect of the question, and .try to find out for themselves whether this proposal is likely to be for the benefit of the people of Australia. I think the statement cannot be made too often that if the defence argument is of any value at all, what we want for the defence of Australia is more people. How many people will the spending of this £[5,000,000 settle upon the soil. There are parts of Australia where, if we spend £500,000,000 on the settlement of the land, we should be able to settle probably 200,000 persons. We cannot settle 10,000 people in this country. So far as I can see, from the point of view of defence, this line will be of very little value at all. </para>

              <para>- Yes, the sand will be continually drifting over it, and we shall require to have gangs of men always going east and west to keep it clear. I believe it will cost a great deal of money per annum to keep this line clear of sand. Whether there is any traffic, little traffic or no traffic on it, the expense of maintenance will always continue. The cost of maintaining the line from Julia Creek to Cloncurry was about £170 a mile, whilst the income was £220 per mile. A very low estimate of the cost of maintaining this line will be £170 per mile. Whichever way one looks at it, the only apparent conclusion is that it will result in  a  very large annual deficit. The report of the Engineers-in-Chief estimates the deficit for one year at £68,000. That is a very large deficiency per annum for the people of the Commonwealth to have to meet in addition to the other obligations upon the Treasury. But when we double that, and say that the annual deficit will be from £100,000 to £120,000 or £130,000, the matter becomes serious, and honorable senators should pause before committing the people to such an alarming annual payment. I intend to vote against the second reading of this Bill. I have been against this proposal from the beginning. I have never yet heard an argument or read of a fact which would induce me to alter my mind on the subject. I do not believe in these wild-cat schemes. I think that nations as well as individuals should be particularly careful as to how they spend their money. I think the money spent on this railway will be wasted. Five millions sterling of Commonwealth money will be engulfed and swallowed up in the sands of this desert. Some day we may have to send an expedition out to look for the railway. It will be covered up with sand, and no one will know where it is. I trust that the majority of the members of the Senate will vote with me against the second reading of this Bill, and thus show that they are capable of looking after the interests of the Commonwealth sometimes. </para>

The honorable senator pointed out that in his opinion the Government had misunderstood Lord Kitchener's advice with regard to the railway systems of Australia as part of a defence system, and he made out his case. But the Minister of Defence suggested by interjection that Lord Kitchener had advised the construction of this railway presumably from a defence point of view. I, by interjection in reply to the Minister, pointed out that that utterance of Lord Kitchener was an after-dinner utterance. </para>

              <para>- Honorable senators are welcome to put any construction they please upon that remark of mine. I made it plain at the time that I used the term " after-dinner speech," in order that it might be clearly understood that Lord Kitchener's remarks on that occasion were certainly not official. With every respect for Lord Kitchener I do not propose to qualify that statement in any way. Whilst entirely disclaiming any sinister construction which may be placed upon my remark, I say, without hesitation, that on the occasion in question, Lord Kitchener was like the Greek shoemaker, in that he went somewhat beyond his last. In other words, he was good enough to make certain observations on the railway policy of this country entirely apart from defence matters. I repeat that his utterance was not an official one ; but I do think that, when he mentioned matters relating to the railway policy of the States and of the Commonwealth, he went somewhat outside his province. That policy exclusively concerns the States and the Commonwealth. In matters of defence, we invite the opinions of such experts as Lord Kitchener, and give them the weightiest consideration. Except for the strongest reasons, there is scarcely a tittle of any policy connected with naval or military defence which they may promulgate that we would not thankfully receive and adopt. But railway matters, apart from defence, concern us alone. There are two or three outstanding features connected with this Bill which must arrest the attention of everybody. The first is that neither the Minister himself, nor a single supporter of the Government, has given the slightest reason why the proposed railway should be undertaken. It is true that its construction has been urged upon what have been described as " national " grounds. Now, the word " national " reminds me of the blessed word " Mesopotamia." It is a glorious word when used in the right place at the right time. But I would remind honorable senators that that which is national must be supported by business. We know, from the varying opinions of experts, that the cost of constructing this so-called " national " undertaking will be from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000. Allowing for the difference between official estimates and the actual cost based upon past experience, it is not unreasonable to assume that the cost of the proposed line will be anything from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000. This project has been in the melting-pot of Federal politics for the past ten years, and yet the Government have not given the slightest indication of where the money for its construction is to be obtained, how it is to be raised, and when it is to be paid. </para>

              <para>- That is a very sore point with the honorable senator, and I can quite understand why he is so perturbed about it. If he were acquainted with the politics of the various States, he would know that every honorable senator representing Queensland is, more or less, pledged to use all the forms of Parliament, without abusing them, in his opposition to this Bill. We are bound to give effect to our pledges. We are bound - even though we may do so by a silent vote - to justify to the Commonwealth of Australia the attitude of the citizens of Queensland. Otherwise Parliament would cease to be a deliberative assembly. More than that, every honorable senator has a right to speak at some length upon this question, seeing that it is out of the pockets of the people of the various States that the money to pay for the construction of this line must come. Any representative of Queensland would be faithless to his duty if he did not seek to give full effect to his pledge. It has been the custom, ever since railways were constructed by the States of Australia - from the turning of the first sod of the first line - for fairly minute particulars as to route, probable cost, revenue, expenditure, and difficulties of construction to be laid before Parliament. In New South Wales and Victoria no line  10  miles in length could be constructed without a report from a Committee, called in one case a Public Works Committee, and in the other a Standing Committee on Railways. That is done in order that when Parliament authorizes the construction of a line, a body of information shall be brought together, founded upon evidence by the best experts obtainable, so that the representatives of the people may know all the particulars that can be furnished to them on the subject. Parliament, under that system, has the benefit of full criticism and of all available facts before it authorizes the expenditure of a penny. Similar safeguards prevail, to a greater or a lesser extent, in every State. Further than that, there are members of the State Parliaments who are more or less personally acquainted with the districts through which proposed railways have to pass. But no such safeguards have been provided for this Parliament in reference to the railway under consideration. I am at a loss to know why the Government should, towards the end of a hard session, desire to force this Bill through Parliament. Do Ministers mean to say that if we were to take proper time for the discussion of every detail any material injury would be done to the Commonwealth ? As- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> remarked, the railway certainly will not benefit Australia during the next six or eight months. I am glad that a voyage to the Antipodes has brought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> round to an appreciation of my point of view with regard to immigration. It is certain that  20,000  or  30,000  extra people settled in Western Australia would do more to safeguard this country from invasion than this railway would do, even though it were built in a month or two, with the aid of the magical lamp of Aladdin. What great interest in Australia would suffer if this proposition were hung up until the next session of Parliament. If, during the recess, Ministers devoted themselves to obtaining full information in regard to the route itself, the cost of construction, the probable revenue to be derived, and the estimated working expenses, nothing but good would flow from their efforts. Parliament, indeed, ought to insist upon that being done. I appeal to the supporters of the Ministry, who feel as I do with regard to this Bill, to refuse to assist them in forcing the measure through upon such meagre information on two or three of the most essential points. What interest, national or material, is going to be served by authorizing the construction of this railway upon imperfect information? </para>

            <para>I venture to say that few railways have been so much discussed, so much inquired into, so much thought over as this particular line.

          </quote>
          <para>Mark the words, " all the advantages and disadvantages." That is a somewhat remarkable expression. If there is one attribute which distinguishes the Minister of Defence, especially when he is charged with the responsibility of introducing a Bill, it is that he weighs his words pretty carefully. When he used the word " disadvantages," I thought it peculiarly appropriate. I took it  that he referred to the disadvantage that the Senate should be asked to vote for a project involving millions of money on indefinite and insufficient information. It certainly is a disadvantage to have to deal with a matter of this magnitude under the circumstances in which it is presented to us. If it does not mean that, it must have this construction - and possibly it is the only alternative construction which can be put upon it - that the information which we do possess, with regard to the character of the country, is such as to make us certain that this line will be a permanent loss to the country, so far as it is a developmental railway. I was loath to think that, notwithstanding the reports I have read, until the Minister put it in that way. But having read since the beginning of this debate the reports on the territory I can quite understand that, possibly that interpretation of the word " disadvantages " may be the one which the Minister meant. How singular then if either interpretation is correct, and especially the latter one, does this proposal stand out as against proposals which are brought down by a State Government for approval. I have never heard of a State Government, and seldom of a State party, saying that a proposed railway would be a disadvantage to the State. The Government are prepared to prove that most of the railways included in their works policy will be a decided advantage to the country, and not a. disadvantage or an evil. When the Minister asked us, in the light of the discussion and the information we possess, to consider the advantages and the disadvantages, and further, when he spoke of the benefits and the evils which would follow, he practically admitted to the Senate that this railway will be more or less a permanent incubus upon the taxpayers. Reading the whole of his speech it is evident that he has almost come to this conclusion - he almost expressed it in direct words - that, if it were not for its relation to the defence policy he could not recommend this proposal to the Senate. And, first and last, its construction depends on the fact that it may, possibly will, be part of the defence policy. In no other way can his remarks be interpreted. Let us consider the hazy estimates of revenue and expenditure which have been given by competent authorities from time to time in order to see what a leap in the dark, from the defence point of view, we are asked to take. In 1901 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> E. O'Connor, who was then Chief </para>
          <para class="block">Engineer of Western Australia, estimated the cost at about £[4,400,000. He was a very competent authority, and I believe the author of a daring and most useful scheme for bringing water down to Kalgoorlie. Judged in the light of that achievement I should say that, from the engineering point of view, his opinion was equal to that of any man in Australia. In a subsequent report I think he modified his estimate by admitting that he had not allowed £[200,000 a year for the interest on the cost of construction. An Engineers' Conference, which sat some time afterwards, made an estimate of £[4,559,000, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> estimated the cost at £[4,045,000. According to his last report, if internal combustion engines are used, the cost will be brought down to £[3,839,000. Nobody seems to know what internal combustion engines are. With all respect! to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> not even he himself seems to know. It is said that very learned men at times become very childish, and when the consulting engineer of the Commonwealth solemnly reduces an estimate of £4,°45&gt;000 to £3,839,000 on the supposition of the possibility of internal combustion engines being used- </para>

          <para class="block">If the country was able to carry sheep, there must have been some population to look after them. This kind of report writing is more or less an insult to the Senate, and not creditable, as to accuracy at any rate, to the writer. According to this sentence, the country having been taken up for sheep runs, there are no sheep there and no population. What was the intention in penning that sentence? It was to convey the impression that sheep runs were taken up, that the sheep were there, and would provide a population just as wherever sheep have been settled in other parts of Australia settlement has followed the sheep, and a railway has followed in their wake. We know, as a matter of fact, that if sheep runs were taken up west of Tarcoola they were abandoned, and that the whole country between Tarcoola and Port Augusta is more or less a desert.

            <para>On the Nullabor Plains the State Government of Western Australia have carried out boring operations with success. At No. 3 bore on the railway route 344 miles from Kalgoorlie water was struck between 1,270 and 1,344 feet in beds of fine and coarse sand with hard bands and granite boulders, with hard granite at the bottom. The water stands in the bore about 420 feet from surface; there is a large supply, and it is of good quality, no salt, a little hard, but it is considered that it would be good for boiler purposes. </para>

              <para>- I am very happy to be able to say that neither the Commonwealth Government nor the Government of Western Australia desire to bring any people from the Old Land to this particular country. There are millions of acres of good land in Western Australia on which it is possible to settle hundreds of thousands of people. These remarks  bear upon an observation made by the Minister of Defence. If Western Australia does as the eastern States are doing, and fills up her available territory with people, I have no doubt that Australia will be able to consider the expenditure involved in the construction of a connecting line between the East and the West through this desert country. But the State Government of Western Australia are, no doubt, bringing pressure to bear upon the Commonwealth Government to commence the work of settlement at the wrong end. No more pertinent observation on this point could be made than that which was made by the Minister of Defence when he said that we need not regard the nature of the country between terminal points if, when they are connected, sufficient traffic can be developed between them to pay for the cost of the construction of the line over the unprofitable area. That is a sound, economic proposition which most Railways Commissioners would indorse, and it is justified by the past experience of Australia in railway construction. The Minister has pointed out how and when this railway might be considered from a business point of view, and might be submitted to this Parliament for serious consideration. When the Government of Western Australia have further proceeded with the work of settling the State as they. are settling the districts about Kalgoorlie, no one will be disposed to refuse to consider a business proposition for the construction of a railway bridging the continent. But the Government of Western Australia desire that the Commonwealth should take the whole risk in this matter, and the Minister of Defence is disregarding the economic proposition he submitted himself. I should like, by leave of the Senate, to be allowed to continue my remarks at the next sitting. </para>

          <para class="block">I defy any honorable senator to consider all these reports and say that it has not been abundantly proved that this railway will be one of the most difficult financial propositions ever submitted to a Parliament. I shall say only a few words on a matter arising out of the engineering propositions for the conversion of the gauges of our railways. A great battle is raging around that point. The engineering problem is whether lines on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge should be converted to a gauge of 4- ft. 8J-in., or whether what might be called the standard gauge of the Commonwealth - 4-ft. 8j-in. - should be converted to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. In 1897 a conference met to determine the relative cost of the conversion of gauges. It is clear from this that before Federation the State Governments anticipated that a standard gauge would have to be adopted, and that one or two transcontinental lines would have to be constructed, and probably whether Federation was accomplished or not. As a matter of economic necessity, the State Governments were considering the construction of transcontinental lines, and were driven to consider at the same time the cost of the conversion of gauges. In 1897 there were 7,849 miles of railways constructed in Australia. Our railway mileage to-day extends to 15, 466 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> miles. The engineers reported that to convert the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railways to 5-ft. 3-iri. gauge would cost £4,260,000 ; but that to convert the 5- ft. 3-in. gauge railways to the 4-ft.  8£-in.  gauge would cost only £2,360,000. That is to say, that there would be a saving of about £2,000,000 in the conversion of railways on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge with a mileage of 7,849 miles. As our mileage of railway construction has since almost doubled what it was at the time the report to which  1  refer was written, it follows that the conversion of the existing 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge railways to a gauge of 5 ft. 3 in. would involve an additional cost of about £3,500,000 as compared with the cost of converting the 5-ft. 3-in. to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. If we are to enter into the battle of the gauges, that point must be seriously considered. Honorable senators must understand that the cost of conversion in any case will be immensely expensive ; and if it is to be increased by £3,500,000 in order to secure a conversion of the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge to the 5-ft. 3- in. gauge, the proposition will be almost economically impossible. The State Governments in 1897 evidently considered the possibility of a transcontinental railway connecting Perth with Brisbane, and the 4- ft. 8j-in. gauge "was recommended,, probably because that was the gauge adopted by the State of New South Wales and it would be less expensive to convert the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railways to that gauge. This recommendation was made long before the Federal Parliament had' assembled, and it is clear that the State Governments must have considered the question from this point of view. </para>

              <para>- When we consider that the lowest cost at which a line upon the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge has been constructed is slightly less than £3,000 per mile, and when we recollect that that line traverses well-settled, well-watered, and well-wooded country, whereas the proposed transcontinental railway will be constructed through country where there is practically no water and no wood, we must recognise that the cost of building it will considerably exceed £3,000 per mile. We have also to remember that the wages which will have to be paid will be 20 or 30 per cent, higher than those which were allowed for when the estimate was made, in addition to which the price of material has advanced 40 per cent. </para>

              <para>- The break of gauge does not affect the question very materially. The report was directed chiefly to the supposed demerits of the 3- ft. 6-in. gauge. I think that those figures were entirely misleading. In support of my statement I would point out that last year 13,259,000 passengers, or 1,100,000 per month, or 35,000 per day, were carried over the Queensland railways. The average length of the journey was 79 miles. That number of passengers was carried under the ordinary time-table and with the ordinary engines. Upon  a  4- ft. 8½-in. gauge it is possible to carry more passengers daily, and only an expert of a certain character would suggest that in time of war, with the assistance of the whole of the engines of the States, we could not carry more than 30,000 troops daily over the two gauges. I do not altogether rely on the railway reports, but rather on the authority of one of the ablest railway transport agents in the Commonwealth. When I spoke to him he told me that if the officers of the Department did not know more about defence than they did about railway transport, they should be relegated to a position where they would be of less danger to the national safety. He went on to say that with a 3-ft. 6-in gauge he could, with the consent of the New South Wales railway authorities, shift 100,000 troops from Sydney to Longreach. A great deal of twaddle has been talked about gauges; but, apart altogether from that, I shall, for the reasons I have given, oppose this Bill at the second-reading and at every other stage. </para>

            <para>- I do not include the Opposition, because they have done all they could to prevent the conclusion of business in that time. I think now, however, they are taking a different stand, and I am sure they will assist the Government in carrying out our intentions. The business yet to come before the Senate includes the Commonwealth Bank Bill, the further consideration of the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Railway Bill, and a Bill to give the public servants of the Commonwealth the opportunity to bring any dispute or grievance they may have before the Arbitration Court. We are getting on very well with the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Railway Bill, and I make no accusation whatever against honorable senators opposite of any " stone wall " in this connexion. Then we have the Seamen's Compensation Bill which was passed by the House of Representatives in a few minutes, and should certainly not occupy us for more than an hour or two. Following that there are short measures dealing with private telephones, the creation of Commonwealth stock, the amending of the Act relating to the note issue, naval defence, and post and .telegraph rates. Then the Government have some announcement to make regarding their policy in the Northern Territory, the establishment of Commonwealth offices in London, and the Capital site, together with one or two other small matters. None of those measures, except the first three, should occupy any length of time; and we have three weeks before we need adjourn for Christmas. The progress of this week will be noted, and next week, if necessary, we shall meet in the forenoon, and on the following week on the Monday. I hope honorable senators opposite will give all the assistance they possibly can, for otherwise, it will be necessary to extend the session into next year. I am- not anxious to take a step of that kind; and I am sure that honorable senators opposite, if they expressed their minds honestly, would tell us that they have no desire to meet after Christmas, always providing, of course, that the work can be completed. T have only to say that if the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters find that the Minister of Defence or myself get a little irritable in our anxiety to make progress, they will excuse us, because I am sure that if they occupied our places they would exhibit the same desire for expedition. </para>

          <para>. - I am sure that honorable senators are obliged to the Vice-President of the Executive Council for his extremely interesting statement. Honorable senators on this side will, in the future, as in the past, be extremely anxious to assist the Government in the despatch of business, but it requires a larger swallow than I have to accept the statement that we are expected to pass this long list of measures at the rate of something like one per day. The announcement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council was combined with something which amounts to a threat. We have been told that it is the intention of the Government to practically force these measures through at such a rate that it will be impossible for honorable senators, individually or collectively, to subject them to the consideration they call for. </para>

            <para>- The fact that the question of going on after Christmas arises is no fault of those on this side of the Senate, nor, so far as I know, of the rank and file on the other side, but is due entirely to the fact that the Government, after the longest recess on record., had absolutely no work to place before this Chamber when it met. Because of the incompetent manner in which the Government have managed the business, it is proposed now to compel us to swallow these thirteen measures in as many days, working long hours, so that it will be impossible to consider them properly, under the threat that if we do not complete them in the time we are to go on sitting after the Christmas week. </para>

            <para>- It is being made strenuous because of the incompetence that has marked the management of the business. If the Government had so prepared their measures as to have placed before us during the two or three weeks of that forced adjournment some of the proposals they now intend to bring in, there would have been no need for us to sit on Mondays, or for long hours every other day in the week. So far as the measures which are now before Parliament are concerned, the Government would appear to be justified in asking us to deal with them before there is any talk of a prorogation, because they could have been comfortably disposed of. But when they propose to bring in new measures which are highly controversial, although, according to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, they are short, either they intend by means of the Standing Orders and by. sitting unduly long hours to force them through without proper criticism or discussion, or else to put the Opposition in such a position that, by mere physical weariness, we shall be bound to let them go through. There is the proposal to allow the public servants to go before the Arbitration Court. The Minister says that is a little measure, but he knows as well as I do that it is highly controversial, and there is also a measure relating to Commonwealth stock. </para>

            <para>- The "gag" was passed at the instance of the Labour party. The one great achievement for which that party can take credit was the framing of the "gag" resolutions, and then they had not the courage to apply them. Another matter is the note issue. We do not know what is covered up in that measure, but, bearing in mind the general financial policy of the Government, we may reasonably assume that it will call for examination, and probably for continuous criticism. Another matter relates to naval defence. That may involve a complete reversal of policy. The Minister went on to speak of one or two other measures. If he is going to pile up a list of this kind, he is not justified in appealing to the Senate to assist him to get the business through. Let the Ministry revise that list in the light of their own practical experience as to what is a fair thing to ask Parliament to pass in the time. </para>

        <para class="block">Gardiner would scoff at the idea of what took place last week being regarded as a " stone wall." If there had been a " stone wall" the Bill would not have been through yet. If the Government honestly wish to close the session in time to enable members of Parliament to get to their homes for Christmas, they are not justified in bringing' in measure after measure with the intimation that there will be more to come. They should retain on the list what they regard as absolutely essential, and leave to next session the less important measures which are being brought in at the last moment. If they did that, they would have a claim on us, to which I think honorable senators would readily respond, to use every effort to bring the session to a close. Such an appeal, however, falls upon prejudiced ears when coupled with the intimation that not only is this long list to be completed; but that it will probably be added to. I trust the Government will see the advisability of shortly intimating to the Senate that it is intended to drop some of the less important measures. If that assurance is given, the Government will have no reason to complain of the assistance received from this side of the Chamber. </para>

          <para>. - The concluding sentence of the Leader of the Opposition is reassuring, but I do not agree with him that we had a long rest in the interval between this session and last. Between January and April, when the proposed referenda were being discussed vigorously by representatives of both parties - an occasion such as never before occurred during a recess - we were not enjoying a rest, and the Ministers who attended the Conference on the military and naval defence of the Empire did not do so. As for the acceptance of the invitation of the British Government to be present at the Coronation, that provided a pleasant time for those who went, but it will be acknowledged that Australia did well to send a representation.. I suggest now, that, as the Opposition may complain if business is pressed on, we should continue this session until 'Parliament ends, by which time we shall be in a position to say that in one Parliament, the Labour party gave effect to every plank of its platform. I hope that the Government will not hesitate to make use of its opportunity to do this. </para>
