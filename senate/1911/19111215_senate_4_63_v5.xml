On the notice-paper there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> no measure which apparently it is the intention of the Government to proceed with, and we are awaiting the arrival of the Tariff Bill from the other House. It would he, as I think the Government will recognise, very unreasonable to ask the Senate, as a deliberative body, to proceed at once with the consideration of a Tariff Bill which it has not yet seen. As I understand that they recognise the reasonableness of that view, and the Minister has discussed the matter with me, I invite him to tell us how he proposes to deal with the business which remains to be done before the close of the session. </para>

                        <para>. - As a speech from the Vice-President of the Executive Council would close the debate, and other honorable senators may wish to speak to the motion, I have risen to state that the Government recognise that it would not be fair to ask the Senate to proceed with the discussion of the Tariff Bill without having been supplied with copies. In order that copies may be supplied, it is proposed, if this motion be carried, to move the first reading of the Bill, and then ask that the sitting be suspended until half-past 2 o&#39;clock to-day. In the interim copies of the Tariff will be distributed. In the afternoon the general discussion can be commenced and continued until the usual hour of adjournment on Friday, to be resumed on Monday morning. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;10.34&#93;.- I assume that the discussion of the second reading of the Tariff Bill will be proceeded with on Monday morning, so that practically very little Committee work could reasonably be expected to be done until after the luncheon adjournment on Monday. It will be a good thing to get so much of the debate out of the way. If there are any honorable senators who have arranged to go away this afternoon, and desire to have an opportunity of speaking on the second reading, they could do so on

                    <para class="block">Monday afternoon, though, of course, it will be impossible to pledge honorable senators who remain to continue the debate.

I do not want to interfere with any arrangement which has been come to between

                        and the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but if it could be arranged to fall in with the suggestion to meet at a later hour on Monday, it would be a very great convenience, because there is no train from Adelaide on Sunday evening, as there is from Sydney. There is a difficulty in that respect, but as we have to enter on business next week, and get through the Committee stage of the Tariff Bill as speedily as possible, it would be a convenience, and I think in the interests of the business before the Senate, if the Government could see their way - with the concurrence, of course, of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                        - to make the concession suggested by

                        I was not aware that the Senate was going to sit late last night; otherwise I should have been here if that had been possible. From that point of view, it is desirable that we should have some timely notice of any intention to prolong a sitting.

While sympathizing with those who are in the position just mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> I would point out that there are not many hours remaining before the close of the session. As the intention is to prorogue before Christmas, every hour is valuable, and useful work might be done. A number of honorable senators who have been waiting in Melbourne for weeks and weeks, can attend at that hour, and take part in the discussion on the Tariff Bill. I do not think that any inconvenience will be caused to those who may be unable to return to Melbourne until after mid-day on Monday, or, in perhaps a few cases, even until after mid-day on Tuesday. </para>

                            <para>- I would suggest that it is also a matter of convenience for a number of honorable senators to sit on Monday morning. I believe that it will meet the general convenience if we meet on Monday morning at half-past 10 o&#39;clock, adjourning, of course, at the usual hour to-day. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to adhere to his intention. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that some consideration will be extended to those representatives from other States who have not. the pleasure of staying in Melbourne with their wives and families. In my opinion, we have been treated unfairly. I do not approve of the method of procedure that has been followed during the last week or two. My view is that we should adjourn at the usual hour to-day, meet again in&#39; January, and do the business of the country properly. The Government ought to study our convenience a little in connexion with the sitting on Monday morning. I have been in the habit of going to New South Wales at every week-end, and I would rather do that than enjoy the pleasure of stopping in Melbourne for two or three days. I hope that the Government will have some regard to the convenience of the representatives of New South Wales, who have been constant attendants, and always ready to do the country&#39;s business. We are entitled to a little consideration. </para>

It should be remembered that if we were to adjourn until next year the session might go on for weeks. Every sitting involves a big expense, which, if Parliament could be prorogued before Christmas, would be saved to the country. I hope that my proposal to adjourn until Monday morning will be carried, and everything will be done to suit the convenience of honorable senators. </para>

                <para class="block">This is one of those measures discussion on which always takes place on the first reading. I intend briefly to outline the purport of the Bill, so that honorable senators may consider it between the present time and the hour which will be fixed for the resumption of the debate. It is my intention to ask for a suspension of the sitting when I have concluded what I have to say, in order that the Senate may look into the details of the schedule. It will be remembered that some time ago the Minister of Trade and Customs sent out circulars to all manufacturers in the Commonwealth with a view to ascertain what industries required additional protection, and what anomalies in the Tariff needed to be rectified. We also wished to ascertain whether it would be desirable to decrease some duties in the interests of industries that were dependent for their success on the importation of cheap raw material, A number of manufacturers furnished replies to the Minister&#39;s questions. A large number took no notice of them. Although it may be argued that because some manufacturers did not furnish information, we need not consider their industries, nevertheless it would be unfair to take up the position that we should not review the Tariff in the interests of those who have taken the trouble to furnish all the information at their disposal, and who have treated the Minister in the fairest possible way, by giving  him  and his officers opportunities to ascertain the real condition of the industries concerned. Consequently it has been found necessary to introduce this Bill. There are fifty-three items in the schedule that involve increases of duty. Those increases have been proposed largely as the result of the inquiries that have been made, and of the replies that have been received by the Minister. There are nine items which entail decreases of duty. Those decreases have been proposed so as to adjust the relative positions of raw materials and finished articles under the Tariff. There are fifty-one items which are included  in  the schedule for departmental reasons, to remove anomalies and obviate misinterpretation. Such are the purposes of the Bill. I do not think it necessary to enter into details at the present moment. If any answers are required to questions and criticisms brought forward by honorable senators during the course of debate, I shall endeavour to obtain information from the officers, which I shall furnish  in  due course. I have much pleasure  in  moving the first reading of the Bill. </para>

At those elections and prior to them there was no accusation which was hurled at the Fusion party with more emphasis or with greater frequency than was the accusation that while that parity remained in power Protection was in danger, and that Protectionists could not hope for any assistance from that Administration. Inferentially the electors were asked to believe that, if they would only intrust their political destinies to the Labour party, from that time forward Protectionists could sleep in their beds in perfect comfort. It may truly be said that in Victoria the Labour party lived upon that cry. </para>

                            J. Russell knows that the very first thing which he of all men did when he wished to place himself upon good terms with the ardent Protectionists of Victoria was to make a reference to

                            and other New South Wales Free Traders. If he will take the trouble to look up the speeches which he delivered during the time that the Fusion Government held office, he will find that he bitterly denounced the failure of that Government to introduce a protective policy, and that he assured the electors that the Labour Codlin was their friend, and not Short.

                        <para>- I am not denouncing anybody. I merely wish to hammer home this point : that every Bill which this Government bring forward serves to direct the attention of the people of this country to the wide difference which exists between their pre-election promises and their later day performances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is inclined to smile at my statement. But what treatment has been meted out to this Bill either by its friends or its opponents? The very supporters of the Government, when they beheld the result of this great effort at Tariff reform - a result which was arrived at only after a long period of incubation on the part of that militant Protectionist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> - received it with derision. They treated it so contemptuously that they have absolutely shown that they do not care whether the Bill passes or not. With equal emphasis the opponents of a protective policy have exhibited their Scornful indifference of it. And what has been the attitude of persons outside of this Parliament ? There have been critics of the measure amongst every section of the community - indeed, scarcely a single individual has received it with favour. </para>

                        <para>- I call it a measure worthy of this Government. One of the first things which happened when these duties were, brought forward was that the Chamber of Manufactures in Victoria - an admittedly Protectionist body - rose and condemned some of them. It was supported in its view by deputations representing both Protectionist employers and Protectionist workmen. These men were not expressing the heresies of Free Trade : on the contrary, they were staunch <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the true faith, and they joined together to denounce these proposals. But I wish to again direct attention to the fact that if this Bill is put forward by the Labour Government in redemption of the promises made by them in Victoria prior to the last election - in this State the party lived on the promise that they would frame a truly scientific Protectionist Tariff - the electors have once again been absolutely sold like a bullock at Smithfield. Let us see what this measure does, in addition to disappointing the hopes of those who voted for the Government in the belief that they had at last in office a Government who would give them true Protection. I say that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Tariff amendments contained in this Bill offend both Free Traders and Protectionists. Vague as are some of its proposals, the Bill unquestionably provides for the imposition- of revenue duties. Now. if there is one class of duty more than another  which has merited the condemnation of both fiscal sections of this Chamber, it is that class of duty which levies an impost upon the poorer sections of the community without having any but the most remote association with -Protection. Some of these revenue duties are so pronounced that even so stalwart a Protectionist as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maloney</inline> felt it incumbent upon him to seek their removal, What can we say of a Government who have so repeatedly denounced this class of duty, and who now submit propositions which they have never tired of condemning ? Yet I have no doubt that these proposals will find their way to our statute-book. </para>

Upon more than one occasion in New South Wales the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> stated that no attempt would be made to impose additional Customs duties until side by side with them the Government were in a position to introduce the new Protection.

                        <para>- When I am dealing with the attitude of his party, the honorable senator&#39;s name and Victoria are almost synonymous terms. In New South Wales this matter was not stressed because the Labour party knew that they were there appealing to a constituency which was traditionally Free Trade, and that consequently the story that was told in Victoria would not be acceptable. In New South Wales they said that no additional imposts would be proposed until, by means of the new Protection, they could assure fair wages to the workers. Yet in this Bill we find increased duties proposed without any attempt being made to give effect to the principles of the new Protection. </para>

They have been careful to keep them from the public eye, or 1 should have discovered them. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell deny that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> is a Protectionist in theory, and on the electioneering platform? He presented himself to the electors at the last election as a straight-out Protectionist. Having a period of eighteen months in which to consider whether he would bring in a fully Protective Tariff, or should deal merely with anomalies - and if so, what anomalies - he comes down with a measure which is indecisive, and about which he is so undecided himself that he does not know whether to stand by it or abandon it. </para>

Not only have the Government shown by their vacillation that they are not quite certain where they stand, but they are responsible, to a large extent, for putting this Parliament in the same position. What information has been given to either House of the Parliament to justify the proposed alterations? Ministers have told Parliament and the country that, as the result of certain inquiries, the Minister of Trade and Customs was supplied with certain information from a number of manufacturing firms. The Minister may have that information, but we have not got it here. No attempt has been made to put before Parliament the facts which, in the opinion of the Government, justify these proposed alterations in the Tariff.

                        <para>- I admit that the force of numbers has made me do so. If the numbers were the other way about, it would not have been necessary for me to make a public capitulation. Having put the matter three times before the electors, and the electors having on each occasion turned down the appeal addressed to them by the Free Traders of the country, it was only fair and reasonable that we should accept their decision. No information is presented by the Government to enable us to form a judgment upon the Tariff alterations proposed. It would introduce an altogether pernicious state of affairs if, in this Parliament, we were to accept the mere assurance of Ministers that they were in possession of information sufficient, in their opinion, to justify alterations of the Tariff. To accept such a course of procedure would be to transfer all deliberative work from this Parliament to secret conferences, which might be held in the privacy of the Ministerial office. That would, sooner or later, bring about a condition of affairs which is commonly associated with American politics, but which, so far, has been kept out of politics in the British Empire. I should be the last to submit to the doctrine that a Tariff is to be formed by private conferences between manufacturers and Ministers. We should be informed as to the circumstances of each industry affected by the proposed alterations which justify them to the Ministerial mind. Until we are, we must be unable to say how we &#39; should deal with these alterations. I am, in this matter, under a disability, which I assume is shared by every member of the Senate. In the absence of information, I am unable to determine how far the proposed alterations of the Tariff may be beneficial. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator does expect to get it, his hope triumphs over his experience. It is one of the most difficult things in the world to get at the real facts connected with any industry. Perhaps upon any statement of the facts no two members of the Senate would be agreed. The whole trend of things is forcing opinion outside to the conclusion that, sooner or later, we shall have to establish some permanent institution whose business it will be to conduct investigations into the conditions of industries, and submit facts and recommendations to Parliament. It was the policy of the late Administration that there should be created some tribunal of a permanent character which should have delegated to it the duty of inquiring into all industries, gathering facts, statistics, and information, and having the power from time to time to make certain recommendations or suggestions to Parliament. Without such a body, it is impossible that Tariff matters can ever be adjusted on sound business lines. Under existing conditions it is not the merits of an industry, but the importunities of those connected with it, that determine the liberality with which it will be treated. For the time being, the present Government have refused to take the way out of the difficulty which has been suggested. They have turned their backs upon the assistance which would be afforded by the adoption of such a proposal. But I am thoroughly convinced that in the mind of the public outside there is a growing conviction that some such institution as that to which I have referred should be established, and that it is only by the adoption of such a course that we .can be placed in possession of the necessary facts- in order that we may be able to adjust the Tariff to meet the changing requirements of the country. As in common with other honorable senators I am anxious to do what I can to bring the business of this session to a close, I do not propose to deal with the items at length in Committee. I shall endeavour to confine criticism, and also divisions, to as few of the items as possible, but upon items which do stand out as inviting criticism, it must be understood that honorable senators on this side will not, from any consideration of personal convenience, shirk their public responsibilities. </para>

                    <para>. - I confess that I do not like the way in which this Bill to amend the Tariff is submitted to us. The schedule to it is so framed that it is difficult to discover what is proposed. After a sitting lasting until 4 o&#39;clock this morning, we are now asked to take up the consideration of this Bill, having had only a short adjournment of two hours in which to consider what it contains. We know that a great number of people have been making complaints as to the way in which the existing Tariff has operated. This has been particularly noticeable in Victoria, where several deputations have waited upon the Minister in connexion with the subject. It would be far better to have an advisory board, composed of men who thoroughly understand the subject, who could secure information, carefully consider it, and then submit their recommendations to Parliament. </para>

I see that amongst the new proposals is one for the imposition of a duty of 6d. per cental on bananas. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> laughs, but when the last Tariff was under review he secured the imposition of a duty pf 4d. on dried herbs because there was a man at One Tree Hill who was making a living by growing them. </para>

                        <para>- It was an absurd thing to alter the Tariff because one man and a boy were engaged in a certain industry. There are thousands of people growing bananas in Queensland ; yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> emits a laugh of derision when the subject is mentioned. Desiring to be fair, I admit that in North Queensland, round about Cairns, the banana industry has been in the hands of Chinamen. Some of them employ white men. </para>

                        <para>- I say, without hesitation, that three-fourths of the banana industry from Rockhampton southward is in the hands of white men. My statement will be corroborated by senators from Queensland who sit on the honorable senator&#39;s own side. At Nerang Creek there are between 250 and 260 white farmers growing arrowroot. This is not a one-man-and-a-boy industry. How can these farmers pay standard rates of wages, and sell their product in competition with arrowroot grown in Java and Fiji, where black labour is employed ? These men are being starved out, and little consideration is given to them, though Parliament was ready enough to assist a one-man-and-a-boy industry. It seems that Parliament only regards the Tariff through one eye, keeping the other eye closed. </para>

                        <para>- The people who grow vegetables round about Melbourne are almond-eyed. I never saw such Scotchmen in Scotland, and I doubt whether the honorable senator&#39;s countrymen will appreciate the reference. I should be prepared to vote on duties of this kind very much more freely if the evidence had been sifted by a Tariff board. At present, however, it is the industries that are carried on in the neighbourhood of Parliament House that seem to stand the best chance of getting assistance. This building has lately been besieged by deputationists. Queen&#39;s Hall has been full of them since the Tariff has been under consideration in another place. In previous years when the Tariff was under review one could hardly get into Parliament House for them. You never see these men here unless they have something to gain personally. I object to that sort of thing. I would rather have an advisory board to make inquiries and submit recommendations to Parliament than have these crowds of interested persons button-holing the representatives of the people. I should be quite satisfied to refer any grievances that were brought under my notice to such a board. If, after making exhaustive examinations, they came to the conclusion that a recommendation in favour of a duty was not justified, I should have to be content. I hope that the Government will take the advice that has been offered them in relation to the appointment of such a board, which I feel sure would give satisfaction to honorable senators on both sides. </para>

                    There could be nothing more true than what he says, that in regard to all these Tariff matters a Government that brings in proposals for increased Protection merely looks at the question with one eye, and that is an eye whose vision is allowed to be directed by the selfish interests of those who can manage to get into closest touch with the Government of the day. My honorable friend has rendered a service in revealing this feature, which is always incidental to proposals of the kind. He chaffed

                            was chaffed in turn about the Queensland banana industry. He is quite right from the point of view of his State in demanding that a particular industry shall not fall on evil days. But he would, I think, have been on stronger ground if he had vindicated the industry, not because in some places there may be white men engaged in the production of this fruit, but on the broad ground of whether or not it is a just or legitimate thing that we should increase a tax upon what is substantially a food of the people.

                        <para>- The argument tells rather against my honorable friend&#39;s view. If bananas are a food of the people, it is unreasonable and unjust to increase the duty already imposed upon them even by 6d- per cental. At the same time, there is no necessity whatever to disparage the Chinese who are employed in growing Bananas. Nor is it necessary to support&#34; the demand for a duty by showing that in certain parts of Queensland the fruit is produced by white labour. The Protection was imposed, not because bananas were or were not grown by Chinese or white people, but because it was contended that the duty was for the benefit of the industry, taking into consideration also the broad interests of the community. It does not matter whether the production is carried on by Chinamen, by kanakas, or by any other form of coloured labour, so long as it is the labour of the citizens of this country. Therefore, I think my honorable friend will be well advised if he takes the broader ground that the duty which he supports will benefit an industry in the State from which he comes. The Vice-President of the Executive Council very properly refrained from entering into details in respect of the schedule when he moved the first reading of the Bill. We do not want to go into details, as this is a matter for the Committee; but I think we are entitled to know on what ground it was considered necessary that there should be any interference with the Tariff at this late stage of the session. I protest against the disturbance of trade which is incidental to any interference with the Tariff when the time is so limited for its consideration as it is in the present instance. When we are engaged on the business of the country day and night, the Government are quite entitled to say, &#34; We want to close the session before Christmas,&#34; and we ought to do our utmost to assist them. But I venture to say that they are not dealing fairly with Parliament when they bring down this measure within the last few days of an expiring session, and expect these proposals to be considered as they ought to be. My honorable friend&#39;s only reason is that there have been representations made to the Government in answer to inquiries, or by means of letters, or by means of button-holing on the part of interested persons. </para>

                        <para>- Is it possible that the representations which are made, whether in answer to a circular or not, are disinterested or unselfish? We know perfectly well that all of them emanated from those who, rightly enough, are seeking to benefit their own pockets. And the circumstance that my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out is. the most cogent evidence that the materials; which are before the Government are not such as will bear investigation from any other point of view than the particular wish of these people to benefit their own industries. Is it to be said that, whenever there are a few manufacturers, who, in consequence of incapacity or bad luck, are not making the profit which they desire, and want a little more Protection put on in order that their profits may be enlarged, out of the pockets of the consumers, that is a justification for introducing an amendment of the Tariff? Surely rot. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. I am taking the view of the Protectionist. Is it not a fact that the Protectionists look on the policy of Protection as one which is for the benefit, not of themselves or of manufacturers, but of the whole community ? Are we not to consider, when a change is being made in the Tariff, how it will affect the industries which are interwoven with the particular one which is in question ? How can we possibly deal with one particular increase of duty unless we also deal with various cognate industries which are mixed up with it? Is not that the policy of the Protectionists ? The Protectionists are just. They do not desire to - put on a duty for the benefit of a particular manufacturer. Let me take an article called dextrine, on which it is proposed to put a duty. Now dextrine is not made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am as sure as the best information I have will enable me to be sure, that it never has been made in Australia, and is not made in England. It is made in Germany, and is greatly used in Australia. Surely it is not a reason for putting on a duty - I dismiss that at once - that it is made in Germany. It is widely used here in the stationery, printing, box-making, and various allied trades. For what reason is the duty to be imposed? I suppose that some individual who thinks that he can make dextrine wants to start an industry, and to start it first at the expense of the trades in which it is used, and, secondly, at the cost of the consumers. Let the man who wants to start this business start it out of his own pocket. </para>

                        <para>- Offer a bounty, as you have done in the case of other things. Before an industry is started, and without any evidence that it will be remunerative or employ any number of men, you are going to disturb established industries which you have already protected. That is a monstrous position to take up, and it is still more monstrous that this Bill is brought before Parliament, I presume seriously, at this&#39; period of the session. I ask honorable senators who are Protectionists by conviction, quite apart from those who, like myself, recognise the policy of the country as one of Protection, to say that they will not encourage tinkering with the Tariff, pettifogging alterations which may disturb, inconvenience, and cause loss in more industries than the particular one which is sought to be benefited. Looking at it from that point of view, it is an unfortunate thing that the Government have introduced this Bill at the present juncture without any other reason than, as my honorable friend said, representations or answers to various circulars which have been sent out to manufacturers. If you invite persons who are at present benefited by Protection whether they would like some more, what answer do you expect? Of course, they would like some more, and they would be less than human if they did not. No one can deny that it is a benefit. We have only to look at the advantage to New South Wales, which formerly was a comparatively Free Trade Colony, since the advent of Protection. If you send out a circular to a manufacturer and ask him whether he is satisfied with his Protection, or would like more, you need not wait for his answer. You know perfectly well what lt will be. So it is with all demands of that kind. Throughout this session, everybody has understood that the Government were not going to have any Tariff alterations. It was thoroughly understood until within the last few weeks that there was to be no revision of the Tariff this session, and that, at the very utmost, even a.= late as a few weeks ago, it was merely to be some rectification of anomalies. I do not call the increase of duties or the imposition of new duties the redress of anomalies. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has told us, and I was very glad to hear the statement, that certain duties are taken off. That is, of course, a matter to be justified, because we know that revenue duties must be imposed, but we do not want revenue. In the last Budget statement, the Treasurer anticipated for the current year a revenue of something like ,&#163;13,000, 000 from Customs duties. That is an enormous revenue, and if there are duties - and, as has been pointed out, undoubtedly there are in this Bill - which will still further increase that revenue, they ought to be taken off, because we do not want it. We do not want to impose taxation on the people simply for the fun of the thing, or in order that we may have in the Treasury a plethora of money which is exacted from the producing interests. I should have been glad if it had been possible for my honorable friends on the other side to have said that, looking at the fact that throughout the entire session they have not really contemplated for a moment any interference with the Tariff, that they would withdraw the Bill, and, next session, if they like, arid can show adequate grounds for it, introduce a measure which will enable Parliament to discuss, not merely the particular items in this schedule, but other industries which may be affected by the duties sought to be imposed. I protest against this Bill being brought in now, and against it being brought in for such inadequate reasons - reasons which are merely an expression of the influence of the selfish interests of those who want duties increased in order to put more money into their own pockets. </para>

                    <para>. - I intend to follow the excellent example set by those who have spoken to this motion, and to be very brief.  1,  as a Protectionist, must confess to a feeling of very great disappointment at the Government&#39;s introduction of this Bill at this time. I emphasize both expressions - &#34; this Bill &#34; and &#34; this time.&#34; In relation to the Bill, I say that the modicum of Protection which is being extended to the industries of the Commonwealth is ludicrously absurd in its smallness, and, with regard to the time, I say that it is asking members of Parliament to approach the consideration of one of their most important duties under circumstances and conditions which do not enable them to act with a proper sense of responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that it is hardly within the competence of anybody outside the Cabinet to assign a good and adequate reason for the introduction of the measure at this particular period of the session. Everybody knew that the session must necessarily be a very short one, perhaps the shortest in the history of this Parliament. Seeing that we met so late in the year, and that it was announced that we were to rise before Christmas, a very large programme of work had been indicated for us in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, and until quite recently there was not the slightest indication on the surface of things to show that the Minister of Trade and Customs intended to introduce a schedule amending the Tariff. I might go even further than that, and say, though I am not in a position to quote the particular times and the particular references, that it had been given out - if not by the Government in circumstances which,, at any rate, called for a denial on their part if it had not been correctly given out - that there was no intention on their part to alter the Tariff in the direction of extending Protection unless they had enabled this Parliament to insist on. conditions which would make that Protection of the new Protectionist character. I believe it was generally understood that,, until some alteration of the Constitution took place, those manufacturers who desired increased Protection were doomed to disappointment. Yet now, at the tail end of the session, and with the Estimates unconsidered, this schedule has been tabled&#39;. Necessarily, it has had to be rushed&#39; through another place, just as it will have to be rushed through here. I suppose that if we examine the hundred odd items which are contained in it, we shall find&#34; that not 25 per cent, of them have the slightest protective incidence. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking for myself, and I have no hesitation in affirming that not 25 per cent, of the duties which this schedule seeks to impose have a protective incidence. Out of that number there are not half-a-dozen which are of any practical consequence. If we are to have a revision of the Tariff in a Protectionist direction, why should it be limited to half-a-dozen industries in the Commonwealth? Do the Government intend to plead that they have not received replies to the invitation which they issued to our manufacturers? </para>

                        <para>- It is not. If Protection is the settled policy of the country, it is the bounden duty of the Government to inform themselves of where protective duties will have a beneficial effect. They have no right to wait till they can obtain that information from individuals who are associated with various industries. But if the Government put forward the plea which I have mentioned, I say that information has been supplied to them in regard to industries other than Victorian industries - information as to where a protective policy would exert a beneficial influence - but I look in vain in this schedule for any evidence that they have given consideration to it. At any rate, there has been nothing like an organized and systematic attempt made to ascertain where the old Tariff has failed to give expression to a protective policy. In other words, the proposals contained in this Bill are a sop which has been thrown out by the Government to their Protectionist supporters, with a view to conveying the impression that they are bent, upon Tariff reform. I challenge the assertion, if it comes from the Government, that they have made any serious effort to alter the Tariff in a Protectionist direction. To ask the Senate or the other branch of the Legislature, clogged as they are with, other business, the consideration of which is of the gravest importance, to deal with alterations of the Tariff at this late hour of the session, is absolutely farcical. As has been pointed cut by honorable senators who have preceded me, even, if we had a whole session before us, such as we .had in 1907-8, the revision of the Tariff would be a most difficult task to undertake. In that year, we were fortified by the report of the Tariff Commission, whose exhaustive inquiries had extended over many months, by the recommendations which it had made, and by the evidence upon which those recommendations were based. On that occasion, the precincts of this Parliament were thronged with persons who were interested in the maintenance, the reduction, or the increase of duties. That being so, it was only to be expected that when this measure was under consideration the Parliamentary Buildings would be similarly thronged by representatives of the commercial and trading community. I have even been asked by persons in my own State whether it would be an advantage for them to come to Melbourne in order that they might make their own representations in respect of Tariff alterations. They are just as much affected by some of the items in this Bill as are the manufacturers and traders who are resident in Melbourne. The same remark is applicable to the other States. But, in such circumstances, how is it. possible for us to give anything like fair consideration to the items of this schedule? For that reason I am disappointed that the Government have introduced the Bill at the present juncture. But, apart from the particular period at which it has been submitted, I say that, in considering this schedule, we are following a precedent which, in the early history of the Commonwealth, we recognised that it would be very undesirable to follow in the future. That is to say. we have already placed upon our statute-book a comprehensive Tariff, and that Tariff is being amended year after year. We have amended the principal Act by the Act of 1907-8, we have amended it by the Act of last year, and now we are asked- to consider still further amendments. Amongst the commercial and trading community the confusion and uncertainty which will be introduced by a succession of amendments of this character are hardly possible to estimate. By no stretch of imagination can it be contended that the schedule to this Bill represents the be-all and end-all of the requirements of the people and of the Government. It surely cannot be pretended that there are no other items in respect of which protective duties should not be imposed or increased. Are we then, in 1912, to be confronted with still another Tariff schedule? If so, will not the entire community be disturbed in the interim? Cannot  we frame a comprehensive Tariff which will embrace all that is good in the old Tariff, and all that is necessary to supplement it? But I feel certain that it will be impossible for Parliament to adopt that course, unless it is first fortified by the recommendations of a body in the nature of a board or of a commission, which will be competent to investigate the incidence of our Tariff. So far as the items in this Bill are concerned, I do not now intend to deal with them. I shall content myself at this juncture with registering my objection ito the mode of procedure that has been adopted by the Government and to the mature of the Tariff amendment generally. In Committee, I shall offer some observations upon certain items of the schedule, and I hope then to be as brief in my remarks as I have been in addressing myself to the motion for the first reading of this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There has been no backsliding on my part. I have always been a believer in effective Protection, which will give the command of our Australian market to Australian industries. I admit that there are many commodities manufactured in the Commonwealth upon -which I would impose a prohibitive duty. 1 intend to vote for the Bill which is now under consideration in all cases in which it seeks to increase the measure of Protection which has hitherto been granted to Australian goods. But 1 wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that we once had a glorious opportunity to improve the old Tariff, and that if it had not &#39;been for the position which was taken up by the so-called Protectionist Government which was &#34;then in power, and which was too ready to compromise in regard to dozens of amendments submitted by Free Traders, we might have improved it beyond all recognition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was a member of that Government. At that time we had one Free Trader in the Labour party. There were fourteen others in the Parliament, besides three Free Traders in the Government. The result was that on no fewer than thirty occasions we found an m,0 wed l v Protectionist Government voting with the Free Trade section of this Senate, while fourteen or fifteen Labour Protectionists had the humiliation of being defeated as a result of members of the Protectionist Government joining forces with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his friends. </para>

                            for his attitude on the Tariff question, because .1 believe that he has always been a consistent Free Trader. But I have many times denounced the whole of the Protectionist members of Victoria who joined that gentleman in a political alliance, and then proclaimed to the electors that they were the real Protectionists, who would frame a decent Tariff for Australia. I express my disappointment that the amendments of the Tariff proposed in this Bill will not give us the Protectionist Tariff required for Australia. Although, as I have previously said, I do not like tinkering with .the Tariff, I hope that very early next session we shall be afforded an opportunity to give a really Protectionist Tariff to Australia. I trust that in framing that Tariff we shall knock out many of the revenue-producing items which were introduced by the so-called Protectionist Governments of the past. I wish to say a word or two about the Tariff board, which has been mentioned on many occasions. I am absolutely opposed to the appointment of an independent board for the consideration of Tariff matters. It seems to me that the appointment of these boards is always an evasion of the duties of Parliament. 1 do believe, however, that our Customs officers should be something more than mere  collectors of Customs revenue. I believe thai we have many competent officers in the Trade and Customs Department who should, under the control of the Minister, be given the special duty of investigating and analyzing the effects of every item in the Tariff. I believe that if our Customs officers were charged with that duty, they would be able to supply the detailed information necessary to enable Parliament to properly deal with the Tariff.

Every one of the supporters of the Government in the Senate, and also in another place, have condemned the Tariff now proposed as a wretched apology for the policy of Protection, in which they believe. The Government come down at the close of the session with a Bill which none of their supporters can say a word in favour of.

                            has been unsparing in his condemnation of this measure. It may be said that the honorable senator is not a supporter of the present Government, but he is a supporter of a Protectionist policy for this country.

                            J. Russell has been just as condemnatory of this wretched apology for a Tariff. Ministers cannot find a single ardent supporter of the Tariff now put before us. It may be that it has been introduced to enable the party opposite to tell the electors that they have done the best they possibly could in the circumstances. But they took care not to submit this Tariff at a time when it might be fully considered and dealt with effectively. We are asked at the close of the session to accept this measure as fulfilling the high sounding principles of Protection, which the Government have advocated. Is there an honest Protectionist in the Senate who will say that this Tariff meets the wishes of Protectionists?

                            GOULD. - The Government were returned with an overwhelming majority of members to enable them to carry out the policy they had advocated. They told the electors that they intended to give effect to the principles of new Protection, and to adopt a scientific system of Protection, by means of which there would be high prices for the manufacturer, high wages for the wage-earner, and low prices for the consumer. But the electors soon found out how hollow were the shams which they placed before them. Within twelve months after their return to power the Government went again before the electors to ask for amendments of the Constitution, which they said were absolutely necessary to enable them to give effect to the policy of new Protection. What was the result ? The country turned the Government down. I do not say that the people who had been gulled previously by the Government entirely lost the idea that it would be possible to carry out the reform promised in the interests of manufacturer, wage-earner, and consumer.. Possibly a large number of people in this country are still under the impression that some Government will be able to carry such a policy into effect. But we know what happened on the 26th April last year.

                        <para>- I think that the people who voted against the referenda proposals of the Government displayed a want of confidence in honorable senators opposite.. No doubt, they had found out that they had made a mistake twelve months previously, and were anxious to rectify it. What is the position with regard to Protection and Free Trade? We recognise that the verdict of the people has been given against the views of the Free Trade party. The Free Traders have fought the battle upon three occasions, but without success ; but as we have accepted the verdict of the people one honorable senator has suggested that we have become delegates. The fact is, that while accepting the verdict of the country in this matter, we are not such fools as to run our heads against a stone wall. I would remind honorable senators, however, that there are many Free Traders still in the Parliament of the Commonwealth; and I have little doubt that they will be returned to represent the people for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>- How consoling that statement must be to the Government. The honorable senator accepts the Tariff now proposed as better than nothing, and, with other supporters of the Government, he is most contemptuous in his references to what they have done in this matter. Although the Government talked of new Protection, they have, under the guise of attempting to rectify Tariff anomalies, introduced increased duties for the benefit of specially favoured industries, in which those who have been most persistent in the advocacy of their own interests are concerned. The requirements of industries which have not. had persistent advocates may go hang so far as the Government is concerned. The Government say to these people, &#34; As you have not taken the trouble to communicate with us, we do not consider it worth while to inquire whether any assistance should be given to your industries.&#34; So we have a measure submitted for the benefit of a few manufacturers, and not in the general interests of the country. If we are to have a system of Protection, it should be for the advantage of the country generally, and not in the interests of a few individual manufacturers. The Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was a member submitted a proposal for getting over Tariff difficulties. Honorable senators may say what they like in derogation of the honesty of Protectionist members of the late Fusion Government, but they cannot deny that they still occupy a place in the front rank of the Protectionists of Australia. That Government, in accepting the verdict of the country, and to get rid of all these wretched bickerings about the Tariff, proposed to appoint an independent Tariff board - and again we hear some honorable senators advocating the appointment of such a board - so that the question might be brought before Parliament in the light of full and fair information. If we are to have that -scientific Protection which some people talk about, how much better it would be to allow an independent body to devote their whole attention to the subject, and to make representations independently of Free Trade or Protectionist prejudices. At present we are working in the dark. What is the use of imposing a duty for the benefit of one industry if you are going to penalize a number of others? </para>

                        <para>- Do we not appoint to the Judicial Bench men who can be trusted to deal with the questions brought before them in a spirit of independence and impartiality ? With but possibly few exceptions our Judges have always been men who have upheld the judicial traditions of freedom from prejudice and partisan feeling.  1  feel satisfied that we could select such a body of men to deal with Tariff issues. Of course, if partisans were appointed, I admit that their recommendations would perhaps be of little value. But it would be a serious reflection upon the honesty of any Government to appoint men of that character. I am speaking from the point of view of a man who has been a Free Trader all his life. I have stood on Free Trade platforms over and over again. I have been returned to Parliament as a Free Trader. But I recognise that, rightly or wrongly, this country has adopted a Protectionist policy, and I want to see it carried out honestly, not by means of abortive measures, such as the one that the Government have now submitted to us. At present I am bound to register my strong condemnation of this Bill. It is nothing better than a source of disappointment and irritation to the people who were expecting it. It will do no good either on the one side or the other. Nevertheless, with the aid of their majority Ministers are prepared to rush it through Parliament; and then, I suppose, they will puff out their chests and say to the country, &#34; See how we have carried out our pledges ! See how we have given effect to the policy approved of by the majority of the electors ! &#34; Let us get rid of this sort of sham, and have a policy that is honest, straightforward, and effective. How many honorable senators really desire to stand behind the Government in respect of this measure? Honest Protectionists have condemned it already. How many of the supporters of the Government are prepared to exercise their independence of judgment, and condemn it also? </para>

Honorable senators opposite are free enough in their language, but very seldom do they help to form a majority opposed to the Ministry. They are bound to their party, and have to make the best of what they regard, and honestly regard, as a very bad job, and a mere pretence at meeting the wishes of the people of the country. </para>

It is that the people of Australia have, by a large majority, approved of the policy of Protection. That fact is beyond dispute. There is a majority of members of this Parliament in both Houses pledged to Protection. The only inference we can draw is that there is a majority in the country. But, nevertheless, what chance has that policy of being carried out? We have two parties in the Senate at present, and I ask any man who pays even the slightest attention to the question to say whether there is any hope in this direction from either of them. What is the standpoint of the party in power, the Labour party, the party which, of all others, ought to support the policy of Protection? The policy of the Labour party is that, when the people of the Commonwealth gives this Parliament the power to fix wages and conditions of labour, this party will assist in passing a truly Protectionist Tariff. I say frankly that I am not one of those who believe in that position. I believe it to be wrong. We can no more carry out our policy as a whole, all at once, than a man can build a house otherwise than brick by brick. We have a mandate from the people of Australia to pass a Protectionist Tariff. We asked them for power to fix wages and conditions of labour. They refused to give us that power. They gave us one mandate; they refused to give us the other. The wise, patriotic, and common-sense policy would be to establish a system of Protection, as required by the people of Australia, trusting to their good sense and 4502 <inline font-style="italic">Customs</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Tariff Bill.</inline> to the righteousness of our cause to obtain the extra powers which we require at some future time. As far as I can see, Protection has no hope at present from the party in power. What has it to hope for from the party on the left of the President? That party is composed of Free Traders and Revenue Tariffists. </para>

                        <para>- The party with which the honorable senator is associated. Has it not opposed direct taxation within these walls? Is not the party outside, of which my honorable friends are the representatives here, opposed to direct taxation, not only in the Commonwealth, but in the States ? I want to know from that party, when they profess to be in favour of Projection, and to treat this amendment of the Tariff with scorn, and contempt, what they are prepared to do. They may say what they please, but I want to know how they propose to get revenue, if they give the country a Protectionist Tariff. If we have a Protectionist Tariff, they ought to know that just as it is Protectionist in its incidence, so it fails to give revenue. Both : sides of the Senate know that, or ought to  know it. I have shown that, on the Government&#39;s own policy, as enunciated by honorable senators here, there is no hope, so far as Protection is concerned, from that side of the Chamber, and I claim that there is no hope from this side. Between the two stools, the country goes to the ground. The policy of Protection fails. Here we have an example of parliamentary government, as it is carried on in most civilized countries at the present time. The people of the Commonwealth have declared for a Protectionist policy - a policy which will create industries, and employ labour, not in Europe, or Africa, or India, but on Australian soil. The people of Australia have told us, their representatives in this Parliament, to pass a policy of that kind, and we simply cannot do it. Parliament is impotent. One side renders itself impotent, and fetters itself hand and foot. The other side wants revenue. It will not impose any kind of taxation other than Customs duties. No party can introduce a Tariff here which will at once create industries and yield revenue without taxing the ordinary necessaries of life to a much greater extent than any one in Australia, I think, desires should be the case. I want to know what is going to be done. Is the Government party going to wait for this warrant from the people before it will give any further Protection ? We have a feeble, halting, lame, impotent attempt in this Tariff to do something in that direction. It shows that, although the Government professes that it will not do this, and that it will not do that, still when pressure is brought to bear, though it swears it will never consent, it does consent. It seems to me that it is only a matter of sufficient pressure being brought to bear. I do not want to pose as a prophet, but I believe that at the coming election, unless the Government puts a move on, pressure will be brought to bear, and many of its present representatives will be defeated at the polls - men who stood on the platform and proclaimed their faith in the policy of Protection, and their desire to see it carried out, but who failed. When these men go before their constituents, in many cases, they will find that these people resent action of that description. We ought, I think, to take a national view of this question. I am appealing now to the party with which I am associated. I think that every man belonging to the Labour party is, or ought to be, a Protectionist. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but there used to be. Free Trade means no Customs revenue, while revenue Tariff means taxing the poorest of the people most of all. The latter is the kind of Tariff we have, and I do not find that the party in power, although it has the numbers, has any desire to alter it. We have here evidence of how far it is prepared to go. It is not prepared to deal exhaustively with the Tariff. In the Cabinet, we have a predominance of men who were professed Free Traders a few years ago. </para>

                        <para>- There was a pre-dominance of Free Trade influence. I do not care how great a man&#39;s gifts may be, or how profuse his profession of a desire to help the working men of Australia may be, if he is a Free Trader or revenue Tariffist, he is only a hypocrite, a sham, and a fraud. That is my deliberate statement, and I am going to show how I came to that conclusion. </para>

                        <para>- I am not talking of other countries, but of a policy which is suitable for Australia. Here is the position of our Labour Free Traders. They say, for instance, to a manufacturer of boots, &#34; You must pay your men 50s. or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> a week. You must not work them for more than eight hours. You must give them the best conditions of labour which it is possible to bring about,&#34; and yet they expose him to the competition of countries where about one- third the rate of wages is paid, where about 50 per cent. more hours are worked, and where the sanitary and other conditions are not to be mentioned in the same breath with those prevailing in Australia. Some honorable senators may tell me that these people live in other countries, but they might just as well say to a bootmaker living in Swanston-street that he must do all the things which I  have  recounted, and at the same time allow a bootmaker in Bourke-street to carry on in the same way as does a bootmaker in Germany, or Great Britain, or some of those countries where sweated labour prevails to such an extent as to compete so largely with our workmen. The cost of transportation nowadays is so small that the product of cheap labour, coming into this country, no matter from what portion of the earth, competes unfairly from the point of view of Australia. I ask leave to continue my remarks at the next sitting. </para>
