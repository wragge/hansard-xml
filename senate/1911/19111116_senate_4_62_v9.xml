                    <para>. - I do not know whether the clause has been drafted in the form in which it appears by inadvertence or of set purpose, but it seems to me that the word "and," which follows the word "roll" first appearing, ought to read "or." If the Electoral Officer has proof that a person has ceased to be qualified for enrolment upon, a roll, that circumstance in itself justifies some steps being taken to remove him from the roll without imposing an additional condition that he must have obtained enrolment upon another roll; </para>

                    <para>. - The retention of the word '"and" is considered necessary in this clause. I cannot read the provision in the same light" as the Leader of the Opposition. The clause is designed to give the Commonwealth Electoral Officer power to remove a name from a roll, provided that it appears on more than one roll. </para>

                    <para>. - This is not a question of what may be the opinion of expert draftsmen, but of what the Committee desire to express. If an electoral officer has proof that any person has ceased to be qualified as an elector for enrolment on a roll, should that officer have the power to strike off his name? I think that he should. But under this clause, the officer must not only have absolute proof that the person has ceased to be qualified for enrolment on one roll, but that he has secured enrolment on another roll. Take the case of an elector who, for a breach of the law, has been sent into retirement for a considerable period. Let us assume that his name appears upon the electoral roll for the division of Melbourne, notwithstanding that he is located in some place far up the country. In that instance, the Electoral Officer would have absolute proof that the person in question had ceased to be qualified for enrolment on the roll for the division of Melbourne. But he is not on any other roll. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point. He cannot get on the roll there, and he has ceased to be qualified to be on the roll on which his name appears. Suppose that an elector has ceased to be qualified to vote in Port Melbourne, but that his name remains on the roll for that electorate, whereas he is located at Ballarat. He cannot get on the Ballarat roll, and the Electoral Officer will not strike him off the Port Melbourne roll, though the officer may know that the elector has left that district. He would have power to remove the name if the word " and " were inserted instead of "or." This clause was not designed to meet such a case as I have mentioned. It has been inserted because those responsible for the new card system recognise that in all probability it will frequently break down, because persons instead of applying for transfer will in the future, as they have done in the past, apply for original registration. In that case the new application will be attended to, and the applicant will become enrolled for. the district in which he resides. By-and-by the Electoral Office will discover on comparing cards that the name of the elector is on two rolls. </para>

                        <para>- I think so, but I am not responsible for the card system. The clause is designed to give power to aid and abet those law-breakers who apply for original enrolment instead of for transfer by enabling their names to be removed from rolls on which they ought no longer to appear. I do not find particular fault with the purpose of the clause, but I say that some other power is necessary to deal with the case of a man who has ceased to be entitled to enrolment on a particular roll. The name of such a man ought to be removed somehow. Surely the Government are not going to allow names to remain on several rolls as they have done in the past, although it has been within the knowledge of the electoral officers that they ought to be removed from one roll to another. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> gave a concrete case,- and the Minister declared that the point raised was provided for in Part VII. of the principal Act. I say that it is not provided for at all, because under Part VII. the Electoral Officer does not take action until he receives a written objection to some one being on the roll. This clause does not provide for such a case. It provides that the Electoral Officer is to have proof of two things - first, that a person has ceased to be qualified for enrolment on a particular roll, and second, that he has secured enrolment on another roll. I asked the Minister the other day to tell us how this provision was going to work. We have not yet been informed. We ought to be told. If the new card system is to be worked efficiently, there is no need for this clause, because the Commonwealth Electoral Officer ought to have immediate proof if his cards are kept up to date. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that. But under the card index system as generally used, there ought to come into the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, every day notices of transfer and enrolments, and he ought to have a staff sufficient to keep the roll up to date. He ought to be able at once to put his hand on a card, and give information concerning any elector. But this clause contemplates that the system is going to break down. Under this model system it ought to be impossible for an elector to get his name on to a new roll without its being omitted from another one. </para>

                        <para>- We ought to know that also. The Minister has such a blind faith in the Department that he has scarcely troubled himself to master the details of the measure of which he has charge. We have to satisfy ourselves that we are passing common-sense legislation. Before action is taken to strike a name from a roll we should be absolutely certain that the elector is on some other roll, and the only way in which we can be certain of that is by communicating with the person whose name it is proposed to strike off the roll. If we do not get an answer within a certain time we may take it for granted that the name should not appear on the roll on which it is objected to. In order to make the matter clear I move - </para>

When it is intended that any person shall be struck oft a roll by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of the State, that officer shall send notice by registered letter, to the last known address of the person to be struck off, of such intention, and such person shall not be struck off until twenty-one clear days have elapsed after such notice has been sent. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will not accept the amendment. In submitting it <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made a statement which is becoming somewhat hackneyed from him. No matter what Labour Minister may be submitting a measure, the honorable senator, on almost every occasion, makes a personal reference to him, suggesting incapacity, apparently with the intention, of making it appear that he is himself the only Solon in this Chamber. Such charges do not become the honorable senator. I have given as much consideration to this measure as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has done. This provision was discussed almost threadbare the last time we dealt with this Bill, but no matter how long we may discuss it, and no matter how much information may be given to honorable senators opposite, this measure will not be acceptable to them. They started out to oppose it tooth and claw, they condemned it lock, stock, and barrel, and in my opinion they have set out purposely to try to delay its passage as long as possible. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment, instead of strengthening, would weaken the clause. One would think that Australians are such dull ards that they will not be able to understand the plain language of this Bill. They will understand that their enrolment is compulsory, and that they must give notice of any transfer under a penalty if they do not do so.  They will know that it will be their duty to fill in certain cards supplied to them with the information desired by the Electoral Officer. When the Central Office is in possession of all the cards, they will be in a position to ascertain whether the name of the same elector appears upon more than one roll. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Minister will give very favorable consideration to the very happy suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> When I first raised this point, I asked the Minister if the provision was designed to enable the Department to correct mistakes where electors have obtained a fresh enrolment rather than a transfer. He did not give me a specific answer, but he has just done so to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> If the provision is merely designed to meet cases where the provisions as to transfer have been ignored or broken, there is no reason why we should not set out plainly that the great power which is sought to be conferred on the Electoral Officer is limited to such cases. The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would, if adopted, do that, and there would be no objection to the provision being passed in that form. At the same time, I wish to point out to the Minister that if he is as warm a believer in the principle of compulsory enrolment as he would have us believe, this provision will do more than anything else to discredit the system, and cause it to break down. It is to be made an offence for a man to seek original registration rather than a transfer from roll to roll. If a man does do that, the Department ought not to condone his offence, or to become a party to it, but to immediately return the second application for original registration with the statement that he must apply for a transfer. </para>

Hundreds 01 thousands of persons have taken that course with the result that our rolls are inflated. It is alleged that one of the advantages pf the proposed system is that we shall clarify the rolls as we go along, and that there will be no duplicate registration. But here is a provision which will assist to defeat that object. Undoubtedly we all desire to get the rolls cleared. </para>

                        <para>- Having obtained his second registration, he would not be any worse off. We ought to insist that every elector who has changed his place of residence shall get a transfer, and not a fresh registration. Every second application for original registration should be returned,, and the applicant told that in the circumstances he is only entitled to apply for a transfer. I suggest strongly to the Minister that, if he wants to give a fair trial to compulsory registration, he should not, by adopting this provision, hold out an invitation to persons to break the regulations and the law. Let it be clearly understood throughout the Commonwealth that no man can get on another roll until he has cancelled his first registration. </para>

                    <para>. - It has been suggested by the Leader of the Opposition that, in the last line of this provision, the word " or " should be substituted for the word " and." There is no doubt that that alteration would satisfy what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has suggested, and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has recommended. I desire to know if the Minister still objects to adopt the suggestion. If the Electoral Officer has proof that a person has ceased to be qualified for enrolment on a roll, that ought to be sufficient if it is intended to make the system complete. But the Government say that it is not sufficient for him, and that he must further be satisfied that the person has secured enrolment on another roll. How is it possible to have purity of rolls under the card system unless the Electoral Officer, if he be satisfied that a person has ceased to be qualified for enrolment on a roll, has the power to take his name off that roll? If he is satisfied on that point, is not that alone sufficient ground for striking off the name ? </para>

The provision in itself is a sufficient guarantee that the interests of the electors will be safeguarded very carefully. No Electoral Officer would dream of removing a name from a roll until he was perfectly satisfied that the elector had qualified elsewhere.

                        <para>-What I desire to point out is that, under the provision, the roll may be altered by the Electoral Officer if he has proof that the person has ceased to be qualified for enrolment on that roll by having secured enrolment on another roll. That is a qualification which will handicap the Electoral Department. If a person has not secured enrolment upon more than one roll, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State cannot strike his name off the roll on which it first appeared. </para>

As he has clearly pointed out, a person should be able to get his name inserted upon a roll after it has been struck off any other roll only by making application for a transfer. I hope that the Government will listen to his proposal, because its adoption will enable us to have much cleaner rolls than we have had in the past. </para>

                    remarks, the Minister stated that the sole object of this provision is to enable the Commonwealth Electoral Officer of a State to eliminate the name of any person from a particular roll if that person has secured enrolment on another roll.

                        <para>- No. The simple way to accomplish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> purpose is to strike out all the words after "person," where second occurring, down to and including the word "and." The object is. to prevent the duplication of names, and also to prevent impersonation. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it is a deplorable state of affairs if an elector can secure enrolment upon another roll without first having obtained a transfer. But the clause assumes that such a. state of things is possible, and seeks to provide a remedy. The simplest remedy for us to adopt is to declare that the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for a State may strike out the name of any person if he has proof that that person has secured enrolment on another roll. At the same time, I commend to the attention of the Minister, the suggestion <inline font-style="italic">o£</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> namely, the desirableness of framing a clause which will prevent the name of any person being enrolled upon any roll other than that on which it first appeared, except by means of a transfer. </para>

I would rather see a few names duplicated than know that an equal number had been omitted from our rolls. I think that the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out an evident contradiction in this clause, but he appears to lay too much stress upon it. The duplication of names may be the result of accident. I have heard a good deal about the card system, but 'I do not know what it means any more than does the man in Mars. </para>

                        <para>- But I am speaking of compulsory enrolment. Only the other day I was debating the matter with a man in Sydney who expressed the warmest admiration for it; but when I told him that under it an elector would have to notify every transfer of his residence, he admitted that it would be absolutely impracticable. I do hope that we shall not have a party squabble over any verbal amendment that may be proposed. It seems to me that the clause is merely intended to meet the cases of electors who have lost enrolment on one roll by securing it on another roll. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not for a moment think of accepting Senator's Rae's amendment. Honorable senators opposite say that they cannot understand the clause. If that be so, they cannot understand plain English. The language of the clause is not involved. It provides simply that the Electoral Officer must have double-barrelled proof before removing an elector's name from a roll. He must have proof that an elector has ceased to be qualified to be enrolled in one electorate, and that he has become enrolled in another. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> amendment would vitiate the whole provision. He seeks to provide that if a person has secured enrolment on one roll, and his name already appears on another, he shall "be removed from the first. An elector, however, ought to cease to be qualified to vote in an electorate where he is enrolled before his name can be removed. A man does not cease to be qualified simply because his name appears on a second roll. </para>

                        <para>- There are possibilities; and it is to remove any possibility of fraud that we want the provisions of the law to be tightened up.

                    (Western Aus correct in his contention. I do not think that the intention is to make use of this clause in a case where an elector has removed from one division in a State to another. It is intended to operate where an elector has removed from one State to another. By the card system, it is intended to keep a check upon electors, who may be followed from one end of Australia to the other. That is the intention of the whole Bill.

                    <para>. - I am much surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> expressing such views in face of the wording of the clause. It has nothing to do with transfer. As the Minister has correctly stated, it deals only with the removal of the names of those electors who have got upon other rolls. In other,, words, it deals with the case of those who have violated the law. The proper way of getting on. to a new roll is to apply for transfer. But the Minister recognises that a number of electors, instead of going the right way to work, will apply for fresh registration. It is admitted that this clause has been framed to meet cases of that kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> argued that the clause was intended to . deal with an elector who had removed from one State to another. If that be so, how will the Western Australian Electoral Officer have proof that a late Western Australian elector who has gone to Tasmania has applied for fresh registration in that State? He cannot have it; and that is the reason why, by this clause, an easy means is being provided of breaking down the compulsory enrolment system. It ought to be- provided that, when a man has obtained his registration, he shall be entitled once, and once only, to original registration. Having got that, under no circumstances should he be allowed to apply for fresh registration. If he removes, let him apply for transfer. But here the Bill provides that he can apply for fresh registration. As surely as we make provision for such a breach' of- the law, so surely will such breaches be committed? Why should they not be? It may be much easier for a man to apply for fresh registration than for transfer. The compulsory enrolment system will break down. If honorable senators opposite believe in that system let them provide for it in such a way as will make for success, by letting every elector know that there is only one way to get on to a roll in the first instance, and only one way to secure the removal of his name to another roll if he changes his residence. Let every elector know that his application for new enrolment will not be successful if he really ought to apply for transfer. Electors will soon know what is the right thing to do. But if we provide that if they do the wrong thing the Electoral Office will set it right for them, compulsory enrolment will fail. </para>

                    <para>-  - The rolls of the Commonwealth at the present time are full of such cases as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has instanced. I know of members of this Parliament who are on two rolls, if not three. Take my own case. I am an elector for Queensland. Yet my name was put on the roll in Tasmania by the police. If I had liked I could have voted there. I did not do so, simply because I knew what the law was. But many men, not knowing the law so well, will break it. Suppose a man who has been living in Queensland goes to Broken Hill and gets on the roll there. How is the Electoral Officer at Broken Hill to know that this elector is already on the roll for Gympie, Charters Towers, or any other place in Queensland? The electoral name will remain on the roll for the State which he has left, as well as being "on the roll for the State to which he has gone. I have already said that I believe our rolls are unduly inflated, and often quite inadvertently. We have only to consider the last election for Boothby to, see that this is so. Boothby is a metropolitan electorate, and although the political parties there are highly organized, and, no doubt, brought every possible voter up to the poll, only 52- per cent, of the persons on the roll recorded their votes. If Boothby were a country electorate, it might be said that, as it was a by-election, the people did not take very much interest in it, but, in the circumstances, there must be something radically wrong with the Boothby roll. I believed that probably 75 per cent, at least of the persons on the roll would record their votes, knowing that both parties were well organized. I am satisfied that if the Boothby roll contained only the names of electors qualified to be upon it, it would have been found that 70 or 80 per cent, of the electors voted at the election. I <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> not aware that action has been taken by any one since the establishment of Federation to purify the Federal electoral rolls. It is within my personal knowledge that, ort the Kennedy roll, there appears the names of many former residents of Charters Towers who left the district years ago. The continuance of names on a roll of persons who have left the district merely offers an inducement to persons to personate, and get themselves into trouble. Under the State laws, there are quarterly sittings of Revision Courts provided for in Queensland, though the system is not all that I should like it to be. A person objecting to a name on a roll has to make a deposit of 5s., and. if the elector appears and proves that his name should remain on the roll, the objector loses his deposit. In that way, there is very little danger that the name of a qualified elector will be struck off a roll. I will admit that the system now proposed by the Government, if properly carried out, should do much to purify the Commonwealth rolls. It should: be kept up to date*. and once an elector is enrolled for a particular electorate, his name should not appear upon any other roll unless he makes an application for a transfer. If the system is to be worked as feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I have no doubt that, in a few years, the rolls will be as inflated as ever. A man leaving a Tasmanian electorate, and going to Broken Hill to get work, will, no doubt, desire to be on the roll for the Barrier. He will make application for enrolment, but his name will still remain on the roll for the Tasmanian electorate which he left. I am sure that is not the intention of honorable senators. Now that we are establishing the card system, we should try to make it as perfect as possible, and  1  am satisfied that honorable senators on this side will support any proposal made by the Government to secure the purification of the rolls. </para>

I should like to say that I consider this another provision which will weaken the sense of responsibility which it is the object of this Bill to throw upon the electors. I can see, also, very considerable trouble for the Electoral Office in the proposal. A lady, having changed her name by marriage, might reasonably be asked to notify that to the authorities herself. If we are going to adopt the principle of individual responsibility of each elector, the whole matter should be left to them. </para>

It would be much better that we should give the electors to understand! that they must look after such matters for themselves. If the Department is to undertake this responsibility of making alterations in the names of persons, I am afraid that injustice may be done to some electors, and the Department will be given a very great deal of trouble. </para>

                        <para>- The address of the person who has changed her name may or may not be given. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> may have seen a marriage register, and will know the nature of the addresses entered in such registers. I suppose that, if he were to turn up his own marriage register, he would find that the address would possibly be only the town in which he lived. That would be all the information which the Registrar would be in a position to send on to the Electoral Office. The Minister must not be led away by the fact that a somewhat similar return is provided for in the case of deaths. The reason for this is obvious. No one can give the information supplied by that return but the Registrar of Deaths. Nobody is officially dead until the Registrar says so. In this case the Minister is misled by a fallacious parallel, which is drawn between a return of marriages and a return of deaths. There is no means of showing that a woman whose name appears on a return is identical with a woman whose name appears on a roll, and therefore the Electoral Officer will be put to considerable trouble to determine which name has to be dealt with. </para>

                    <para>. -  I believe that in almost ninety-nine cases out of every hundred a woman adopts her husband's name as speedily as possible. The names of newly married women will from time to time be in the possession of the Electoral Office, but in order that there shall be no possibility of doubt in respect to women who have changed their names by marriage, the insertion of this harmless provision is desired by the Government. It will be a help to the Department. It cannot do the slightest harm, and. the probability is that it will materially assist those who are intrusted with the compilation of the rolls, in having proper names on the rolls, and no unnecessary names. </para>

                    LEDGER (Queensland)  ("4.12].  - The explanation which the Minister has given to the Committee is remarkably clear and requires no explanation. At every point he is anticipating the break-down of the compulsory principle. He has offered no answer to the criticism from this side. A woman has her name before she is married. When she attains her majority she must be on a roll. Whether she is married or not she is on a roll : whether she is married or not she ought to be on a roll. That is the natural way in which the system must work out, but the Minister wants the Department to catch hold of a woman under a new name, but she is the same individual all the time. I do not object to the provision itself. It is an illustration of how the compulsory principle will break down. I am rejoiced to hear these continued explanations from the Minister.

I do not propose to press the argument on this proposal at any great length, but  1  would remind you that various decisions have been given, which, stated broadly, were to this effect : that an amendment to an amending Bill must be relevant to the amending Bill, and not to the principal Act. In other words, that we are not at liberty to" roam over the principal Act, and propose practically a new law. </para>

                        <para>-  The object of that part of the Bill which we have been discussing recently is to make compulsory enrolment secure, and to provide, as far as possible, that no person shall escape the roll, that having once been enrolled the enrolment must continue by every means possible under the measure. One of the methods sought to accomplish the object is a list of the names of newly married women, to prevent any leakage through the change of names causing omissions from rolls, or some mistake being made, and a. name struck off which should have been retained. As the object of the Bill is to secure more complete and fuller enrolment than is deemed possible under the present law, the amendment seems to be quite pertinent, since it would tighten up and strengthen the measure. I hold that it is manifestly within the objects of the Bill, and, therefore, should be within its scope. </para>

The Act provides that she can vote. Suppose that she has not sent to the Registrar her married name, or that the fact of her marriage has not been communicated by the Registrar-General, is she to be prevented from voting? This provision is wrapt up in stupid bureaucracy. I should like to see a Minister 'pr an official who  would  dare to punish a woman in these circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- I have noted that ruling. Section 66 of the principal Act, which the amendment of the Honorary Minister seeks to amend, is one dealing with the duty of the Registrar-General to forward to each Divisional Returning Officer in the State a list of the deaths which have been registered in the division during the preceding three months. That section is not mentioned in the amending Bill which is now before the Committee. Although, personally, I disagree with the precedents which have been established in this Chamber, as I am merely the temporary occupant of the Chair, I feel bound to follow them on this occasion. I say, therefore, that the proposed amendment is not relevant to the Bill, and cannot be moved at this stage. Therefore, I rule it out of order. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the petition which was presented to the Senate this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker,</inline> I would ask the Minister whether he is prepared to reconsider this clause, and whether he noticed in this morning's newspapers a paragraph which suggested that the Minister of Home Affairs had promised to submit it to his colleagues for reconsideration, with a view to modifying it so as to meet the objections of the Jewish community ? When we are dealing with matters of conscience, we ought to proceed very warily. Whatever advantages may result to a large section of the electors from setting apart Saturday as polling day will be largely outweighed when we reflect that, in order to confer a temporary convenience upon its members, who can vote equally well, so far as considerations of conscience are concerned, upon any other day, we impose a disability upon another section of the electors. If the Minister is not prepared to agree to the course which I have suggested, will he consent to postpone the provision until he has had an opportunity of ascertaining whether the deputation which recently waited on the Minister of Home Affairs has had the effect of modifying the opinion of his colleagues on this matter? </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot hold out any hope that a departure will be made from the day which is set apart for polling day in this clause. In the opinion of the Government, Saturday is the most suitable day upon which to hold a general election. I am aware that from time to time there have been movements in different States which have had for their object the proclaiming of polling day as a public holiday. Many believe that if that course were adopted a larger percentage of votes would be recorded, and a keener interest would be manifested in our elections. Whether that would be so, I am not prepared to say. But the Government, even if they were favorably disposed to proclaim polling day a public holiday throughout Australia, have not the power to do so. The fact that Saturday is a partial holiday will, it is thought, result in a bigger vote being recorded than would otherwise be registered. The fixing of that day as polling day will enable hundreds of electors to take an active interest in such an important event as a general election. Of course, I am aware that there is a section of the community which entertains conscientious objections to Saturday being set apart as the polling day. While we must respect such objections, we cannot legislate for them. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Government upon having determined to set apart Saturday as polling day. But I would like them to ascertain from the Jewish community whether the peculiar conditions of the latter would not be met if the hour for closing the poll were extended to  8  o'clock. If they would not, the members of the Jewish persuasion might be enabled to obtain their ballot-papers on the Friday preceding polling day, and to forward them to the Returning Officers so that they might be opened the next day. </para>

                    <para>.- I trust that some provision will be inserted in the Bill to meet the wishes of the 17,000 or 18,000 persons who entertain conscientious objections to voting on Saturday. We have already provided that any person who expects to be distant more than 5 miles from the nearest polling place on polling day, may make a declaration to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- No. Such a person may go before the Returning Officer and record his vote. I feel convinced that, with very little difficulty, a provision could be inserted in the Bill which would enable any conscientious objector to record his vote on Friday. In addition to the Jews, there are the Seventh Day Adventists, who also have conscientious objections to voting on Saturday. Probably there are in the Commonwealth between 30,000 and 40,000 people who are influenced by the same motives. If we can meet their objections without throwing too much work upon the Electoral Officers we ought to do so. </para>

                    <para>- The only provision that I can find in the Bill which would meet the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> has mentioned is proposed new section 139, which enables electors who will be absent on polling-day to vote beforehand. But that only deals with those electors who will be outside the Commonwealth altogether on polling-day. There is nothing in the Bill which would give Jews and other conscientious objectors the right to vote except on the day of election. Personally, I prefer to have elections on Saturdays; but at the same time I do not like to deprive a large number of people of the franchise because they have conscientious objections to voting on that day. </para>

A large number of the 27,000 who have been instanced, even if they do go to church in the morning, have no objection to go to sports meetings, and other gatherings, on Saturday afternoons. I will guarantee that you will find plenty of them - thousands, in fact - occupying positions as scrutineers, poll clerks, and so forth, at elections held on Saturdays. As long as they can get paid for what they do, they have no objection to do anything on polling day. </para>

                        <para>- They say that that does not meet their case. I do not see why any other day in the week should not be chosen for election day. I have no doubt that the State Governments would fall in with our arrangement and make  the day chosen a half-holiday. These people make it a matter of conscience, not  to do any unnecessary work on Saturday. I dissent entirely from the last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker,</inline> who said that many Jews are prepared to desecrate the Sabbath for the sake of a little money. That was not a right thing to say. Even if three-fourths of them did what the honorable member described, it would be no reason why we should trespass on the conscience of the others. Australia is supposed to be a land of liberty, where every man is free to worship God in his own way. These people consider it to be their duty to their God to keep Saturday holy. We have no right to trench upon their convictions, to come between them and their God. We are doing so by this provision. I find, according to the last census returns, that there are 15,239 Jews in the Commonwealth, of whom 6,447 reside in New South Wales, 5,847 in Victoria, 107 in Tasmania, 733 in Queensland, 1,259 in Western Australia, and 786 in South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- These figures represent the total population. There are also 3,700 Seventh Day Adventists, who are very particular about their Sabbath. I know of servant girls belonging to that religious denomination who will not work on Saturday. We have no right, because we are in a majority, to flout their convictions. A petition has been presented to-day from two Jewish representatives, who tell us that this provision simply means disfranchisement for their people. We must take their statement as being correct. By taking away the postal vote we have already disfranchised between 20,000 and 30,000 persons. Now we are going to disfranchise more. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> suggestion could be carried out. It certainly seems difficult. The best plan would be to leave the polling day an open question. If, in view of the circumstances of the time, it seemed desirable to declare Saturday "as polling day, that could be done. But do not let us fix it arbitrarily as an enactment. Let us have some regard for the scruples of our fellow citizens. </para>

                <para>These people value the right to vote, and are anxious to exercise it ; but if they are called upon to vote on the Saturday, that will involve a violation of their conscientious convictions. I think they should be given some consideration. It may suit a very large majority of the people to have Saturday fixed as polling day; but we might tell these people that we are prepared to consider their conscientious scruples, and to provide some means by which they may record their votes without having to go to the poll on the Saturday. I believe that there are something like 18,000 Jewish voters in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is 50 per cent, more than I stated. In addition to them, there are numbers of Seventh Day Adventists, Plymouth Brethren, and others who, though we have received no petition from them, have a similar objection to voting on the Saturday. The Minister might consider the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Gardiner, and enable these people to obtain a certificate from the Returning Officer, and record a vote which might be sent to the Returning Officer, and reach him before the close of the poll on the Saturday. Ministers, with the majority behind them, may have a giant's strength, but I ask them not to use it in a tyrannous fashion. If they cannot see their way to retain the whole of the postal voting system, as I think they should, they might, in the way I have suggested, enable these people at least to record their votes without violence to their religious convictions. </para>

                <para>SenatorW. RUSSELL (South Australia) [5.0]. - I should like to reply to some suggestions made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and others on the question of the day for the elections that will best suit the farming community. From my experience I should say that farmers and their employes have no holiday on any day in the week. Speaking of South Australia, I might say that mails leave Adelaide on the Friday morning, and reach their destination, which may be some small country post-office, on the Friday night, or early on Saturday morning. As a rule, the people for miles around a country Post-office come in to the office to get their mails on the Saturday. There will probably be a store at the place as well as a post-office, and the polling place could be established at such places, and it would then  be  convenient for the farmers to vote on the Saturday. Far be it from me to say anything disparaging of those who hold different conscientious views from my own, but it must not be forgotten that under the provisions of this Bill, if Saturday is fixed as a polling day, there will still be two hours beyond the Jewish Sabbath during which electors may record their votes. </para>

The Saturday will be a more convenient day than any other for the working classes, because most of them have a half-holiday on that. day.

                <para>SenatorW. RUSSELL.- The trouble with honorable senators opposite is that they are afraid of the Labour vote. They think that to have Saturday as polling day will suit the Socialists, as they call us. I said that it would, and I gave an instance which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> can corroborate. There are a greater number of electors on the roll for the Commonwealth for Adelaide than for the State electorate of Adelaide; and yet, on one occasion, there were 900 more votes recorded at a State election there, because it took place on a Saturday, than were recorded at a Commonwealth election held upon another day. I mentioned that; but perhaps I should not have done so. I am afraid I am too open-minded, and that I speak sometimes without looking far enough ahead. I reminded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> of this, and he has not forgotten it. </para>

Whether this clause is agreed to or not, the Government will still be able to fix Saturday as the polling day. Then what is the object of it ? It is not intended to. determine the course of action of the present Government, because they can fix Saturday as the polling day in the proclamation ordering the elections. It will not act as a restraining or compelling force upon them; and it is clear, therefore, that the Government hope that, by putting it in the Bill, they will be able to exercise some compulsion in this matter over a succeeding Government, who might find it difficult to alter the law. </para>

                        <para>- There could be no such Government. Every Government must stand as representing the majority. If this clause were defeated, the present, or any subsequent Government, could still fix whatever day they liked for an election. A number of persons who are firm believers in the appointment of Saturday as polling day, express the greatest sympathy with those whose conscientious beliefs prevent them from voting on that day. They would not hurt the consciences of those people in any way; but they will not, on that account, refrain from insisting upon having this clause passed. The statement that the extension of the hours for polling to 8 o'clock will give those who object to vote on the Jewish Sabbath two hours in which they may record their votes, is not true of any Saturday in the year, and is certainly not true of any Saturday in the middle of summer. </para>

                        <para>- We have decided to hold our elections in April, but an extraordinary event may compel the holding of elections at any time during the year. We have no guarantee that even the next elections will be held in April. If I am correctly informed, the Jewish Sabbath terminates only with the rising of the first star, and it is, therefore, perfectly clear that, if an election were held in the middle of summer, Jewish electors would be unable to record their votes, even if they resided only a short distance from the polling place. I suggest that, even if the Government do not relinquish their idea to hold all elections on a Saturday, they will still make some provision to meet the views of conscientious objectors to that day as polling day. They can still fix Saturday for polling day, or, if necessary, select another day. The Minister knows that previous Governments have been free to select any day for polling day, and so W1 the present Government without this provision. </para>

                        <para>- Why does the Minister want to put on the succeeding Government the obligation to repeal this provision? It is hoped by the Government that, in some way or other, the provision will leave some shackles on their successors. The Government have full power to hold the election on any day without the clause, and circumstances may arise when even they may see the desirability of varying the day. There can be no wisdom or advantage, or sense, in passing a provision which is not necessary to bind the present Government, and which will bind their successors only so long as they like to be bound. </para>

The way to meet their objections, he said, was to leave out the day fixed in this clause for holding elections - not that he had any objection to Saturday being taken, not that he did not believe in Saturday. He wants Saturday to be the polling day. </para>

At one moment he argued in favour of Saturday, and pointed out that the Government would be in. exactly the same position if the word were eliminated, and that the elections could still be held on Saturday. But by holding them on that day the objections of the petitioners could not be met, by his line of reasoning. </para>

                    <para>. - It is remarkable what curious positions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> gets into at times. On this occasion he finds fault with the clause before the Committee for not giving the Government sufficient latitude, but on a previous occasion he took up quite an opposite position. If he would only allow the Committee sufficient time to forget his contradictory attitude of a few days ago there might be a chance for him to escape our attention. On the clause providing that the averment of an Electoral Officer should be sufficient to secure a conviction in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the honorable senator insisted that the administration was being given too much power.  His  complaint at the present time is, I understand, that the clause before the Committee is too rigid, and does not give the Government sufficient liberty. Our aim should be to secure the greatest measure of public convenience. It is well known that in every centre of population - mining,' agricultural, and pastoral - the best time to get a large number of visitors together is Saturday evening. It is then that people who are far removed from the townships come in to do their shopping, and, perhaps, to have a jovial hour, to which, of course, they are quite entitled after a week's hard toil. This measure would be very defective if it did not take heed of the general usage of the country. This clause makes Saturday the polling day for the Commonwealth, and takes it out of the power of the Government to fix a day to suit their own purposes. Unquestionably, Saturday is the most convenient day for securing the maximum attendance at the 'polling booths. I agree that we should be very careful before we compel any section, however small, to run counter to the voice of conscience in discharging a citizen's duty. We ought to respect, as far as possible, the conscientious scruples of every section, large or small. Seeing that the last general election was held in April, and that the next general election will be held in a later month, when the day will be very much shorter, the Hebrews will have an opportunity of recording their votes without doing violence to their consciences. Of course, there are the Seventh-Day Adventists, and, perhaps, another sect or two whose peculiar positions need to be considered. </para>

                <para class="block">A very convenient way of overcoming the difficulty would be to insert in the Bill a clause providing that the members of any religious sect mentioned in a proclamation to be issued by the Governor-General, who conscientiously object to voting on Saturday, would be afforded an opportunity of voting in the same way as absent voters may do. If, for example, they were permitted to vote on the day preceding polling day, no harm could result. Of course, the provision would be limited to members of dissenting bodies, whose conscience forbade them voting on polling day. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that. If the Government intend to recognise the conscientious objections of citizens, special provision should be inserted in the Bill to meet their views. To compel any section of the community to subordinate their conscientious convictions to the will of a Government, no matter how strong that Government might be, would be an act of tyranny. We have had too much of that sort of thing in the past, and it is about time that we took some notice of the genuine conscientious objections of a considerable element in our midst. This difficulty can be overcome in the way I have indicated. So far, I repeat, the only complaint which has reached us has been from the Jewish members of the community. But we know that there are other religious bodies which have an equally strong ground for consideration in this matter. Until we have discovered their wishes, it would be exceedingly hard if we closed the door irrevocably upon them. I therefore suggest to the Government the wisdom of providing for their cases as they arise in the future. I do not think that such a provision as I have outlined would be liable to abuse. It is inconceivable that, for the mere purpose of being enabled to cast an easy vote, an elector would declare himself to be a member of a religious body to which he did not belong. For that reason, I hold that there would be no danger of the provisions of the Bill being nullified if humane consideration were given to the position. </para>

                    <para>. - I was rather surprised to notice that the Honorary Minister, when he addressed himself to this subject, entirely ignored the suggestion  which was thrown out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> 1 anticipated some time ago that this Chamber, and the House of Representatives, would be asked to consider the unfair position in which the Jewish portion of the community, and other religious sects, would be placed, if we made it a rigid statutory rule that, in connexion with general elections, Saturday should be fixed as polling day. In speaking upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I pointed out that if the Government were irrevocably committed to that course, they might, in Committee, recognise the wisdom of extending, as far as possible, the provisions of proposed new section 139 to persons who, for conscientious reasons, were unable to vote on Saturday. In that proposed new section, it is provided that electors who will be absent from their electoral divisions upon polling day, may vote at any time after the issue of the writ, and before polling day, if they attend before any prescribed Commonwealth Registrar, and make a declaration in accordance with the prescribed form. If it be competent for an individual to exercise his franchise in advance of polling day, merely on the assertion that he will be absent from his electoral division on that day, surely it ought to be equally competent for persons who cannot conscientiously vote on a Saturday, upon making a declaration to that effect, to vote in exactly the same way. I know .that the proposed section to which I have referred is open to a good deal of adverse criticism on the ground that it leaves so much to prescription by regulation. But if the Government intend to adhere to it, either in its present or any modified form, surely its -benefits ought to be extended to persons of the Jewish community, to members of the Seventh Day Adventists, and to others who, from conscientious reasons, are precluded from voting on a Saturday. It is not proper, after we have received a petition from the Jewish community, after the Minister of Home Affairs has been waited upon by a deputation from that body, and after a petition has been presented to another Chamber from the Seventh Day Adventists, for this Parliament to ignore the requests which have been made to it. Neither is it for us to answer those requests by attempting to discover what percentage of these bodies devote themselves to sports on Saturday, and thus outrage the conscientious convictions of the majority of them. Hitherto, there has been too much disregard of the conscientious scruples of certain sections of the community. I entirely disagree with the statement of the Honorary Minister in that connexion; and, upon reflection, I think he will realize that that statement was most ill-timed. He declared that the paramount consideration in matters of this kind must be the interests of the majority. Let me remind him that that ought not to be the paramount consideration where matters of conscience are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Still, that circumstance cannot obscure the fact that considerations of conscience should not be ignored simply because of a view which is entertained by a majority of the community. I do hope that the Minister will intimate his willingness to adopt the suggestion which I made upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, namely, that the provisions of it which are applicable to absent voters should be made applicable to members of the Jewish community and others who entertain conscientious objections to voting on Saturday. If that be done, it will be easy to prevent the abuse of such a concession - far easier than it will be to prevent its abuse in the case of absent voters. The reasons which underlie the introduction of proposed section 139 apply at least with equal, if not with ten times greater, force to those persons who hold conscientious objections to recording their votes on Saturday. </para>

We all know that the Christian respect for the Sunday has conferred great blessings upon civilization. By insisting upon Sunday observance, we have done great good to the world. There is a section of the community - whether large or small does not matter - to whom Saturday is equally sacred. How can we ask those persons who regard their Sabbath so reverentially to respect our Sunday unless we, as Christians, also respect their observances? This is the first time that any modern Government in a Christian community, when it has been respectfully petitioned by the persons concerned, has said, " No, we do not respect your conscientious objections." </para>

                        <para>- Then I do not understand plain language. Fortunately, we have held up the Bill in the Senate for some time, and have given an opportunity to certain sections of the community to petition Parliament to eliminate the clause to which" "they have such strong religious objections. I can understand their point of view, because there are certain convictions which appeal strongly to me as a Roman Catholic. No matter what law be passed, or what penalties be imposed, there are certain obligations with respect to education which I feel bound to carry out. No law would alter my determination. It is dangerous to pass legislation which is heedless of the religious convictions of a section of the people.  </para>

If they did, there would be an outcry throughout the Commonwealth, and properly so. Why should we disregard the outcry of the section of the community that regards voting on Saturday as Sabbath desecration? The position is unanswerable from the Christian point of view.

                        <para>- It is possibly because I have a conscience that I am sensitive about these matters, and am pressing the argument upon the Government. I say that the respectful petition of those who have approached the Senate in proper form ought to be regarded. Unless some insuperable difficulty or some national issue is involved, which transcends the objection raised by these people, their views should be respected. The Government have received one lesson during the consideration of this Bill already, and they may receive others. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in asking that respect should be paid to the views of these people. I notice Senators Pearce and de Largie smiling at each other ; but, if my memory serves me aright, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has often spoken of the duties of Christians from a pulpit on some pleasant, or unpleasant, Sunday afternoon. </para>

The honorable senator has not needed much inducement to discourse upon a Sunday afternoon on the duties of Christians in the community ; and when the duty of Christians in this matter is jeered at, we are justified in saying that there is a great deal of Pharisaism about the virtues, Christian or political, of some honorable senators on the other side.

                    <para>- Then I shall deal with another phase of the question. The Government have abolished the postal voting provisions, but they have made provision for absent voters, and I join with Ministerial supporters, as well as with honorab'le senators on this side, in requesting them to reconsider their refusal to treat the petition of persons who hold religious objections to this clause with some degree of consideration and respect. If they say that they are unable to do so, they are reckless because of their majority, or they are politically incompetent. If they can provide, as they have done, for absent voters recording their votes anywhere in the Commonwealth or out of it, they can make some provision to enable persons who object to vote on a Saturday to record their votes on some other day. Why is the absent voter, if he be a Christian, to be given a privilege denied to the Jewish section of the community? There is no answer to that question, but the smiling contempt of honorable senators on the other side. It would be as objectionable to persons of the Jewish persuasion to record their votes on a Saturday, as it is for Christian people to perform their ordinary work on a Sunday. I hope that, before the Bill passes, we shall have some indication of an intention to modify this proposal, which represents the second or third instance of a tyrannous disregard of the conscientious convictions of certain sections of the community on the part of the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say a final word, in order to make my own position perfectly clear. I think that in South Australia all our elections are held on the Saturday; but I believe there is no provision in the State electoral law that they shall be held on that day. That course has been adopted as a matter of convenience, and, I think, meets with general approval. We had an election last Saturday in South Australia, and a very satisfactory one. I can assure honorable senators opposite that the tyrannical proposals of this Bill were an important factor in the result of that election. They were made a great feature of during the contest, and the electors expressed very strongly their dissent from certain of these proposals. I have no personal objection to Saturday being made the polling day; but I think that when 27,000 people petition this Parliament- </para>

It is said that we are meeting them half-way in extending the hours of polling for an hour, but only those who live very close to a polling place can take advantage of that extension. I do not ask the Government to give up their intention to fix Saturday as the polling day, but I do ask them to yield to the request of Senators Gardiner and Lynch, as well as of honorable senators on this side, and make some provision in this Bill for the people who object to record their votes on the Saturday. If the Minister in charge of the Bill would say that he is prepared fo insert a clause which will enable these people to record their votes, I should be satisfied, but I say, distinctly, that if the Government are so unwilling to consider these people as to say, " We shall make no provision for them at all ; we do not care a button what their conscientious objections may be. We shall not consider them in any way," I shall vote against this clause as a protest against conduct of that kind. We have a right to treat with consideration the request of  20,000  people when we can do so without departing from the Government proposals. </para>

I am not questioning that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> said he believed that the Jewish population in the Commonwealth was about  27,000,  and in reply to a question he told me that he was not in a position to give the number of adult Jews.

If we divide that number by three, which is a very fair division, we shall find that, approximately, the adult Jews number a little over  8,000.  No honorable senator will venture for a moment to say that the whole of the adult Jews have a conscientious objection to voting on a Saturday. </para>

                        <para>- It is very easy, I know, to open the door in regard to postal voting; but the Senate has declared emphatically against that system, and the Government are not prepared to open the door in the slightest degree. It has been pointed out here half-a-dozen times to-day that the Government have met the conscientious objectors in a very reasonable way indeed. The probability is that the next general election will be held at a period when the sun will go down at about  6  o'clock, and between that hour and  8  o'clock, the conscientious objectors will have an opportunity to vote. </para>

                    <para>. - I again suggest to the Government that what is being urged from this side is, not the destruction of their policy in regard to Saturday voting, but the provision of a fair and reasonable outlet by which these electors, whether their number be large or small, can record a vote, and discharge their duty as citizens without violating their con- science. The Minister has very successfully talked all round the subject. He has never once come closely to grips with the real problem which fronts him. Is there any difficulty in making provision for conscientious objectors to vote on Saturday ? </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the whole shipping community. We have an extraordinary provision that, before nomination day, and before they can know the names of the candidates, some electors may vote. But when the Government deal with another class, where conscience should be the determining factor, they not only submit a. hard-and-fast provision, which shuts out all prospect of hope, but even turn a deaf ear to the appeals from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> Surely it is much easier to frame a provision enabling conscientious objectors to record a vote than it was to hammer out a provision enabling voters who may be leaving Australia for good to vote, and without resorting to the method of postal voting? If it is fair and reasonable to allow a sailor who is leaving a port of the Commonwealth before nomination day to go to an Electoral Officer, obtain the necessary paper, and, in his presence, or under his direction, cast a vote, why can it not be provided that, on the day before the poll, any one who cannot conscientiously vote on a Saturday shall be able to vote? I ask the Minister to tell me what solid reason there is against putting a provision of that kind in the Bill ? </para>

                        <para>-I should not insult the intelligence of the Senate as the Minister is doing by supposing that a matter of convenience is to be placed on the same parallel as a matter of public safety. What I am urging is not that the Government should disturb the convenience of the great body of electors, who may find Saturday the better day for polling, but that since they have been so liberal, in the provisions which they have designed for electors who may be leaving Australia, a little of that liberality should find expression in a clause enabling those who cannot conscientiously vote on a Saturday to vote at some other time, or in some other way. I suggest the insertion of a clause empowering the Governor-General in Council to make a regulation for that purpose. I am not concerned as to how it is done, but an opportunity to vote should be provided. There is a great principle at stake. We have no right, unless the national safety is concerned, to ruthlessly thrust aside the conscientious objections of any class in the community. </para>

                            <para>. - In submitting this motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie said that " during the investigations of the Commission we found, on making comparisons, that, speaking of the work of the Department all round, in very few of the services performed by it could any one country in the world claim to have a better system." That testimony, coming from one who had many opportunities of observing the methods adopted by the Department in the conduct of its business, ought to have some weight with those honorable senators who are ever prone to exaggerate the slightest shortcomings of the Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Services of the Commonwealth. As a further answer to hostile critics, the fact ought also to be made known that, in January last, a Conference of  Deputy  Postmasters-General sat in Hobart, and either prior to the commencement of its proceedings, or during its sittings, a communication was received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henniker</inline> Heaton, a gentleman who is well known throughout all parts of the British Empire for the activity which he has manifested in connexion with postal reform. He forwarded to the Conference a copy of the reforms which he had urged the British Postmaster-General to adopt in the Postal Department of the United Kingdom. The Conference, after having looked closely into the communication, found that in no instance where a reform did not relate to a matter peculiar to the United </para>

                    <para class="block">Kingdom, and was such that it was not applicable to Australia, was any reform proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henniker</inline> Heaton which was not already in operation in the Postal Department of the Commonwealth. Of course, no one would be bold enough to say that we have reached the high- water mark of efficiency and management in the services which are now under consideration. But I think it may truthfully be said, in connexion with this vast Department, that, the public enjoy greater facilities to-day than they ever enjoyed previously, and that, speaking generally, the employes are in a better position now than they were anterior to Federation. Their conditions of employment have been very much improved during the period that the present Government have been in power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie observed very truthfully that the parsimonious policy pursued by the State Governments, prior to Federation, had left the services in a very unsatisfactory condition, so that the expenditure of large sums of money was necessary to bring them up to anything approaching efficiency. I think it will be generally admitted that, when the Commonwealth took over our Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Services, they were in a very unsatisfactory condition. Since then large sums have been expended with a view to giving more satisfaction to the entire community. In order that the Senate may have before it figures which are indisputable, I intend to read the amounts which have been voted and expended by the Commonwealth in connexion with our Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Services since the advent of Federation. </para>

                            <para>- No. In other words, the sum of ,£1,300,000 has been set apart for expenditure upon our Postal Department during the current financial year. In all probability a further sum of ^£700,000 will be appropriated next year. I believe I am right in saying that the Postal Commission declared that an expenditure of ^2,000,000 was required to put these services upon anything like a satisfactory basis. I think that the present Government are going a long way in the direction which the Commission recommended. </para>

                        <para>The Postal Commission found that this particular branch had been starved for want of funds. In every State new metallic circuit switchboards, which cost considerable sums, had  been  asked for by the heads, but they had been told that no funds were available, and for that reason the service has gone from bad to worse. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It will be interesting to honorable senators  to  know the progress which has been made  in  regard to the adoption of metallic circuits, and the figures which I propose to give will demonstrate that. I repeat that the postal, telegraphic and telephonic conveniences, which the public enjoy to-day, are much better than they ever were previously. This is a comparison between the year 1901, when the service was taken over by the Commonwealth, and the year 1910, in regard to metallic circuits : In New South Wales, in 1901, there were no metallic circuits. In 1910, there were 12,827. In Victoria there were none in 1901. In 1910, there were 414. Probably honorable senators are aware that a large sum of money is being expended in this State at the present time in order that we may have more metallic circuits. A large number of men are employed in and around the metropolitan area upon that work, as a result of which we hope to improve the service materially. Since this return was prepared, extensive works have been proceeding, and many of them are almost in a state of completion. In Queensland, in 1 901, there were 803 metallic circuits. In 1910, there were 3,158. In South Australia there were none in 1901, but, in 1 910, there were 2,767. In Western Australia, in 1 901 , there were 628 metallic circuits, and, in 1910, there were 2,990. In Tasmania, in 1901, there were none, whilst, in 1910, there were 1,159. The total number of metallic circuits in Australia when the service was taken over from the States was 1,431. In 1910, we had a total of 23,313. Honorable senators are aware that the Postal Commission held many sittings, extending over a period of two years. Much evidence was collected, which was carefully weighed and sifted. Ultimately, a report was presented to Parliament - a document which, in my opinion, for clearness and conciseness has never been equalled by the work of any other Royal Commission which we have had. Whatever one's views may be in regard to the recommendations of the Commission, it cannot be said that there is any ambiguity in regard to any of its recommendations. It must be very satisfying indeed to the members of the Commission to know that many of their recommendations have already been adopted, whilst others are being carried into effect. Later on, still more will be adopted. I do not expect, however, that any member of the Commission, in his most sanguine moments, ever expected that the recommendations would be adopted <inline font-style="italic">in globo.</inline> We have had other Commissions sitting from time to time dealing with matters affecting the interests of the community. Although care and capacity have been manifested in regard to their reports, many of them have been treated as so much waste paper, and have been pigeonholed. But the report of the Postal Commission is unique in this respect - that it has at once received the serious consideration of the Government. It has also been closely examined by the gentleman to whom exception has been taken in certain paragraphs of the report in relation to his administrative policy. The Postal Service, according to the latest return, dated 1st January, 191 1, embraced 11,773 permanent male officers, and 1,450 women. It is only natural to expect that there should be in such a large service a certain amount of discontent. It would be wonderful if peace and satisfaction reigned throughout. It is reasonable to suppose that some have legitimate grievances In order that those who have legitimate grievances, which from time to time they have attempted to have adjusted, may have their case properly inquired into, it is the desire of this Government that they shall have the same opportunities as are given to workers outside the service of appealing to the Federal Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- I have read that there is a section in the Public Service today who, while not entirely satisfied with their lot, are indisposed to lay their grievances before the Federal Arbitration Court for adjustment. Statements have been made to that effect in the public press. For a long rime numbers of working men and women, who are banded together in organizations, have been eager to secure opportunities of approaching the Court. When the Government are making clear the path for the public servants with grievances to approach the same Court, I cannot understand what solid objection they can have to appearing before that tribunal. </para>

We know well that promotion in the Public Service is not obtained by political influence to-day. We do not have members of Parliament knocking at the Public Service Commissioner's door, or waiting to grasp him by the hand and talk matters over with him. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. Instead of having a managing staff of seven, as under existing conditions, the Royal Commission's recommendations would involve a staff of twenty-two. It is claimed that, if this recommendation were adopted, a considerable saving would be effected. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and the other members of the Commission who made this recommendation went very carefully into the matter. But any opinion of the kind expressed by a Commission must be problematical. Rightly or wrongly, the opinion is also held that the recommendation, instead of effecting a saving, would increase the expenditure. </para>

Parliament has rightly held, ever since the establishment of Federation, that it should have a say in regard to the conduct of the Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Services of the Commonwealth, and that the staff management of the . Post and Telegraph Department should be intrusted to the Public Service Commissioner. Is Parliament, under the system of a Board of Management and staff committees recommended by the Commission, to lose all control of this huge institution ? </para>

Is is not one of the recommendations of the Commission that the Postmaster-General's Estimates should not be subject to review or alteration by the Treasurer? Do they not also recommend that the service should be self-supporting, and that the proposed Board of Management should be responsible for making it self-supporting ? If this does not mean that the power of control is to be taken out of the hands of Parliament, then I am unable to understand the English language. </para>

                            <para>- The Commission recommends that the Treasurer should not have the power to review or alter the Postmaster-General's Estimates, and, further, that the Postal, Telegraphic, and Telephonic Services should be self-supporting under the proposed Board of Management. The time has not arrived, in my opinion, for these services to be placed under a Board of Management, or Commissioners, as the State railway systems are at present. Parliament still desires, and I hope will continue to do so, to retain the power it possesses in regard to these services. </para>

                                by his interjection, evidently favours the recommendation of the Commission that the services shall be self-supporting, but would he apply that principle to all Government works? Would the honorable senator contend that there should not be a mile of railway built until Parliament or a Board of management were absolutely convinced that it would" be self-supporting? In remote parts of the Commonwealth, postal, telegraphic and telephonic services have never been, and probably never will be, self-supporting.

If the services as a whole are to be made self-supporting, some people will be called upon  to pay  very much more than others for them. In compact and densely populated areas the people are supplied with every possible facility, postal, telegraphic and telephonic. But the people of remote and sparsely settled districts have much fewerfacilities. </para>

It is sufficient for them that they are better off than they were. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that since the present Government came into power there are more members in the organizations within the Commonwealth Service than there were before. There ought not to be any insuperable difficulty in the way of any section of workers in the Commonwealth Service forming themselves into an organization and then formulating their grievances, and having their case submitted to the Federal Arbitration Court. In regard to the service generally, advancement and promotion will entail an additional annual expenditure of .£202,800. That is for the present year alone. Of this amount, ^90,000 is estimated to be paid on account of ordinary increments and increases of salary on promotion, and £112,800 is due to an amendment of the scale of pay. In order that honorable senators may obtain a grip of what this expenditure really amounts to, I shall show how the clerical and general divisions have been financially advantaged. In the clerical division, for the first year, clerks and clerical assistants in the fifth class are to get <inline font-style="italic">£IO,000 i</inline> postmasters, ,£2,500; telegraphists,. .£13,000; making a total of ;£25j5oo. In the general division, for the first year, sorters and senior sorters are to get .£2,500; assistants and postal assistants, .£17,000; letter-carriers, £ji 3,000; linemen and line foremen, £6,800; mechanics, ,£6,000; telephonists^  £18,000;  telegraph messengers,  £18,000;  and other classes of officers,  £6,000.  There is to be distributed, in the first year,  £87,300  in the general division, and  £25,500  in the clerical division, or a grand total of  £112,800.  I am not going to cite the different branches of the service which have been advantaged in a financial sense during the last few years, but I might incidentally say that the recreation leave, sick leave, time in lieu, and overtime are much more liberal under the Commonwealth than they were under the States. The district allowance is more liberal under the Commonwealth, in the ratio of five to one. The Sunday pay is also more liberal under the Commonwealth, in the ratio of five to one.

                    <para class="block">The Government of the day do not wish to ignore the report, nor do the departmental heads. That the Government have not ignored the report has, I think, been shown by some of the remarks I have made respecting certain of the services, and that the heads of the Department have not ignored it is known to each member of the Postal Commission. I ask the Senate not to carry this motion in the form in which it is submitted, because to do so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says, would mean revolutionizing the Department. The Government have not yet arrived at that stage when they feel that it is necessary to bring about a revolution in the Department by the abolition of the Public Service Commissioner and the bringing into existence of another system recommended by the Postal Commission. I wish to give credit to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and the other members of the Postal Commission for the work which they have performed. They have pointed out difficulties in connexion with the administration of the Department, and many things which perhaps would not have come to light but for their appointment. Having the consolation that the major portion of the recommendations have been adopted, and an assurance from me, as representing the Postmaster-General, that other matters contained in the report will be favorably considered, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie ought to be satisfied, and not desire the Senate to pass his motion. </para>

                            <para>. - I have much pleasure in supporting the motion in a general manner, but I cannot agree with the Honorary Minister, who tried to make out too much. In South Australia the Post and Telegraph Department could not have been much worse than it was. Indeed, things were so bad in connexion with the Federal referenda that the opponents cf Labour directed attention to the mismanagement of the Department, and quoted the fact to prove that the Federal Government had more to do now than they could well do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> will, I am sure, agree with me, because I am quoting from  a  speech which he delivered at the time the Department in South Australia was seething with discontent; in fact, I was afraid that a strike would take place. That was not a very pleasant thing to think of. Several members of this Parliament, including myself, interviewed the officers concerned, and told them to be cautious, and to wait a bit. We said that the report of the Postal Commission had been laid on the table in each House, and would be dealt with, and if, as they said, they could not get justice from the Public Service Commissioner, they might be able to get it from Parliament. Ever since the cry has been, " Adopt by all means the recommendations of the Royal Commission." One of the principal grievances then, as it still is, was that the Public Service Commissioner was the wrong man in the wrong place. The officers complained of his action and the treatment which the service had received at his hands from time to time, and the power which he had claimed. Whether it was legal or otherwise, I think that it was unwise, and I intend to quote what happened about last Christmas. The ex-Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> was in Adelaide, and a deputation was arranged to wait upon him. I took the opportunity, with other members of this Parliament, to hear the request put in the best way in which it could be submitted, and the Minister's reply. I came to the conclusion that the honorable gentleman was either incapable, or had not the power to do anything, for he told us straight away that he would see if he could move the Public Service Commissioner to do certain things. He then suggested that a deputation should wait upon the Commissioner if it could be arranged, and stated that he would like to be present at the interview, but he was afraid that would not be permitted. The Commissioner declined to meet the deputation which was appointed by the Civil Service Association of South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> suggested that the special grievances which had existed in the Civil Service for years back in that State should be settled by an arbitrator to be appointed by both sides.  His  suggestion was hailed with a good deal of satisfaction. It was thought that, instead of going to law, an amicable settlement might be arrived at by having an arbitrator such as, perhaps, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon, or one of the other Judges of South Australia, to do the work. After the public  servants had been rejoicing over the prospect of getting an amicable settlement the Commissioner turned down the suggestion. Was not that cruel? I propose to read a portion of the statement which was prepared by the Civil Service Association in reply to the Commissioner's reports, which have appeared from time to time, in order to show the Senate how the Public Service in that State has been treated, how the men whose names appear in this statement, and they are legion, have been treated, how, instead of receiving increases, they have suffered reductions in salary, amounting to a very large sum indeed. This statement is not a one man affair. It has received the approval of the Civil Service Association after fair and full consideration. They say - </para>

                            <para>When classifying the Service in 1904, the Commissioner found South Australian postmasters and postmistresses in receipt of certain payments, or allowances, such as rebate on sale of postage stamps (a very few cases), and Savings Bank salary, &amp;c, in addition to statutory salary. With the exception of one or two small allowances, such as fees for registering births and deaths, which the postmaster retained only until transferred to another office, the Commissioner abolished all emoluments, and, with only two or three exceptions, classified the officers at their statutory salary. </para>
                            <para>The result was that sixty-four postmasters and a large number of other officers were deprived of a portion of the remuneration which they had received under State control. Several postmasters also were deprived of increments to their statutory salary which had accrued, and were accruing, under State law. This phase of the question is dealt with under the heading " Increments under State law." The following table will show the extent to which the South Australian officers were affected monetarily by the abolition of emoluments and increments. </para>

They assured the latter that it was to their own interests to vote for Federation at all costs, because they could not possibly lose anything by so doing.

                            <para class="block">The officers affected, individually, through the Appeal Board and by petitions to the Postmaster-General, and also through this association immediately claimed that such treatment was a violation of the spirit and letter of clause 84 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which was re-enacted by the first Federal Parliament in clause 60 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1002. Clause 84, relating to transferred officers, provides " Any such officer who is retained in the service of the Commonwealth shall preserve all his existing and accruing rights, and shall be entitled to retire from office at the time and on the pension or retiring allowance which would be permitted by the law of the State if his service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his service with the State." The officers urged that the Commissioner should have classified them at a salary equal to their total remuneration under the State. In advancing this claim they relied partly upon what they regarded as a clear compact made by the Federal Convention to insure the vote of the public servants being cast for Federation. That compact assured them Hint they would lose nothing by transfer to the Commonwealth. That this view was justified the following extracts from the debates of the Federal Convention at the Adelaide sitting clearly shows. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> page 1044, said, " The Drafting Committee seemed to have amply provided for those particular rights (pensions, gratuities, and retiring allowances) of public servants. But is it not also necessary to provide that any other existing rights of public servants should be preserved to them?" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> moved an amendment to the original clause in these words, " and all other existing and accruing rights of such officers as remain in the service of the Commonwealth shall be preserved." </para>

                        <para>The next authority whom I shall quote is an even higher one than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> He was the leader of the Federal Convention, the present <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. </para>
                        <para>He suggested that the amendment would be wider if the word "other" were omitted, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> seemingly anxious that no right should be jeopardized, omitted the word. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> followed. He said, " I think it is highly important that we should have some provision such as is suggested by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> I think it is important to put in the word ' accruing." . . . When we transfer men to the Commonwealth it behoves us to do them no injury. We ought to preserve to them not only their existing, but their accruing rights." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trenwith</inline> said, "While it would be difficult for some time, as indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon,</inline> to adjust the different conditions running side by side, it would be unjust not to maintain the rights already in existence. We should be doing different from what any conscientious company would do." . . . "If this is not done there will be a manifest injustice to a very large number of citizens of Victoria, and without- imputing selfishness or a want of patriotism to the civil servants of Australia, I have no hesitation in saying that we shall be inducing a large number of citizens to vote against Federation in defence of their own rights and their living, and in defence of justice." </para>

If there is one thing which must be paramount in framing a Constitution of this kind it is that it must be just, and I take it that this Convention would be doing a great injustice if it did not provide for existing rights. . . . These rights, -hovever, will gradually die out under the Commonwealth, and there can be no continuation of them, because there are only one or two Colonies where these contracts, as I prefer to call them, exist ; and it will be very easy to earmark  officers, say, from New South Wales or Western Australia, and to say that they are subject to these existing contracts.

                            <para>I recognise the force of the honorable member's contention, and trust he will give us his help to provide that substantial justice shall be done to all public servants, and that substantially the rights and privileges they now enjoy will be preserved to them under the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>I think that the public servants of South Australia have shown that justice has not been done to them. When they read the speeches delivered by leaders in the Convention, they expected that they would get fair treatment. They were given to understand that their rights would be preserved to them. But, instead of that, their claims have been turned down. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> speak about the justice that has been done, the prosperity that prevails to-day, and the extra money that has been spent upon the Public Service. Let mc mention a case. I live in the city of Unley, near Adelaide. We have two deliveries per day. About ten years ago, or less, the first delivery used to bring our letters at about half-past 10  or  11  o'clock, in the morning. But frequently nowadays - last Monday, for instance - the letters were not delivered until about  1  o'clock. I made a careful note of the time on that day. I  do not complain of the letter-carrier. I simply said to him, " I suppose you have a big mail to-day." He said that he had. That is not the sort of thing which should occur in a growing place, where the population is on the increase, and where the letters delivered since the inauguration of penny postage have been considerably multiplied. I quite agree with the Royal Commission that the Post, Telegraph and Telephone Services ought to be made to pay, though I was very glad to read a statement made by the Postmaster-General in another place, to the effect that the Department would not expect country mails to pay. It must be remembered that while some cities have three deliveries a day, there are country districts which only enjoy one mail a month, or in other instances one per fortnight. These country districts have not benefited by penny postage. It is the merchants, the manufacturers, and the city people who have benefited. I am glad that the Government have adopted the policy of not calling upon country residents to contribute sums of money towards mail services. I know of one country district in South Australia which wanted three mails per week. The Department told the people that they could only get that service by paying for one mail out ot their own pockets, or by contributing a certain sum towards it. That sort of thing ought not to occur, and I am glad that it is not in accordance with the policy of the present Ministry. Here let me remind honorable senators that under the State administration, South Australia was the only one of the group in which the Postal Service paid its way. Indeed, it produced a credit balance of ,?40,000 for two years. It is therefore particularly disappointing to the public servants of that State to know that they have been treated with particular harshness. This brings me to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, in moving the second reading of the Public Service Bill. That gentleman said - </para>

                            Under the South Australian Civil Service Act provision is made that after twenty years service an officer is entitled to a holiday of six months (actually eight months) on full pay. A number of officers have been taken over by the Commonwealth with that right, and they are entitled to claim that holiday whether we pass this clause or not.

                            view to be correct. There are three classes of civil servants with whom we have to deal. First there are the civil servants who are in the true sense transferred from the States to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Constitution provides for them. We have no power to interfere with their rights, &amp;c.

                            while contending that furlough was not an absolute right under the State Acts, the. granting of it being permissive, said, " We ought to legislate in such a way that transferred officers cannot be placed in a worse position than they would have been had they continued in the service of the State."
                        </para>
                        <para>Notwithstanding all this, the Public Service Commissioner adopted, and has adhered to, an absolutely contrary view, and by the act complained of, inflicted losses on South. Australian Postmasters and on other officers who were entitled to increments under State law, ranging UP to <inline font-style="italic">?15?</inline> Per annum, representing reductions of as much as 32 per cent, on individual salaries. </para>
                        <para class="block">I hope that it will be recognised from what I have read, that South Australian officers have been cruelly treated and deceived. Can any one wonder that they were amazed when they found that the Commonwealth Parliament had  given the Public Service Commissioner power to turn down their claims, and to do towards them just as he willed. When the ex-Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> was in Adelaide, and was approached on this subject, he admitted himself to be in a helpless condition. He said in effect, "I sympathize 'with you; I recognise that you have a good case, but I have no power to help you. I shall try to move the Commissioner in the matter. Send over a deputation, and I will see that it finds its way into the presence of the Commissioner. Possibly, he will not allow me to be present, but you can state your case to him." We have a Government who are in favour of preference to unionists. So arn I. What was the position in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> the ex-Postmaster-General was placed ? He had no power to do anything in the matter at all. When the deputation was agreed upon, .two of the best men in the Post and Telegraph Department in South Australia were selected by the association, and it was supposed that they would be admitted into the presence, I will not say of the Czar, but of the Public Service Commissioner. What happened? He objected to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the deputation. He could not receive <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macdonald</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hiscock.</inline> The Government recognised that they had no power over him, nor had they. The Government had not the power, and Parliament had not the power. He was an autocrat with a vengeance. </para>

                                <para>- I hope it will show that it has the power. I am not speaking against the Public Service Commissioner personally. I do not know him at all. I dare not go near him. I should be afraid to enter his office, because if I went there to speak in favour of any one I wanted to get into a billet he would at once turn him down. That is the position of the Commissioner, and I repeat that he is ah autocrat. What I meant by the reference to preference to unionists was this - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> shifted his ground ; the Public Service Commissioner spoke through him, and said, " It was the  chairman  of the association, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rossi,</inline> whom I invited to come over. It was not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Macdonald or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hiscock."</inline> But these latter were the gentlemen selected by the association, and I should imagine that they were at liberty to say who should represent them in spite of any one. The position in which the Public Service Commissioner is placed makes him like the Czar. He has no responsibility to the staff intrusted with the conduct of the Post and Telegraph Department, but they are controlled by him. There is great discontent existing in the service in consequence. One of the most urgent demands is for a change in this respect, and I had hoped that the Government would try to meet the service as far as possible in this matter. I think I have proved to the satisfaction of the Senate that South Australian civil servants are suffering an injustice financially,, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> knows what that means to a Scotchman. I want to drive this home to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> because he was a member of the Finance Committee of the Federal Convention, and has been a member of the Senate since its establishment. I hope he will long continue to be a member of it. </para>

Instead of approaching the association with their grievances, some men - I do not like to use the word " scab," or any word of that kind - go crawling and using influence in their own interest. We want to put a stop to that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> will understand that members of the Senate do not care to listen to grievances from one or two or half-a-dozen men. But if they are members of an association, we shall know where we are. If they are authorized tq speak' in the name of an association, we shall know that they speak for the majority, and can be trusted. I am strongly in favour of that policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said that the Government intend to stick to the Public Service Commissioner. No doubt' they often feel pretty much in his hands. That does not apply only to the members of the present Government, who are smart! men, but to the members of previous Go'vernments as well. They have all been too much under the heel and dictation of their officers.- Perhaps there is a cause for it. The officers know the ropes, and they do not. I remember that one of the first acts of the present, or the first, Fisher Government was to reappoint the Public Service Commissioner for a further term of seven years. I do not say that we should dismiss him. Far from it. But I do say that if one man is to be given the' power of ruling such a huge Department, he will need to be a very brainy man indeed. I do not believe that the man is yet born who is capable of satisfactorily performing all the duties of such a post.i <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> admitted that the evidence taken by the Postal Commission was good, and their report clear, and nice in every respect; but I hope he will change his! mind and go a little further. My elec-' tors expect me tq vote, not for ousting the present Public Service Commissioner, but for clipping his wings and reducing; his power. The Government may not be in favour of that, but I hope that the majority of honorable senators will be in favour of it. Some of us have backbone enough, and are determined enough, believing it to be our duty, to see that justice is done to the civil servants, whatever the effect may be upon the present Administration. We shall do our duty to the country, and shall support the recommendations of the Postal Commission, even though in&gt; some matters of detail the Government are opposed to our views. I feel strongly on this matter.I know personally a number of the men affected. I may say that I have been told that the attitude assumed by the Government in the House of Representatives last Friday had an influence injurious to the Labour party in the election which took place last Saturday. Whether that be true or not, I cannot say; but I was told it by some one who ought to know. </para>

I am speaking from a sense of duty ; and those who have listened to what I have said, and especially to what I have read, will know how the civil servants have been treated, not by the present Government in particular, but by previous Governments as well. They have been unjustly treated all through, and both sides try to make political capital out of it. I recognise and claim that it was the party to which we on this side belong that asked for the appointment of "the Postal Commission. We forced the battle and succeeded at last. We waited a long time for. the report, and we have got a good one. I cannot understand how a Labour Government, if they were as friendly disposed as they ought to be to the public servants, could have allowed a report of that kind to lie on the table until nearly the end of the session without taking action. </para>

A very wide, and in some sense, a very loose, provision has been made by which seamen leaving Australia can vote, even before nomination day. The only restriction is that they shall vote according to regulations. If it is competent for the Government to design regulations which will enable persons leaving Australia to vote before the nomination of candidates takes place, it ought to be possible to devise a regulation to enable Hebrews and other persons who are unable to vote on a Saturday to vote on the previous Friday, or, if the Government like, on the day after. While I recognise at once that there are many forms in which that vote could be cast, I suggest that the Government might follow out the proposal which is out lined in proposed new section  139  for seamen - </para>

It could be done under official control, and not as in the case of postal voting. The ballot-paper could be handed out by the official, completed by the voter, and returned to the official there and then. It does not appear to me to be open to the possibility of fraud, while, on the other hand, it will get over the great difficulty which has been created by the determination of the Government to make Saturday a compulsory polling day. I sincerely hope that they will see their way to adopt the amendment. </para>

That will afford me an opportunity to confer with the Cabinet and the head of the Department to see whether the proposal can be embodied in a regulation, and surrounded by sufficient safeguards to meet the wish of the honorable senator. In these circumstances, I ask him to agree to a postponement of the proposed new section. If he will allow me, I will move accordingly. </para>

The Minister of Defence seems to think that I am suggesting a course which will be, in some way, inimical to the Government, but it cannot in the slightest degree prejudice them. I am willing either to withdraw the amendment or to postpone it. </para>

I ask your ruling, sir, as to whether it is competent for him to do so. It has already been laid down in the Senate time and again that an amendment of an amending Bill must be relevant to that Bill. Only this afternoon a ruling was given to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- If an amendment be made in the form of the nomination-paper it may afterwards be incorporated in the ballot-paper. We all know that there are certain recognised politicial parties. Suppose there are two candidates, calling themselves a Labour man and a Liberal respectively. Those candidates will belong to known political organizations. If another candidate wishes to come in as a Liberal, he should describe himself as an " Independent Liberal "; or, if he be a Socialist or a Single Taxer, he should be so designated on the nomination paper. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to have any nonsense about this matter. I would allow a candidate to describe himself. When a candidate belonged to a known political organization, he would bear the designation of that organization. I think these descriptions would be of considerable educational value to electors, who would thus be able to back the horse they wanted to win. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems rather an extraordinary idea that when a man is nominated as a candidate for election he should be allowed to describe his political principles on his nomination paper. He might be a candidate standing in the interests of a temperance society or a licensed victuallers' association. The main feature of his policy might be to support the views of such a body. </para>

No matter how many principles a candidate may entertain, one political designation can easily be placed in the fore-front. A man may be a Free Trader or a Protectionist, a Single Taxer or a Socialist, but be is a Labour man or a Liberal first or foremost; or he may stand purely in the single-tax interest, in which case " Single Taxer " would bethe proper designation. The candidate himself, how-: ever, would choose the description of himself, and it would be nobody else's business whether he gave a misdescription or not. </para>

                    <para>In submitting this motion, I desire to make a statement, since honorable senators  will  recognise that at  4  o'clock on Friday there may be no opportunity' to do so. I wish to ask honorable senator's if they think that, ' up to last night, really satisfactory or reasonable progress had been made with the business of the Senate?. If they do, I fear that they lack discrimination. The work now before the Senate cannot be got through unless honorable senators come down really to business, and are prepared to waste less time. I do not say that time has been deliberately wasted, but I ask that in future every effort shall be made to do business expeditiously. Next week it may be necessary to give notice that after next Thursday there will be no further opportunity afforded for the consideration of private members' business. After that, Government business will take precedence after dinner on Thursday, as well as on other days. It rests with honorable senators themselves as to whether we shall be compelled to sit four or five days in the week, and also as to whether all-night sittings will have to be indulged in. </para>

Every honorable senator must recognise that the business will become congested towards the end of the session, particularly if the Government are in anything like a hurry to get through. It is as well, therefore, that we should take time by the forelock, and commence with Tuesday sittings next week. I am prepared to suffer the inconvenience of coming over from New South Wales a day sooner than we have been asked to do so far this session. I think we should commence with Tuesday sittings next week. </para>

                            <para>- I shall say a very small, trifling measure like the Military and Naval Decorations Bill, dealing with pawnshops and things like that - if the Senate wasted its time for three or four days over such a measure, the Government had themselves to blame for it. I, for one, will not hurry in dealing with measures brought before us. It is evident that the Senate has plenty of time at its disposal, when it can waste time in the way I have stated '. </para>

                        <para>.- I have no desire to curtail legitimate criticism, or the fair consideration of any measure brought before the Senate . I hope honorable senators will exercise their rights in that direction at all times. I wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner, Senator Rae,</inline> and other honorable senators, that it is usual to make a statement, such as that which I have made, a week ahead. It would be scarcely fair, without giving honorable senators reasonable notice, to ask the Senate to sit next Tuesday. Some honorable senators may have made arrangements to go to their own States at the end of this week, and to ask them to sit next Tuesday might put them to considerable inconvenience. I am only giving notice that, if it is necessary, that course of action will be taken in the following week, so that honorable senators may be prepared to make their arrangements accordingly. </para>
